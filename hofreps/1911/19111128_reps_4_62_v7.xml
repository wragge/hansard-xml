                <para class="block">On behalf of the Government I wish to say - by no means as a threat - that we must, before the session closes, deal with the business which it is imperative to consider. It is only possible to have twenty sittings before Christmas, but by strenuous effort we hope to get through, and, at the same time, to provide a reasonable opportunity for the full discussion of all the measures undertaken. In addition to the business already on the notice-paper, we intend to introduce a Bill giving the public servants the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, a general Bill providing for the issue of Commonwealth stock, and a measure of minor importance amending the Australian Notes Act. </para>

                        <para>- The second reading will be moved by the Minister in charge, but the further consideration of the measure must be left to next session. We do not require of honorable members that they shall pass all the measures on the notice-paper. Those which it is considered necessary to pass are the Commonwealth Bank Bill, the Public Service Arbitration Bill, the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, the Seamen's Compensation Bill, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Bill, the Purchase Telephone Lines Acquisition Bill, and the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill. In addition, there are one or two items of policy to engage attention, which I am not at liberty to speak upon now. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister was never more sanguine than in the just delivered statement of the possibilities of the session. The Opposition is of the opinion that the general principles, of the Commonwealth Bank Bill having been discussed fully during the second-reading debate, the measure may now be dealt with clause by clause, in practical and business-like fashion. In regard to neither it nor any other will debate be prolonged beyond the point at which it can be useful. Within the limits of their responsibility, we on this side are anxious to facilitate the transaction of business. Some exception will be taken to the proposal that we shall meet on Mondays at 3  p.m. For Victorian representatives it means only an additional sitting day. The representatives of New South Wales, however, having arrived home on Saturday morning, would have to leave again on Sunday evening, whilst the representatives of South Australia would reach home on Saturday morning, and have to leave again for Melbourne on Saturday evening, since there is no Sunday train from Adelaide. The proposal is equally inconvenient to representatives of Tasmania. I suggest to the Prime Minister that, since we shall be sitting extremely long hours if the remaining proposals axe adopted, he might forego, until about the last week, his proposition that the House should meet on Monday, and substitute for it a proposal that we meet every Tuesday morning at 10.30.' The representatives of South Australia, leaving home on Monday night, would be here by that time, and the representatives of New South Wales, also leaving home on Monday, instead' of Sunday, night, could be here two or three hours after the House met. From the opportunity I have had of ascertaining the general feeling of honorable members on this side of the House, I believe they are prepared to make practically the sacrifice that the Government asks, except that in the particular direction to which I have referred the sacrifice is considerable, while the gain cannot be material. It will seriously inconvenience every honorable member who lives outside this State or whose business calls him beyond it. Since we are disposed to meet the Government, so far as our responsibilities will allow, by confining ourselves to such criticism as is essential in order that the Ministry and the public may be properly informed, the Prime Minister would probably find himself in a better position to make a further demand on the House should it become necessary at a later stage, by refraining from making 'this demand for meeting on Mondays until it is peremptory. </para>

                    <para>. - I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister does not intend to carry out the whole purpose of the proposals he has just submitted. I have on previous occasions complained of this practice, so that it cannot be said that I am objecting to it because it is made by the present Government. The duty of the Parliament should be, not to carry as much legislation as it can through a session, but to pass as much as it can pass in a satisfactory manner. </para>

                        <para>- It is. It is absurd enough that of all trades in this country the trade of the politician is the one that requires no apprenticeship. It is bad enough that we should be sent here without any proof that we are fit to be here to examine public measures. But the position becomes absolutely absurd if we are not given a reasonable opportunity to examine public measures before we are expected to deal with them in 'this Chamber. I do not know how we can be expected to carry out our duty if we are to have measure after measure slung at us, and have no time in which to closely examine those measures before we proceed to debate them. I do not think this proposal is in the interests of the country, although it may be in the interests of the Ministerial reputation in the country. I wish to speak quite frankly to honorable members opposite. The proposal now before us is not new. It has been made by every Government since I have been a member of this House, and I have been equally warm in denouncing it regardless of the Government from which it emanated. I cannot help realizing that the reputation of the Government may not necessarily mean the welfare of the country in this connexion. The reputation of the Government depends on , getting through as much business as they can possibly place on an electoral placard. They want a certain number of measures passed. At the end of a session we find thirty or forty measures on the list, many of them, Supply Bills or others, requiring very little consideration. The object of this practice is to secure numbers, not quality. Our object should be, I think, to deal with every measure submitted to us with due discretion and absolute prudence, so that we can say that no measure is passed that is not carefully considered. Is it not notorious that much of our time year after year has been spent in amending Acts that have been hurriedly passed? ls that not conclusive proof of my statement that this House does not devote itself so much to the duty of passing its measures wisely as it does to the desire of passing as many as the Government choose to submit? </para>

                        <para>- If there is anything at all in my argument, and I submit that there is, it must apply infinitely more strongly when Bills are submitted ' which the House cannot have a reasonable opportunity of criticising. What sort of chance do the Government expect the Opposition to have of criticising any measure that is submitted during the period to elapse before this Parliament is prorogued ? We shall be here every day from 10.30 a.m. until 11 p.m. We have to sleep - although my honorable friends opposite may feel that it would be better, perhaps, if we were bull-dozed into a state of mental exhaustion - and what time is left to examine measures? Is it fair to put upon a House of this character such a strain? Is it not prostituting the National assembly to so work it out, and give it no chance to consider the measures submitted to it? I ask my honorable friends to be reasonable, and to see this matter apart altogether from narrow party interests and advantages. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro suggests a number of ingenious methods by which business might be expedited. I did not hear the Prime Minister say how far the Government are. committed to deal this session with the somewhat difficult question of the Tariff.. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to discuss the merits of the Tariff, but the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has just suggested to me that if we did not consider the Tariff this session, we might deal with it on Boxing Day. I urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity of considering the welfare of the country, and to give the Opposition a reasonable opportunity to criticise the measures submitted to the House. If the Prime Minister will not go to the length of enabling the House to meet during reasonable hours, sit a reasonable time, and do its business in a reasonable way, we might, at any rate, have our Monday free. This is not a matter of personal importance to myself, because I long since found that constant travelling at the week end interfered with my work here. I regard the adjournment from Friday to Tuesday as affording a most valuable, and practically the only, opportunity for inquiry into the Government measures to be submitted. When an honorable member has dealt with his correspondence, he finds the best time for considering measures in advance to be during -the week-ends. </para>

                        <para>- But I understand that the measures to be submitted are considered by the Government to be of importance. The Prime Minister will do great disservice to the country if he persists in forcing a number of proposals through Parliament without affording *a proper opportunity for examination. I do not urge that a proposal of this kind is peculiar to the present Prime Minister, because the practice has been resorted to by previous Governments, though, so far as I am aware, we have never hitherto been asked to sit on Mondays. </para>

It is the absolute duty of the Government to apply the " gag," if it is thought that the Opposition, instead of criticising, are deliberately setting themselves to talk measures out, or howl, as </para>

                        <para>- Then I deeply regret that this interjection should have come from the Ministerial bench. If honorable members on this side had abused their rights of criticism, arid Ministers had no power to deal with them, it would have been reasonable to ask for extra sittings ; but the House has deliberately given any Ministry power to apply the closure, and it is the duty of the Government to act on that power. Why should the guilty and the innocent suffer alike? Why should honorable members, who devote themselves to proper criticism, suffer for those who indulge in " stone- walling," though, of this, I have seen nothing during the session? The proposal of the Government is dangerous, and not in the public interest, and it will tend to militate against .the usefulness of a deliberative and legislative Chamber like this. I regret that the Government should have gone a step further than any previous Government ' in making this House a mere registering automaton of their decrees, instead of a place where their views and intentions should receive the most earnest criticism for the welfare of the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, I was reminded of the old saying which bids us beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts. Nothing, in my opinion, could suit the Opposition better than the adoption of this motion, because, either business must be done in a slip-shod way, or some of the measures must be jettisoned. 1 am sorry that for once I find myself in agreement with the honorable member for Wentworth. I thought the Leader of -the Opposition was favouring the motion with a sinister motive, but it seems to me, in view of the utterances of the honorable member for Wentworth, that mere is no concerted action 011 the part of the Opposition. 1 am totally opposed to the motion. There is no reason whatever for hurrying legislation on. There is nothing sacrosanct about Christmas, and we can sit just as well after that festivity as before, and finish the business in a reasonable and proper way. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the Prime Minister, the honorable member for Maranoa, and others are particularly interested in this matter, for, if we rise at Christmas, the natural assumption is a session beginning in April, or not later than May ; and that means that we should have to visit our constituencies during the monsoonal period. During the referendum campaign, I was in my constituency, but was unable to get about on account of the heavy rains, and we may anticipate similar weather in the early months of every year. The Prime Minister is very optimistic if he expects to get through twelve of thirteen measures between now and, say, the 22nd December. In my opinion, the business cannot be completed before Christmas ; and if we try to finish in that time, the result must be disastrous to the Labour party, though, of course, it may very well suit the Opposition. I wish to study, not the convenience of the Opposition, but the interests of my own party, and to some extent my own interests, because I desire to get to my constituent.* during some 'portion of next year. I shall vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>.- This little flash of personal independence coming from the Ministerial benches is as refreshing as the sight of a piece of blue sky would be to one who had been confined in a cellar for two or three months. It gives one hope that some day honorable members on the other side will begin to think for themselves and exercise a little judgment. When the honorable member for Wentworth was addressing the House I noticed a very self-satisfied smile upon the faces of a number of honorable members on the Ministerial side, because the honorable member spoke of the necessity of considering measures on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays. Those who smiled seemed to forget that, whereas they have had these measures before them over and over again in their Caucus, and considered them in every detail, we have them sprung upon us  suddenly, and are asked to consider questions like the Commonwealth Bank Bill, involving great economic principles, without any notice whatever. Honorable members opposite, on the other hand, have settled them in detail, and they are brought down here, as if this were a mere registry office, to which far-reaching measures were sent merely to be put through. During last session, when advocating the Referenda Bills, the Attorney-General said that unless they were passed there would be nothing more for the Federal Parliament to do, because we had practically exhausted our legislative functions. Yet the Government have found a political <inline font-style="italic">menu</inline> as long as one's arm, and so full of material that when we reach the end of the year it becomes necessary to keep everybody here for every day in the week except Saturday, beginning at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning and sitting until 10 or or 11 night. This shows the hollow hypocrisy of the constant talk of  the Labour party about eight hours being enough work for any man, whether he uses his brains or his muscles. Quite apart from these considerations, there is no reason why all this legislation should be put through in this year. I understand that the Prime Minister has already intimated the possibility of our having a summer sitting after the end of the year. I should like to know whether the public or the Savings Bank depositors are crying out for the Commonwealth Bank Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The same argument applies to all these measures. I challenge the Prime Minister to point to any one of those on the notice-paper for which the public have ever asked in such a way as to necessitate Parliament sitting  for abnormal hours to put it through. The Government merely wish to put up a placard in order that they may win some popularity in the country. Speaking, like the honorable member for Wentworth, as a member coming from another State, I may say that if we leave here on the Friday. Saturday is practically a <inline font-style="italic">dies</inline><inline font-style="italic">nott.</inline> There is very little opportunity for one to attend to his private affairs on that day, and all that is available is the first part of Monday, even under normal circumstances. But, according to the new proposal, we are to leave here on the Friday, reach Sydney on Saturday, and leave again on the Sunday in order to be here to do business on Monday. </para>

                    <para>.- It is very difficult to answer the arguments of the honorable member for Parkes, because he speaks from such a high altitude that if his feet were in Purgatory his head would still be above the clouds. A famous Oxford collegian once said, " For complete ignorance, commend me to a schoolmaster." I can assure the honorable member for Parkes that when he dogmatizes upon a subject about which he knows nothing, he reminds me of that saying. A witness who was asked by a lawyer, " Will you swear that I have any money in my pocket?" replied, "I believe you have money in your pocket, but I should not care to swear it"; but I take it that the honorable member for Parkes would swear anything in connexion with the Caucus, whether it was true or otherwise. I resent these early-morning sittings. I am nearly dead, and, I suppose, other honorable members are half dead, but I do not want to be completely dead.. I resent strongly that we have nothing 'definite about the anomalies of the Tariff. People who have come out as immigrants to this country are unable to get employment. I know one man who has been out here for six weeks, and, although it was said that there was plenty of employment in his trade, he would have been in great trouble but for the help of a dear, kind lady. I am waited upon daily by people who want employment, and as we have had no distinct promise in reference to the anomalies of the Tariff- - </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the Prime Minister would ever break a promise. If he has given a promise in this case, I am certain that it will be kept, if any human being can keep it. I see no reason why we should not carry the session over Christmas. We should do our work all the better, and be all the stronger, if we sat for the ordinary half-day. No one on this side of the House wishes to burke discussion or to use the powers which this Parliament has already agreed to ; but, at the same time, if it is necessary to hurry on these measures, let us have the usual hours, and put our powers into practice if need be, because I am certain that no argument from &gt;this side will convert a member on that side, and certainly no argument on that side will convert a member on this. The honorable member for Parkes took exception to travelling on a Sunday. I would object to it also, and I hope to see this Parliament removed from Melbourne within a few years. In my opinion, it is too much to add a Monday sitting to the four strenuous sittings we have every week, and the number of those who were members of the first Parliament, but are now dead, is evidence that the travelling of a thousand miles a week to attend the meetings of Parliament is not fair to the man who does it, nor to his wife and family. In the interests of the health of members I protest against the proposal for sitting on Monday. Personally, . I would be willing for the session to go over into next year. There are measures which I hope to see passed into law, which must be discussed. Of course, if it should be necessary to move the closure it must be moved, so that a determination may be arrived at. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the electors are not in a hurry for much of the legislation proposed by the Government, and measures ill-debated might as well not be debated at all. Honorable members opposite are numerically strong enough to force through their programme. Why do they not take the straight and manly course of applying the "gag" in the first instance? But the results of the Boothby election, and the Victorian State elections, are a warning to the Government to take a pull. The handwriting is on the wall. Ministers must see that the people are opposed to hasty legislation. Much of our legislation may ultimately prove to be unconstitutional. We, on this side, are opposed to many of the Government proposals, because we think them antagonistic to the public interest, and no legislation at all is better .than unjust or harmful legislation. It has been said very fairly by an honorable member on this side that the proposals of the Government are considered and debated before being brought before the Chamber. I agree with that. The same opinion has been expressed in the press. The Opposition members, however, have not had an opportunity to express, in Caucus, our opinion regarding them. It is not in the interest of the country that legislation should be forced through ; but, of course, the Government is strong enough to take the bull by the horns, and gag discussion by the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>. - While willing to support the Government programme, I am opposed to Monday sittings. For more .than ten years I have been constantly travelling between Sydney and Melbourne for the purpose of attending the meetings of this Parliament. I know what it means to leave Sydney on a Sunday night to be present at a meeting on Monday, and to attend here from early in the morning until late at night for the greater part of the week. That is an experience which I do not wish repeated more often than is necessary. The black record of this Parliament is largely attributable to the strain imposed on members. I have never voted to gag discussion, and never shall do so. When members abuse their privileges it is their own concern. Those who do not do so should not be punished for those who do. No doubt, the Opposition; wish to prevent the Government from carrying legislation, and are therefore in favour of shortening the session. In my opinion, it is not necessary to end the session by Christmas time. Rather than rush measures through without fair opportunity for discussion, we should continue our sittings into the new year. Some of the proposals of the Government are out of the ordinary line, and must be discussed very fully. To give time for this discussion, we should be ready, if necessary, to prolong the session beyond Christmas. </para>

                    <para>. - -The almost annual debate on motions of this kind should awaken attention to the need for adopting a suggestion which I have made from time to time, and to which, on- two occasions, I have tried to give effect - that is, that there should be a time limit to the speeches of honorable members. Had an opportunity presented itself this session of getting the matter discussed, I should have brought it forward, but our procedure makes it almost impossible to deal with private members' business. When we have a debate on a railway question, certain honorable members read a few engineering works, get hold of a few catch phrases, and then, posing as engineers, talk about gauges and other engineering questions for hours. When a banking proposal is before us, standard works are again stewed up, we all become experts on banking, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is filled with pages of matter which any one of us could read for himself in the text-books. In my opinion, Ministers and Leaders of the Opposition should be given an hour in which to state their opinions on any subject, and other members not more than half-an-hour. Under such an arrangement, speeches would be shorter and better, and there would be ample time for discussing the business of the House. </para>

                        <para>- My proposal would gag them. It is amusing to hear the members of the Labour party speak against gagging, in view of the fact that the longest sitting on record in Australia - a three days' sitting of this House - was made necessary by their support to the resolutions which provide for gagging. _ I hope that next session one of the earliest measures introduced will be one to compel honorable members to deal with the business of Parliament, in a practical way. I am in favour of Monday sittings. Throughout the session Tasmanian representatives cannot return to their homes more often than once every three or four weeks, and representatives from Western Australia and Queensland have to remain in Melbourne all the time. It is not too much, then, to ask the representatives from South Australia and New South Wales to spend the concluding two or three week-ends of the session in Melbourne, to enable the House to sit on Monday afternoons and evenings. As to long sittings, it is generally admitted that they are not a success, and I hope that we shall not repeat the practice - of meeting in the morning and sitting until late at night. </para>

                        <para>- That is evident from the fact that two of the supporters of the Government have said that they are " prepared to give every reasonable support to the Ministry." If this were a party question, they would be absolutely bound by the decision of the Caucus. I do not approve of " stone- walling." An Opposition may delay the passing of a measure by resorting to that practice, but in the end the Government, with a majority behind them, is sure to pass it, so that the only result is a waste of the time of the country. I should be glad, however, if some time limit could be placed on the speeches of honorable members. I hope that the Prime Minister will reconsider his determination to ask the House to sit on Mondays. I, for one, should find it very inconvenient to attend here every Monday. As it is, I cannot return home at the week ends and be back in Melbourne every Tuesday, and if this proposition be agreed to I shall have to remain in Melbourne for the rest of the session-: By agreeing to meet every other morning at 10.30, we shall be doing a fair thing, and I do not think any good purpose will be served by over-working honorable members. I wish to emphasize the remark made by the honorable member for Wentworth, that whilst the Government and their supporters are in favour of eight hours a day for the workers outside, they are prepared to make us work twelve hours a day. That is sweating. If eight hours a day is a fair thing for the working man outside, it should be a reasonable working day for parliamentarians. Is it any wonder, having regard to our long sittings, that a great many men who have entered politics have either gone to the wall, or have died comparatively early in life? We should not be overworked. I already feel the strain of politics, and am practically falling away to a shadow. I do not think it is possible to get through the programme which the Prime Minister has submitted ; but I think we shall be able to do a great deal of work without sitting on Mondays. I promise the Government every reasonable assistance, for I do not desire that we shall meet again shortly after Christmas. After  the arduous duties of the session, we are entitled to a reasonable spell. I certainly hope that we shall have Mondays free. </para>

That is the fault, not of this Government in particular, but of all Administrations, and it is responsible for a good deal of the demoralization that overtakes Parliament towards the end of every session, when important measures are rushed through without the necessary consideration. I am quite prepared to strain a point in order that we may carry out some of the work which the Government are anxious to achieve, but I protest against the proposal to pass this session all the measures that are before both Houses of Parliament. It is utterly impossible. It has been suggested that we might continue 'the session over Christmas, or have a summer session. 1 would, however, ask honorable members resident in Victoria and New South Wales whether they think it fair that those of us who come from distant States like Western Australia should be compelled to remain here for the greater part of the year. It is not a Federal proposal, and I hope the Government will at once realize the impossible nature of the task they are setting this House in proposing to carry this session all the proposals now before Parliament. I hope they will realize that it is time for them to take a sane view of the position - to say honestly that they are proposing to carry into effect more than is reasonable, and that we should get into recess as soon as possible. The strain on members since the inception of Federation has been something of an abnormal character, and it is time that it should be eased off. When I look round the House, and see friends of mine who entered this Parliament with me ten years ago - honorable members like the Prime Minister, who was then a sprightly young man - and see how they have aged in these years, I feel that there is sufficient justification for my plea that the sessions should be shortened, that the work should be carried out in a businesslike fashion, and that impossible tasks should not be set us. </para>

                    <para>. - I take no exception to the criticism of this motion,  which  is one that is usually submitted every year towards the end of the session. The honorable member for Herbert, in urging that we ought to have a summer session if the work is not done is repeating only what I said myself. While he and other honorable members speak of the great volume of business that has yet to be transacted, he and they forget that nearly all the measures constituting that business have been discussed in this Parliament. They are all in preparation for passing. The position so far as they are concerned is something like that known to the miner when the whole of the ore has been raised to the surface, and put through the mill, and -the cleaning up alone has to take place. It would be just as unreasonable to say that the whole process had to be gone through in connexion with mining when the cleaning up alone remained to be clone as it would be to say that the whole process has to take place of inquiring into and examining these measures. Honorable members are familiar with the terms of our proposals, and, in my opinion, we are adopting the right course. T admit that it is somewhat difficult for honorable members from other States to attend Monday sittings, but I ask the House to pass the motion as it stands, on the understanding that we shall make the experiment next Monday, and give honorable members a holiday on the second Monday. That would break the monotony, and enable honorable members to return home at the end of next week. At all events, we shall see how we get on. </para>

                    <para>.- I have a suggestion to make, which seems to me to offer the best opportunity of arriving at an opinion on a very important side of this measure. It has struck me that the subject-matter of this measure ought to have been distributed over two Bills - that there ought to be one corporation to deal with banking of an ordinary character, and another corporation to deal with the Savings Bank. Under the measure as it stands we are to have one corporation covering Savings Bank and ordinary banking business. That means that if the ordinary bank happens to make a loss, the assets of the bank, as a whole, including those of the Savings Bank branch, can be drawn upon by creditors of the ordinary bank to meet the liabilities of the bank as a whole. That is bad. We ought to divide the two proposals. We should have the Savings Bank within one corporation and the ordinary bank within another. I suggest to the Prime Minister that, by merely altering the short title to " Commonwealth Banks Act," instead of " Commonwealth Bank Act," and making the necessary consequential amendments, we could arrive at the result which  I  believe is desired by the majority of honorable members. </para>

I do not care what amendment the honorable member makes as long as he gives effect to that proposal ; but I do not think he can adopt any other legal method than that of providing for two corporations. I am satisfied from what the Prime Minister has said that he proposes to keep inviolate from the debts of the ordinary bank the deposits in the Savings Bank Branch. That is all I desire. We ought to safeguard the large deposits of the Savings Bank as much as possible. I shall not submit an amendment, but trust to the Prime Minister to have an alteration made later on. </para>

                    <para>.- The right honorable member for Swan, who is not at present in the chamber, suggested that it might, perhaps, not be advisable to name the chief officer of the bank "the Governor," because current allusions to him under that title might lead to certain confusion, inasmuch as it is one employed to describe the Governor of a State. For the purpose of lucidity and distinction it might be desirable to have the title varied in some way. </para>

                    <para>. - As I have said, I think that the title " Governor " is the most appropriate in the case of a bank of this description. I admit that some confusion might arise; but when the title is associated with the bank, I do not think there will be any doubt on the part of  financial people. I frankly say that I prefer the word " Governor," unless the Committee feel very strongly on the point. </para>

                    <para>- - I think the honorable member for South Sydney is quite correct. If the Prime Minister intends to suggest a Board of three directors, or trustees, he will be following the precedent of the Bank of England; and it is important to know whether such is the intention. If it be so, I do not see any objection to the use of the word " Governor " ; but, on the other hand, if the Governor of the bank is to act alone, his title may be much less appropriate. </para>

The honorable member for Ballarat pointed out that the right honorable member for Swan had some apprehension that the title proposed in the Bill might give rise to some confusion in the minds of people in connexion with the Governor of a State. On that being pointed out, I consented to insert the word " Bank " ; and the worst that can be said of the amendment is that it is a redundancy. If, however, the additional word removes any misapprehension or confusion, no harm is done. </para>

                    <para>.- The right honorable member for Swan pointed out that references to the Governor of the bank, verbally or in the press, would be briefly to " the Governor," and that this would be likely to give rise to a certain amount of confusion with the Governor of a State. No one has yet mentioned the Governor-General in this connexion, <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> called attention to the matter in the absence of the right honorable member for Swan ; and then came the suggestion that the title should be "the Bank Governor." I hesitated to adopt this suggestion, because that is not a taking title. It does, however, describe the official ; and for want of a better, it was proposed by the Prime Minister. My own suggestion was to leave the matter with the Prime Minister, so that he might consider some modification, with a view to giving the Governor of the bank a distinctive appellation. </para>

The honorable member for Parkes regards the amendment as a foolish one, though it did originate with his leader. How are we to read this Bill if the amendment is carried? Clause 11,, for instance, would read something like this: - "The bank shall be managed by the Bank Governor of the bank." </para>

                    <para>.- It is not necessary to insert the proposed word. I understand that in some of the States we find what is called " the Governor of the gaol " ; and we are not told of any confusion that arises between that official and the Governor of the State. Every time the chief officer of the bank is described, it will be as " the Governor of the bank." </para>

                    <para>.- Owing to the arrangement made to close the second-reading debate at a certain time, I had no opportunity to address myself to the general principles of this measure ; and, therefore, I should now like to offer a remark or two on this clause. In the first place, I have no objection to the Commonwealth establishing a bank. It is quite possible for the Commonwealth to establish a bank that will be a really strong institution, to which other financial, institutions can look for support. The question is, " What sort of bank are we going to establish, and under what sort of management <inline font-style="italic">7"</inline> I admit the truth as a general proposition of the statement that banking is merely a matter of dealing in credits, but the credit must have a fairly sound foundation. It is quite open for the Commonwealth Parliament, if -the people desire it, to found a sound and proper bank, so long as we go the right way about it. My trouble is, "Are we going to found a bank that will be worthy of this Commonwealth ? " If we desired to be so foolish, we could start a large generous affair, open-hearted and open-handed, to which everybody could come in time of need, and where no one would be denied; but I do not think it would carry on for very long. I am afraid that if we do not do something in that line, some people in Australia will suffer a great disappointment, because the people were told that the present banks were bleeding the public, and making immense profits, and that the Commonwealth could establish an institution to which the poor and needy could apply with a certainty that their wants would be supplied. We are a Federation, and it would be a good idea if our bank were given a really Federal basis, by the States being allowed to co-operate with the Commonwealth in it. This would tend to make the institution all the sounder, and also help to simplify the very difficult and pressing problem of dealing satisfactorily with the Slate debts. That was one of the great questions for which Federation was brought about, but after eleven years of Federation we are as far off any practical solution of it as we were at the beginning. I am sorry no scheme was outlined in that direction in the recent Budget, but this bank must, sooner or later, take a hand in dealing with the State debts. lt will have to be the financial institution through which we do the business. 1 wish' to put it on record that, if we give the bank a more Federal basis than the Government propose, it will simplify our procedure, and materially help the settlement of the question, which will have to be dealt with, not only in a way that suits this Parliament, but in a way that is satisfactory to the States which have incurred the debts, and to the people of Australia generally: If we go about the business in the right way, we can establish a National bank which will be in the proper sense a banker's bank, strong enough to help in time of need any other bank that is worth propping up. Of course, there have been in Australia banks that have gone smash, and that sooner or later would have collapsed under normal circumstances, but other banks have gone down that need not have gone insolvent had there been some institution to tide them over their period of stress. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily the State, so long as there was some strong central institution. If we go about it properly, it is possible for us to establish a bank that, in time, would not only be able to render such succour to other institutions in need of help, but that would be a sound business in itself, and earn substantial profits that could be applied to Commonwealth purposes. Apart from that, it could save the Commonwealth a lot of money by doing the Government business,  and by negotiating for the flotation, transfer, and renewal of loans. I take it that that is one of the best arguments for the foundation of a bank of this sort. </para>

                        <para>- The help should be given in the case of a financial institution which is not really insolvent, but which, if pressed too hard at a certain time, would have to suffer a great decrease in the value of its securities, and so cause great loss to many people, and the State generally. Institutions of that sort should be saved from collapse, in the public interest. As an illustration, I can refer the honorable member to what happened in his own State in  1893.  A tremendous loss would have been caused to the whole of Queensland if the great securities held by the Queensland Bank had had to be realized at that time, but the Government came forward with their note issue and other forms of assistance, and kept the bank from collapse. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that the Commonwealth Bank is an absolute necessity. I do not think it is. I merely say that such an institution as I have outlined could be established, and if it is run on sound lines I see no great harm in it. Ido not say that the Commonwealth Bank should overshadow the private banks, but, if established, it should be a bank that we can all look up to. When established it should also have a branch to deal with the Commonwealth note issue. This would be a. great improvement on the system of handling notes that we have had so far. </para>

                        <para>- It would not be difficult for the bank, when established, to take the note issue over. It could manipulate the business in a better way for the Commonwealth than could the Treasury. With its central office in Melbourne, and its branches throughout the country, the bank would, as it were, have its finger on the pulse of the community to a greater extent than the Treasury has, and so could tell better how trade was going, and the amount of note issue required. By setting up a central institution we could deal with Savings Bank business also, but we should be taking on unnecessary trouble. We shall have quite enough to do in the first instance to establish our own general bank. It would be wiser to leave the Savings Bank business as it is now, or at any rate before we take a share in it we should consult the States, which already have Savings Banks of their own, in which the people of Australia- have placed over £50,000,000. A great deal of that money is lent out on short-dated loans, and a great deal of it also on long-dated loans, through the Credit Foncier system. </para>

                        <para>- I was trying to picture the sort of Ccommonwealth Bank that I should like to see established under this clause, but I bow to your ruling. Those in charge of the Savings Banks of the States have done all that they can to make their systems uniform, with the result that depositors now enjoy practically all the conveniences which they could have from a Commonwealth Savings Bank, and the duplication of this machinery is unnecessary. The capital of the proposed bank should be adequate. We need  , £2,000,000  or more to establish the bank. </para>

                        <para>- Still, I think that my remark is in order. A more important point is this : It would be better if the bank were not purely a Commonwealth Bank, and had private capital as its basis. It would then be more useful in times of trouble. The Bank of France is not purely a State Bank. Like the Bank of England, it is based on private capital, as is partly the case with the Bank of New Zealand. A purely State Bank might not be able, when its help was most needed, to give the assistance that was required. Panics come when they are least expected, and no method of preventing them is known. If at a time of panic a purely State Bank could not meet the demands made on it, the position would be very awkward, because the public credit would have been destroyed, and there  would be nothing to fall back on. But with an institution like the Bank of England or the Bank of France, you would have something to come to the aid of the credit of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth could come to the aid of the bank. President Thiers, after the war between France and Germany, said that the Bank of France saved France, " because it was not a State Bank." Had that bank been wholly a national concern, it could not have given the assistance which it did, because the national credit had been destroyed by the war. The situation was saved by the credit of the bank coming to the aid of the national credit. </para>

                    <para>When the Bank of France issued notes secured by Treasury obligations, it added its own guarantee to that of the State, and the paper circulated consequently at par. If the bank and the Government had been one and the same, the bank's signature would have been no reinforcement of the State's, and the paper intended to be taken on trust would have been valued at just what the State's credit was worth. </para>

                <para class="block">That touches a vital point that has not been fairly dealt with by Ministers or their supporters. If this bank becomes, as no doubt it will, an ordinary trading concern, it must, like any other institution, occasionally suffer losses, and, should the credit of the Commonwealth be injured, there would be nothing to back it up. A bank based on private capital, doing the Government business on easy terms, and enjoying certain privileges, so that it would be somewhat in the position of the Bank of England, would be a much stronger institution, and of greater value to the community, than a purely National or State Bank. </para>

                    <para>. - Like the honorable member for Wilmot, I had intended to speak during the second-reading debate, but waived my right to do so to enable the Bill to get into Committee on Friday afternoon. Therefore, there are many matters on which I should like to speak which I cannot discuss now. But I am glad to witness the general approval - in some cases a modified one - of the Government proposal for the establishment of a National bank. The honorable member for Wilmot favours the establishment of a bank which will be a sort of agent for other banks, and would come to their assistance in times of financial crisis by placing the credit of the Commonwealth at their disposal. But I think that the time has come when the people should control directly their great monetary interests. At the same time, I would leave the financial field as open to private institutions as it is now. The establishment of a purely National bank has been strongly opposed, when efforts to that end have been made by the States. Savings Banks have been established by the Governments of the States, but until recent times that of New South Wales did not lend money to the general community, and I believe that a similar policy prevailed in the other States. </para>

                        <para>- I wish only to explain my support of this proposal by pointing to the policy obtaining in connexion with the State Savings Banks, and showing that this scheme will be more generally in touch with the desire of the people. It will be conducted with due regard to the carrying out of the general principles recognised in the banking world, as compared with the more restricted system adopted by the earlier Savings Banks. The bank to which I was referring when the  Chairman  intervened would not lend to small holders, and its principal customers as borrowers were the privately-instituted banks. It was only when the crisis of 1892-3 came along that this institution, in common with others, got into financial difficulties. The result was that the State, being the larger and the more substantial institution, had to guarantee their assets, and so prevent the general bankruptcy which threatened. </para>

                <para class="block">State had to come to the assistance of these private institutions. The lesson of the crisis was that the State was more substantial, and more to be trusted, than was this semi-State Bank or the private banking institutions. It was only when the guarantee of the State as a whole was placed behind them that confidence was restored and business proceeded along normal lines. That proves that the bank, as proposed to be established under this Bill, has a larger asset on which to operate, and that, notwithstanding the fear expressed by the honorable member who preceded me, that there may come a time when the operations of this bank may be seriously affected by a crisis, experience demonstrates that before a State institution can be seriously menaced by any general loss of confidence on the part of the depositors and those who do business with it, the other banks, including the State Bank which does not possess the full guarantee of the several States, will be in a very much worse position than it is possible for this bank to be in. As the honorable member for Denison clearly demonstrated the other day, there is a vast difference between the popular idea of the functions of a bank and the real basic principles on which it works. The banks, after all, are simply dealers in credit, and, that being so, it is desirable that their credit shall be substantial, and that there shall be general confidence in their ability to meet their engagements. My argument is that the Commonwealth, being the larger and wider institution, representing the people as a whole, is not liable to the withdrawal of public confidence that falls to the lot of private institutions. It was objected that the Commonwealth Bank should be completely removed from political control. That is only right, and I support the Government in their desire to establish this bank, and to establish it under conditions that will insure that it will be conducted on proper commercial lines, free from any interference on the part of politicians or those interested in politics. T.hat is not the position of a private banking institution.' Private banking companies are very anxious to have leading politicians on their directorates, and well-known politicians largely preponderate on their Boards. In the practical work of banking, as the people have reason to know, politics are not altogether unknown. First of all, the small holders of overdrafts from a bank are squeezed when a drought or some other trouble takes place, and that process has been as largely responsible as any other factor I know of for the wiping out of the small settlers and the aggregation of large private estates. In other ways also politics have been introduced into banking business. Small men with ' overdrafts have been told that they must exercise due caution in expressing themselves in the political arena, otherwise they may be called upon at a moment's notice to make good their overdrafts. Such an experience is well known to the poor farmer. It would be a great thing in the interests of pure politics if we could have an institution that would be so free from political bias and control that such an experience would be impossible in connexion with it. It does not obtain in connexion with the State Savings Bank, and a great National bank that can remove such a blot from the free exercise of our political rights will confer a great service upon a large and substantial section of the community. In these circumstances, I heartily support this measure; and I am glad to find that the opposition that used to be offered in the State  Parliaments to every proposal to establish a bank under State control is not so pronounced in this case. I trust that this will be a National bank in every sense of the term ; that it will do all the business that it is possible for a bank to do; and that it will do it in the interests of the whole people. I hope, further, that politics will not be obtruded in the discharge of its functions, and that the people who do their business with it will not have the sad experience, which has fallen to the lot of many doing business with private banks, of being hauled up to the bull-ring when their politics do not coincide with those of persons who have the control of the institution. </para>

The honorable member for Riverina remarked, when the honorable member for Wilmot was speaking, that he ought not, upon this clause, to deal with the general question, since it was merely one giving a name to the bank. On reading it carefully, the honorable member will see that it goes further, since it provides - </para>

In the first place, I should like to remark that when first I saw this Bill I was rather disappointed with the character of the proposal, and surprised that the pride of the honorable member for Darwin should have been so severely touched by completely ignoring the scheme that was put forward, with the consent of the Government, some eighteen months ago, as the emanation of his own intellect, and indorsed by the Brisbane Conference. My recollection of that scheme was that there was to be a bank in which all the States were to be compelled to take a part. </para>

I am not vain enough to imagine that I can influence the opinions of honorable members opposite by anything I can say on this question. I regard this discussion, so far as putting the Bill into shape is concerned, as quite futile. I have long given up the hope that any honorable members on this side can affect the measures, or the form of the measures, put forward by the Government. It has become a truism that all Bills are discussed in general and in detail before they come here. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite compatible with the fact that the Bill was before the Caucus, and the general principle and details approved, and that it has come here now to be registered. I am not sufficiently biased to believe that honorable members opposite are opposed to joining with honorable members on this side in making some necessary amendments ; and when we come to the clause dealing with the management of the bank, I shall submit what I think is, in one respect, a much wiser scheme. Instead of throwing on the Governor the complete responsibility for managing an institution which may have the handling of  £25,000,000  or  ,£50,000,000,  honorable members will be willing, I think, to appoint directors, as in the case of the Bank of England, or trustees, as in the case of the Savings Banks. I fear, however, that, on the general principles, it is very unlikely that any suggestions from this side will be adopted. I do not take the pessimistic view of this Bill that many honorable members do. It is quite open to the Government, especially of a young community like this, to take part in the banking business of the country. The Bank of England has been, not only a successful, but an extremely useful institution. The Commonwealth has, or will have, enormous financial prospects. We are going, by-and-by, to take over the debts of the States ; and this Commonwealth Bank will have an office in London, in which a great deal of very useful work can be done in this connexion. But a great deal will depend on the way in which such an institution is managed. It would be very undesirable that this bank should be so constituted as to be under the influence, directly or indirectly, of any Government or any Minister. My experience of banking extends over thirty years. I have been director of a bank, and I know something about the business ; and I say that if we are not careful to make this bank completely and obviously free from political influence, the public will never have in it that confidence which is so necessary to make it a highly successful institution. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking from the point of view of the management. Under the clause before us, I submit, I am at perfect liberty to discuss the whole question of the desirableness of establishing a Commonwealth Bank, and to say under what conditions, quite apart from other proposals in the Bill, I consider such an institution is likely to be successful. I am not trying, sir, in any way to manoeuvre or get round any of your rulings. I submit that we have a perfect right now to discuss the abstract question of the desirability of establishing a Commonwealth Bank, and, to that end, to deal with those conditions which ought, or ought not, to surround such an institution. If the public see or suspect that this bank, instead of being put into the hands of a Governor or genera] manager and three competent men as trustees, is left in the hands of one man- </para>

But, surely, I may bring to bear on this question my experience as a bank director, and, from my knowledge of commerce, say that the public will be very sceptical of the soundness, and probable future soundness, of an institution which is liable to have the hand of any Government or Minister placed on it at any time in order to influence its policy? </para>

I do not wish the honorable member to sneer at any opinions which may be offered simply because he is suspicious that I come here as the advocate of bankers. The honorable member makes a great mistake if he thinks I am here as the advocate of any capitalists. I know capitalists as well as he does ; and I have no unreasonable partiality for many of them, whether as merchants, bankers, or manufacturers. I can assure honorable members that, if I stand up here and express opinions, those opinions are quite distinct from any influence that can be brought to bear by any parties outside. </para>

                <para>The popular idea outside is that a bank is a means of making enormous sums of money - that banks are a sort of octopus constantly bleeding the people, in order to put money into the pockets of what are popularly called "fat men." During the days of the reconstruction of the banks I made it my business to attend a large number of meetings of those institutions which availed themselves of the reconstruction laws, and I was quite astonished at the great variety of people who formed the shareholders. The cartoon in a Labour paper, representative of a banker, usually shows us a man of huge proportions, . with an enormous gold chain, big enough for a dog chain, large diamonds in his sleeve-links and in his rings, and smoking a big cigar. This represents the popular notion ; but the actual fact is that shareholders consist of men and women, many of them of the working class, small shopkeepers, or various kinds of working women, some of them, perhaps, washerwomen. If anybody attends a meeting of bank shareholders, he, too, will be astonished at the large number of poor and middle-class people to he seen there; and when people look for the typical bank shareholder in the ridiculous figure presented by the working-class papers, they are labouring under an extraordinary delusion. The bank shareholders are, many of them, of the same class of people as those who deposit their money in the Savings Bank ; and to get them to take an interest in the Commonwealth Bank, it will have to be made quite clear that it is not liable to political influence. </para>

                        <para>-  The question of decency I shall not deal with ; but I think I can show that I am quite in order. This clause is simply a proposition to establish a Commonwealth Bank ; and we cannot deal with the advisability of taking that step without asking ourselves under what conditions it would be advisable to establish it. Surely it is obviously relevant to say that, if we establish a Commonwealth Bank, it ought to be free from political influence? I am pointing out, in an appropriate way, I think, that we ought to consider what is the class of people likely to use the bank, so as to give it that importance and substantiality we desire. </para>

Some time ago I read a quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Worker</inline> on the subject of a State Bank.

                    <para>The establishment of a Commonwealth bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve, would be . 1 big step towards making the Australian nation master of its own currency, and liberate its citizens from the talons of the Money Power. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the popular view - that every bank in the country, notwithstanding that it is in competition with a great many more in every other State, is a sort of vulture. The word " vulture " is used in the article, and the allegation is that the banks are really trying to take advantage of the simplicity of the people to bleed them of their means. That is an utterly wrong view, which will not stand the investigation or the test of figures. When the Prime Minister was addressing the House upon the question, he said the average profit of all the banks over a great many years was 17 per cent. on their original capital, but that on their paid up capital to-day the profits were an average of 9 per cent. I have taken the trouble to look up the <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book</inline> for Australia, and I undertake the responsibility of differing entirely from the right honorable gentleman's conclusions. He has never taken into consideration the banks which have absolutely failed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think, sir, you have any right to say so. I wish to deal with the question of the profits of the banks, and to show that they cannot be arrived at by taking what they pay on their original capital. If one wishes to find out what a bank will pay, he must take as a basis, not merely the present capital, but also the market value of the shares. To ascertain what a bank would have paid on its original capital would take one back sometimes sixty or seventy years. In addition to their dividends, we know that banks and other institutions have put money into reserve funds. If you take their present capital you have to take into account as a basis for their profits, not only the original value of the shares, but the value of the reserve funds. We have to remember, too, that the shares are changing hands every day, and that the people who buy them pay so much premium on them, according to the interest they pay, as will give them about the same average which they get on all other public companies - namely, 5 or 6 per cent. To talk of the " talons ." of a bank, and of it being a "vulture," when you have seen the character of the people who form the shareholding class of the banks, is wholly unfair. Honorable members would find, if they bought shares in one of the banks, that, at the current price, they would not produce more than 5, or, at the most, more than 6 per cent. ; and if they were original shareholders they would find that they are not producing much more than that on the present capital, adding to the original capital the reserve funds, which have been saved out of profits. In the past, when prices were high, there were times in Australia when you could not borrow money upon a property under 6 nr 8 per cent. In those days men made bigger profits, and the banks paid dividends to a certain amount and put a portion of their profits to reserve funds. Therefore, if you take the profits paid upon the original capital and the reserve funds combined, you find that they do not come to the high rates that many people suppose they do. If, on the other hand, you take the profits of the banks upon the current value at which people have been buying the shares for years, you will find that, being a sound, and what is called a gilt-edged, investment, they do not produce more than sometimes 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., or, at the very most, 6 per cent., so that the idea that this bank is going to make huge profits can be disposed of at once. That vision of ignorance is one which ought to be dispelled at all events from the mind of every member of this House. </para>

                        <para>- I said it then. The honorable member, because he is at my back, and misunderstands what I say, gives me the lie direct. In taking into consideration what the banks have produced in the past, it would be utterly wrong to leave out of calculation the losses, not only of profits, but of capital, in the institutions that have failed. If you want to take the average of what a particular industry, whether banking or gold-mining, has brought in, it is not sufficient to take the successful ventures and say what they are making. You must take into consideration the whole of the ventures, successful and unsuccessful, calculate what money has been put into them, what money they have produced, and take that as an average over all their capital. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt that also ought to be taken into consideration. There is a popular notion outside that the Commonwealth Bank is going to lend money to individuals in a very small way. I cannot discuss that matter here, but it has a bearing on the broader issue which I have put to the Committee. We ought to be very careful, when formulating a scheme for the establishment of a bank, to surround it by all the protection possible through the management. If that is done, and it is put upon the basis of other institutions of the kind, I have no fear for the future. As we are going .to convert some hundreds of thousands of State debts into Commonwealth debts, and to deal with their investment, and to have a branch in London, I think it will be a very useful institution, so long as it is entirely free from political influence. </para>

                    <para>.- As we have come face to face with the particular proposals in the Bill, this clause not only affords an opportunity for the general discussion that we have had, but is the proper place" to invite a specific statement from the Prime Minister on one or two of the most important features of the Bill, and some of the most important proposals which deserve a place in it. The clause provides for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I have already defined my view of the bank. The word "Commonwealth" is, apparently, intended to be used in its more exclusive reading as denoting the bank of the Government of the Commonwealth, and of the Commonwealth alone. In the original shape of this proposition, the obvious intention was that it should be a Commonwealth Bank in the \ larger sense of the term, embracing the States and their Treasuries, as well as the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth and Commonwealth Treasury. Nothing could be more desirable than such a combination. It would be in harmony with the intention of our own Constitution, enormously increase the resources of the institution, and, of necessity, carry with it the banking business of the States, which, taken collectively, is an immense source of revenue, and affords enormous opportunity. </para>
                <para>At this stage, the crucial issue appears to be whether we intend to establish a rival and a competitor to the existing private banks, and to any possible State Banks which may be launched by any of the States. As this proposition is put forward, it creates a rival and competing bank entering into a field which at present is wholly occupied by private banks. As I understand the original object of those who, on various sides and from various political angles, have proposed an Australian bank, the crucial question is whether it is to be national in its business and foundation in the wider sense of the term, or whether it is to step into the public arena relying only on its own great future resources as a combatant. It will seriously limit many of the present operations of the private banks, and might so occupy the field of national finance that only a combination of State Banks, if such a thing could be imagined, would be able to make financial headway against the powerful corporation that it promises to be. </para>
                <para>I am endeavouring now to direct the attention of the Committee to this parting of the ways. This is the time and place at which we must arrive at an all-important decision. One of the features which commended this project to many, myself among them, was that in the original draft submitted to the Conference by the honorable member for Darwin provision was made, not as extensively as one would have liked, but quite explicitly, for the recognition of a certain probable partnership on the part of the States. </para>

                        <para>- On this point the measure is not explicit, and the opportunity for making it so presents itself. If this is to be a Federal undertaking, the bank should be founded with State as well as with Commonwealth capital. That would make it immensely more powerful and popular. Should the States find part of the capital, their financial business would certainly be given to the bank, and the handling of their debts would naturally come under its management. This last is the outstanding financial undertaking to which all financial attention is directed, and its importance can scarcely be overestimated. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to appear as the author of a carefully thought-out scheme, nor am I antagonistic to other suggestions ; but the possessor of a direct pecuniary interest in an institution pays more attention to its management, and does more to put business in its way, than one who is not concerned in its success. My suggestion is a merited recognition of the position of the States, and affords an opportunity for the handling of their debts. It is a frank and open arrangement for the financial federation of our great public enterprises and interests. That is the real end of this bank. Of course, no proposition has the faintest chance of success unless submitted by the Government with the support of Ministerialists; but at this juncture a question not to be avoided is, What is our aim? Is it Federal in the inclusive or in the exclusive sense? The formulation of a scheme such as I suggest will in no sense coerce the States, each of which must consider the proposition -from its own stand-point. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. That might depend on the replies returned by the States, and in such a situation I should be prepared to make a suggestion. But if the Government will not seriously consider the proposal, the discussion of it is fruitless. Still it is at least possible, to frame the measure so as to make provision for their coming in, a period, if necessary, being fixed in which the States could make a definite reply. </para>

                    <para>. - The question raised by the Leader of the Opposition is not so clear to my mind as it appears to be to his. One would think, listening  to  the honorable member, that the Commonwealth alone had the constitutional power to establish a National bank. As a matter of  fact,  no one knows better than he does; that the States themselves ha.ve far greater powers in regard to national  banking  than*  has  the. Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Already the Government of the honorable member's own State has agreed to bank with this institution, quite apart from any question of partnership. The question of partnership has never been raised by it, nor has it been proposed, or  Suggested,  by any of the States. It is quite true that the Minister of Home Affairs, at the Brisbane Conference, outlined a scheme, which met with general approval there, in which it- was proposed that the States should cooperate with the Commonwealth in the establishment of a National bank. That scheme, however, is not part of our platform. It is equally true that, for twenty years, a State banking proposal was outlined in connexion with nearly every State Labour  platform in Australia. The people knew exactly what was meant. I do not wish to take away any of the credit to which the honorable member for Darwin is entitled for constantly keeping this question before the public. The business of this Parliament, however, is primarily, to establish a Commonwealth Bank to transact Commonwealth banking business, leaving it open at any time for the States to come in and co-operate with us if they so desire, The proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition, as I understand it, is that the passing of this Bill should be delayed until the States, by co-operating with us, become partners in this concern. If that' is his proposition, then I venture to say, with the greatest respect to the States, that the Bill will not be passed during this, or the next, Parliament. The second point to be considered is whether we could take in one State if the remainder did not elect to come in. In my opinion, such an arrangement would meet with absolute failure. When all the States desired to co-operate with us we could amend this measure in accordance with their wishes, so that there could be co-operation and joint action, on the part of the Commonwealth and the States, in dealing with the great question of the State debts and their own financial business. After all, the question of the management of the State debts will, undoubtedly, come ultimately into this banking scheme, whether the bank be a cooperative concern or not. That, in my opinion, is inevitable. So far from the Commonwealth Bank proposed to be established being. un-Federal, I say that it will be most Federal. The Opposition have been most persistent in the assertion that a citizen of a State is also a citizen of the Commonwealth. How, then, can they say that the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank will injure the citizen of a State if it benefits him as a citizen of the Commonwealth? We have no power to coerce the States in this matter, but when they think fit they may express a desire to become partners in this national banking institution, and it will be found that this Government is just as desirous of cooperating with them as they are to co-operate with us. But to insert in this Bill a provision, making it at condition precedent to the establishment of -a Commonwealth Bank, that the States shall have agreed to co-operate, would be to cause a fatal delay and to disrupt the whole policy of the bank. I wish the Leader of the Opposition to disabuse his mind altogether of the idea- that this Government is antagonistic to the States. I wish him, and those who are acting with him - in short, I desire all who take any interest in this banking proposal to know thai the Government are anxious to pass a Commonwealth Bank Bill for Common wealth banking purposes, and that they wish to leave it open to the States at any time to express a desire to become partners in it. When that desire is expressed it will be time to raise the question brought forward by the Leader of . the Opposition. In my opinion, the best managed bank will be such a bank as we propose, governed by one central authority, rather than by a combination of interests. In that way, alone, shall we secure a bank of the greatest utility. I do not say that we are shutting the door against the States coming in. We leave the door perfectly open, so far as this proposal is concerned, but I do not think it would be wise to de: lay the passing of the Bill until the States came to an agreement regarding the question. The Leader of the Opposition knows how difficult it is to get them to agree upon anything, and that difficulty would be intensified in this connexion, seeing that the States, notwithstanding that they had the original, constitutional power to establish banks of their own, have, in no case, attempted to pass legislation, providing for the creation of a bank to do general banking business. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on having' hinted to the State Governments that, they should have embraced before now the many opportunities offered them to create banks of their own. They would then have been in a position to say, " Here we are with our own institutions.  We shall be able to come in and co-operate with you." Even if we have separate management, in my opinion co-operation is better than the merging of one bank into another. I am not of the view that it would be advisable at present to ask the States to become shareholders in this bank. I shall not dogmatize upon this .question, which has been sprung upon me, but I think the . people of the Commonwealth will be best and most expeditiously served if we pass this Bill, providing for Commonwealth control, on the understanding that when the States have arrived at an agreement  to come in, and express a desire to do so, they will be able to, come in and be &gt; shareholders with us in a co-operative banking concern. </para>

I should like the Treasurer to insert in the Bil] a provision indicating to the State Governments that the door will be open to them to comp in later on. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the Bill as it stands leaves the door ajar. I certainly think it ought to be open to the States to come in. Some honorable members have been exceedingly afraid of politics entering into the management of this institution, and I think that honorable members on both sides are averse to anything of the kind. It is difficult, however, to determine where what may be called political influence ceases and practical management begins. I read to-day a speech made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> D. Carter, when Treasurer of Victoria in  1894,  in moving the second reading of a Bill providing for the introduction of the Credit Foncier system in connexion with the State Savings Bank. The honorable gentleman was surprisingly frank in pointing out what part, in his opinion, the Government should play in connexion with that institution. In the course of his speech he said - </para>

                    <para>The Bill makes the whole of the property and cash that may come into the hands of the Savings Bank Commissioners, Government property. We guarantee the depositors; and we have the right to control the finances of the institution. We should have a preferential lien upon the money deposited. The right to veto a loan. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Ballarat will probably tell us whether the Bill as passed gave effect to those views. It appears to me that the Treasurer of Victoria at that time had no fear of enunciating his views in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- That is all very well, but the fact remains that it is a bank. In reading the debate on that measure, I felt that I was reading the debate on the Bill now before us. The same old objections that were trotted out against that measure have been raised against that with which we are now dealing. There seemed to be no fear, however, in the mind of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> D. Carter, who was generally regarded as a Free Trade Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. It was in  1894,  immediately after the banking crisis, that the Bill was introduced, because he believed there would be a great demand for cheaper money. Up to that time producers and others had had to pay  9  and  10  per cent; but as soon as that measure was announced the rate came down. </para>

                    <para>. - We are indebted to the Prime Minister for the clear explanation he has given of this phase of the question. The States are free to come in if they exhibit any desire to do so; and to await any action on their part would, for obvious reasons, be a great mistake. If the measure be passed on the lines- laid down, it will be a clear indication that the management must be in the hands of bankers without any political control ; and the States, if they do come in. must do so under those conditions. In the past the States have been free to institute banks of their own, but they have not done so. The attempt made in South Australia years ago by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> failed. </para>

                <para class="block">I venture to say, because of that distinguished and august body, the Legislative Council. The Legislative Councils of Australia will see that no State Bank is ever started, and that none of the States take a part in the proposed Commonwealth Bank. But it is just as well that the States should know the real position, and that they should not be able to say in the future that they had never had any invitation. If the States do take an interest in the bank, they will naturally want a nominee on the board; and how, then, could it be said that there was no political control. Of course, I am now speaking solely for myself, and 1 may say that I feel very strongly on the matter. 1 see no likelihood of the States taking an interest in the concern ; but, if they do, it must be on the principles laid down in the Bill. If they do not choose to join in this enterprise, let them start their own State Banks as soon or as late as they like. </para>

                    <para>.- It is strange to hear the Prime Minister saving that the door is to be left open to the States to subscribe capital to an institution to which the Commonwealth itself does not propose to subscribe a single sixpence, and, yet, that the States shall have no voice in the management. How is it possible to put such a provision in the Bill without affording them an opportunity later on to share in the government of the bank? Would any honorable member be prepared to subscribe to the share capital of a company and be deprived of any voice in its management? If the Prime Minister is genuine in his desire to give the States an opportunity later on to come in as shareholders, he ought also to indicate in what way they may be able to share in the management. It is of no use our simply putting a placard of this description in the Bill, unless we also indicate the conditions. </para>

                <para>It has been stated that the Government, business will be a* matter of considerable moment to an institution of this sort, and that considerable revenue will be thereby derived. The Prime Minister was good enough to answer some questions of mine this afternoon, and we learn that the banks of Australia paid to the Commonwealth no less than ,£4,737 more than the Commonwealth, paid to the banks. The Commonwealth paid the banks £2,850 for conducting their banking business in exchange, and the banks, in competition with one another for the Commonwealth drafts on London, owing to having certain charges to .adjust at the other end of the world, paid to the Commonwealth no less than £6,562 for the privilege of negotiating those drafts. This may come as news to the honorable member, but it is well known in banking circles. The banks, in competition for money at distant places, where there are settlements to adjust, and so forth, are often very willing to purchase a draft, and give a. considerable premium on it. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Richmond does not seem able to get out of his head the idea of an ordinary bank, into which a number of gentlemen put a certain amount of capital, with a view to dividends. And he compares such an institution with a National bank, established for the benefit and advantage of the whole people, who are really the shareholders, and who are not seeking profit in the same way. The suggestion that the States should come in as shareholders  seems to suggest that some advantages would thereby accrue to the State Governments j and, if that be so, it must mean advantages in the way of political influence and political control. As a matter of fact, the people as a whole will reap any advantage there may be from the establishment of this bank ; and to admit the State Governments would mean an alteration of the whole scheme. When the States express any desire to come in as shareholders, it will be quite time enough to talk about making provision of the kind. I believe the State Governments will very quickly find it to their advantage in handing some of their business to give patronage to the Commonwealth Bank in the ordinary business way. I do not see how they could do any more than that, even if we declared them to be shareholders, and gave them a say in the management. I trust the measure will be left on its present lines, leaving it open to any improvement which the States may suggest, but always keeping in view the advantage of the people as a whole. This Parliament; represents the people as a whole, and the State Parliaments represent only sections of the people. I do not see any advantage to be derived for the whole people by the States, as representing sections of them, coming into  the management. On .the other hand, there might be a considerable element of danger through too much political and Governmental influence, which, ought specially to be avoided. It is not correct to say that the bank will be managed by one man only. The Governor of the bank will have great responsibilities, but I think we shall get better results than we should if we had divided control. I do not think that Austral ian experience has shown that government by three Commissioners has been an improvement on government by one man. There has rather been a difficulty in locating responsibility where more than one man is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that the able man who will be secured as the Governor of the bank will consult the experts and authorities regarding any important step that he has to take. There is a provision in the measure for a  Deputy  Governor, which seems to have been overlooked, and when branches are established there will have to be managers appointed for. them. There will, therefore, be plenty of brainy men available for the Governor of the bank to consult. Let any honorable member picture himself as manager of the bank. What would he do as a sensible man, but get all the advice available, and then, after analyzing it, use his best judgment in deciding his course of action, he having the power and responsibility of deciding in any case? It is best to give responsibility to an able man, who will do his best, and be careful. Nobody rushes bull-headed into a job of that kind, and in any ticklish proposition the Governor would take the advice of those concerned.- </para>

                        <para>- He would get the opinions of those whose opinions he considered of value, and then use his own judgment. It is a mistake to say that only one man's brains will be running the show, when there will be quite a host of managers as the business is extended, and all their opinions will be considered by the man in charge. I think the bank is being started on the safest lines. Probably the Governor will start carefully and slowly, and he will need to do so, as he will not have a great amount of working capital to begin with. I do not see any of the dangers that have been depicted. They are possibilities, but they are certainly not probabilities, if we have a man of experience and tested judgment in charge. It is not at all likely that a total stranger to banking will be appointed. We must get the best man available, and pay him a handsome salary to conduct what we believe will become the great National Bank of Australia, and be of great service to the country, corresponding in position with the Bank of England in the Old World. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know that I should have spoken but for the Prime Minister's remark that the Federal Government were animated by no feelings of antagonism towards the State Governments in regard to this measure. There is an old truism that actions speak louder than words, and we know that one division of the Bill relates to the establishment of a Commonwealth Savings Bank. . All the States have at present Savings Banks in existence. We may disclaim as loudly as possible any desire to injure the States in that regard, but the fact remains that we are starting a bank which will run in opposition to the Savings Banks of the States. I question whether the Federal Parliament is entitled to establish a Commonwealth Bank in opposition to banks already being run by the States. The Prime Minister was also good enough to say that the States could come in and work with the Federal Government in connexion with this bank. We are entitled, to ask in what way they can come in. I have pondered the matter over since the statement was made, and the only possible way that I can see for them to come in is as customers of the bank. There is no provision implied or expressed in the Bill by which they could come in as partners. In fact, the determination appears to be to make it a Federal bank pure and simple. The Prime Minister has not placed before us those details which are necessary to enable us to form a proper opinion as to whether we should establish this bank. It was probably an unfortunate slip of the tongue on his part when he said that it was not the duty of the Government to afford such information to the Opposition; but whether it was a slip or not, it is undoubtedly being carried out in practice. Are we to set up large banking establishments in all the chief centres? Are we to evict the State Savings Banks from the post-offices in order to establish our own? There are also a number of other particulars which ought to be supplied to us before we carry the clause. Of course, it will be carried in spite of us; but I am entitled to raise my protest against the deliberate determination by a majority of this House, to establish this bank, in view of the fact that it is going to have very serious consequences to the State Savings Banks, and also in its general banking business, because we are to put ourselves in opposition to existing banks possessing large capital and resources. Unless we put the money of the taxpayers into the venture, to give it stability and strength, it will be a pigmy in comparison with the existing banks from the point of view of the capital at command. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I think in certain circumstances it might be judiciously entered upon. I should not raise a word of opposition to it if it were a bank purely to deal with Commonwealth securities, and transact Commonwealth banking business; but when it ventures into the realm of general banking business, and of Savings Banks which are al ready existing in every one of the States, it becomes an altogether different and much more complex question, which ought to receive more serious consideration than it has so far had. We should consider whether we are justified in entering the realms of private enterprise, for the establishment of this bank means that, and means also a large increase in the number of Commonwealth employes. The number will be small at first, but it will be gradually increased until it becomes a very considerable contingent. I dread the time when we shall have so multiplied our enterprises that the Commonwealth employes will be sufficiently numerous to become perhaps a dominating factor in the government of the country. </para>

If it becomes a marked success, it will mean a large augmentation of the number of Commonwealth employes, and to that extent it constitutes a somewhat menacing feature. </para>

                    <para>. - I was very pleased to hear that the Prime Minister had every desire to allow the States to come into the Commonwealth Bank, because I realize that, unless it has the assistance of the State Governments, it is going to have a very stormy passage for some years. Those of us who have taken notice of the opposition with which every State enterprise has met, must see that the Commonwealth Bank is sure to meet with the same. When, wifE the cooperation of the British, Canadian, and New Zealand Governments, the Pacific Cable Board was created, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company set up the most unfair competition, and to-day the Stateowned Socialistic concern makes a deficit of many thousands per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot argue that question now, but such remarks create antagonism between the Governments of the States and that of the Commonwealth, which hinders Commonwealth enterprises, to the detriment of both. Again, when the New Zealand Insurance Department was started, the private insurance companies lowered their rates, doing all they could to maintain their business, and to attract fresh customers. There are twenty-two banks in business in Australia, and the Queensland National Bank alone has fifty-four or fifty-five branches in Queensland. The whole of our commercial business, with the exception of the little done by the Savings Banks, is in their hands. When the Commonwealth Bank is established, and the managers of the private concerns find that customers are likely to remove their accounts, they will ascertain the reason, and if it is that lower rates can be obtained from the Commonwealth, the rates charged by the private banks will be reduced. If the Commonwealth lends out money at 5 per cent., the private banks will probably lend at 4J per cent. There are other ways in which they will try to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from doing business: It will be impossible for the Commonwealth to establish as many branches of its bank as there are branches of the private banks. It will not be possible to have a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in every country town. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and that very fact makes it all the more necessary to obtain the co-operation of the Governments of the States. The Queensland Government has an agreement with the Queensland National' Bank for the transaction of all Government business by that bank until 1921. That points to a way out of our difficulty. We should insert in the Bill a clause which will allow any State transacting business with the Commonwealth Bank to obtain a proportional share of the bank's profits. I do not think that the profits will be great, because of the competition of the private banks, but the public will gain by the establishment of the Common wealth Bank by getting cheaper money. But if the action of the Commonwealth in establishing a National Bank is regarded by the Governments of the States as a high-handed procedure, and they are further irritated by competition with their Sayings Banks, the Commonwealth institution will suffer. </para>

                        <para>- I am not clear how the States should share in the management of the bank. They might be allowed representation on an Advisory Board, though I hold the view that the management of the bank must, as far as possible, be beyond political control. The States might be given a power like that of the Senate in regard to financial Bills, namely a suggesting power. Undoubtedly one-man control is necessary for the success of the institution. There could not be two captains navigating one ship, and to have the bank controlled by a Board might neutralize the efforts of the man possessing the best brains for its management. If the States come in, it will not be long before some settlement is arrived at regarding the transference and redemption of their debts by the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I recognise the advisableness of permitting the States to obtain an interest in the Commonwealth Bank. While this Parliament and Government represent the whole Commonwealth, each of the State Parliaments and Governments represents a portion of the Commonwealth, and the latter have undertaken big financial obligations which could be best managed through » central institution of the kind proposed. No doubt it is the intention of the Government to meet the States in this matter. </para>

                <para class="block">Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth is empowered to take over the debts of the States for the purpose of consolidating and redeeming them, but nothing will be done without their consent and cooperation. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, the State loans will mature at a rapid rate in the near future. Between 19 n and 19 15 loans amounting to £38,000,000 mature, in the next lustrum £39,000,000, in the next ,£49,000,000, and in the next ,£19,000,000, or  £^77,000,000  within ten years, and about ,£146,000,000 within twenty years. Some of the States are more favorably situated than are others, and I regret to find that New South Wales in this respect is not too well placed. For instance, in 1912 it will have to meet a maturing debt of nearly £10,000,000 ; in 1918 it will have to meet a maturing debt of nearly ,£13,000,000; and in 1924 -a debt of about £16,500,000. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; when we federated the indebtedness of the States amounted to about ,£200,000,000, whereas to-day it exceeds ,£250,000,000. In addition to these maturing debts, new debts are being created, and I hold that the handling of these maturing debts can be successfully dealt with only through an institution of this character. We should therefore endeavour as far as possible to secure the co-operation of the States, and we should have that co-operation in connexion with the Savings Bank side of this proposition. The States at present not being in common agreement, the Commonwealth must give them the lead, and it can give them a lead only by passing a measure of the character of that now before us. The Commonwealth can deal with the matter only from its own standpoint, but it should be ready to welcome the co-operation of the States, and to make every provision to meet them in a reasonable manner. I was pleased to hear the declaration of the Prime Minister this afternoon that he was prepared to make this scheme fit in, as far as possible, with that requirement. That being so, I do not think there is any reasonable ground for strong exception being taken to it. I can understand the opposition of those who, like the honorable member for Echuca, are against the principle of the Bill ; but those who believe in the principle of it can find nothing in this proposal to prevent their hearty co-operation in building up an institution which will be worthy of the whole Commonwealth . </para>

                    <para>.- It is very gratifying to discover that the general feeling of the Committee is at least not antagonistic to, and in some respects is governed by, a desire to see a closer relation between the Commonwealth and the States in the management of this bank.. The remarks of the honorable member for Capricornia show that he, at all events, is able to take a broader outlook, and to realize our responsibilities. I am disappointed, however, that no more positive step is to be taken. I brought the matter under the attention of the Committee, without any idea of causing delay. Still the probable advantages to be gained by an immediate junction of the forces of the Commonwealth and the States in finance is so important that, personally, I would have faced any necessary delay in order to bring it about. That, however, did not appear to me then, and does not appear to me now, to be essential. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I would urge the Prime Minister between now and the time when the Bill leaves the Committee to consider whether something more than the open-door policy cannot be proposed to the States - whether we should not have the open hand as well as the open door. Let him consider whether we ought not to make in this measure at least some preparation such as would anticipate and if possible avoid the delay of waiting for further legislation in the event of the- States making to the Commonwealth overtures that it could reciprocate. It would be better still if the Commonwealth would make the overtures to the Governments of all the States, placing upon them the direct responsibility either of availing themselves of the opportunity or of pursuing their own individual courses. The general attitude of honorable members on both sides, especially considering the disadvantages by which we are faced in dealing with this matter at practically the close of the session, and in circumstances of great pressure, is encouraging. It should indicate to our critics outside that a broad national spirit is a Federal spirit. This proposition, important as I think it must be, is not undertaken with the object of the aggrandisement either of this Government or this Parliament. Our position is too well established to need anything of the kind. We can lose nothing in this regard. Nothing can be taken from us by any step in this direction. </para>
                <para>In these circumstances, and commending this matter to the further consideration of the Prime Minister, I shall allude only to the suggestion made from several quarters that the obstacles to this <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement</inline> between the States and the Commonwealth are to be found in the second Chambers of the States. If there is an obstacle, and that obstacle is effective, it is immaterial to us where it lies. I shall, however, be much surprised if the members of those Chambers of review, who, in the case of most of the States, are men of considerable business and financial experience, do not realize the golden opportunity now afforded them. At all events, if after the proposition has been submitted to them by their respective Governments, they still persist in turning a deaf ear, the responsibility will rest, not upon the Commonwealth, but upon those who will hereafter be called to account for their obstruction. Our aim, therefore, , should be not simply to allow them to " come in," as it has been phrased several times this evening, but to induce them to come in. We can undertake that task for reasons which the honorable member for Calare put very happily. We are one and the same people. Each of us is a citizen of a State, as well as a citizen of the Commonwealth, and we are severally interested in the welfare of our several States, just as we are all interested in the welfare of the whole. </para>

                        <para>- That is better still. But we are near the end of the session, and until we receive some response from the States, I do not think the Prime Minister or his party will excuse us if we set to work to discuss all the precise terms on which this co-operation can be accomplished. Until we have received some further indication from them, we are not in a position to ask the Prime Minister to set aside the business we are at present engaged upon in order that we may deal with the matter. In these circumstances, I have endeavoured to be as brief as possible, and, indeed, have done much injustice to this great subject by the rapid and cursory way with which I have felt bound to treat it pending some direct overture to and from the States. </para>

                        <para>.- Referring back to the quotation just read as to the functions that a Commonwealth Bank is called upon to fulfil, we find that, in the first paragraph of this clause, which deals with the whole of the powers proposed to be conferred upon the institution, there is a broad line of demarcation. I refer to the paragraph authorizing the bank to carry on the general business of banking. It is thoroughly understood, therefore, that so far. as this bank is concerned, all business, even speculative - using the word in the proper business sense - all transactions involving a certain amount of risk, or dealing with private interests, is brought within the scope of this institution. Whatever an existing bank may do in its private relations, the Commonwealth Bank may also do. This appears to be venturing into a very dangerous field, at all events at this stage of the bank's existence. I do not propose to debate the question, because it is one of those matters on which I understand Ministers have made up their minds. </para>

                        <para>- I do; I doubt whether it is wise to undertake such business. Of course, the Governor of the bank will invite this class of business, but he can expect but little for some time to come, especially with the resources at his disposal. </para>

                <para>The only other sub-clause to which I propose to call attention is sub-clause 4, which gives the bank power to borrow money. It appears, therefore, that the no-borrowing policy of the Government party is abandoned. Borrowing is now an open part of the programme of honorable members opposite. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to go into that matter. We all know the benefit it is to a bank, when lending money, to have the account of the borrower within the bank, and thus give opportunity to operate in credit instead of in actual cash. The idea of those who always oppose State banks is to force the Government to borrow money at a certain rate, and then lend it out again. In New South Wales the borrower was in the glorious position that he went to the State bank and got his loan and immediately placed the proceeds in a private bank, which was able to operate on the money as a free deposit. I congratulate the Government on having embodied the principle of private business in this Bill. Many people who support our movement have asked, " Why should the Federal Government go so far as to create a National bank when there are State Banks in a number of the States?" But we really have no State Banks, only land mortgage Departments carried on in the most re.stricted way possible, without any of the ordinary powers of a bank. The Commonwealth Bank will be able to deal directly with its customers, with all the power to control credit and unfixed deposits ; and this makes it paramount above every other effort at State banking hitherto. The Upper Houses of the States have always opposed State banking, and all the State Governments are absolutely powerless to pass a measure like that now before us. For many years to come it will be utterly impossible for any State Government, no matter how strong in the Lower House, to establish a full and complete State Bank without first conquering the Upper House. This shows the absolute necessity for our going straight ahead with the Commonwealth Bank. As to asking the States to come in and assist with the management of the Commonwealth Bank, I could not tolerate such a proposal for a moment - to my mind it is absurd. As we go along with our policy of nationalization, and the nationalization, for instance, of monopolies, I trust the Federal power will be able to manage its own business. So far as the absorption of banking business is concerned, I have not heard one complaint through the press or otherwise; there has been something said about the Savings Banks, but that is all. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, in regard to the Credit Foncier, or land mortgage business, whether it is proposed to set forth the rate of interest to be charged on the loans. This, of course, is not real banking business, but rather a mortgage Department. </para>

A man in business who has good assets with a chance of making money, and who is afraid to borrow, has no right to be in business. I should further like to ask the Prime Minister whether he thinks it would be permissible under this Bill to act upon the co-operative banking system, whereby there is pledged to the Government the combined credits of those who form the co-operative bank. The Government lends in a lump sum the required amount, and the co-operative bank conducts its own affairs in the small outlying districts, giving a good solid guarantee for the amount advanced. I should very much like to see that idea incorporated in the Bill, as well as the. Credit Foncier system. </para>

                        <para>- It would be unfortunate to allow the Bill to pass without some provision of that kind, because the co-operative banking system reaches the smallest borrower within the State or the Commonwealth. It would be able to deal with kinds of loans with which a big  bank manager could not cope. We could not ask him to look after the accounts, or <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> into details, but if co-operative societies of farmers and settlers, artisans, or others, wanted the money even to build houses, or anything of that kind, and we advanced them the money under their combined security, we should be going to the furthest limit of possibility in extending credit to the humblest borrower in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That should be thoroughly understood, because the Credit Foncier system is quite opposed to the general principles of the Bill. It involves a system of borrowing by a process of mortgage bonds, and then retailing the proceeds out to farmers, artisans, and others who choose to borrow. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point I am making. Honorable members must not be under the impression that this Bill is so wide in its scope as to include an effective mode of carrying out the Credit Foncier according to recognised principles. It is essentially a commercial bank that is contemplated, and, consequently, widely opposed to the general principles of lending out in small sums such as have been suggested. The honorable member for Maribyrnong was under a wrong impression regarding the history of the Credit Foncier system in Victoria. It is quite true that a Bill having for its object the establishment of the system was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter,</inline> who was Treasurer in the Patterson Administration, and the second-reading speech quoted by the honorable member was in connexion with that Bill ; but the Bill was never carried. Consequently, the comments on it would hardly be <inline font-style="italic">apropos</inline> to a measure of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- But the Bill to which the speech applied was never carried. As I interjected at the time, it was abandoned, and, subsequently, a Bill which embodied the true Credit Foncier system was introduced. I understood the honorable member to say that the amounts borrowed are a charge upon the Savings Bank of the State. As a matter of fact, while it is the same institution that carries on the ordinary Savings Bank business and the Credit Foncier system, the two sets of funds are kept completely apart. Separate investments are made of the Savings Bank deposits. It is provided that, I think, 25¼ per cent, may be devoted to advances upon land, and that the rest must be invested in Government or the like security ; whereas money for the Credit Foncier system is procured by the selling of mortgage bonds, and, in setting it out, elaborate provisions are necessary to show the borrowers the system of repayment by instalments. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like clearly to understand the Prime Minister's intentions with regard to the States.. We are anxious to have not only their moral but their practical support in this banking scheme. At the same time we are not prepared to share the control of the bank. A divided control of that sort would be fatal to its success. On the other hand, of course, the control might be altogether too concentrated, but that is another question.. I would prefer one-man control to control divided among the separate States. In order to obtain the support of the States we must make some special provision for them in the Bill, if only by giving them a share of the profits proportionate to the extent of their transactions with the bank. That would be the most businesslike method of treating with them. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has yet made a definite pronouncement on the point, but we should do a little more than merely express an opinion on it. If the honorable gentleman agrees, I should like to see embodied in clause 7 some provision setting out that if the States will transact their business, which is enormous, through .the Commonwealth Bank, they will be permitted to share in its profits in proportion to the extent of their business. </para>

All I say is that while the Government are here they will co-operate in every way, bath actively and passively,  to assist the States in coming into the business,' but it must be understood that .this is a Commonwealth banking measure. That is the beginning of it. This clause is not the place to make the provision suggested by the honorable member for Macquarie, lt deals with the powers of- the bank. The honorable member's suggestion ought to&gt; be dealt with in a separate clause, indicate ing the position that would be given to a State Government doing its business with the bank, and what would be the <inline font-style="italic">quid proquo.</inline> In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I think the power to borrow money in paragraph // ought to be given to the bank.

If the Governor or; the management of the bank desire to .borrow money for purely banking purposes,, they ought to .have that power clearly stated, if we mean to give it to them. It is not desirable that the management, of a bank belonging to the people of Australia should be any more restricted than is. the manager of a private concern of the same-, kind. We want to start from scratch, and give equal facilities to both parties. </para>

It has been said that language was given .to man to conceal his thoughts, and possibly, the Government, in their desire to conceal the true objects of the bank, have put the powers in the clause into specific words. If they wish to incorporate in the Bill the full powers that the bank is to have, and if, those powers are to be anything like the' desires expressed by the Prime Minister in. his. recent remarks, their object would behest obtained by deleting the whole of these-  paragraphs, and providing that the bank, in addition to any other powers conferred by this Act, shall have power to do anything that the Government of the day please." </para>

                    <para>.-I think the clause to which the honorable member for Laanecoorie takes exception has been drafted to give the Government a free hand to deal with any matter connected with the bank, and which, in the wisdom of the Governor of the bank, may appear necessary at any time in the future. The Government do not necessarily anticipate that the provisions of the clause are to be put into operation immediately in their entirety. I understand that they are only giving the Governor of the bank powers in all these directions in case he feels, in his wisdom, that it is necessary to exercise them. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know if the Government have a special reason for limiting the capital of the bank to £1,000,000. It seems to me that a large financial institution, adequately representing the Commonwealth, will need a much larger capital, particularly if it gets the business of the States. A private institution, started with similar aims and purposes, would not be limited to a capital of £1,000,000. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Bank needs a capital of at least £5,000,000. At any rate, it is not unreasonable to give power for the extension of the capital to £5,000,000. If the money is not needed, it will not be drawn upon. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that £1,000,000 is more than enough to meet the requirements of the bank for the first few years. I speak with great diffidence, but the advice given to me, which coincides with my own views, is that the bank will soon have more money than it can handle. The difficulty will be to make use of the money deposited with it, so as to pay working expenses, and at the same time give a good return to the depositors. I cannot conceive of the bank needing for capital purposes anything like £1,000,000 within the first two or three years. The capital used in building and equipping offices would probably be more like £250,000 than £1,000,000 for a good time to come. As soon as the bank opens its: doors, it will get money. Were I sure that first-class investments for that money could be found at once, I should have no doubt of the immediate success of the institution. Parliament meets every year, and can increase the capital of the bank if more is required. </para>

                <para class="block">While the right honorable gentleman may speak with diffidence, he acts with great confidence. It is not proposed that the capital of the bank shall be £I,000.COC but that £1,000,000 shall be lent to the bank. The absurdity of that proposition is shown by the fact that the banks of Australia, possess coin, bullion, and cash balances amounting to £37)198,339, their advances being £159,237,265, their other assets £53,765,400, and their total assets about £250,201,004. Yet the Prime Minister says that this bank can* do with a loan of £250,000. </para>

                    <para>. - I have always understood that capital is money put into a business. It is said that Parliament can do everything but prevent a baby from crying, but it is extraordinary to find it declared by legislation that borrowed money shall be regarded as capital. I am surprised that the Government has not put Commonwealth money into the institution. The sum of £1,000,000, or something like it, should have been voted to start the bank, whose profits could go into the Treasury. The bank will have to provide interest amounting to 3! per cent, on the capital lent to it, and at the end of the first year it will be in debt. A profit of 1½ per cent., in addition to the 3 J per cent, interest, would amount to only £15,000. We were told, in answer to a question to-day, that the Government pays something like £2,000 to private banks for the management of its business, and receives about £6,000 for interest on money lent to them. Obviously its business is not of much advantage to the banks. Adding £8,000 to £15,000, you get only £23,000, which probably will not pay expenses for the first year. Premises will have to be bought or rented, and branches cannot be established in the various capitals under £500,000, the interest charge on which, at 4 per cent., would be £20,000. </para>

                        <para>- The whole question of the financing of the bank is open to review. No doubt my honorable friends opposite, if they wished to hamper criticism of the finances of any proposal, would cut up the scheme into a number of clauses, and then claim that we must discuss them one at a time. That would be the best way to blind the eyes of the people as to what is proposed in this case. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to discuss it further. The proper way to have drafted this measure would have been to set forth in clause 9 what, after close examination of the bank's probable requirements, we were prepared to give it to put it on it's feet, and to expect the bank to be responsible for the repayment of the money so handed over to it. </para>

                    <para>.- It may possibly be owing to the fact that honorable members opposite believe that the credit of the Commonwealth is to be behind this bank that they think they are, entitled in connexion with it to depart from what is known as sound finance. Any private institution starting on these lines would be scouted by the financial world. I am glad that honorable members opposite, judging by their cheers, share that view. I would remind them that financiers will equally scout an institution started by the Government which departs from the principles of sound finance. If there is one thing which this bank should eventually do it is, I believe, the work of dealing with the debts of the States; but unless this bank has the good opinion of the financial world, it will be utterly useless to us for that purpose. I stated during the second-reading debate my reasons for believing that the capital of this bank should be subscribed privately.I should be perfectly willing to see the rate of interest fixed. </para>

Everything in connexion with the starting of the bank, and the cost of its premises should come out of capital account. That being so, what is the reason for clause 10? If it is proposed to . raise by means of debentures the money necessary for the capitalization of the bank, why is it proposed to give the Treasurer power to make a temporary loan to the bank? All the expenditure in the initial stages of the bank should come out of capital account. </para>

                    <para>. - The two experts, according to their own statements, have spoken ; but I differ from their views. I believe that the Bill is drafted in a sensible, straightforward manner. It provides that the capital of the bank shall be £1,000,000, to be raised by the sale and issue of debentures. Meantime, the bank being a Commonwealth institution, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth is to advance it the moneys necessary to enable it to get a start, and to issue its debentures. The money so advanced, however, is to be repaid to the Commonwealth. The position is simplicity itself. The honorable member for Wentworth and the honorable member for Richmond say that these two matters should be provided for in the same clause. </para>

                        <para>- Money will be advanced by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to enable it to begin operations. Immediately the Governor of the bank has commenced operations, he will be able to sell debentures up to £1,000,000, and he can then repay to the Commonwealth the amount advanced to it prior to the issue of those debentures. The. two matters, instead of being embodied in one clause, are, in my opinion, properly dealt with in two clauses. The one clause deals with the capital of the bank and the other with the power of the Treasurer to advance the bank the money necessary to enable it to commence business and raise its capital by means of the sale and issue of debentures. </para>

I feel in duty bound once more to remind honorable members opposite that, although we are assured that the credit of the Commonwealth is far superior to that of any private institution or individual, the credit of other countries has suffered reverses. Issues of notes by the United States Government have been sold on the public market at a discount of, I dare say, from  75  to  85  per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- After hearing the discussion, I have come to the conclusion that there should be some provision for interest to be paid on any money advanced to the bank. The Prime Minister has told us that this advance is to give the bank a start; but I believe that in the case of an advance from the Treasury the bank should be placed in a position similar to that of any other business institution. While the Prime Minister holds that this advance is only for the initiation of the bank, the Governor of the bank may later on be of opinion that it requires a further advance; and there is no limitation to the operation of this clause. The advance of a million may not prove sufficient, possibly through some mismanagement of the Governor himself ; and yet he may hold that, under this clause, he is entitled to a further advance without any interest. I hold that on all such advances, whether long or short, interest should be paid. </para>

                    <para>.- If what the Prime Minister said in answer to me on clause  9  be correct, I cannot see why the money advanced should be repaid immediately the capital is obtained ; that is to say, I cannot see why the debt should not be immediately capitalized. Clause  30  provides for the repayment of this money out of a redemption fund to be created by placing half the profits of the bank to the credit of that fund. But the bank may not make a profit for two or three years, and it is more than likely that it will not. Under the circumstances the money which the Prime Minister says is only required to enable the bank to float its debentures and to get its so-called capital, ought to be immediately capitalized and liquidated so far as the Treasurer is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- That is the question, but I agree generally with the view that this clause is not to give the Treasurer permanent power to advance money to the bank. If the £1,000,000 proves not to be enough, Parliament should be asked to sanction a further advance by another Bill. As a matter of policy, I do not desire a provision to enable the Treasurer to advance further money without the authority of Parliament. I ask honorable members to pass the clause, and I undertake to see the Attorney-General in regard to it; and if the provision does not mean what I think it does, some amendment can be made. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that it means the opening of various offices. When the Prime Minister was moving the second reading of the Bill, he was asked whether interest would be payable on the advances made to start the bank, and he replied that it would if the advances were for a long period, but if they were only temporary it would be hardly worth while to provide for interest. He further said, however, that if the Opposition thought any principle was involved he would have some provision made, but that his opinion was that the advances would not be for more than a year. </para>

                        <para>-  I beg to differ from the honorable member. All I want to know is where I am in presenting this blank cheque. If the bank premises are to be in Collins-street, or in Martin-place, the sum required will be over .£1,000,000; and if the non-provision of this money will wreck the bank,' the position is worth the serious attention of the Committee. If I understand the Prime Minister, he intends this money for certain incidental expenses. </para>

I do not know a single commercial undertaking with which I am connected that has not down in the capital ledger the value of its premises. We are informed by some intelligent members of the Caucus, who have, no doubt, previously discussed this matter, that this money is to provide bank premises, and yet we are told, also, that if we ask the bank to bear that expenditure out of the £"1,000,000 we shall wreck the institution !

He was not sent here to hold his Parliament upstairs, and to hold his peace downstairs, but rather to say exactly what is in his mind. This clause appears to rae misty and vague, and  1  desire to discover what it means. The Prime Minister would do well to consider the propriety of taking this money from the proceeds of the debentures, so that when we are capitalizing the bank we shall know that it means £1,000,000, and not that amount plus a sum which the Treasurer is authorized to advance, and which the bank is to repay in the dim and distant future, when it starts to make profits. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause raises the whole question as to whether the government of the bank is to be by one man or by some combination of officials. In any case there are provisions in the measure which go to show that of necessity there must be somewhere in the background a controlling authority. If we add together the various powers with which, in different portions of the Bill, that controlling authority is to be endowed, it will be discovered that there is another authority, which is the Government of the day- </para>

                        <para>- The Government of the day will exercise a very great but undefined control over even the Governor of the bank, who in other portions of the measure appears to be endowed with almost despotic authority. The Governor and the  Deputy  Governor are to have 'such powers and to perform such authorities " as are prescribed by this Act or the regulations." To this Act I shall shortly draw attention; to the regulations I cannot, because we have not seen them, but they will or can be framed and authorized by the Government quite irrespective of Parliament, and in the absence of Parliament. We have, therefore, the powers and duties partly outlined in this measure, and capable of being indefinitely added to or altered by regulations outside this House. That is in clause 14. In clause 23 the consent of the Treasurer is required before establishing a London branch, or branches in other places beyond the Commonwealth. In clause 24 the approval of the Treasurer is required to appoint any person to act as attorney of the bank. Clause 32 is important. Under clause 53 the Governor arranges with the Minister of any Department in order to obtain the services of any officers for his purposes. But 64 is the important clause, under which the Governor-General, which means Ministers, may make regulations " not inconsistent with this Act prescribing all matters required or permitted to be prescribed or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act," and in particular for certain provisions as to the stock of the bank, and matters incidental thereto. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly; but if the occasion required one could show what a. skeleton this Bill is in relation to these powers. The limitations, if they can be called such, which are imposed by the Bill relate for the most part to non-essentials that could not be dealt with in any other way, or to matters which are not of immediate importance. As a matter of fact, I am not exaggerating when I say that this last clause practically throws the reins on the horse's neck. Sofar as we are concerned as a Parliament, we throw the reins on the neck of the Government, and the Government can take the bank and the Governor pretty well anywhere they please. A very large authority is necessary, but while, under the terms of the Bill, the Governor is practically the sole responsible person - the  deputy  taking his place under certain circumstances - and it is understood that he is free from political influence, at the same time the power of regulation given by the Bill is quite sufficient to show that the Governor of the bank after all in many cases will not be the real authority. The neal authority will be found in the Government of the day. The Government have that power; most Governments would exercise it. Putting that view, with some diffidence, as my own opinion, I find myself greatly supported and strengthened by the interpretation of the Prime Minister himself, when he was expounding the Bill on the first occasion to the House. He pointed out very frankly, from the very first paragraph of his speech, that this will be a bank belonging to the people, and directly managed by the people's own agents - they being obviously the Ministry of the day. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind the phrase is susceptible of only one meaning. It was intended to convey that really the reins were in the hands of Parliament, and that the Government of the day would exercise the driving power, subject, of course, to Parliament. The Prime Minister then went on to say that the Governor would, in some respects, have an autocratic position, but that he was not as autocratic as he appeared, because - </para>

                <para class="block">From these passages it is clear that the Prime Minister points to Parliament as exercising supreme authority - the authority of a board of directors. He refers to the exercise of the legislative power. But it is also evident, from the series of statements quoted, that he regards Ministers as the active agents of Parliament in this relation, and, more especially when Parliament is not sitting, as the persons responsible for the control of this institution, as well as for every other Government Department. </para>
                <para>Consequently, in the appointment of a Governor, with the attendant risks of one-man rule, you have that one-man rule modified by the control of the Government of the day while it has a majority while Parliament is sitting, and always during the recess. Is that the form of government from which the best results are to be expected in a financial institution whose responsibilities are as varied and business as fluctuating in its character as those of every bank? Another illustration pf Ministerial control occurred when, in reply to the interrogation - </para>

                <para class="block">The regulations under this Bill are, for all practical purposes, unlimited. They have to be read with the rest of the Bill, where restriction operates only in a few directions as any check upon the regulating power. The power to make regulations, and also rules, whether Parliament is sitting or not, is in itself a very important authority, which will no doubt be often exercised by the Government of the day. </para>
                <para>In the circumstances, the question for honorable members is : "Is this the best possible government which we can devise for the institution in which we are going to embark so many of our fortunes?" Without that personal experience which other honorable members are able to claim, I venture to think that the addition of  a  certain number of qualified impartial and independent directors, either to act as advisers to the Governor, the final voice remaining always with him, or, following the usual model of the private bank, exercising joint authority with him, and capable of restraining him with certain restrictions, would strengthen the institution. The Committee is called upon to decide, before passing away from this clause, whether the bank shall be managed by an independent Governor, or whether the Governor shall be supported by two or three independent advisers, or whether he shall be the head of a board, instead of the whole and sole authority. </para>

                        <para>- If a board chooses to trust its manager, that is another thing. With a board of directors and a  chairman,  you have the advantage of both systems. In any case, the Governor should have the support of an advisory board; though I have an open mind as to whether the members of the board should have the status of bank directors, the Governor being their  president  or  chairman,  and capable of being outvoted. The clause provides for placing absolute trust in one man; but there is no certainty that we shall be able to find a man so strong in body, so healthy in mind, and so well-informed, that we can put our trust in him. A man clothed with the despotic authority vested in the Governor might be tempted to take the bit in his teeth, and it would be difficult to deal with a capable man when Ministers thought he was exceeding the margin of safety. It seems to me that the provisions of the Bill under which we trust the government of the bank to one man, and, at. the same time, give supreme authority to the Administration in power to make regulations and rules, will bring about a less stable control than the well-wishers of the institution desire. </para>

A departmental official would be appointed an agent of the bank for the sake of economy. He would not act solely for the bank, but would do the bank's business in conjunction with his departmental work.

We desire the bank to be absolutely independent of political influence, which certainly will not be exercised by the Labour party. If there is any way in which clause 64, which empowers the Governor-General to make regulations, can be tightened up, we are willing to consider an amendment. The case made by the Leader of the Opposition has broken down. He has abandoned one clause after another. </para>

                        <para>- If we could present to the House to-night the gentleman whom we propose to appoint as Governor of the bank, he tells me that he would be able to say whether or not he is in favour of one-man control. I am in a better position. I have been impelled by my own reasoning to the conclusion that control by one man is better than control by any number of men. That is the conviction at which the Government have arrived. No body of men could dogmatize on the question of whether the bank should be controlled by one, two, or three men. But, assuming that we decided to have a Board of three, where  should we obtain the members of that Board? It has to be remembered that this is to be a Commonwealth Bank, differently situated from any other bank of which we know. It is to be a bank owned solely by the people, and to be conducted in the interests of the people. A Board of directors for such a bank would, however, necessarily consist of men interested in other financial concerns. That is obvious. Men who were worthy of a position on the directorate would have banking experience, and in nine cases out of ten would have interests in other concerns of a like kind. </para>

                        <para>- Although they gave honest service, they would still be at that obvious disadvantage. That is one side of the question. But supposing we abandoned the idea of bringing in practical men from outside, and constituted a Board consisting of officers of the bank, what would be the position ? If the Board consisted of three men, it would comprise the Governor, the Deputy-Governor, and the officer next in authority. As the result of this, the Governor himself might be outvoted, and the policy of the bank determined by two of his subordinate officers. Whilst a Board of that kind might be able to conduct a bank, it would not be able to carry it on as well as would a single Governor, absolute and responsible. There is yet another line of reasoning that may appeal to honorable members, and it is that we might have a Governor and a  Deputy  -Governor, and also a number of inspectors, independent of the Governor, with power to report to the Treasurer, or the Minister administering the Act, as to the state of the bank's affairs. In that case, the Minister would know what the Governor did not, and he would be asked to decide between the reports made privately to him by the inspectors and the policy of the Governor. In that way political influence would become rampant. Immediately we allowed any appeal from an officer who was not the Governor to the Minister administering the Act, the Governor would be absolutely at the mercy of that Minister. What kind of man are we likely to appoint as general manager of the bank? What kind of salary are we likely to offer him ? Both the man and the salary attaching to his office must be first class. </para>

                        <para>- It was an impertinence on the part of the press to publish the statement that he was an applicant for the position. Surely a man may come down here to open a branch of his own bank,, and, whilst here, have a conversation with a few old friends, without such a suggestion being made in regard to him. I do not wish any one to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ralstonis</inline> not one of the biggest men in the Australian banking world, but those who know him know that he is not available for this position. That", however, is by the way. The man to be appointed Governor of the Commonwealth Bank should have Australian banking experience. Indeed, it would be useless to select a man who is not an Australian banker. Then, again, the man who will undertake this work will have a fairly good knowledge of what the position really means. He will know very well that if he fails, his honour as a business man will be affected, and his future position in the banking world will be absolutely worthless. That is the purely personal, selfish side of the matter. If he fails, he will be lost in his profession, and will be almost an outcast. Then, amongst all men of wit, knowledge, and experience, there is always the ambition ' to succeed, and, having regard to all these circumstances, I think we are likely to get the best services from one man of ability. I do not intend to enlarge further upon the point ; and, as I am not anxious that the Committee should come to "a division on the question to-night, if the Leader of the Opposition thinks that it should be further discussed, I shall move that progress, be reported. </para>
