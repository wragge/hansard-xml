            <para>The public are not inconvenienced in obtaining postal notes or money orders owing to inadequate space at Ocean House, Moore-street, such space being ample and commodious. Occasionally temporary congestion arises when a large number of the public clamour for immediate attention, and, in order to minimize this, a redistribution of the tellers has just been effected. A rearrangement and extension of the counter accommodation lias also been determined on, and when this is completed it is expected that- the accommodation and attendance will be adequate foi all demands. </para>

I paid particular attention to the purely: local aspect of the question, but to-day I shall direct attention to a wider horizon, and ask honorable members to consider the matter as one of national importance. The sale of intoxicating liquors within the precincts of this House affects not only honorable members and others who have access to the refreshment rooms, but also the citizens of Melbourne, the electors of Victoria, and the people of the whole Commonwealth. No question within the realm of politics more deeply concerns the nation than this matter of the use of intoxicating liquors.

          <para>The letter is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> R. Francis, General Secretary. These letters, together with over a hundred telegrams and letters upon the same subject that I received last year, show that there are outside this House a large number of people who are looking at this question from the national point of view, and are not merely concerned with its local aspect. I was rather interested last year in the public notice given to my motion, and particularly pleased with some comments made by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> I had the honour to draw from that newspaper a comparison between my own attitude and that of the late Right Honorable W. E. Gladstone, who was described by Disraeli as being  inr  toxicated with the exuberance of his own verbosity. The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> went on to point out how intemperate  1  was in my language, how extravagant I was. in. my illustrations, and how unfair I was to the members of this Parliament. I explained when I introduced this motion last session, however, that, anything I might say with regard to it would have- no reflection on, and no personal application to, the members of this Parliament. I repeat that statement today. I propose to discuss this question free from any personal application, and wish only to ask honorable members to realize that, since we are charged with the national&#39; affairs of Australia, and concerned with- those things which are for the welfare of the Commonwealth, we cannot ignore o\ar responsibility by refusing to consider what would be at least the moral effect of our action, in prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in the- Parliamentary Refreshment-rooms, and upon the whole question of the sale of intoxicating liquors throughout Australia. In order that honorable members and the public generally may not imagine that I arn. a lone voice crying in the wilderness regarding the viciousness. of the liquor traffic, the degrading, and debasing effects of the use of alcohol, and the national waste and the national loss, both in money and in lives,, that result from this traffic - in order that honorable members may realize that I am supported in my attitude of uncompromising hostility to the traffic - I propose, to make a few quotations from statements made by persons in. all walks of life in regard to this question. I begin with a quotation from a speech made by the late Queen Victoria,, when addressing some South African chiefs at Windsor in 1895 - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am glad to see the Chiefs. . . . I approve of the provision excluding strong drink from their country. I feel strongly in this matter, and am glad to see that the Chiefs have determined to keep so great a curse from the people. </para>

            <para>The. friends of the saloon-keepers denounce their opponents for&#39; not treating the saloon business like any other. The best answer to this is that the business is not like any other business, and that the actions of the. saloon-keepers themselves conclusively prove this to be the case. The business tends to produce criminality in the population  at  large and law-Breaking among the  saloon keepers  themselves. When the liquor men are allowed- to do as they wish-, they are sure to debauch not only the body social, but the body political also. The most powerful saloon-keeper controlled the politicians and the police, while the latter, in turn, terrorized and blackmailed all other saloonkeepers. If the American people do not control it, it will&#39; control them. </para>

Imagine, if by some reasonable wise legislation, we could diminish the facility of recourse to the public-house, what a large proportion of these scores of millions spent on drink would be diverted from the liquor trade, and flow over to other trades and industries. All trades would benefit ; more food would be purchased, and better kinds of food ; more clothing and more furniture ; more education would be given to the children, and better kind of education. </para>

Athletes, for instance, invariably became total abstainers for the time being. ... It was part of his duty to sit on the Bench and hear all kinds of trouble .discussed in&#39; the cases which came before him. He had there discovered that drinking in excess was productive of an immense proportion of the trouble and the crime afflicting our nation, and disgracing more or less the national flag. &#39; He noticed in further confirmation of that view that the Posmaster General had stated that intemperance was responsible for 35 per cent, of the dismissals and 66 per cent, of the loss of good conduct stripes in connexion with the Post Office. The experience of all departments of life was in the same direction. </para>

          <para>National greatness did not depend upon the size of our armies and our fleets only. The country that was the most righteous was the greatest.&#39; And it was because the drink traffic tended to hinder the realisation of that ideal that they of the working-class movement, especially the socialist clement in that movement, were bound to be the most pronounced in their opposition to the success of democracy. There was no man who was engaged in public work, whatever his position in politics, who could fail to be impressed with the magnitude of the evil of intemperance. There must be differences of opinion concerning the question as to whether alcoholic liquors should be used at all, but there could be no question about the terrible evil which drunkenness inflicted upon our nation. Those best acquainted with the Labour movement would bear him out that the strongest ally there was on the side of reaction was intemperance. It made every movement more difficult, and tended lo thwart many a well-meant effort. </para>

          <para>The traffic is largely responsible for murder, suicide, immorality, and petty crimes; it is poisoning the bodies of the children before they are born ; it sends thousands to the grave before they have learned to lisp ; it gives to tens of thousands who survive a shattered constitution and weakened will; it predisposes them to every form of illness; it is destroying the capacity for motherhood, and weakening the natural instincts of the mother. It wastes all this human life, and it involves an incalculable loss of social&#39; wealth through physical inefficiency, mental incapacity, and loss of self-respecting ambition. It wastes the value of the lost time and expense through sickness, and the maintenance of prisons, police courts, homes, and asylums due to drink. Drink is, in fact, one of the most destructive evils, destroying mind and body, which curses the human race. </para>

            <para>Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigour, manhood in its strength, and age in its weakness. It breaks the father&#39;s heart, bereaves the doting mother, extinguishes- natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning age in sorrow to the grave. It  produces  weakness, not strength;, sickness, not health ; death,, not life. It makes wives widows ; children orphans; fathers fiends; and all of them paupers and beggars. It feeds rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites, cholera, imports pestilence, and embraces consumption. It covers, the land with, idleness, misery, and crime. It fills your gaols, supplies your almshouses, and demands your asylums. It engenders controversies, fosters quarrel&#39;s, and&#39; cherishes riots. It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to your scaffolds. It is the lifeblood of the gambler, the element of the burglar, the prop of the: highwayman, and. the support of the midnight incendiary. It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems the blasphemer. It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honours infamy. It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue, and slanders innocence. It incites the- father to butcher his helpless offspring, helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the  child  to grind the  paracidal  axe. It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God, and despises heaven. It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine. It degrades the citizen, debases the legislator, dishonours statesmen, and disarms the patriot. It brings shame, not honour; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery, not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays reputation, and wipes out national honours, then curses the world and laughs at its ruin. </para>

The saloon has absolutely no respect for law. It obeys only when it must. This&#39; is true under any and all conditions. An evil tree cannot be made good by building a fence around it, nor can access to that tree be prevented by limiting the number of the entrances.

In that column of some  30,000  men, the first who dropped out -were not the tall men, or the short men, or- the big men, or the little .men - but the drinkers, and they dropped out is clearly as if they had been labelled with a big letter on their backs. . . . There is a great desire on the part of all young men to be &#34; fit.&#34; A young man cannot be fit if he takes alcohol. By no possibility can he want it.

            <para>In my experience people that are total abstainers in the Colony enjoy better health, and have a lower mortality than those that are not abstainers. There is a wide-spread popular belief that some stimulant is required in the tropics, especially by people that have in a cooler climate been accustomed to it. This will not stand the test of experience. It is a matter that any one not a total abstainer can prove for himself in a month. I have not known a missionary that was of intemperate habits ; but it is easy to see that the missionary that has no alcoholic stimulant with his meals is healthier than he that has. The principle applies to all residents in the country, but it is easier to see in the case of the missionaries than among other classes, because their habits and practice are more regular and uniform. The missionaries that as a class are total abstainers are the healthier, and stand exposure better than others. The man that is a total abstainer bears very much better the onset of fever than the man that is not; and he is also less liable to other diseases. </para>

            <para>The use of alcoholic drinks is prohibited during working hours. -Mention of the injuries which the misuse of alcoholic drink causes the physical and intellectual powers of the employees has repeatedly been made. It has been proved, not only in railway service but in all other branches of labour, that the use of alcohol lowers capacity for effective work. </para>
            <para>We have, therefore, strictly forbidden drinking during working hours, and now call attention afresh to this regulation. This prohibition includes all employees, watchmen, and common labourers, and is aimed not only against stronger drinks, but against all kinds of beer and wine. The bringing of such drink to work is forbidden. The violation of this prohibition will be punished with fine. Second offence dismissal. </para>

            <para>Next to the urbanisation of the people . . . the question of drink occupies a prominent place among the causes of degeneration. The close connexion between the craving for drink and bad housing, bad feeding, a polluted and depressing atmosphere, long hours of work in over heated and often ill-ventilated rooms . . . is too self-evident to need demonstration ; nor unfortunately is the extent of the evil open to dispute..... Drinking habits among women of the working classes are certainly growing, with consequences extremely prejudicial to the care of their offspring, not to speak of the possibility of their children being born permanently disabled..... Evidence was placed before the Committee showing that in abstinence is to be sought the source of muscular vigour and activity. </para>

          <para>One immediate result of the publication of that report was that over forty towns and cities in England spent money placarding the walls and hoardings with warnings in regard to alcohol and physical degeneracy. That movement originated, I believe, in France, where the people, aroused by the enormous decrease in the physical vitality of the nation, particularly among the young men, placarded Paris and other French cities and towns on the question/ Here is an extract from a placard  dis-played  in Paris in 1902 by order of the French Government -  &#171;*Alcoholism causes a great variety of diseases, many of them most deadly - paralysis, insanity, disorders of the stomach and of the liver, and dropsy. It is one of the most frequent causes of consumption. It complicates and renders more serious every acute illness : typhoid fever, pneumonia, or erysipelas, which would be mild in a sober individual, will rapidly kill the alcoholic. </para>
          <para class="block">That movement also extended to Australia, and, I believe, the city of Ballarat has the honour of being the first in the Commonwealth to warn its citizens of the dangers of alcoholism. I have here a placard which has been distributed in Queensland, dealing with the proceedings of the French supervising Council of Public Aid in 1902, and giving extracts from the posters put up in the French cities by the French Government, and from the posters put up in British cities. I shall not read this placard, but will simply mention that it was submitted to the mayors of a number of Queensland towns, and was signed by the following: - H. Thompson, Mayor of Brisbane; Andrew Gillespie, Mayor, South Brisbane; R. Ruddell, Mayor, Bundaberg; Walter G.  Amrose,  Mayor, Gympie ; J. F. Bergin, Mayor, Toowong; Thomas T.

            <para>Liquor does more harm to body, brain and soul than anything else on earth. Liquor is man&#39;s greatest enemy because : It robs him of health, happiness, home and honour. It turns a good man into a bad brother, a bad son,  a  bad husband, a bad father, a bad workman, and a bad master. It professes to make a mam strong, but makes him really so weak that he cannot stand up straight or walk straight when under its influence. It professes to make a man happy, but gives him a headache and  a  remorseful heartache after. It professes to make a man bright and smart, but makes him act like a madman instead. It makes a man cruel and heartless towards his loved ones, and also towards himself, as nothing else could possibly do. Liquor has been the means of blasting millions of most promising young lives, and destroying the happiness of thousands of homes. If yon are wise and desire to live a happy and useful life, please make a solemn vow that you will have_ nothing whatever to do with that dangerous liquid fire and poison called &#34; Liquor.&#34; </para>

The last occasion on which I did continuous work of the kind was some years ago, when I was occupied for two or three weeks in excavating deep trenches in heavy boulder clay to explore some Roman foundations. M&#60;day&#39;s digging was always at least eight hours&#39; long (usually more), my hands were kept in good condition by alcohol applied externally, and when at the end of the day I returned home I went to a refreshing tea, and did not narcotise myself in the public-house on the road. </para>

          <para class="block">I have also some rather interesting statements on the question of how the capacity for hard physical toil is affected by the use of drink. An immense work is at present going on at the Barren Jack Reservoir, now being constructed in New South Wales, and no intoxicants are permitted on the areas of the works. With regard to the Panama Canal, the following has been published : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The work of making a great canal from Panama to Colon, uniting the Pacific with the Atlantic, was commenced in 1879, but suspended in 1889. The district was called &#34; the white man&#39;s grave,&#34; owing to the fearful death rate. The open saloon for the sale of intoxicating liquors to the workmen was considered by many one of the causes of this evil. In 1904 the United States Government purchased the property for $40,000,000 (^8,000,000), and by an International treaty agreed to construct the canal at a further cost of $140,000,000 (^28,000,000). In recommencing the work the canal commissioners determined to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors along the whole route, except at Panama and Colon, where the saloons were already licensed under the laws of the Republic. The results have been most advantageous. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Johnston, K.C.B., says: &#34;The whole of the canal zone (10 miles on either side of the canal banks) is &#39; teetotal.&#39; No alcohol is sold by the canal commissioners at its hotels or boarding houses, and the general result of these stern measures - the improvement in health and the absence of crime - amply justifies this anti-alcohol policy. Of course, there still remain some Americans (and some Britons) who kill themselves with alcohol if it can possibly be managed, and so &#34; alcoholism &#34; emanating from the grog stores at Panama and Colon accounts for a few deaths among the employes - just enough to show one what a pandemonium might rage here in the little army of 26,000 men but for the prohibition policy of the Canal Commissioners. </para>

            <para>J regret to have to say that excess of drink beyond all doubt or question, is either the cause or the object of a large proportion of the crime of our community. Much of the gravest crime is directly traced to the influence on or to the mental disablement produced by alcoholic liquor in those who commit it. On the other hand, a great deal of less grave crime is committed with the object chiefly of obtaining such liquor. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Constant observation has founded in my mind the settled belief that the use of intoxicating liquors is the prime factor in the production of crime. There are other vices and passions which occasionally tend to crime, but even there drink will very generally be found awakening and arousing them to destructive energy. In almost every crime of violence the drunkenness of the prisoner and his victim either urged on or tempted the criminal to the commission of the offence. I have further a firm conviction that if the women of this country would refuse  to  sanction the use of intoxicating drinks in their homes, and on festive  occasions everywhere, and if they would furnish a constant example of abstinence themselves, they would bring a priceless blessing to their country, and secure the eternal gratitude of the future generations of Australia. </para>

          <para>One startling fact is the loss of life entailed by the sale of intoxicating drink. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norman</inline> Ker estimates that yearly 120,000 deaths are directly attributable to drink; and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Richardsonsays</inline> that in ten years in the United States drink creates 200,000 widows and 1,000,000 orphans. Life assurance tables give very striking evidence in this connexion. There are fourteen British life assurance companies who have special provisions all in favour of the total abstainer; and a rather interesting statement was made lately in regard to the Australian Mutual Provident Society, with which we are particularly concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Teece, the actuary of that society, has, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Rechabite -</inline> taken the favorable experience of the A.M. P. and compared it with the temperance section of the United Kingdom Temperance and General Provident institution with this result :  - Actual deaths among select A.M. P. lives, 8,259; according to the British Temperance experience these would have been 7,607; excess in A.M. P. 652. The inference is that if all the A.M. P. policy-holders had been abstainers there would have been 652 fewer deaths among them ; that their wonderfully low mortality would have been lower still. But this is only half the truth. If the abstainers in the A.M. P. were in a separate section - as they ought to be - and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> had been able to compare moderate drinkers by themselves with abstainers, the con trast would have been much more striking. The many abstainers in the A.M. P. have helped to keep down the average death rate.

          </para>
          <para class="block">There are two or three interesting comparisons which I wish to base on the figures just given. In the first place, let me compare the total value of the output of breweries and distilleries, and the number of employes engaged therein, with the value of the output and the employment given in a number of other industries. That is best shown by the following table :- </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="061331191111024_15_1.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">Let me now give the output of and wages paid in breweries and distilleries compared with the output of and wages paid in several other industries. It is as follows : - </para>
          <para class="block">There is one worker employed for every ^252 spent in hats and caps, for every ^517 spent in furniture, for every ,&#163;325 spent in boots and shoes, and for every &#163;2,231 spent in alcohol, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> the great brandy manufacturer, has stated that with 1,000 men he could drown the world in spirits. The annual expenditure on alcohol has been estimated roughly at &#163;15,000,000. In the following table  1  have bracketed together the industries supplying the things that we eat, the industries supplying the things that we wear, and I have made a third group of the saw-mills and agricultural implement factories. Each of these groups of industries is compared with the breweries and distilleries. </para>
          <para class="block">From the Budget speech delivered by the Treasurer last week, I have ascertained that the expenditure on all the Commonwealth Departments for 1911-12 will not exceed &#163;r 1,1.45, 064, while there is to be expended on the Navy ,&#163;1,515,000, and- on new works &#163;2,791,365, a total of &#163;15,451.429, which is only equal to the annual expenditure on intoxicating liquors in Australia. To make another comparison : The estimated expenditure on old-age pensions is &#163;2,235,927 j on defence, including the construction of the Fleet, ammunition factories/ new works, and departmental expenses, &#163;3,974,515.; 011 posts, telephones, and telegraphs. &#163;5.127,160; a total of &#163;11,337,602, or &#163;3,662.-398 less than the annual drink bill of Australia. Tlie total increase in the value of land, buildings, plant, and machinery in all the industries of Australia from 1903 to 1909 was &#163;14,999,176. whereas the drink bill for the period totalled &#163;84,000,000. While in 1.908 the estimated expenditure on alcohol was &#163;15,000.000, the money spent on bread was &#163;7.250,000, on sugar &#163;3,750,000, on lea &#163;2,000,000, and on education &#163;2,214,812, the four items only about equalling the expenditure on alcohol- The expenditure on railways and tramways was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;h</inline> 769:383, or only half what was spent on alcohol. Without this expenditure on alcoholic liquors, we could carry our people and their products free on the railways, and let them live rent free, too. Our expenditure on telegraphs and telephones is &#163;3,827, 160, but while we are thus starving an important Department because of the difficulty of raising all the revenue needed, we are squandering &#163;15,000,000 on drink.

          <para>I sincerely regret that the Government do not recognise the advisableness of granting the inquiry for which the honorable member for North Sydney asks, for I am fully convinced that no section of the Public Service is worse considered in the matter of pay and conditions than is the Permanent Defence Force of Australia. The mover of the motion asks only for an inquiry into the pay and allowances of the warrant, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Permanent Military Forces of the Commonwealth. For the moment I cannot understand why he should not have included the commissioned officers of the Defence Forces in his motion, so as to embrace the pay and allowances of the Forces as a whole. I presume that he felt some reluctance to move in that direction in view of the fact that he has, perhaps, friends or relatives in the service. I should be very happy to see this inquiry all-embracing in its scope, and with the permission of the mover, and the concurrence of the House, I should like to move that the proposed inquiry embrace the pay and allowances, not only of the warrant, non-commissioned officers, and men, but also of the commissioned officers. The pay of the non-commissioned officers and men has been fully and clearly dealt with by the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

              <para>- I would rather have part than lose the whole, and if the proposal to extend the inquiry to the commissioned officers is defeated, the balance of the motion will have my most cordial support. It seems almost invidious to propose to consider the pay and allowances of every section but one of the service. To so restrict the inquiry might suggest that this House was merely seeking popularity for the observance of a democratic principle, or something of the sort, when really, I take &#34; it, what is desired by the mover of the motion, and the House as a whole, is that we shall go thoroughly into the whole question of whether or not the Commonwealth Defence Force is adequately remunerated for its services. </para>

              <para>- The general living rate, as a whole, has increased. The position is so serious that the Government of New South Wales have had to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole subject. There are many causes for the increase. In our efforts to facilitate labour getting a fair remuneration for its services, through the medium of either Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts, we have undoubtedly put up, to a certain extent, the cost of commodities. I am not putting the matter controversially, and do not give that as the only reason for the increase. If a man receiving higher wages in one industry has to pay more for the necessaries of life owing to the wages being put up in the industries which produce those necessaries, his position is not so prejudiced, because his wages have gone up with the increase ; but a man in the Government service, receiving a fixed pay, feels the pinch all the time. The difficulty all through in regard to the Permanent Military Forces is that, although the present pay and allowances might have been a. fair thing in 1900, it will require a good deal of argument to satisfy us that they are adequate to the extent of the services rendered, and to the cost of living to-day. If wages in general employment go up, and the cost of living as a whole rises, the pay and allowances of the Public Service of the Commonwealth ought to go up in equal proportions. </para>

There are the honorable member for Newcastle, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and the Honorary Minister, from the Ministerial side; and there are the honorable member for Franklin, the honorable member for Parkes, the mover and myself, from this side. I cannot see why the Ministry should refuse to appoint so impartial a Committee. I had hoped that the statement which emanated from the present Postmaster-General was only the expression of his own individual opinion, and that the Government would see the desirability of letting the House know, through an impartial body, what is a fair rate of wages and allowances in this service. There are enough strong Government supporters nominated on the Committee to see that recommendations for increases in pay, &#38;c, are not made greater than the Government would perhaps like. </para>

That is a curious anomaly which might well be inquired into in this connexion, although I do not think it is nearly so important as the inquiry into the pay and allowances of the non-commissioned officers and men.

            <para>. - I second the amendment. It seems incredible that the Government should offer any objection to so simple a proposal as that now before the House. After all, the Committee is asked for only with a view to inquiring into the pay and allowances of those connected with the military service. The Committee may make recommendations to the Government, but the Government alone have the right and power to say whether they shall be given effect to, or whether the present conditions shall remain. The mover of the motion desires to ascertain whether the rates of pay in the sections of the service specified are commensurate with-the cost of living in the community, and adequate for the duties they have to perform. Surely it is not the desire of the Government, or of the party supporting them, or, I hope, of any honorable member, that our military service should be paid less well than any other branch of the Commonwealth service. If these men are underpaid, it is our duty, in looking after their interests, and the interests of the community generally, and in enforcing the general wish of the people of this country, to see that their wages are increased to a proper and reasonable standard, according to the nature of the duties they have to perform. It has been said that the junior officers in the Australian service have a higher rate of pay than that which prevails in. Great Britain. But it is more apparent than real when we look at all the facts. A com parison of the rates for certain grades shows that a company sergeant-major in the Imperial service receives 6s., and in the Australian service- 6s. 3d. ; a- sergeant gets 5s. and 5s. 6d. respectively ; a corporal, 4s. and 4s. 6d. respectively ; a bombardier, 3s. <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline> and 4s. 3d. respectively ; and a gunner, 2s. 5d. and 4s. respectively. </para>

              <para>- The figures from which I am quoting are compiled by those within the service who should know something about the rates of pay, but I take no personal responsibility for their accuracy. Those who compiled them should be in a better position to speak with authority on these matters than we who are mere la ymen, without any inside knowledge of the workings of the Department. Although the figures indicate that a. slightly higher rate of pay prevails for those officers here, it is not in any way proportionate to the higher rates of pay prevailing in general outside occupations here as compared with Great Britain. I believe the pay of ordinary citizens  in the Commonwealth is no less than from 80 per cent, to something like 130 per cent, in some occupations greater than in Great Britain. If the rates of pay of those officers were increased in proportion to the difference in the cost of living, and the difference in wages as between citizens in Great Britain and Australia, I understand from the list which has been supplied to me that the pay of a company sergeant-major here would be 10s. od. instead of 6s. 3d. ; of a sergeant, 9s., instead of 5s. 6d. ; of a corporal, 7s. 2d., instead of 4s 6d. ; of a bombardier, 6s. 9d., instead of 4s. 3d. ; and of a gunner, 4s. 4d., instead of 4s. I do not say that those are the rates of pay that should prevail. That could be determined only after inquiry into all the circumstances. We should ascertain definitely what is a fair rate of pay for the services which these people perform for the Commonwealth in their military capacity, in the light of the cost of living, general rates of wages outside, and other vital considerations. It seems, from what we can learn so far, that the rates of pay in the permanent Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are very small as compared with those received by the Imperial Forces, when those conditions are taken into account. I do not know whether the utterance of the Postmaster-General on this subject Inst week was merely the expression of his own opinion, or was indicative of the attitude of the Government as a whole. If it was the latter, I sincerely trust the Government will reconsider their position in relation to the question, and at least allow a Select Committee to be appointed in order to ascertain all the facts. No harm can be done by an inquiry of this kind, and I can see no reasonable objection to the passage of the motion. </para>

            <para>. - I support the motion as proposed to be amended by the honorable member for Wentworth. The Government would be well advised to permit an inquiry of the kind into the whole question of the pay and emoluments of officers and men. I cannot see that any ill could result, but, rather, that a Select Committee would prove a great source of help to the Ministry in launching the new defence scheme. There are a great many readjustments required from various aspects of administration. For instance, a Select Committee could investigate the question whether a number of officers now performing civilian duties should be under the Defence authorities or under the Public Service Commissioner. At present, the control is divided, with consequent confusion. Since seven honorable members are to form the Committee, I suggest, having regard to the state of parties in the House, that it would be well if the Government party were given the odd man rather than that the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> should be as proposed in the motion. It is, in my opinion, a very proper thing that the Minister representing the Defence Department in this House should be a member of a Select Committee of this character, because he will be able to see that the Department is properly represented and its interests safeguarded. An inquiry of the kind would, I think, save the Ministry some unpleasant duties. Honorable members will have seen that, at Home,, the Postmaster-General has consented to a thorough inquiry into the staff arrangements of the whole Department ; this, in England, is considered to be no reflection on the Minister. </para>

              <para>- The point is that such an inquiry is held to tie no reflection on the Minister.; and, on more than one occasion, there have been inquiries by Commissions into the administration of the War Office. Very often, schemes -of reform are suggested, and taken advantage of by the Government, with good results to the </para>

          <para>Department, the country, and all concerned. If I thought that an inquiry of the kind would in the slightest degree embarrass the Minister, I should vote against the motion, but, as I say, I think the Government would be well advised to accept the proposal. It may mean the obtaining of information from the War Office ait Home; and if the Committee do not conclude their labours before the end of the session, they might, as is done frequently, both .here and at ,Home, be constituted a Royal Commission. There is a scheme for the payment of officers suggested in Lord Kitchener&#39;s recommendations, but I see no reference to that in the Estimates ; the whole matter would be better for an inquiry by an impartial body, such as that now suggested. </para>

            <para>. - I do not see that the Government have anything to fear from the motion now before us. I do not support the appointment of a Select Committee because I hope to obtain any political kudos thereby. While I cannot vote for the amendment to include officers in this inquiry, I think the subject ought to be probed to the very bottom. We have heard, on many occasions, that, in regard to pay, our forces do not compare favorably with other forces in the Empire, particularly those in the oversea Dominions; and I have no doubt that on this point valuable information could be obtained by a Select Committee. The military authorities regard themselves as quite immaculate when they get on to their little thrones in the different administrative offices throughout the Commonwealth; and this is the most difficult of all Departments to obtain any sound information from. The present PostmasterGeneral, when speaking as Honorary Minister some weeks ago, said that all the information contemplated in this motion could be obtained from die Department. My experience, however., is that, though the officials of the Department will give .the information asked for, they will give neither more nor less - they simply say &#34; Yes&#34; or &#34;No.&#34; If a private member desires to enter into details, a hurdle is always put up in front of Mm. When, some years ago, I assumed the task of helping to put defence matters in order, -my friends in Queensland told me that it was only a question of time when I would join she ranks of those who had set out on a similar mission of reform and had failed. Their words have come true---I am &#34; full up &#34; of it. One who spoke to me in that strain was the Prime Minister himself, and another was the Minister of External Affairs. The Prime </para>

If there is nothing to hide or fear, I ask the Prime Minister to accept the motion. </para>

              <para>- If a Select Committee be appointed, the members of it will boil down the information and present it to the Government and the country. When the Honorary Minister said that all the information desired could be got from the Department, the honorable member for North Sydney very wisely said, &#34; That is no good to me; I wish to have the information supplied by a Committee that will have some weight in the House.&#34; We are not content with the opinions of individual members expressed in academic discussion. The privatemembers&#39; business day is neither more nor less than a farce - it is a day to give us an opportunity to &#34;blow off steam.&#34; You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have for years known my opinions on military matters. If a Committee can bring fresh light to bear on the Department, it may allay a great deal of bad feeling, both in and out of the service. The Permanent Forces are the skeleton of our army ; the men who compose them are the instructors of the Citizen Forces, and will give stiffening in time of war. But however small our Permanent Force, it must be contented if we are to get the best work out of them. </para>

              <para>- If I did not think so, I would not support the motion. Last year, with the sanction of the Minister of Defence, the matters which have been referred to were discussed by members of the Forces, and a petition presented to the Minister and to every honorable member. But it went the way of all petitions - into the waste-paper basket. The more I think over the matter, the more certain I- am that a Select Committee should be appointed. We have entered upon a big defence policy, and it is not right or proper that our soldiers should be unfairly dealt with. We shall always have soldiers, so long as the world continues.

              <para>- I as honestly think that it is not. In my opinion, the Government should not consent to an investigation of the administration of the Defence Department by a Select Committee. If honorable members think that the Minister of Defence is not capable of making the necessary representations to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet of presenting the necessary proposals to Parliament to secure proper pay and conditions for the commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the permanent service, another sort of motion should be moved. The honorable member for North Sydney says that he has excluded commissioned officers from the scope of the Committee&#39;s inquiry, so that we may not suspect him of an ulterior motive, but the real question is, What is the proper course to pursue with a view to the proper administration of the Departments of government? If the Minister of Defence, whose term of office is not very long, has failed to do justice, an attack should be made on him in a different way. </para>

The present session will not be a long one, and the inquiry asked for could not be concluded before the prorogation. I am averse from having a Select Committee whose inquiry is unfinished converted into a Royal Commission, especially one appointed to obtain information which the Minister of Defence is able and willing to make available to honorable members, and I promise that it shall be made available to them. In that way, they can obtain as full a knowledge of the case as can be gained by the investigation of a Committee. No doubt, certain honorable members are ready to serve their country and their own opinions, but this is not the time for the proposed inquiry. </para>

              <para>- That may be so. But it is not reasonable to suppose that the inquiry could be finished before the prorogation. The Budget debate, which will be continued as soon as the Works and Buildings Estimates have been disposed of, will give every member an opportunity to ask any question he may wish to put to the Government, and I promise that all information asked for shall be given in as direct a fashion as possible. I cannot, of course, make myself acquainted with the details of administration in all the Departments, and have no personal knowledge of the remuneration of the Permanent Forces ; but no Minister has been more anxious to deal out substantial justice to the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of our Defence Forces than is my honorable colleague, the present Minister of Defence. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member will agree with me, at all events, that much has been done, and that our expenditure has been greatly increased. Much more is yet proposed to be done. It is easy for the honorable member for Parramatta to say that if he had remained in office he would have done this and that; but this Parliament will have to make up its mind as to what is to be expended on defence, and as to what extra taxation shall be raised to maintain our defences in an efficient state. All these matters hinge on the question now before us. If outstanding grievances can be pointed out, the Minister of Defence will look into them and make recommendations to the Cabinet ; and I, as head of the Government, will ask Parliament to remedy those grievances, even if extra taxation be necessary to allow that to be done. During all the campaigns on this question I have never hesitated to say that our national defence system must be efficient; that those engaged in it must be properly equipped and dealt with fairly, and&#39; that the people who want that defence should be asked to pay for it. I appeal to honorable members not, at the very inception of a big scheme of national defence, to intervene with a Committee of Inquiry between the Minister and the Forces. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is one of the most active, energetic, and able Ministers of Defence we have ever had. Whilst the appointment of a Select Committee would not directly reflect upon him personally, it would weaken his position at the present time; and instead of strengthening- the position of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Service, it would, in my opinion, do them an injury. I am not going to say that an inquiry into matters of defence is unjustifiable in any circumstances, but such an inquiry ought not to be entered upon lightly, nor without full and deliberate consideration. I ask that this motion for a general investigation be not pressed. I cannot support it, and I do not think it is wise that the House should agree to it. </para>

              <para>- I am not suggesting that the right honorable member has been in any way neglectful, for I can well understand that his many duties make it impossible for him to be always in the chamber. But if he had had an opportunity to speak at an earlier stage of the debate, and had done so, I think he would  have cleared the air very considerably. I intend to support the Government, even if they go to the extent of resisting the proposal for the appointment of a Select Committee. It is to be regretted that the mover of the motion did not ask straight out for a Royal Commission. The  appointment  of a Select Committee at this stage of the session would be- useless. The Committee would lapse before anything could be done. As the honorable member for Maranoa has pointed out, if we are to have an inquiry, it must be of an exhaustive character. A Select Committee must either lapse at the end of the session, or be converted into a Royal Commission. </para>

              <para>- Not necessarily. A craftsman- - a carpenter, a blacksmith, or an engineer - certainly does not, of his own free will, remain in his own. particular trade; he does so, because he is receiving good wages ia it, or, because certain other circumstances compel him to do so.. There is a certain amount of pressure brought to bear upon- every man to follow his own trade, but the rank and file of our Permanent Forces, who are drawn largely from the labouring classes, are not bound to remain in the Forces. They can retire and do other labouring work.  </para>

              <para>- I am not here to advocate the unfair treatment of  any section of the community. Ali that I urge is. that, during this debate,, a strong, case has not been made out for the. appointment of a Select Committee against the. wish- of the Government. The debate will, I think, be a sufficient indication to. the Government that the House is of opinion that, if there are any grievances - and I believe there are - in connexion with our Defence Forces, the sooner the Minister removes them the better. There may be some grievances of a minor character, but any substantial grievance should, undoubtedly be removed. We have ample opportunities to discuss such matters without adopting the extreme- course we are asked&#39; to follow. Some honorable members opposite have sought to draw an analogy between the Postal  Commission  and that which we- are now asked to appoint. I fail to see any analogy. Military affairs are always looked upon as exceptional, since, in connexion with them, we have to deal with men who bear arms. Their position is totally different from that of postal employes. </para>

              <para>- I am not urging that those who bear arms should, because of that fact, be compelled to suffer grievances. The point of my argument is that the exceptional character of their work is such that we would not be justified in coming between them and the Government, unless a very strong- case were made out for action on our part. I agree with the honorable member for Maranoa that we should view very seriously any grievances under which our Military Forces suffer, for I am one of those who do not believe that the era of peace has yet arrived. We constantly hear that it is at hand; but I well remember hearing, as a boy, the statement that the Great Exhibition of 1851 was going to bring about an era of peace, and that the lion was going to lie down with the lamb. Modern history has falsified that prediction. Only a few years afterwards the British Empire was involved in a big war, and, as the honorable member for Maranoa has mentioned, a war is now being carried on by two other nations. The only element of doubt in regard to that war is whether or not another great Power thought of doing what Italy seized the opportunity to do. Whether it did or did not the opinion has been freely expressed, not only in Australia, but on the other side of the world, that it did. I appeal to honorable members to be very careful not to come between the Government and the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth in the way now proposed, until all other legitimate parliamentary means of securing redress of grievances have been exhausted. If the Government are prepared to resist the appointment of a Select Committee I shall support them, but I do not wish them to gather from my attitude that, if grievances on the part of members of our Defence Forces are repeatedly brought before Parliament, the time will not arrive when I shall be compelled, however reluctantly, to support an inquiry if I come to the conclusion that the Government are determined hot to remove the causes of dissatisfaction. </para>

            <para>. - I wish briefly to justify the vote that I intend to give on this motion. If I thought, for one moment, that the Select Committee asked for would have the desired result, I should support its appointment, but I have no confidence whatever in such a Committee. What will it do? It will simply inquire into this question at great cost to the country. Its report will be laid before Parliament, nothing will come of it, and the Minister will be able to shirk his responsibility. Cannot honorable members see the move? I am of opinion that it is simply a move to deal with the highly-paid officers. </para>

              <para>- Throughout the debate it has been so. It is questionable whether the figures that have been submitted are accurate. We repeatedly hear it stated outside the House that the lower-paid noncommissioned officers and the men in our Defence Forces are receiving such high pay that the best men are being attracted to the service. The proposed Committee, if appointed, will in bringing down their report to the House, forget all about those whom I should like to see receiving better pay - that is, the very lowly-paid men in the ranks. The honorable member for North Sydney knows very well that they will not get a rise. Why does not the honorable member be straight and say &#34; T want to get some kudos- &#34; </para>

              <para>- Most decidedly I will, but I am at a loss to know how the honorable member could understand my meaning before I completed the sentence. T have no confidence whatever in the mover of the motion. Why does he come here, just when the Minister of Defence is about to inaugurate a great system laid down by officers brought from abroad, and spring upon the House a motion that will put honorable members in a most awkward position by compelling them to take sides on a question that the majority of them know nothing about? In my opinion it is merely - and if I am out of order when I say it I will withdraw - an electioneering dodge. If that is out of order I will withdraw it, but it is in my mind, and I wish to give utterance to it. </para>

              <para>- I said nothing of the sort. I am not going to take the responsibility which certain honorable members would like to throw upon me. Coming as I do from an electorate in which a number of my supporters are military men, I want to explain to those gentlemen the attitude I am taking up now, and my reasons for it. In the first place, I have every confidence in the Minister of Defence ; but what self-respecting Minister would remain in the position while a Committee of irresponsibles from this House dictated to him how he should run his Department? I am opposing the motion, and until it is shown that the Minister of Defence has failed as a Minister, I shall not support the appointment of any such Committee. That has not yet been shown, and not an argument has been brought forward to show us why we should vote for the motion. Honorable members have not brought forward a specific case to show where any particular body of men are paid very low wages or are suffering to any extent. There may be individual cases. I have had individual cases brought under my own notice, but I believe that, given time, the Minister of Defence will rectify those grievances. He has been, however, only a few months in office, and the same thing applies to exMinisters of Defence. What we have suffered from in the past in regard to our Military Forces has been the short tenure of office of the various Defence Ministers. The present Minister has had no time to remedy these grievances. Members who have been a long time in this House, and should know better, come down to support propositions which would involve the country in enormous expense, and for what purpose? Can any honorable member show me where a Select Committee of this House has yet done any good ? When a Minister or member wants to throw responsibility on to somebody else he gets a Select Committee appointed. </para>

              <para>- That cost  &#163;600,  and I am looking for something to come out of it, but it has not come out of it yet. No good result will come out of this Committee if it is appointed. I want to tell the poor fellows outside that the motion is simply put up to make them believe that a certain section of the House want to do something for them. That has been my experience in the past of this sort of thing, and I have had enough of it. Some honorable members have said, &#34; If we get this Committee, much- good must accrue,&#34; while another section say, &#34; There may not be anything done at all.&#34; The honorable member for Lang admitted that there might not be anything done - that there might not be any necessity to give an increase of wages. Are this House and the country to be put to the expense and trouble of this Select Committee for the purpose of finding out that nothing need be done? I have always thought that honorable members had a good case when they came to the House and asked for the appointment of a Committee. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member knows more about moisture in butter than about the Military Forces. Neither he nor I can know the cost, but I am surprised when I look at the cost of Royal Commissions and Select Committees. I hope that when -honorable members move for the appointment of any such body, they will have some sound reasons to give the House. Why &#34;do they not point out the glaring cases, and show where they exist? I happen to be the representative of a military centre, and not one of the Military Forces has approached me about any grievances under which they suffer as a body. If they did approach me, I should try to get the trouble remedied for them. If I could not do so in any other way, I should, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, point out the grievances which the men were suffering under, and I should expect the House to assist me to get the wrong righted. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh very clearly put it, we are not dealing with the postal, or any similar Department. We are dealing with the Defence Department, which is altogether different in its management from all the others. If it were not so, how is it that the whole of the Defence Department has not been placed under the control of the Public Service Commissioner? It is simply because the House and the country desire to throw the responsibility on to the Minister.  1  have every confidence in that gentleman, and the moment I cease to have confidence in him I shall say so. If the Minister is to be hampered by irresponsible people inquiring into the working of his Department, it will cause no end of dissension throughout the Commonwealth. If, for instance, the Committee reported that a certain section of the non-commissioned officers were under-paid, and the responsible officers of the Department did not feel inclined to recommend an increase, in what position would the Minister of Defence be, and what condition would the Defence Forces find themselves in? Should we be likely to have that discipline which is essential for the carrying out of any proper Defence scheme? The Committee, if appointed, would not achieve the effect which its supporters say it would. </para>

              <para>- Employment in the Defence Forces is altogether different from employment outside. If the men in the Defence Forces formed themselves into a union, and were called out for the defence of the country, and just about the same time took it into their heads to strike, what position would we be in? If honorable members say these men are justified in forming a union, then I am logical in saying that they would be justified in striking if they did not get their just dues from the Government. It is for the Minister of Defence to take the responsibility of seeing that the men get their rights. If the Minister does not do so, it is for us to express our want of confidence in him, and compel the Department to do justice to the men who defend the country. </para>

The present Minister of Defence has a policy altogether different from that of his predecessor; and if he made a mistake, would the question  not be a party one then? Such must be party questions so long as we have responsible government. If I voted for the appointment of this&#34; Select Committee, I should be simply expressing a lack of confidence in the Minister. I desire the men in the ranks, and the non-commissioned officers, to understand that there is no one in the House more desirous than myself of giving them proper conditions ; but a proper means to that end must be adopted. I oppose the motion, for the one reason that it will not benefit those whom we desire to benefit, namely, the lower-paid men in our Defence Forces. </para>

I regard the members of the Military Service as employes of the Government ; and I do not desire to see them treated differently from any public servants. I, therefore, suggest that the Government be requested to bring die members of the Defence Forces under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and thus afford a true solution of the problem. If these men are underpaid, as suggested, it is our duty to see that they are given a fair return for their labour. The honorable member for North Sydney will, I think, support an amendment in favour of legislation to bring these men under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

              <para>- The Government ought to see that every public servant has a fair and decent wage. A Select Committee can only make recommendations; and if the Government oppose the appointment of a Select Committee, what chance is there of having any recommendation carried into effect? In our Defence Forces we employ engineers, blacksmiths, carpenters, painters, and so forth; and if outside employers have to pay a certain wage, and observe certain conditions under an Arbitration Court, I do not see why our military employes should&#39; be deprived of the benefits of our industrial legislation. The conditions at Thursday Island arid at- Queenscliff, for example, are vastly different ; and as any Select Committee would have to travel in order to obtain evidence at first hand, I do not see how their work could be completed during the present session. During the recess, however, the Minister will have an opportunity to obtain reports from the different centres ; and next session he may be in a position to introduce a Bill to bring the Military Forces under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and thus settle the conditions for all time. I understand that these men have grievances connected with their food, clothes, accommodation, and so forth ; and, under the circumstances, I suggest that, the honorable member for North Sydney should withdraw his. motion,, and rely on the Government to see that justice is done. If I were a member of the Military Forces, and received a miserable wage, I should leave the service. </para>

              <para>- These men have no excuse if they are underpaid. There is a demand for labour all over the Commonwealth ; and if they are men, they ought to fight for their rights, or leave the service. Honorable members who are supporting the appointment of this Committee do not, some of them, interest themselves in the welfare of the lowly-paid man in outside employment. Any Select Committee appointed would have a wide field to cover; and, as I have already pointed out, the Minister of Defence, in recess, could consider the question of housing, food, clothes, holidays, canteens, and the class of liquor supplied, and so forth. All these form part of the military organization, and call, I suppose, for investigation. I might further suggest that honorable members should visit Thursday Island and other military centres with benefit to themselves and to the country. The honorable member for North Sydney- has been connected with the Military Forces* for a number of years;- and, consequently,, he has the comparatively easy task of talking &#34; shop.&#34; But other honorable members, myself included, are not fighting men, and it would be well if the Government could arrange such, visits of inspection as I have indicated. I agree with the honorable member for North S Sydney that the men of the Permanent Forces should be fairly remunerated and properly treated, and no doubt the result of the debate will be to cause the Minister of Defence to look carefully into the whole matter. We, on this side, are at all times ready to do everything that can be clone to better the condition of the community, and the employes of the Commonwealth. As such the men of our Military Forces have nothing to lose by putting themselves in the hands of the Minister of Defence. </para>

            <para>- That removes one objection to the motion. There are more officers and men in, and passing through,, my constituency than in any other constituency, because Melbourne has only one member, while Sydney is divided into four electorates; but I have not yet heard either officer or man make a complaint about pay. The last  speaker  referred to the food supplied to our Permanent Forces, and to the clothing. As an Australian, and a member of this House, I say that the uniform that is good enough to fight in should! be good enough for attendance at banquetsand the like. The honorable member for North Sydney, who has risen to the important post of colonel, knows that theuniforms, dress and undress, of an officer of high grade cost not less than  &#163;50. </para>

          <para class="block">Great Britain to attend the Coronation, I was unwilling to go to the expense of a Court dress, but on representations being made through the Prime Minister to the King, he, with a courtesy that was exquisite in the extreme, waived that requirement. A Court dress would have cost at least ,&#163;30. and might have cost .&#163;120. By appearing in ordinary attire on that occasion the representatives of this Chamber anc! the Senate set a great example. We hope that our Defence Force will be one of the fighting forces of the world, and that in its simplicity, verve, and splendid discipline, it will vie wilh the most patriotic army the world knows, that of Switzerland. As it is proposed to finish this session by Christmas, though I cannot see how that can be done, it would not be wise to begin the inquiry which the honorable member for North Sydney asks for, but the Minister might take the debate as an instruction to obtain data as to the cost of each army unit in the world. In <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Owen&#39;s classic work 011 the Swiss Republic, there is a comparison of the armies of Europe, and I think that, whereas a unit in Great Britain costs .&#163;65, one in Switzerland costs only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;l</inline> That great authority, who was, and is still, I think, an officer in  His  Majesty&#39;s Forces, showed that Switzerland could mobilize 250,000 men in three days, a thing which Great Britain could not then do in six weeks. What we need is a fighting force; we do not want frivolous giltspurred roosters, to use a phrase that has become famous. We know that bright facings are marks for sharpshooters, which render gay uniforms dangerous to their wearers. No time in a soldier&#39;s life is more glorious than that in which he is taking part in the defence of his country, and the uniform in which a man is willing to face an enemy, and in which, if necessary, lie would be proud to die, should be good enough for meeting the mightiest man in the Empire, even the King himself. I ask the honorable member for North Sydney would it not be better to withdraw this motion, and obtain an inquiry into all the grievances of the military. Take the question of salaries. Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton received ,&#163;1,500 a year and allowances. When a member of the State House, I endeavoured to ascertain what the allowances covered, but could not get the information. Our Ministers would not refuse any information that members might ask for. Count von Moltke received only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,500</inline> a year when leading 750,000 Germans triumphant through France. </para>

              <para>- I hope that no comparison will be made between professional and amateur soldiers. In my opinion, promotion in the Permanent Forces is often blocked unfairly, men not &#39;being given a proper trial. It was told -me -within  the  last three days that an officer has the right to take any man as an orderly, and that orderlies do not &#39;have as much drill as other soldiers. It is not the intention of Parliament that soldiers shall be told off to  run  errands, and do work that a boy could do. I must vote against this motion, but if a proposal is made for an inquiry into the .grievances of the Defence Forces, with a view to securing better pay and conditions, should that be necessary, it will command my support. </para>

Last session a. constant agitation was kept up, more particularly by the representatives of Tasmania, for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the alleged Tasmanian Customs leakages, and it is, to say the least, peculiar that one of the representatives of that State should now assert that these inquiries are of no use whatever. The honorable member said that he did not believe in Royal Commissions or Select Committees. </para>

            <para>-- I wish to take this early opportunity to direct the attention of the Government, and especially of the Minister of Trade and Customs, to the very substantial grievance which I think this House will be under if the Royal Commission, appointed to inquire into the sugar industry, is not supplemented in its numbers. The honorable member is aware that, speaking broadly, the general practice has been to constitute Royal Commissions, so far as they represent political opinions, of almost equal numbers, the greater number being representatives of the majority in Parliament; even in those circumstances the endeavour has been to avoid the selection of representatives of the Ministry of the day who are definitely and distinctively marked with a particular brand of opinion, regarding the questions into which they are to inquire. It is evident, in this connexion, that the Government themselves realized the difficulties of the position. They occupied some time in making an appointment, and their replies to questions put to them showed both what the original aim of the Government was, and then how it came to be discarded. On the 5th of last month the Minister of Trade and Customs announced the names of those who had been chosen to constitute this Commission. They are well known : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon, of the Supreme Court of South Australia ; the Honorable Albert Hinchcliffe, M.L.C. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> McC. Anderson; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> M. Shannon, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> William Crawford. In answer to a question the Minister, as reported at page 1174, of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe</inline> was Secretary of the Australian Labour Federation, and was connected with the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> newspaper, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> was a commercial  man in Sydney, being a member of the firm of Allan Taylor and Company; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shannon</inline> was a Sydney barrister and cane-grower, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford</inline> was </para>

When the Minister went on to say that &#34; the selection has been in accordance with that intention,&#34; he said something impossible to justify by any evidence that has been or can be produced. Let it be understood clearly that I do not propose, in the course of my remarks, to reflect personally upon any one of the gentlemen chosen to constitute this Commission. If we had now an open choice, and had to determine who should be selected, the occasion would be a proper one to debate the qualifications of the gentlemen for this position, their freedom from bias, the absence of political motives, and other questions of the sort; but it is now too late to do so.

              <para>- Anticipating that such irrelevancies would be introduced, I have come prepared to deal with them, and shall do so in their proper order. If any good purpose could be served by challenging these gentlemen, I should have endeavoured to acquaint myself with the general circumstances of their career and opinions, but I recognise that they have been appointed by the Government, and at present constitute the Royal Commission. My purpose tonight, therefore, is to start from things as they are, without saying what they ought to have been. I may point out that, although the Commission has formally commenced business, it has so far taken only a few steps j so that, if the Government is to fulfil to any degree the statement made by the Minister that the Commission was to be non-political and free from party bias, there is only one way of doing so. I do not suggest that it should be done by adding men of opposite political opinions, because political opinions should not be taken into consideration in such a choice. I regret to find that all the members of the Commission, excluding, of course, the Judge and  Chairman,  have more or less definite political leanings. My present suggestion is simply that if this Commission is to be formed on the basis which we have been accustomed to see accepted both in the State and Federal Parliaments, it will be necessary to add to it two or three members distinctly outside the political sphere, but qualified to undertake an investigation of this kind with strict impartiality. If that were done, the Commission could still be brought, to some extent, into line with the Minister&#39;s own statement. If it is not done, the position is hopeless. We are face to face with the facts which, as the Minister said, &#34;are probably as stated.&#34; I think they are evidently as stated - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HinchclifFe</inline> is an active member of his own party, and still actively associated with and interested in it ; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shannon</inline> has been a selected Labour candidate j and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> McC. Anderson is quoted as having said in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> that it is well known among his friends that Labour and its representatives have had his sympathey for many years past. </para>

              <para>- I do not contend that the Government should have attempted the impossible task of discovering persons who had no political opinions. But to select people who are qualified to act on a Commission and who have political opinions is a very different thing from making the majority of the Commission consist of active politicians - men who take an active part and interest in public affairs, who stand as candidates, and who are pledged to a particular party - giving them the absolute majority on n. Commission. Even now this can be remedied if two or three other relatively non-political persons, with no active political career behind them, or&#39; who have not taken part in public affairs, are selected to sit with those already appointed. If you looked over the list of the Royal Commissions, so far as I remember them, appointed in the States or in the Commonwealth, you would find a Commission of this sort consisting of a majority who probably shared in some general way the political opinions of the Government of the day, or agreed with their policy on the particular question involved, and a minority, usually only one less than the majority, although it might be two less in some special circumstances, who, without being active politicians, were known not to share those opinions, to some extent. </para>

          <para>This is a question in which, unfortunately, the political element cannot be ignored, because the party represented by Ministers and members opposite in this House has on this very question a distinctly pronounced opinion, which must affect the inquiry about to be instituted. Nationalization stands as one of the most prominent objects of the Labour party&#39;s programme, and among the industries which have been selected from time to time by their representative men as illustrations of industries which would, in their opinion, be properly nationalized, the sugar industry has been mentioned continually. In those circumstances we cannot be blind to the fact that  we have here a Commission which, directly it is appointed, has an absolute and overwhelming majority on one of the greatest issues in favour of the particular policy favoured by the Government. In fact, always leaving out the Judge and  chairman,  -only one out of the four members who sit with the Judge is not attached to the party which has declared beforehand that the  sugar industry ought to be nationalized. </para>

              <para>- He can, and that is all that could be done if he were assisted by another. He happens to have been a  Liberal candidate, and, without saying that that is an absolute bar, it is still as unfortunate in his case as in the other. I should have preferred that some gentleman should be chosen who had not been a Liberal candidate, but who was not associated with the Ministerial party in any way. </para>

              <para>- That is correct, but not complete. I said it was so, as far as nationalization of the sugar industry was concerned. One of the most important questions that will be considered and decided by the Commission is the question of nationalization or non-nationalization. When those gentlemen belong to a party which puts nationalization in the forefront of its proposals, it is surely fair to say that they have made up their minds in favour of the nationalization of sugar. </para>

              <para>- Then the one Liberal we thought we had, we have not got. Personally, I think it would have been much better if these gentlemen had no public political associations. I do not want to argue that point again. I mention it merely to point out that, as a consequence, from the political point of view, the balance of the  Commission is more weighted on one side than any Royal Commission I ever remember. Even in the case of Select Committees or other bodies appointed by this House, the almost universal practice has been to make very little difference between the numbers on each side. </para>

          <para class="block">The House, after all, had the final decision of the subject-matter to be inquired into in its own hands. In the circumstances, if this Commission, without addition, is allowed to enter upon its task, honorable members opposite and the Government will be to blame for having constituted it in such a way as to evoke suspicion and distrust, and provoke challenge, even before its work is commenced. Of course, it will be by their work that the members of the Commission will be judged, and properly so. But it is most unfortunate that public opinion should be biased in this way at the very outset by the creation of a Commission in which the proportions are _ so unusually in favour of one way of thinking and acting. I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford</inline> is not still a nationalizer - he may retain his old faith or have embraced a new one - but at all events the Commission commences its inquiry without that support from public opinion, and without that confidence which Royal Commissions should enjoy. Its task will be so much the harder. The Government will not be assisted to their ends by a onesided Commission. It may even prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford</inline> still retains some of his old views. If so, the whole Commission, excluding the  chairman,  is of one political colour and complexion. In the choice of the  chairman  the Government appear to have made a very wise selection. </para>

              <para>- No. They have picked a gentleman of judicial attainments, and who, in addition, enjoyed a long political career, with Ministerial experience. He therefore brings very valuable knowledge to bear upon the subject, which I am sure he will handle in accordance with judicial principles. I do not think the Minister has heard a word of . challenge of that gentleman from any quarter. I understand the secretary of the Commission has also been appointed. </para>

              <para>- I draw a contrast between the Commission now appointed and the Commission we proposed to appoint eighteen months ago. There are two classes of Royal Commissions - one the expert Commission, on which we seek to obtain the services of persons identified with an industry, who are to make a searching investigation and then present results to be dealt with by the Legislature in a more or less judicial fashion. The other is the more familiar kind of general Royal Commission. The purpose then is not to appoint experts or those engaged in an industry. They take evidence, and then present their conclusions to Parliament. As I have said, the universal practice in the Mother Country, and, I think, in the Commonwealth and all the States, has been to take care that the minority was always sufficiently strong in numbers to be able to press its inquiries as thoroughly as the majority, and also to present, on any particular points, a minority report, setting forth their grounds for not agreeing with the majority. There is no such balance in the present Commission. The Commission we proposed was to consist of a gentleman recommended to us as the best expert in all the processes of dealing with sugar, from the growing of the plant until it was turned into the refined article; and another said to possess an unexampled knowledge of the financial side of sugar - the cost of all the processes, values, and so forth. The Judge was then to acquaint himself with all these general matters which are necessary to complete the case, and to present a purely judicial report. The two gentlemen to whom I have referred were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Desplace</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crompton.</inline> Their names and reputations were all that were known to the Cabinet, and, therefore, we had, -and have, no knowledge whatever of their politics. They were recommended to us simply as, in the opinion of those who know the industry, the two best experts available in the whole of the Commonwealth. The Judge could be compared with any Judge on the bench for his qualifications for conducting an inquiry of the kind, especially of a commercial character, owing to his experience in the Arbitration Court as well as in general practice. I am not contrasting the two Commissions in relation to their character, because one was an expert Commission and the other a Commission with judicial authority. </para>

              <para>- I have no complaint to make that that proposal has not been carried, or any complaint to make of the character of the Commissioners appointed, nor do I question the capacity of any of the members. But the customary balance to which I have referred does not exist. Judging solely from a political point of view, the Government have three representatives on the Commission to one. The Judge, of course, is non-political. Under the circumstances, no provision is made for a minority strong enough to have its views thoroughly represented. It is not too late to repair this defect. </para>

              <para>- I reckon the Judge neither for nor against nationalization, but as occupying a judicial position apart from all questions of political policy. There are four ordinary working members, three of one complexion and one, possibly, of another. While it appears to me very unfortunate that there is any political complexion at all, since it is there the least we can do is to add another member or two of unknown political opinions, but sufficiently qualified, commercially and industrially, to render effective service. </para>

              <para>- I do not suggest for a moment that members should be appointed because they are Liberals, or of any other way of political thinking. This is the last opportunity we have to redress the balance and of casting this Royal Commission in the mould that every other Royal Commission I ever heard of in this country has been cast, so as to give a minority sufficient to enable an effective minority report to be presented on points of difference with the majority. This should be done in order that the inquiry may not be prejudiced from the outset by the clear impression at present that it is political, and altogether one-sided. The political complexion cannot be got rid of unless this is done- </para>

              <para>- I am not in the habit or making statements that are without foundation, or that I have to withdraw. If it be found that my assertion is incorrect, I shall willingly withdraw it. But the honorable member for Ballarat said at the Melbourne Town Hall, as reported in the press, that a Royal Commission had been appointed by his Government, and that the present Government cancelled the appointment, and refused to allow the Commission to proceed. As a matter of fact, that Royal Commission never was appointed by the late Government. The honorable member, from the time he promised to appoint a Royal Commission, was in office six months; and, during that time, he never reached the final stage in the appointment. Names have been mentioned, and it is said that certain members of the Commission that has now been appointed hold political views favorable to the Government. I am given to understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shannon</inline> - I have heard this since, strange to say, from honorable members opposite - was about fifteen or sixteen years ago a Labour candidate. As to what he has been since I am not aware, but the honorable member for Darling Downs may know. </para>

              <para>- Since the Commission&#39; has been attacked by honorable members-, opposite, I have more faith in it than I had before. Members of the Opposition profess to know more about the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission and its political opinions; than any one else, but no word of criticism has come from any one connected with the sugar industry. At any rate, no word has reached me, officially, or otherwise. I have not seen an article, even in Queensland newspapers, adversely criticising the Commission. I do not think it is intended to alter the <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline></para>

              <para>- I do not think it would be wise to add to it. If Ministers admitted that they had chosen Commissioners who should not have been chosen, they would not be worthy of the positions they occupy. There is hardly a man in any walk of life, or, at least, in any prominent position, who does not hold political opinions. </para>

He holds the highest official position, so far as the refiners and growers are concerned, being  President  of the Sugar Producers&#39; Association.

Are Royal Commissioners appointed as if they were crossing-sweepers, taken on for a casual job? The Minister was whip and secretary of his party.

              <para>- I find no fault with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe;</inline> the fault lies with the Minister in appointing him to a body that was to be impartial. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe</inline> told the Queensland Legislative Council that he was sorry that the referenda proposals were not carried, because they would have enabled the Sugar Refining Company to be dealt with. He has prejudged the case, and, curiously enough, in the direction ardently desired by honorable members opposite. I am not attacking this man for holding this opinion ; he is entitled to hold the Views that fit in with his conscience. But if a man holds strong views beforehand about the merits of a case, why appoint him as a Judge to deal with it ? </para>

I do not want to go too closely into- this particular matter, because it is not within our province ; but this gentleman, and the Minister whom we all have in mind as having mentioned his name to the Minister, are very fortunate in their mutual friendship. If the statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> is correct - and I have no reason to doubt its veracity - then it could not have been unknown to members of the Federal Ministry that his leanings had been in the direction of Labour for years past. </para>

          <para>With regard to the other two members of the Commission, I think it is equally deplorable that either of them should have been politicians on one side or the other. My desire was that there should be appointed to this Commission men who would be as free as any persons could be from leanings in any particular political direction. The difference between a chosen politician and a man who is not a politician, but has, necessarily, political leanings in the one direction -or the other, is this : That a man in the political arena who has declared himself emphatically on the one side or the other, loses, to a large extent, political caste if he changes his opinions. It is well known that the moment a member of Parliament changes his political views he is howled at and denounced- </para>

I am discussing, rather, the question of whether a politician can change his views with as much freedom from attack as can a. man who, while having political leanings, is not a politician. It will be conceded by every one who knows his subject that a- politician is in a singularly unfortunate position in this respect ; and for that reason I have been anxious all along that the men appointed to conduct this inquiry should be absolutely free from any professed political views on one side or the other - that, in fact, politicians should not be appointed. </para>

Why appoint men who are just as bound to one side or the other as we are, but who are hot trusted by the people who will have to foot the bill ? . </para>

              <para>- Then we are the only politicians in Australia who would angle for votes, and are, therefore, not fit to sit upon a Royal Commission? That is the most extraordinary reflection on the Federal Parliament we have ever heard ! It would be unfortunate to appoint members of the Federal Parliament to such a Commission, but it is still more unfortunate to appoint men who, without speaking disrespectfully of them, are, in actual political eminence, second-rank politicians as contrasted with the Federal politicians of Australia. </para>

          <para>An effort will be made by honorable members opposite to make this a question of whether or not the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should be sat upon. The question, however, is infinitely larger. The question of whether or not the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should be sat upon is relatively small when we consider the many complexities of this problem. We have, in the first place, to consider the producers, the sugar-growers, the refiners, the jam and preserve manufacturers - who must use sugar in their manufactures - the men they employ, and the fruit-growers. The price of sugar enters largely into the question of what profits fruit-growers will get from selling their fruit to jam manufacturers. We have also to consider the beet-growers, who are entitled to have considered the question of whether or not the whole sugar industry of Queensland is worth keeping at the price. We have, further, to consider the general taxpayers, who will have to foot the bill under any nationalization scheme ; and also every buyer of sugar throughout the Commonwealth, who naturally wants to get his sugar as cheaply as he can. </para>

              <para>- So I am assured. Place of residence is neither here nor there; we have to take into consideration where a man&#39;s interests lie, and, for all essential purposes, this is a Queensland Commission. I am not at present canvassing whether the bounty or duty should continue, but the people of Australia are entitled to have appointed a Royal Commission that can satisfy them that it will give unbiased consideration to the whole question of whether or not the duty, bounty, and Excise, or any of them, shall continue^ - whether the whole system, as introduced by Parliament, ought to be continued, or whether sugar ought to be admitted free into the Commonwealth, like kerosene. That is a big problem affecting every Australian constituency. I have heard honorable members from Western Australia and Tasmania advocating the remission of the duty. Are not the people of Tasmania, who must buy sugar to make their jams, entitled to have their views considered ? </para>

The man w&#39;hose inclinations or aptitudes have drawn him into the political arena cannot be blamed for being outspoken on one side or the other ; but the moment any man declares his measured conviction upon one side of a special problem, he puts himself out of court as a judge upon it. This Commission, in spite of Ministerial promises, has been constituted upon those lines; and I deeply regret that the Minister holds out no hope of making any alleviation of this bad state of affairs by appointing new members who would help to divorce it from its political and partisan character. </para>

I am pleased that the Minister of Home Affairs is present, because.  I  do not think his Department gives the young people of Australia a fair deal in the examinations it conducts of candidates for the service. I desire to enumerate the inconveniences thosecandidates have to suffer. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member can talk sugar to his heart&#39;s content&#39; when he addresses the Chair. The candidates for these examinations have_ many grievances. Like the examiners, they arehuman, and the examiners, being human, . make mistakes for which, unfortunately, some candidates have to suffer. It is known and admitted that mistakes havebeen made in the past in the setting of examination papers, and that afterwards- some mistake was made, if not in the consideration of the examination papers, at any rate in giving information as to who had passed, and who had not. What took place created a fear in the. minds of many that the results, as published in the newspapers, were not correct, and they desired to find out whether a mistake had been made so far as they were concerned.  A.  young man of seventeen or eighteen, living in the back-blocks of Victoria, underwent an examination. His coach, a man of very high education, was satisfied that a mistake had been made somewhere in connexion with the English paper, for which the young fellow was &#34; plucked.&#34; He asked if it was not possible for the candidate to come to Melbourne, and peruse the paper to see where he had made a mistake. The Department, however, will not allow that to be done. </para>

              <para>- The University is a musty old conservative institution, run for the benefit of the few. We are supposed to run this concern for the benefit of all. The interests of the many who spend years of study, and a great deal of money, to qualify for these examinations ought to be considered. Why cannot arrangements be made for them to see the papers, and ascertain where the mistake was made? ls it because the examiners, or the Department, are afraid it will be discovered that they themselves have made mistakes?  A  sense of human feeling from one set of individuals to another ought to allow what I suggest to be done. The attitude of the Department is preposterous. If the Department are afraid that too many will ask to be allowed to examine the papers, let them charge a small fee if they like, although I do not see that that is necessary. No possible harm can be done by allowing the candidates to see the papers afterwards, unless it is that the Department are afraid of exposing their own mistakes, and do not want to see the people who have been wronged righted. </para>

              <para>- The fact that an institution of that character refuses to be progressive should not affect us. The authorities of the University like to preserve their old ideas, and keep it a close corporation. We are supposed to have broader and more progressive ideas than the University Council have. The Public Service examinations are held in large halls. There are some highly intelligent men, whose voices cannot be heard 10 yards away, yet readers of that sort are employed, and candidates are &#34; plucked &#34; because they cannot hear the mutterings of a man who has no right to be there. We ought to hold examinations with a view to getting the best possible officers for the public Departments, and not with the object of persecuting candidates. </para>

It is supposed to make their minds active by being set questions which cannot be answered, and have to be given up in disgust. The Minister ought to alter the present system in his Department. A one-sided idea of giving points is adopted. Definite points can be given in such subjects as spelling, or arithmetic, or geography. If a man is asked where Timbuctoo is, and replies that it is somewhere in the Stilly Islands, it is known at once that he is wrong, and points can be deducted. </para>

              <para>- I do not know; I suppose it is somewhere near China. However, in our Public Service examinations, the examiners assess so many points for handwriting. By what standard ought handwriting to be judged ? There have been candidates whose handwriting was laughed at by their fellow students, but the latter were somewhat surprised when the former came out &#34;on top &#34; in this particular. A man who is thoroughly well up in all the other subjects may be &#34; plucked &#34; because the examiner does not think his handwriting artistic enough, though it may be quite legible for all practical purposes. This is not the way to get the best men into the Public Service. </para>

              <para>- If the handwriting is legible, the student ought to pass, provided that he is otherwise well qualified. As it is, an examiner may give 250 marks for handwriting, and another examiner, in the case of handwriting equally good, may give only eighty or ninety marks. One of the brightest girls I know in Australia spent years in studying for the Public Service, and her parents spent much money on her education. At school she was looked upon as one of the best ; and in her first Public Service examination she got nearly the maximum number of marks for her handwriting, though she was lower in the other subjects, and, while she passed, she just missed being called upon. At the next examination she was &#34;plucked&#34; because her handwriting did not satisfy the examiner. Now, if this girl&#39;s handwriting was good for, say,  250  marks on one occasion, she ought to be deemed good enough in this respect for the Public Service. Parliament and the Minister should not allow students to be penalized, but, rather, ought to assist them in passing their examinations. I should like to know why the candidates cannot see the examination papers after the examinations are over. Can any reason be suggested for refusing this request ? Then, if the reader at an examination does not make himself audible, is it fair to &#34; pluck &#34; those candidates who are furthest away, and have difficulty in hearing ? Of course, if the Minister does not agree with me in the views I have expressed, I cannot help it ; but something ought to be done. During the last eighteen months I have heard complaints inthe case of fifty or sixty young candidates - I take no notice of parents, who think all their &#34; geese are swans,&#34; or of  &#39; coaches &#34; - who have been &#39; &#39; plucked &#39; &#39; for some disability over which they have no control. I should now like to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence the peculiar system of payment in the Defence Department. In the Stores Branch, at Victoria Barracks, both permanent and temporary labourers are engaged ; and the pay is 8s. a clay. On the occasion of the last camp at Kilmore, the permanent employes who went there received as expenses 8s. a day for the first week and 6s. a day for the subsequent weeks ; but the temporary men were allowed nothing. Is it possible for a Labour Government to conscientiously say that that is fair ? If Ministers are satisfied with an arrangement of that kind, I am afraid that a number of their followers are not. I have endeavoured to have this grievance redressed by the Minister, but I have not succeeded ; and I must simply keep hammering away until I do. I do not like mentioning these matters ; but I consider it my duty to do so, and I shall take advantage of every opportunity to obtain fair terms for these men. </para>

            <para>.- Attention should be paid to the remarks of the honorable member for North Sydney, who pointed out that a recent award of the Arbitration Court would throw the manufacturing of wool presses into the bands of two firms. If that happens, these firms will be able to form a ring or trust, and increase prices. Admittedly they manufacture good presses; but, no doubt, they now receive fair prices for them, and it would be a pity if they were placed in a position in which they could gradually make their prices higher and higher. The award of the Court has raised wages. </para>

              <para>- I was merely pointing out that those engaged in pastoral pursuits have to pay higher wages every year; and if a trust is formed in connexion with the sale of presses, their profits will be still further diminished. They, on their part, cannot increase the price of wool, because they export their product, and have to depend on the world&#39;s market. They should not be put at the mercy of manufacturers by an award which had no such intention. I wish, also, to ask the Postmaster--General if he will reduce, as far as possible, the guarantees demanded for telephone extensions into the backblocks. </para>

              <para>- The fund is supplied out of the Consolidated Revenue, but the present system is not calculated to improve the national character, nor to insure the payment of pensions at the rates which have been fixed. No one more ardently wishes to see pensions paid to deserving persons than I do; and it should be our aim to increase the rates, if possible. But we need a sane business basis, so that both those who are now in receipt of pensions, and those likely to need them, shall be sure of relief. When the honorable member for Hume introduced the pension system, he estimated that it. would cost  &#163;1,250,000  250,000 a year; but it is already costing ,&#163;2,000,000 a year. </para>

He cannot get a pension, because he transferred property about twelve months before the Act came into force. The transfer was effected through me, so that I know that it was not made to enable a claim for a pension to be preferred. The property was transferred because it was heavily mortgaged, and the owner, being incapacitated, could not earn anything to meet the interest. </para>

If people know that they have only to keep out of gaol, and be of good character, in order to be entitled in their old age to a pension, some will be tempted not to make efforts which they otherwise would make. </para>

              <para>- It is not. The history ofall nations shows that the handing out of largesse leads to a number of people being, so to speak, good for nothing. In ancient Rome there were many who did nothing but receive from the State their daily bread. They were of no use to the Empire when it was tottering ; about all they could do was to create a disturbance if the games in the circus were insufficient.

              <para>- It is about time that the Ministry seriously thought of initiating a system whereby the youth, the strength, and the manhood of Australia would do something in the direction of contributing to the building up of a satisfactory fund such as I have suggested, or contribute a satisfactory amount towards what we have to pay annually in respect of old-age pensions. It is only fair that those of us who can afford to do something for our less fortunate brethren should be required to do so. If some such scheme were instituted many people would realize more fully than they do now that their thrift was going to provide a fund for the unfortunate and the needy. </para>

            <para>.- Some more satisfactory reply should have been made to the indictment by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of what would seem to be the very partial Sugar Commission appointed. It is unfortunate that this House has to take in hand the duty of criticising the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of that Commission. We are proud to believe that the whole of the people of Australia take a keen interest in politics. It is one of the healthiest signs of the vitality and virility of Australian people that they are not only conducting their enterprises with energy and ability, but are taking that interest in the affairs of their country which is so necessary if the laws passed by the National Parliament are to be a true reflex of the people&#39;s will. </para>

              <para>- In New South Wales Labour won one seat and the Liberals won the other. To return to the question I was discussing when interrupted, it is most unfortunate that the executive power of the Government was used for the purpose of making what appear on the surface to be partisan appointments to the Sugar Commission. No Commission has been appointed by this, or by any other Parliament, in connexion with which it was more vitally important that men of thehighest standing - men who were, at least, outside the active region of politics, and&#39; had not declared any political bias - should be selected. Although we know that it wasimpossible for the Minister to select men free from all political bias, he could, at least, have avoided selecting men who had been openly expressing their political views, either as candidates for Parliament or through the public newspapers. The field of selection was so wide and broad that it would have been quite possible for the Minister to choose men in whom every section of the community would have had the utmost confidence. It is most unfortunate that the Commission should have to set out on its work of investigating the conditions of what is the largest single industry of the Commonwealth with the public mind already biased against it? </para>

              <para>- I am not. Just as our Judges and magistrates should be, not only free from bias, but above the possibility of any suspicion being attached to them, so the members of this Commission should be absolutely free from any political bias. It is most unfortunate that the executive power of this Government has been so far used in a manner that has gravely and seriously shaken public &#34;confidence in its administration. The public policy of a Government can be, and should be, criticised in a proper way. We know that the policy of this Government is decided, first of all, in some other place before it is submitted to this Parliament. Ultimately, it is brought before us and discussed as a public question ; but the executive acts of- a Parliament should leave its administration free from any possible suspicion that might be attached to it. The Government having decided that the Commission should be composed of persons out-  side this Parliament - that it should be of an absolutely judicial character, and one that would have the confidence of every section of the community - should have adhered to that decision. The previous Government took steps to appoint a Commission on a basis that has been advocated for some time by a member of &#39; the present Ministerial party. For nearly two years the honorable member for Capricornia has consistently and sedulously advocated the appointment of a Commission that would be representative, of the five important interests involved. If the Government had carried out their oft- repeated promise that the Commission would be so constituted as to represent impartially every section of the community we should have known that, upon receiving its report, we could mete out justice. The industry affects every householder in the community. It is one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth, and is already in the hands of one important trading company. We want to ascertain, by means of the Commission, whether the consumers of Australia are paying too much to support the sugar industry. At the same time I believe that we, as the National Parliament, should so frame our laws that they will cause industries of the widest variety to spring into existence, so that we may establish a truly national system of production and, at the same time, a self-sustaining community. With our tremendous resources we can establish in this great continent every industry that is necessary to supply the needs and services of the highest type of civilization. It is possible that, under present conditions, the people of the Commonwealth may be paying far too great a price for the support of the sugar industry. We wanted exact information on that point, but the Government and Parliament agreed that it could not be properly obtained by appointing a Commission of members of this Parliament, because such a body would smack too much of party politics. I believe that is the reason that Parliament decided that the Commission should be purely non-party, with a. judicial  chairman,  capable of imparting a judicial, as well as a practical, character to its investigations. We hoped that its report, when presented to the House, would be so representative of every important interest affected by the industry, that this Parliament would be able to evolve from it a complete and comprehensive policy on the ques tion. Unfortunately we have now a Commission which shows on the surface that there is political bias in connexion with its members. It is unfortunate that that should be the case when the Commission is starting on its career of investigation, but the matter is one which, in the interests of Australia as a whole, might reasonably be discussed here free from party considerations. It is a <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> unfortunate blunder on the part of the Executive that it should have been made possible by the appointment of the members of that Commission </para>

It would have been possible to appoint, from prominent business men and representative workers of the continent, a hundred Commissions that would have successfully withstood any fire of criticism that might have been directed against them in this chamber. In the present circumstances it is not possible for this Commission to escape the criticism which ought to be levelled against it. I hope it will be possible for the Commission to say when it brings in its report - if the Government does not think it advisable before then to retrace its steps- </para>

I wish to refer to the remarks of the honorable member for Wilmot in respect to old-age pensions. I am one of those honorable members who have always believed that old-age pensions should be entirely freed from the taint of charity. I believe that our so-called charitable institutions are only regarded as charities because we have not reached that altitude in our Christian civilization which would remove the taint of charity altogether from them, and cause them and their support to be regarded as part of the economic, as well as the ethical, duty of every citizen in the Commonwealth. </para>

There will never be a better opportunity than the present for the Government to introduce a, scientific scheme of old-age pensions, building up a fund, and giving encouragement to merit, thrift, and industry on the part of the people of Australia. It is an extraordinary thing that in all British communities there is a disinclination on the part of Governments to bring in an old-age pensions Act, based on thrift as well as on Government assistance. A scientific scheme can be introduced by which the people, during their years of strength and vitality, could build up a fund that would help to pay them the allowances, gratuities, or honorariums due to them when they reached a certain age. From about  t.88o,  until the pensions scheme was passed in the last session of the present British Parliament, about a dozen Royal Commissions reported on the question. The various Friendly Societies were made use of, and experiments were tried, but, so far, it has not been found possible in Great Britain to place old-age pensions on a scientific basis. </para>

          <para class="block">With an &#34;over-flowing Treasury, and greatprosperity throughout the Commonwealth, the present would have been a golden time: for this Government to lay the foundation of an old-age pensions scheme that would&#39; be largely self-supporting, encourage thrift and industry, and be infinitely more universal in its application than the present system. In view of their professions, this is peculiarly a question that might be undertaken by the present Government. I havein my mind a case which I believe is typical of hundreds, if not thousands, of others. A couple began to purchase a house sometwenty years ago in one of the suburbs of Melbourne. They have paid off nearly ;&#163;66o, and still owe about ,&#163;100 on it. Thethrift, self-denial, and industry they havedisplayed to secure a home for themselves ought to be commended and encouraged, but&#39; the amount of .&#163;600 which they havepaid brings them nearly up to the margin: fixed in both cases, and they are allowed a pension conjointly of, I think, only 2s. 8d. per week. A margin of .&#163;310 is allowed by the Act, but why should any deduction be made from the pensions in a case of thatkind ? There is a very grave and seriousanomaly in the Act in this way - that a man. can earn nearly up to 10s. per week, and can receive a pension of an equivalent amount, but if he has property worth &#163;3.1.0, which is regarded as equivalent tothe capital upon which 10s. per week could be earned, he is cut off from the chance of getting a pension. Such a provision discourages people from providing themselveswith a home, and discounts that thrift and industry which the Government ought to bethe first to encourage. </para>

              <para>- There is a great deal to be said in f avour of that view, but it cannot be done unless we revise the whole existing scheme. We could establish a universal scheme on a thoroughly actuarial and; scientific basis, like that of Germany. In F ranee, Belgium, and other European countries, scientific systems on a sound economic basis are being successfully carried out by municipalities. The municipal-form of government has been made use of on the Continent in many important directions, which we have not yet followed in Australia. The London County Council extends its operations considerably beyond anything done by municipalities in Australia, and that tendency is even more marked on the Continent. We could institute a universal system of old-age pensions in Australia in such a way as to remove all possible taint of charity or pauperism from it, and so enable the old people to claim, as a matter of right, the pensions which they themselves have helped to build up during their years of health and vigour. There is not a citizen who has helped to make this country what it is, either as a servant of the State or in his private capacity, who would not be able to draw a pension in a spirit of independent enjoyment that would be impossible if it were provided entirely by the State. In Germany the system I am advocating goes like clockwork. I speak on the authority of a comprehensive report presented two or three years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockburn, who attended the International Conference of Workmen in Rome, and was able to obtain invaluable data at first hand. This report shows that it is possible for the State, while contributing only a minor portion of the combined fund, to build up a system that is universal in its application. In Germany only some of the big traders and largersalaried officials, who are compelled to take out policies, are excluded. On the employer devolves the duty of deducting the contributions from the wages, and he has to add double the amount thus collected. All these individual contributions are placed in a separate fund, so that each person has a separate account. The result is that at seventy years of age a pension of &#163;13 a year is paid, and this is probably regarded to be quite equal to &#163;26 in Australia. So large is the element of thrift, and so great is the accumulation of money, that it is possible in Germany to pay &#163;13 a year, to which the State contributes only &#163;2 10s. Under a scientific actuarial system, to which everybody contributes ; whereas in Australia the whole of the old-age pensions is paid out of the public Treasury, and a large number of the most deserving people are excluded from participation. I give the Treasurer and the Acting Treasurer credit for an efficient and sympathetic administration of the Act ; but the Act itself requires amendment. I know of no better opportunity than the present to bring this matter under the notice of the Government j because I feel that a much better system could be evolved at a cost much smaller than that we at present bear. The whole basis of the old-age pension system ought to be altered and extended in such a way as to cover double the number of recipients, while, at the same time, encouraging thrift, and altogether removing from it any taint of charity, and at a much smaller cost to the State. </para>

            <para>.- To say that I was surprised at the praise of our telephone system by the honorable member for Denison is but to mildly describe my feelings. Had I not known something of the subject, I might have believed him, seeing that he has just returned from his travels through the world, and that he started out with the knowledge of an electrical engineer. I cannot think that the honorable member really believes, as he most forcibly told us he did, .that we have the best possible telephone system. I can prove, without difficulty, that there are other systems very much ahead of what we enjoy here. I am in possession of some little information which, had the honorable member had the advantage of it, would have made him less certain in many of his statements. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of Sydney, of 3rd November, 1910, contained an article on the subject. It is very fortunate that I happen to have the information which I am about to read, because otherwise the House might have been misled by the honorable member for Denison, who I understand is the political electrical authority of the Commonwealth - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>R. Bainton,  M.I.E.E., electrical engineer, who spent  eight  months in America recently studying the telephone systems, said there were many reasons why the automatic telephone must take the place of the manually-operated system. An unlimited number of subscribers  could be connected with the automatic system, whereas 10,000 was about the greatest number that could be comfortably connected with an exchange on the manual system. After 10,000 tha manual exchange became unwieldy, but even with 100,000 on the automatic the simplicity of the system would not be affected. &#34; There are no operators&#39; salaries to pay,&#34; he continued, &#34; nor replacing of the switchboard lamps, as on the central battery system. No cords nor plugs nor jacks are required. There can be no rush of work during busy hours of the day, because each subscriber connects himself. Confusion in the operating-room is thus avoided. The automatic system is popular because of its absolute secrecy. There is no chance of a conversation being interrupted or overheard nor of an attendant at the exchange listening. The operation of calling up a number is not only simple, but quick, and since you are not dependent on any one else, if your number is engaged you know immediately. A subscriber can test his own line for himself. He can call up his own number, and the &#34; busy &#34; signal will ring. That shows that his line to the exchange is in good order. Furthermore, at the main exchange a 10,000- number board can be tested in half-an hour. On the manual system it takes about three hours. Another important point is that the wear and tear on the automatic system is inconsiderable. One .very great advantage of the automatic system is that with it you can justly charge on a flat rate basis. Since there are no attendants, there is no extra expense from a large number of calls, so that the toll rate is unnecessary. There is no need to record the number of calls.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">It is most important that Parliament should have this information, which shows that there are in other parts of the world systems which are as good as, if not better than ours, and less expensive. Any system enabling subscribers to have communication without the intervention of telephone attendants would lead to a great saving of temper. &#34; </para>

He said that subscribers who had had experience with both the automatic and manual system very much preferred the former. The population of the city was 185,000, and a few years ago the Citizens&#39; Independent Telephone Company was formed to bring about their own independent installation, which is now on the automatic system. They have at present actually &#39;connected 17,000 telephones, charging forty-five dollars {&#163;$) a year, and so forcing the Bell (manual) Company to reduce its rates to the same figure from ninety-five dollars, which they were previously charging. Business men now had the two systems connected with their offices, and they could generally make a call with the automatic in one thrid of the time required by the manual. The reason why the Bell Company continued to carry on was because it had been so much longer established, and had long-distanced lines throughout the country. &#34; I visited the main exchange at Columbus,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bainton,</inline> &#34; and there, where the bulk of the calls passed through, I found that the total number of people looking after the automatic apparatus was fifteen.

              <para>- In Sydney, with only 7,000 telephones on a board, there is a staff of about 150, but at Columbus, with 17,000 telephones, only fifteen operators are employed. To continue the quotation -  &#34; We arrived at Honolulu when the  system had been installed about three weeks. It was a holiday, and we thought it would be a good opportunity for the exchange officials to be putting everything in good order. But there were only three people in the building, though there were 2,300 subscribers connected with the exchange. The board was installed for 5,000 subscribers, the building is fireproof, and the arrangements were the best df any svstem we sow.&#34; &#34; The cost of equipment for small boards on the automatic system,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bainton,</inline> &#34; would be considerably more than that of the manual boards, but the cost per subscriber is almost a constant figure, whereas with the manual system board the cost per subscriber increases as the size of the exchange increases. In a city like Sydney the cost of the automatic system would be a little greater than that of the manual system.&#34; T.he automatic system had been put before the Commonwealth Chief Electrical Engineer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Hesketh),</inline> who was impressed with its advantages. </para>

          <para>Let me now give the opinion of a London expert - </para>
          <para>The London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of July 20 last prints, in its engineering supplement, a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Major W.</inline> A. J. O&#39;Meara,. chief engineer of the British Post-office, dealing wilh the automatic telephone. The major is cautious, but it is obvious that he is impressed. &#34; We have yet to learn from actual experience,&#34; he writes, &#34; whether the automatic and the semi-automatic equipments provide sufficient flexibility to cover the wide range of requirements of the British public, how far the mechanism is reliable in the care of such men as we can train to maintain it, and how the cost nf first installation and the annual charges in respect of depreciation, maintenance, and traffic operation compare as a whole with similar costs in respect of existing types of installation. Clearly, if the new designs of equipment on testing out actually &#39; prove in &#39; there can be no doubt as to the course we must be prepared to adopt. &#34; I have to confess that I was much impressed with all that I saw in the fields of automatic telephony, and I feel that infinite credit is due to the manufacturers of the plants for the efficient manner in which the staff detailed to maintain the switch equipments have been trained. &#34; As an instance of the great flexibility of the automatic system, I may mention that whilst I was at Urbana it was demonstrated to me that so far as the selecting devices are concerned, it is possible to arrange for a practically unlimited number of subscribers to be connected to exchanges in a multi-office area. The operation of calling a subscriber, No. 2,401,104, was performed in my presence, the line used being made up of junctions from the Urbana exchange via the University and Champain (Illinois) exchanges and back, via the University to Urbana. &#34; Perhaps of all the interesting questions which were discussed, the most important is that relating to the development of the automatic and semi-automatic equipment. It was my good fortune to see no less than five different types of switch equipment, designed to provide automatic and semi-automatic telephone service, and I also had the advantage of discussing the question of providing service by means of these new types of equipment, not only with those who advocate these systems, but also with those who are opponents of the automatic systems. A matter which has been much debated,&#34; he continues, &#34; is that relating to the probable attitude of the public towards a service provided by means of full automatic systems. The question naturally arises whether the public will take kindly to the task of calling their correspondents when once the novelty of the apparatus has worn off. I think the non-committal answer of &#34; wait and see &#34; is the safest at the present moment. True at the present time, some 200,000 full automatic stations are in operation in North America, and the advocates of the system point to this fact in support of their contention that the public prefer this system. &#34; On the other hand, the opponents of the system claim that it is the novelty of the thing which appeals to the public, and suggest that the users are also stockholders in the operating companies, that the pleasure arising from a feeling of ownership in the plant is responsible for the enthusiasm, where such exists, and that as soon as the plant begins to age, and the service in consequence shows signs of deterioration, the present feeling of satisfaction will give place to one of disgust. The whole question certainly requires the serious consideration of telephone engineers in this country.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Da Costa, writing  to the editor, says - </para>

It may not be known to the public that the city board, so much talked about, is on the next shelf to the old magneto.

There was plenty of evidence of the automatic system giving complete satisfaction. This is best evidenced by the fact that the system is being rapidly extended in that city. In Columbus there are altogether about 17,000 telephones connected with the exchange and automatically operated, so that it will be seen that the system can be successfully applied in larger towns than Sydney, where there are only about 7,000 subscribers. In that city their main central exchange was connected to a number of branch exchanges. The absence of attendance upon the instruments enables them to make a larger number of branch exchanges, and so reduce, the length of line. The automatic system is simple in operation, and prevents any possibility of delay. As soon as you have manipulated the outer dial you are in communication with the telephone of the person  you wish to reach. In the city of Columbus both the common battery system and the automatic system are in operation, and the automatic system is preferred by the general public, as it guarantees an immediate call - although I must say that the attention given under the Bell telephone service in America is excellent..... </para>
            <para class="block">I also saw the installation at Honolulu, described in to-day&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph;</inline> and was informed by the manager that it was displacing an up-to-date common battery system which had only been installed a matter of four or five years. It really takes American spirit of enterprise to &#39; scrap &#39; a new and costly installation like that, but it shows that they realise that the automatic system had important advantages.&#34; </para>

          <para class="block">I should like the honorable member for Denison to allow this information to soak into his mind, so that when next he speaks of the wonderful system in use in the Commonwealth, he will propose its displacement by the automatic system. Four or five members of this Parliament who returned recently from England, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Canada and the United States, speak in very high terms of the automatic system in use there, and tell me that they experienced no trouble whatever in getting into . touch with subscribers. They consider the system is far ahead of anything we have in Australia. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member made two speeches last night, and I am going to deal with this question now. There is one peculiar feature of the Estimates relating to the Federal Capital which I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee. We find that the proposed votes in respect of the Northern Territory and Papua are dealt with under a separate heading, and details are set out; whereas in the case of the Federal Capital we have an item covering a lump sum, and giving absolutely no details. On the last page of the Works and Buildings Estimates honorable members will find a division relating to the Northern Territory, in which are set out items relating to alterations to the Darwin hospital, artesian water bores, roads, fords and bridges, and so forth. All the details are set out, and the Government are bound by the items given. Then, again, in the General Estimates, the cost of administration is specified in every case, and details given. In connexion with the Federal Territory, however, we are asked to vote a lump sum of ,&#163;100,000 under these Estimates, and we are told that that lump sum includes ,&#163;15,000 in respect of administration and survey. I take strong exception to the cost of administration being included in a vote for Works and Buildings. Why is it not included in the General Estimates, as is the case in regard to the cost of administration of the Northern Territory and Papua ? Why, also, are not the works and buildings to be carried out at the Federal Capital distinctly specified? </para>

              <para>- But some trcable arose in connexion with the purchase of lands. The route of the railway would probably traverse private lands, and the Government wanted to take possession of the whole of the lands, instead of taking some piecemeal. This year we were told that it is proposed to expend money on a weir on the Cotter, a bridge over the Murrumbidgee, a pipe line, a temporary railway, a power plant, a brickmaking plant, a roadmaking plant, and timber. But we do not know how much money is to be spent on each of those works, though full details are given, with regard to the Northern Territory. For instance, there is .&#163;500 for the Pine Creek railway. Surely, we have just as much right&#39; to ask for details regarding expenditure in the Capital Territory. We ought not to vote hundreds of thousands of pounds without knowing how the money is to be spent. There ought to be a Department for the Territory, and a clear idea ought to be given to us as to what the Government propose to do. This idea of giving a free hand is totally unsound. I can quite understand honorable members who are desirous of seeing the Federal Capital established beginning to get alarmed and&#39; <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> fear that the country will object to this wild expenditure. I am quite prepared to join with any other honorable member in taking a stand for the express purpose of compelling the Government to come down with clear and distinct estimates of expenditure, with particulars as to how much they propose to spend on particular works, and how long a period the expenditure is proposed to cover. We must put an end to this blank-cheque business. As &#163;50,000 was voted last year without any details being furnished, we can hardly blame the Government for asking for ,&#163;100,000 thisyear. I should not wonder if they asked for &#163;250,000 next year. There is a rebate of &#163;33,000 on account of last year&#39;s vote. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased to hear that. In the first year after I was returned to this House I was very much surprised that men experienced in parliamentary affairs should have allowed such a silly system to continue as that which we have had in connexion with expenditure. What takes place is this : A sum of money is placed on the Estimates for building a postoffice, say, at Croajingalong, or Buckley&#39;s Crossing. On 30th June, after the expenditure is authorized by Parliament, the unexpended balance of the vote goes back into the Treasury. I am inclined to think that the Treasury looks upon these unexpended balances as a kind of nest egg with which they are able to inflate their revenue for the next year. On the present Estimates, there is a sum of &#163;1,000 for a post-office at South Melbourne. Between the present time and the end of the financial year, not more than that sum may be required to be paid to the contractor. But if the full amount is not expended, the balance will go back into the Treasury on 30th June next, and between that date and the time when Parliament votes the necessary money again, either the contractor will be deprived of the cheques that are due to him, or the work will have to be stopped. I trust that the Home Affairs Department and the Treasury will come to an understanding so that even if the whole of a sum voted is not spent at the end of the financial year, the works for which the money was voted will not be suspended. </para>

              <para>- The amount appropriated stood at ^5,000 for some years. Last year it was .&#163;1,500; this year it is &#163;1,000. I make no complaint on that score, because I am aware that not more than &#163;1,000 will be required to be paid to the contractor before the end of the present financial year. I shall be rather pleased if the ^&#163;600,000 mentioned by the Treasurer is devoted to works of that character, so that there may be no stoppage of operations. The Prime Minister has already said that it would be used for works extending over many years, instead of closing them up at the end of one financial year. That is the common-sense way in which all Commonwealth works should be carried on. I have never been able to thoroughly grasp why the other system has been followed so long. We- have found Treasurers coming down for a- sort of indemnifying vote years after moneys have been expended. The right honorable member for Swan on one occasion objected to certain moneys being passed for payment, and it transpired that some of the amounts had been spent during his own <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> some two years before. The idea now put forward by the Treasurer is a good one, and I hope it will be extended, always on condition that a complete schedule is presented in each case, so that we may know what the money is being used for. I hope the Treasurer will take into consideration the advisability of coining our own bullion in Australia. He says that we lose nothing by having it coined in Europe, but we have three mints in Australia, and the present staffs, with additional hands and more machinery, could coin the whole of our money, and we know that the demand for silver and copper coinage in Australia will increase every year. That work will give a great deal of employment, and involve a great saving, because it must cost many thousands of pounds to have our coinage produced in other countries. It is not my intention in the future to oppose any votes for the Federal Capital site at Canberra, because I recognise that it has been selected, and that we shall have to make the best of it, bad though it may be. We are, however, not treating the land-holders in the Federal Territory properly. They are under great disabilities, which ought to be immediately removed. The land of some of them is partly in the Federal Territory, and partly in New South Wales, and in those cases they do not know what to do. Perhaps the part cut out is the worst part of a man&#39;s holding, but if he sells it cheaply it may be taken as the value of the rest of his land. Many land-owners there have their &#34;property mortgaged, and the mortgages are falling due. It is a matter of great difficulty for them to get a new mortgage arranged for, in view of the present insecure tenure. In justice to them, some arrangement ought to be made in the Treasury for taking over almost immediately the land of&#39; those who desire that course to be followed. I hope the Minister of Home Affairs will see that those people get a fair deal in the very near future. </para>

            <para>. - Sooner or later the silver coinage will have &#39;to be made in Australia. It was only minted overseas for the sake of convenience. There is a great deal to be said for the contention of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the work ought to be done here, and the Government will take it into favorable consideration. With re-, gard to the end of the financial year, it is a constitutional provision that the accountsmust close once a year. The amount of &#163;600,000 referred to is for special works that will bring the Post and Telegraph. Department up to date. At the same time,, provision will be made more than in any other year for the continuance of those works. </para>

            <para>.- A number of complaints have been made with reference to the accommodation at the post-offices in our big cities. I notice that we are suffering from a great lack of accommodation for the Federal public offices in Melbourne, which are being pushed out here, there, and everywhere ; and I presume the same thing applies to every capital city in the Commonwealth. A number of build- ings have had to be rented, and it is about time we pushed on more vigorously with the erection of the Commonwealth offices now in progress in Melbourne, lt stems an iniquitous system to keep on paying rent.  1  do not know whether the Melbourne building is progressing as expeditiously as it might. </para>

              <para>- It should have been made large enough to accommodate as many of - the Departments as possible; but we are increasing our rent roll instead of decreasing it. There is an ever-increasing expenditure in connexion with the Government Printing Office; and, in my opinion, the arrangements in this connexion are not of a businesslike nature. The same remark may be made of the Customs Department in the administration of the Commerce Act. We have to pay through the nose for services rendered by the State Departments ; and our printing is now so extensive that it is time we had an office of our own. We already have a branch for the printing of the Commonwealth notes and for the printing of the postage stamps; and we are . expending, I suppose, ,&#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000 annually in printing. Further, there are conditions, particularly in the printing office, that should not be tolerated by any Government who believe in paying their employes well. Complaints on&#39; this score are sometimes made to Federal members and sometimes to State members ; and, between the two stools, the unfortunate men and women, who perform their work efficiently, come to the ground. It is to the credit of the Prime Minister that he has been prepared to say that, the Commonwealth will pay a fair price for the work done; but when we are spending so much I object to have to go practically cap in hand and request the State to make reforms. I believe that the Agricultural Department nf Victoria is charging more than is fair for the services rendered to- the Commonwealth, and this and the other :items I have mentioned are among those on which we can save money. There are one or two roads in the Commonwealth that might very well be made military roads. On either side of the road leading to the cordite works at Maribyrnong the Commonwealth has purchased land for horse depots, and thus deprived the shire council of rateable property and revenue ; and yet the local authorities are expected to construct and keep the road in repair. I am glad that a vote in this connexion is on the Estimates; but more expenditure is necessary to make the road passable. In my opinion, we have lost considerably by the road not being constructed long before now. As to the discussion on these and similar topics, members on the Government side very often suffer from selfeffacement that does not do them any -good or credit as representatives, and this, I may say, is largely because of the loquacity of the Opposition. Later I shall have some remarks to make oil the telephone system in both town and country, and also on the question of the Federal Capital site. As to the latter, I can now speak from personal observation, whereas previously I could only speak on information supplied by Ministers who had previously denounced the site as the worst on earth. Since my- visit I am more than ever convinced that it is about the most undesirable place in which we could have the Capital. I was looking forward to this project to show what could be done under Government control without hindrance from the High Court or State limitations ; .but, unfortunately, in consequence of the collusion between members on- the Opposition and Government sides, there is little opportunity for honorable members to revoke the very undesirable compact that has been entered into. </para>

            <para>. - I do not know what my right honorable friend means when he says that we on this side are not to have more time than the Government speakers. I do not know what time he is alluding to. My experience is that all the arrangements made with the Government this session for the early termination of debates have simply resulted in letting loose a flood of eloquence on the other side. Honorable members opposite seem to be as dumb as oysters until some arrangement has been entered into with this side, and then they flood the chamber with oratory as though they would never stop. I do not understand that sort of thing at all. As regards this sitting, I do not see what the Government have to complain of. We discussed grievances for two hours only- </para>

              <para>- We discussed grievances for two hours before complaints began to be made. Had we on this side appointed the Sugar Commission, honorable members opposite would have discussed the appointment for days, not for hours. Really, it is time that they stopped these mock heroics which they are getting up every day. It is coming to this, it seems to me, that the Opposition will not be expected to speak at all. But I am afraid that we shall have to do a little talking, despite the Caucus. &#39; We do not settle things beforehand, and so we have to do our talking in the House. There seems to be a spirit abroad on the Government side that, because they have an overwhelming majority, therefore nothing should occur on this side. The sooner they get that silly notion out of their heads, the better for us all, and the better for the good temper of the House. I said nothing about the Sugar Commission to-day. I had some notes prepared, and was quite expecting to speak, but when the debate had proceeded till 10 o&#39;clock, I waived my right to speak on the subject. And this is the reward we are getting. I hope that the Works and Building Estimates, will be passed without unnecessary delay. I am anxious to see them put through ; but when the Prime Minister talks in a minatory tone, as he has done -to-night, I have to express the hope that he will be a little reasonable. </para>
