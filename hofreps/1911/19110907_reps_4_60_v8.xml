                    <para>- In consequence of what was said during the discussion of the Supply Bill on Tuesday, I asked the Minister of Defence to inform me as to what has been done for the encouragement of rifle shooting. He has supplied me with a return which shows that the grants for rifle ranges amounted in 1907-8 to £10,452 ; in 1908-9, to , £20,191; and in 1909-10, to £25,562. For the year 1910-11 the appropriation was £47,866 ; the figures as to expenditure are not available. The grants to rifle clubs, at 5s. per efficient, amounted in the years I have named, to £6,474, £7,530. £8,446, and £9,200, respectively. </para>

                        <para>- The statement was made that it is the policy of the Government to discourage rifle clubs, but the figures show that it is not. For the encouragement of rifle shooting, in addition to the grants I have named, and not including free ammunition, there was appropriated in 1908-9, £8,305 ; and in 1909-10, as well as in 1910-11, £8,875. The expenditure on rifle clubs has Increased from £10,795in 1908-9 to £23,058 in 1910-11, and this latter amount does not include a special appropriation of £15,718 for a site and range in the metropolitan area of Brisbane. </para>

This the Minister declined to do, but subsequently it was arranged to grant leave of absence to selected officers, non-commissioned officers, and cadets. The issue on loan of arms and equipment, the issue of camp equipment during camp before embarkation, and the services of two noncommissioned officers to assist at the preliminary camp were also arranged. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Wynne</inline> was informed that the Government would accept no financial responsibility in connexion with the visit.

He wrote a personal letter to Lord Haldane. the Secretary of State for War, asking that the cadets should be given a place on the line of the procession, and it was promised that this should be done, and that other facilities would be arranged for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> went to meet the cadets on their arrival in London.

                            <para>. - One has to be prepared for many surprises in approaching this session after our long recess. Adequate mention has been made during this debate of the gloom cast over the House by the passing away of two comrades whom we all esteemed. We have had full proof that those gentlemen have been replaced by very vigorous members. The striking feature of the debate so far as it has gone has been the method of attack adopted by the Opposition. I received a great surprise when listening yesterday, as I always do with a certain amount of pleasure, to the able painting of word pictures by the Leader of the Opposition. When the honorable member set up a nice straw bogy and christened it " disloyalty," I wondered for some time what he was getting at. It seemed to me that the long recess had been leading the honorable member into indulgence in bad dreams or jim-jams, and that he had come to the House without the effects of his nightmares being quite cleared from his mind, but when the honorable member for North Sydney followed in a similar strain, bombarding the House for two and a half hours on the same subject, I began to see a little daylight through the position of the Opposition. It seems that the administration of the present Government has been sufficiently good to obviate anything like severe criticism from the Opposition. There has been nothing outrageous in the conduct of the Government, nothing to' which the direct attention of the people, or with which to awake the enthusiasm of the anti-Labour daily press. Why, the Labour Government have actually got through as well as past Governments have done. We are still here, Australia is actually solvent, there is no ruination, everything is jogging along beautifully, and all this in face of the fact that those horrible Labour people are sitting on the Government benches. </para>

                            <para>- Just imagine a country being prosperous under Labour government ! That is really the most startling admission yet made by an Opposition. We have been led to believe ever since the Labour party came into existence that, once it got on to the Government benches, there would be nothing but " blue ruin " for the country. We were further given to understand that ordinary " common or garden " representatives of the working classes could not possibly successfully carry the honours of office at an Imperial Conference. All the same, we have had a delegation consisting of a Labour Prime Minister with his colleagues representing us at such a Conference, and accurately* carefully, and without a spice of Jingoism, placing before those who direct the affairs of the Empire the views of the Australian people on defence. And our Ministers have come back with the information that the proposals submitted by them ort a previous occasion have been adopted by the Admiralty as the basis of the Australian Navy. I have no desire to detract from the proposals or efforts of honorable gentlemen opposite, but I think we may claim that we have approached this question in a solid common-sense way, without any frothing at the mouth. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday beat round the bush, and, by innuendo, supported the allegation that there is a certain spirit of disloyalty within a section of this Parliament. Such an attitude is unworthy of the honorable gentleman. </para>

I am pleased, of course,- that the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for North Sydney have given the cue to the attitude of the Opposition. We now have a distinct pledge from a party-, the members of which are prepared to  ' Mafeking ' ' the whole time - to protest and protest again their great loyalty.

Who can doubt for one instant the loyalty of any man who realizes the benefit conferred on us by our present political system? I challenge any honorable member opposite to say that, in any shape or form, the Government have been disloyal. As the discussion proceeded yesterday we very soon found the kernel of the matter. It was put to us that we are behind the movement of men who desire to meet force with force if occasion requires. I am well aware that there is a number of our comrades, followers and fellow-workers - and we are always proud to acknowledge them as fellow-workers, notwithstanding the attitude of the honorable member for North Sydney and others - who hold the opinion that militarism in no shape or form should not be allowed to take any hold in Australia. We are quite prepared to accept the honorable member's quotations as facts ; but we have had all these protestations before. During the whole of the time that the defence proposals have been in drafting, there has been this cross-firing from- sections of the community ; and I am rather pleased that the replies of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and the resolutions on the subject, have emphasized the fact that a nation armed is a nation that can guard itself either internally or externally. If we put a rifle into every man's hands we cannot anticipate a repetition of history - we cannot think of the military being called out to, in brutal fashion, to shoot down unarmed citizens. There is every reason why we, as liberty-loving citizens, should wish to see every man carrying his rifle, because when the day comes to make a demonstration the citizens will be able to come out on parade and make it peaceably. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently we are being overwhelmed with advice on military matters from the other side. Yesterday we listened to a speech for two hours and a half from the honorable member for North Sydney, and now we are being told more of the same kind of nonsense. I may say, with all modesty, however, that I am quite prepared to uphold my own ideas on the question without advice from the other side. The honorable member for North Sydney, who was so lavish with his advice, was so sure on the question that he was not satisfied with present-day history. Neither the Lithgow nor the Liverpool strike, nor any trouble of that kind, was of any use to him. He had to go to far-off India, and to declare that one Keir Hardie, a member of the Labour movement, and of the British House of Commons, had preached sedition there, with the result that there was likely to be trouble in that land. Despite what may be said to the contrary by the Press, I wish "to give that statement an emphatic denial. I am in a position to do so since I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie to give me all particulars in regard to this very matter. In his reply he told me that, as we all know, an agitation has been going on in India for many years. The natives are becoming educated, and many of them wince under British rule. Rightly or wrongly, they feel that British rule in India is irksome, and who will say that the administration there is perfect? I am not going to say that it is. At the same time I recognise that the British Government have a very difficult problem  to face in India, and in retaining possession of it, and I am prepared to admit that many items of administration which would appear very harsh in a country like Australia may be quite unavoidable in India. The peoples of that country - and they are many - have their own papers, printed in their own dialects, circulating in every direction, and those who have read the history of those peoples know 'that they have a very great reverence for any man who poses as a prophet. Consequently when it was announced in the native Press that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie was about to visit ; India, that he was practically a saviour of the people, that he advocated the cause of the down-trodden, the helpless, the weak, the invalid, and the poor, the people, given as they are to hero-worship, rushed the railway station at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie was to take train for the country districts. The news of his coming went in advance of him. For some time prior to his arrival a great drought had prevailed, and there was a famine in the land. Just as he reached India, however, the drought commenced to break, and, strange to say, as he travelled from district to district, the welcome rain seemed to travel with him. The natives in this way came to entertain the idea that he was a prophet, and had something to do with the downpour. Here, indeed, was a saviour of the people come from Great Britain to India, and with his coming there was a glorious downfall of the welcome rain ! Naturally the people were worked up to a high pitch of excitement, and they flocked in tens of thousands to the railway stations through which his train passed. Indeed, so great were the crowds that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie had at last to keep his movements secret. He did not address the natives except to say a few words. He made no special tour of India, and yet the honorable member has told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie, a member of the British Parliament) preached sedition in India. I have entered into these details only to show how ridiculous is the foundation on which honorable members opposite build up straw bogies simply to knock them down again. It was not enough that the Leader of the Opposition should build up the bogy of probable disloyalty; the honorable member felt that he must go one better. He suggested a principle which I am ashamed to find any Australian advocating. He told us that this Parliament ought not to have the right of determining whether or not the Australian Army should be placed at the disposal of the British Government. Our Parliament, according to him, is not to be trusted with the control of either the army or the navy. Such a thing is so unthinkable, so inconceivable, from the Australian stand-point that I can hardly understand an honorable member in his full senses giving expression to it. Not only have we always taken up the stand to which the honorable member objects, but some honorable members opposite have also done so. This Parliament, as a Parliament, has stood up for this right, and I trust that the day will never come when we shall relinquish that attitude with regard to either the army or the navy of the Commonwealth. Jingoism run mad may seem a very excellent thing, but the representatives of those who have to pay the taxes to provide the cost of our naval and military system and to do the fighting should at least have a voice in determining where the expenditure shall be made and as to what generally ought to be done.  Another laughable statement made by the honorable member for North Sydney was that the Labour party had been dragooned into the acceptance of compulsory military training. The honorable member said he was astonished that we had adopted it, and expressed the opinion that we had probably been dragooned into it by the Attorney-General.  His  statement serves only to show his ignorance of the procedure of our party. I can forgive - in fact, I can sympathize with - him, since I understand that he disowns the principle of the caucus, and upholds the right of the Leader of the Opposition to lay down a policy and to dragoon every member of his party into supporting it. Such a thing has never happened in the history of our party, and I should like to know what member of the Labour Government would dare to try to dragoon the Labour party into supporting a policy of which they did not approve. Such a thing has never happened, and I hope it never will. Every honorable member on this side of the House has a voice in determining the policy of the Government, so that when we go to the constituencies we are able to say that we have all shared in the making of the laws passed while our Administration was in power. We are not in the painful position of honorable members of the Opposition, who have to accept the administration of this man or that and to stand or fall by it regardless of whether or not they 162 <inline font-style="italic">Governor-General's Speech:</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Address-in-Reply.</inline> have had a hand in determining it. The whole of our party has a voice in the work of building up the system of laws that we wish to see placed on the statute-book. At the same time, it is only fair to say that the Labour Government are " oysters " as far as Cabinet secrets, which they have no right to disclose, are concerned. I do not think a member of our party would even dream of asking a Minister to disclose secrets that ought not to be divulged. We fully recognise that in every Administration there must be secrets known only to the Cabinet, and not one of us would insult a Minister by asking him to divulge any of them. If any of us did so, we know what the reply would be. I was rather surprised to hear certain allusions made to the cost of sending the delegation of honorable members to England to take part in the Coronation celebrations. We were told first of all that members of the Labour party were the meanest people on earth, because they declined to plunge into the heavy expenditure that would have been involved in sending to England a contingent of cadets, and also a contingent of soldiery, and then we were criticised because the Prime Minister and two of his colleagues went Home at the public cost. Surely that is not playing the game fairly. Has not a similar procedure been adopted by other Ministries? Have not members of other Administrations gone Home and stayed as long as it was necessary for them to remain there? Investigation shows that the first delegate sent to England by the Australian Parliament - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton - required £1,850 to defray his expenses. We did not demur at that expenditure. I am not advocating for a moment that unnecessary expenditure should be incurred; but I hold that when it is necessary for public men to go and represent Australia at these conferences we should not take up a mean attitude. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to be fair to the honorable member. I would not desire for one moment to misrepresent him. I protest most emphatically against either the Army or the Navy being removed from the control of this Parliament. One of the most remarkable utterances of the honorable member was that he would not think of fighting tyrants at Home - that he would not think of going out and defending the people against armies, and that he was astounded at the continual cry of this side for the worker, the worker, the worker. He suggested that we could see nobody else, and had no other sentiment. Now, whom do we class as the worker? Who are the people whom we are fighting for, and putting legislation through for? I have stated scores of times on platforms that we look upon the workers as the wealth-producers of the country. I refer to the miners, the farmers, the wage-earners, the civil servants, and the legitimate business men. But outside those persons there is a class of men who are trying to live on the workers the whole time, and who have been frequently referred to by writers as " the criminal rich." Although we may only have them here to a small degree, they have grown very numerous in the United States of America and we fear that when we do become as large a people they may grow as strong here as there. A great writer - Lloyd - in referring to this question, makes these remarks, which I think are worthy of some thought :  - </para>

                        <para>The criminal rich - those who appropriate the labour of others in one age by brute strength, and in another by brute wealth - are to-day degrading competition into a rivalry of adulteration. The control of machinery of the exchanges is the control of prices, and control of prices is control of property. </para>

                    <para class="block">If you control the property of the people you control their lives. These are the kind of men whom we sought to bring to book at the referendum. We asked the people of Australia to take to themselves further powers, so that they might protect themselves from the brutal rich. We have no objection to any man becoming wealthy by his own labours; we have no objection to any man who succeeds by legitimate industry; but we have an objection to the brutality of those who, through the medium of their wealth and power, seek to rob others of what is justly theirs. Honorable members on the other side will live to rue the day when they went from pillar to post throughout the Commonwealth and threw dust in the eyes of the people, asking them not to give themselves the power to protect themselves. That is practically what honorable members did, although they did not put their appeal in that way. They tried to make out that some foreign party, as it were, was seeking power. By the time the questions are again submitted, the people will know that it is they themselves who are to get the power to protect themselves through the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members on this side feel very much like myself, that we must have justice for the people, the wealth-creators in this country, and that if there is no means of getting that justice except by amending the Constitution to give this Parliament the necessary powers we must pursue that course ; but we hope that, by the time the questions are again submitted, the people will have realized the fact that their enemies were those who prevented them before from getting this power to' assist themselves to the legislation which they require. I blush for shame when I think - and I say it with regret - that it was assistance from our ranks which enabled honorable gentlemen opposite to defeat our proposals at the last referendum. Although five of the Labour parties in five of the States remained loyal, there were men in the party in another State who were not loyal. </para>

Does he not know that every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth raised the cry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was against the referenda ? Why was he against them ? Because he was disloyal to Labour? No. He was against them because he had joined honorable members opposite in the cry of " State Rights." I am prepared to believe that the good sense of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> and other members of his party will lead them to see that it is necessary to give to the Federal Parliament extended powers, because the State Parliaments cannot effectually exercise the powers that we desire to possess. How can representatives of the people in the State Parliaments do what is required when, as soon as they attempt to touch the sacred rights of entrenched property the dear old Upper Houses will be there to protect them ? The Upper Houses in the State Parliaments are so Tory that any advance whatever towards an alteration of the present system, or towards clipping the wings of the trusts, is blocked by them. That is why I wonder why Labour men who profess to believe in our great policy should appear to hesitate, as thousands of them did at the referenda, because of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman's</inline> attitude. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to put it to the people who desire to see Democracy triumphant in Australia that those who oppose the proposal to give greater powers to the Federal Parliament must know that what they aim at cannot be secured by the State Parliaments, because there the Upper Houses block every advance. Indeed, even if the Upper Houses could be wiped out, the State Parliaments could only legislate within their own territories. Their laws would only run to their own boundaries, whereas Commonwealth law runs through the whole of Australia. It would be useless from the point of view of the people of Australia, as a whole, to clip the wings of an Upper House of any one State, and God forbid that that spirit should ever prevail in our movement ! I trust that the Labour movement will be. as wide as the confines of Australia, that its principles will extend throughout the British Empire, and that they will ultimately permeate the world. Wherever there are brother human beings - wherever there are men fighting for a cause that is right - I trust that our party will assist them to the extent of their power. It is a most contemptible, mean, petty, and parochial attitude to take up for any one to say, " I am all right, let the rest go hang." The matters affected by the referenda were of such serious importance that I believe that when the people of this country come to a full realization of the trick that was played upon them, when they know of the amount of wealth that was poured out against us in that campaign, when they learn that those who were concerned in trusts, pools, and combines rallied their forces behind our opponents, they will avenge themselves once for all by wiping out our political enemies. That is what I think must happen. We are quite safe in trusting the people as a whole. The Jingoistic spirit to which the previous  speaker  appealed belongs, let me tell him, to the dead past. It no longer has any effect upon the people of this country. Indeed, if the honorable member were to attempt to incite Britishers in their own land by talk of that kind he would get even shorter shrift than awaits him in Australia. The people have got beyond that kind of thing. Nowadays we look to realities. And let us not forget that while in connexion with an event like the Coronation there may be a display of enormous wealth - of wealth so great, in fact, as to have a tremendous effect upon the people, and to be followed by terrific strikes - there are nevertheless millions in this Empire who require justice, and demand it, and look forward to the realization of their demands. I refer to the workers whose claims must be considered, lt is their cause that we, on our side, are proud to be fighting for. An honorable member near me interjects that they will soon assert themselves. God forbid that they should ever assert themselves by revolution in any direction ! We want them to assert themselves through the ballot-box.. We do not want to have such revolution as the honorable member for Parkes preached. He said that if the voting at the referenda had been favorable to the Labour party there would have been revolution in Australia. We even pictured the honorable member himself riding through the streets, as a revolutionary leader, in a comic uniform and waving a flag. Passing from these considerations I wish to thank the honorable member for North Sydney for laying his ideas on defence before us so frankly. We certainly know what his attitude is. We perceive that there is a direct cleavage. We understand that while we stand for all that is solid and straightforward there are other people in the community who stand for ail that is frothy and high sounding. I would urge the honorable member not to be too modest. Let us have his ideas on other subjects. He must have a great fund of knowledge on other political matters, and if he will only be as frank concerning them as he was on the question of defence we shall appreciate his speeches. T wish to get back to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition on the Tariff. I know that honorable members will give me credit for being an enthusiastic Protectionist, and I wish to say that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter at the present time strikes me as rather peculiar,- in view of his knowledge of the whole history of the Tariff, and the promises which he has made in this House from time to time in regard to new Protection. How could a Labour Minister face the people of Australia with a proposal for increased Protection in view of the result of the referenda, and the refusal to grant to the workers their fair share of the benefits of Protection? The Leader of the Opposition suggests that the Minister of Trade and Customs should at once re-open the  Tariff.  That would be a grand thing to do at the present juncture when there is so much else to do. The Minister of Trade and Customs has in this matter taken up a rational attitude. He has told the manufacturers of Australia the information he requires, and they refuse to tell him what lie wishes to know. He issued to them a list of questions, which we are told are utterly outrageous and inquisitorial. I am very pleased that the Minister has laid these questions before honorable members, and in glancing through them I must say that I have noticed none which might not be fairly answered by any straightforward business man. Manufacturers are guaranteed by letter that information supplied in the replies to the questions will be kept in the strictest confidence, and treated in the same way as confidential information acquired in the ordinary administration of the Customs Department is treated. We know well that in the preparation of a Tariff confidential officers of the Customs Department are in the way of obtaining information which it would be very profitable to them to divulge. But we have no record that these officers have ever divulged such information at any time. It is then pure subterfuge to say, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that manufacturers refuse to have their business secrets exposed in the way proposed by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Manufacturers who come to the Government begging favours in the way of increased Protection for the industries in which they are engaged should be prepared to state the facts connected with those industries. I must admit that there may be some little difference in the stand-point from which the questions submitted to the manufacturers are viewed. For instance, they are asked to say what capital is invested in their industry. Surely, from their point of view that is an outrage? Then they are asked to state the total value of the output of their factories. That is an awful question. Then they are asked what wages they are paying, and the total amount paid in wages. 166 <inline font-style="italic">Governor-General's Speech.:</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES] <inline font-style="italic">Address-in-Reply.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">If such questions were correctly answered, it is possible that, after going through the replies, the Minister would have a shrewd idea as to whether a manufacturing establishment was making a little fortune for the proprietor or not. He might be able to say whether we are justified in, maintaining so high a rate of Protection for the benefit of that industry. What a horrible thing it would be from the stand-point of those carrying on protected industries if the country were to get to know which industries were worth protecting and which were not. Viewing the matter from our stand-point we recognise that the public of Australia have to bear the burden of taxation. We are willing to justify the expenditure of a certain amount of capital in industries through encouragement afforded by a Tariff, but we claim that the public should share in the benefits derived from that encouragement, that the workers in the various industries should receive decent wages, and the consumers obtain the articles manufactured at reasonable prices. I should, for my part, like to see the proposals submitted at the referenda extended. I say that the day will come in Australia, and I hope it will be before very long, when a further power will be demanded for the Federal Parliament, and that is the power to nationalize distribution. Every day we live the fact is being forced upon us that if we raise wages, and better the conditions of workers, we have those in our midst who, by charging higher prices and higher rents, do away with the benefits we hoped would follow from the increase of wages. The increases in rents and the cost of living are crying questions to-day. Rents' are going up by leaps and bounds. It is scandalous the way in which landlords in Sydney tell the people that rents are going up because of the land tax. Landlords who do not pay a farthing in land tax are making it the excuse for raising the rent of four-roomed cottages from10s. to  15s.  a week. I feel so strongly upon this matter that I would support a resolution to nationalize all distribution in order that we might wipe out for ever the middleman, who is always so ready to take the earnings from the people, whether they are producers or wage-earners. </para>

In America to-day rents are so high, and the cost of living so great, that the American people are on the verge of a revolution. We have only to go amongst the poor in Melbourne and Sydney, and other large cities of Australia, to hear very deep rumblings of discontent from the same cause. Are we to sit idle and inept, unable to do anything to relieve the people from these burdens ? We tried our best in submitting the referenda proposals to take a step in the right direction, by securing the power to deal with monopolies, and those opposed to our proposals refused us the power to assist the people. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do so with pleasure. I heartily congratulate the Government on proposing to strike the first blow at high rents by coming down with a national banking proposal. The first blow will be struck at high rents when we find cheap money for the people who wish to have their own homes, and to pay no rent. My idea is that every man should have his own home, and should not be obliged to pay rent. </para>

These dividends are paid all the time with the people's money. Who have built all the noble institutions in which private banking operations are carried on ? It is the people - the workers and producers. I am aware that I should infringe the rules of debate by dealing in detail with the proposal for the establishment of a National Bank. </para>

He knows as well as I do that the whole of the money used in banking operations is provided by the people. He is also aware that the private banks do not lend money only - they merely allow credit - and it is for that credit that the people pay interest. He knows, too, that a bank can have nothing better than a constant stream of interest flowing into it, whilst its security is daily becoming enhanced because of the instalments which are being paid off the principal. </para>

                            <para>- No Government which I am supporting will make itself ridiculous by bringing down any scheme for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank which does not enter into all legitimate channels of business - which does not cover everything except risky speculation.  1  wish specially to leave risky speculation to the private banks. When the Banking Bill is brought forward I shall have an opportunity of discussing it in detail, and therefore I shall not examine the proposal minutely now. But I feel sure that the creation of such an institution as a Commonwealth Bank will mark one of the great departures which is needed to secure to those who earn wealth in Australia their fair proportion of that wealth. No doubt as the years roll on everybody will be advantaged by the scheme. Even the man who preens himself that he is a capitalist will not be injured by it, because the National Bank will be open to him just as it will be open to everybody else. Ever since banking operations were initiated the curse of the system has been the high rates of interest and compound interest which have been charged. In fact, one great writer has said that of all the imps that Satan ever used to defeat mankind in their attempt to set up anything like a heaven upon earth the most powerful was interest. I do not intend to dilate upon the other proposals which are contained in the Government programme. I trust that we shall push through this session with all expedition. I was rather pleased to hear the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government are determined to press forward to their completion the measures which are outlined in the Governor-General's Speech. </para>

The honorable member knows that it will be the fault of the party with which he is associated if the measures in question do not become law within a few months. If each Bill be subjected only to reasonable criticism the entire programme can be disposed of within the period I have indicated. To me it is a pleasure to see the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in such a genial frame of mind. </para>

                            <para>- What I said was that I would nationalize commercial; distribution. But I would be pleased to see the. trafficker in land also disappear. Those gentlemen who condemn land nationalization are only too frequently delighted to sell a piece of land to a widow arid then to foreclose upon her because of  a little mortgage. I warn honorable members not to say too much of land trafficking in Australia, because, if they do, they will hear something so unsavoury that they will wish they had not spoken. I do not desire to enter into this matter exhaustively, because honorable members opposite knew perfectly well when the leaflet which I have quoted was issued, that the States retained the right absolutely to deal with the lands of this country. But I wish to thank them for this class of literature because, if there is one thing more than another which educates the public to an appreciation of the true position, it is the lies which are circulated broadcast, and the dust which is thrown into their eyes during a political campaign. When they come to realize, in their quiet moments, now they have been tricked, betrayed, and mocked, I feel sure that they will, at ":he earliest opportunity, mete out condign punishment to those who so egregiously misled them. </para>

                            <para>.- In his vigorous speech, the honorable member for New England said, with great truth, that England has a very difficult problem to face in India. I only wish that we were always fully conscious of the difficulties and responsibilities which beset the Mother Country in connexion with that portion of the Empire and with the races of the East. A few days ago a deputation to the Minister of External Affairs requested that the wife of a Chinaman should be permitted to remain in Australia, although she is a prohibited immigrant. The Minister very properly replied that he was compelled by the Act to refuse admittance to all prohibited immigrants. I think that compliance with the provisions of the Act is obligatory upon him, though, in my view, the measure is scarcely worthy of this Parliament. In 1901 we passed legislation which recognised that details of the kind under discussion did not touch the principle which we have all at heart - the preservation of a white race in Australia - and allowed married women and children under eighteen to accompany their husbands and fathers. All ethnologists tell us that a pure race is the best, if inspiration, efficiency, and a sense of nationality are desired. I have the highest respect for the Eastern races; but by reason of biological laws, it is impossible for European and Eastern races to acquire the same degree of efficiency by intermixture that each can acquire separately. For that reason I helped to put on the statute-book the legislation to which I have referred. We should not forget, however, that the civilization of China is much older than our own, and that her standards of education are high, and in these days of keen competition, we should do nothing to irritate and anger nations with whom we and the Empire at large have such important trade relations. The Eastern races in India, China, and Japan number something like 670,000,000, and I hope that the Government, with a sense of statesmanship and fairness, will consider whether it is not possible to regard their <inline font-style="italic">amour</inline><inline font-style="italic">propre</inline> by providing, in accordance with the law which was in force up to 1905, that men married before that year can have their wives here. Such legislation would in no way prejudice the maintenance of a White Australia. If we irritate nations with which the Mother Country has so often to negotiate, and whose positions she must consider, we do not act on what, I hope, is the growing sense of our Imperial obligations. I am glad that the Prime Minister has returned in vigorous health, just as he expressed pleasure at finding the Leader of the Opposition in the same state. He told us that we are to have another officer interposed between this responsible Parliament and the Public Service. I regret this growing taste for the placing of services under  Commissioners,  and under the control of men. who, from their official position, are of bureaucratic temper and irresponsibility. </para>

We have fixed the rates of pay for certain -grades, and have left it to the Public Service Commissioner to make the classification. That opens up possibilities of dispute as to whether the classification is right or wrong, and it is proposed that the determination shall be left to a Court. We shall have to obey the findings of that Court, although the Judge may be no better able than the Commissioner to come to a correct decision. Indeed, the Commissioner is an expert, whose business it is to ascertain what is being done in the Departments, and what the work is worth; while the other, although he may be legally trained, and have a well-balanced mind, is not an expert. </para>

                                <para>- We determine that certain rates shall be paid, with automatic increases, according to classification, leaving transfers from one class to another to the Commissioner. The Prime Minister yesterday threw out what seemed to be an invitation to New Zealand to join the Federation ; but are we likely, when asking for the extension of powers which the people rejected by 259,000 votes, to induce the Dominion to join us ? What ground of expediency or common sense could induce it to enter a Federation in which the local industries would be controlled and regulated from an Australian centre? When one examines these shibboleths, these generalities, and tests them in the cold light of common sense, one sees there is really nothing in them. If I were a New Zealander, and were asked to come to-morrow into a Federation, the Parliament of which had the powers that were foreshadowed under the rejected amendments, I should certainly think, with a growing school of Americans, that the principle of autonomy was much dearer to me than that, and that whatever closer relations were felt to be required in regard to the larger external affairs should be obtained by treaties and co-ordination of powers, by individual and general co-operation, and reciprocity. With regard to the recent referenda, my impression is that the people gave a very common-sense judgment upon the proposals submitted to them. </para>

                                <para>- There was a good deal of misapprehension even by advocates on both sides as to the scope of the proposals, and the people did not always get the best light, but they acted on sound impressions. I should like to know how they are to get the best light on these questions in the future, if what I read about the attitude of the Labour party is correct. I can understand a party - and I have respected the Labour party for it - having almost a rigid bond as regards certain essentials of their policy. It is reasonable to argue that if a man is returned to Parliament pledged to certain things, he ought to obey the mandate given by the people, and carry out those pledges. I have, therefore, never raised my voice in condemnation of what is called the caucus principle. It has its merits,- and may have its faults, but, without being an advocate of the extent to which it is applied, or said to be applied, by the Labour party, let me deal with what has been published on the question of the attitude of its members towards future referenda. I can understand that a man ought to be kept to the promises that he gave on the hustings, but the principle of representative government would certainly be far more respected by simply taking the general lines of a man's political leanings and trusting him with some discretion as to how he is to apply them in legislation. On 22nd August there was a meeting in Sydney called by twenty-two branches of the Labour organizations, and attended by four or five Ministers. According to the papers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was there asked for an explanation of why, believing in a certain line of policy as being best for the State, he did not advocate the opposite in the referenda campaign. I understand it was then agreed that, for the future, all candidates must obey the majority decision on these vital matters of constitutional amendment. If there is one way more calculated than another to mislead the judgment of electors in a case where it is not in any way essential, although it- maybe to some extent desirable, to obey a party mandate, it is by the adoption of", such an attitude in connexion with referenda. The reason for binding- a member is that you cannot touch him for three years. During that time, he ought to  stick to his promises, and obey some majority decision as to the best method of carrying out the principles affirmed on the hustings. But how can that apply to the taking of referenda? There you go back at once to the men from whom, if you were standing for Parliament, you would get your instructions, and you are asked not to render an account of your stewardship, but to tell them what they are to do. In such cases, we ought to speak the absolute personal conviction of each of us when advising the electors. We cannot do that if it is rendered obligatory upon a member, no matter what his private opinions are, to obey the decisions of any Conference, however dignified. </para>

                                <para>- Why put him in the  position of having to mislead the electors? There is no reason for it. He is simply asked by the electors to tell them what the truth is on this or that measure passed by Parliament, and it is making a travesty of all representative principles if you do not allow individual discretion in these matters, to the largest extent possible consistent with the solidarity of a party. The mistake which the Labour party made in the recent referenda was that they attempted to emulate certain advertising doctors, by applying heroic remedies to petty indispositions caused chiefly by straining a naturally sound Constitution. They asked for  95  per cent, more than they wanted. There were only one or two matters of pressing necessity, which they could easily have got if they had accepted bur amendments, but they failed by asking too much. Although it is now after the Imperial Conference, I suppose there is no harm in referring to what was done there. I think it was Lord Salisbury who, in  1887,  presiding over the first Imperial Conference, mentioned that it was a great pity, in Imperial matters, to precipitate a decision upon questions before opinion was ripe. He actually ruled out the question of Imperial Federation, and confined the then discussion to defence. I am afraid that during the last fifteen or twenty years we have forgotten that very wholesome suggestion of his. One proposal, which was happily rejected by the Imperial. Conference, was the somewhat extraordinary one of the Prime Minister of New Zealand to set up another Parliament, with two hundred and ninety-seven members in one House, and fourteen in another, based upon popular representation as regards one Chamber, and I do not know upon what as regards the other,, to deal with defence and some external matters for the next ten years, and with no direct responsibilities. It was actually to be given the power to apportion revenue raised by other Parliaments, lt struck me that if there is one line which is chiefly administrative it is defence. There is very little legislation required for that, and, as regards foreign affairs, surely a body like the Imperial Parliament, that already deals with them, is the most competent and proper, under our theory of government, to continue to manage them. The reflection occurred to me that in any sphere except the political, such a proposal would have simply wrecked the reputation it was possibly intended to enhance. I am pleased to say that it was rejected, but there have been other suggestions of a similar kind. The <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> in  1907,  and again in  191 1,  just prior to the Conference, put with extraordinary directness what it considered to be the alternative for the Dominions. It suggested that we must either separate, or join in some political consolidation. </para>

Is that Imperial loyalty? I dislike dwelling too much on such expressions, for a man's loyalty ought to be asserted by acts. We get too much lip loyalty; and the policy of shoving loyalty down people's throats has been, for instance, the cause of a great deal of the trouble in Ireland. There must, however, be something wrong, some grudging spirit displayed, when we find the very newspapers which ought to stand up for the Colonial Premiers, condemning their attitude on so many matters. I admire the view that is taken by <inline font-style="italic">The Nation, The Economist,</inline> and other great newspapers in which we find matured thought. What they ask is that the bond shall be one of sentiment and autonomy under the Crown with a reserve power in the central government to be used for the benefit of the whole Empire, and of any of the parts at the request of the parts.

                        <para class="block">In regard to the attitude of Canada, I very much question whether we have the temper to render any form of political union workable - whether we would really subordinate our local interests to the coercive powers of the majority. I believe that if the Empire were in danger, we would be willing to sacrifice our local views in order to attain the great end we  have in common. In connexion with the Canadian position, however, we found, about ten years ago, that, although there was much talk of loyalty, the moment local interests were touched, there was an outcry. For instance, when the Alaska boundary report was published, and Lord Alverstone, the representative of the United Kingdom, took the view of the Americans, as he had a right to do, if the Americans were correct, Canada immediately contended that her interests were being subordinated to Imperial necessity; and there was much talk, bordering on disaffection, at some banquets in the subsequent six months. As to neutrality, of course, that is a thing that a man who knows anything of International law will contemn. It is an act of sovereignty; we cannot declare neutrality. The whole Empire might make such a declaration, because it is sovereign. For many years, the right of Switzerland to neutrality as between Austria and France was questioned; and it was only in 1815, owing to the interlacing of the interests of Switzerland with those of some of the other Powers, that neutrality was recognised ; and it was not until 1870 that it was finally affirmed. What on earth is the good of talking about neutrality when its recognition depends on other nations rather than on ourselves? If I chose to detain the House, I could show that there has been much talk of neutrality by some Canadian statesmen in connexion with the Defence scheme to which I have referred. I asked the Prime Minister yesterday why the Colonial representatives did not accept the friendly proposals of the Board of Trade representatives to use the Imperial Labour Bureau in connexion with immigration. All that was suggested was that this Bureau, established in 1909, had done very good work locally, and might prove useful to the Dominions. Some 12,000 to 15,000 men are, every week, placed in employment through this agency ; and we are informed that there is a surplus of skilled men. This Bureau is not established to aid the distressed class-that class which- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> a few years ago, told us was likely to he sent out, and which was condemned in a report by the Agents-General. We are told that  89  per cent, of the engineering class which passed through the Bureau are skilled mechanics, and that only  15  per cent, of the available men in the building trade are pure labourers. These men are seeking homes across the seas ; and the Imperial Government asked the Dominion representatives to accept its view on one point, at any rate. Yet they refused. No wonder we find the Liberal press again condemning this attitude. Hear what the great Liberal weekly, <inline font-style="italic">The Nation,</inline> says - </para>

                                <para>- No. I am afraid that some of these newspapers - even <inline font-style="italic">The Economist</inline> in one or two cases - condemned rather too strongly the points of view of the representatives of the Colonies. In certain cases, however, there was displayed a good deal of what one might call juvenile arrogance. I regret that our representatives did not take a more statesmanlike view of Imperial responsibilities - for instance, in connexion with the Navigation Bill. For the last five or six years the British Government has been asking by correspondence that by means of the Navigation Bill it should be relieved of some of the difficulties which beset it in connexion with the negotiations with various countries for uniform rules. The Merchant Shipping Act was amended in  1906  in a way that has enabled Great Britain to have with foreign countries uniform rules on many difficult questions relating to standard food, measurement, load-lines, and so forth. But the British Government has been hampered very largely in this work by the absence of a similar spirit on the part of some of the Dominions, and those who are now in office have every opportunity to study the documents. It was only this morning that I had an opportunity of reading some of the discussions, apart from the rather meagre reports that I had read in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and I regret that there was not displayed in connexion with some of these suggestions a more statesmanlike view of Imperial responsibilities than seems to have been displayed by some of the men who at banquets spoke rather loudly upon the growth of Imperial nationality, and so on. To come to a more abstruse question, let us see what is the position as regards the Declaration of London. I think that there has been a good deal of misapprehension as to the issue raised. It is a very difficult question whether the Declaration of London in the interests of the Empire should or should not have been adopted. . Some Dominions may take a different view from that of others, just as one belligerent will take a different view from that of another belligerent. The position of England, for example, is not the position of Russia. We are an Empire upon which, it has been said, the sun never sets - a power whose morning drum-beat, following the sun, and keeping company with the hours, circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of martial airs, and have a sense of all that that means in connexion with the diffusion of the elements which compose that magnificent organization. Russia is a great Empire, if that term may rightly be applied to it. with no Colonies, and with ice-bound ports ; whereas England, on the other hand, practically lives upon the sea. Their points of view, therefore,, are altogether different. Up to  1905  or  1906  lawyers - those men who in the opinion of some of our friends never can do any good - had been trying- </para>

                                <para>- To the wrong side, of course. There are two sides to every, question, and the lawyer has to be on the one side or the other. In  1875 an  International Commission, consisting of lawyers - I forget for the moment the title of the Commission - was appointed to draw a code of international law on, among others, the eight questions that form the basis of the Declaration of London. After twelve or fifteen months' work the Commission presented its report ; but - as is historically the case always - until trouble arose, nothing was done. Action was precipitated only by trouble that arose in 1901, in connexion with the South African war, and in 1904 on the occasion of the Russo-Japanese war. In connexion with the South African war I think a German vessel was seized, but not sunk, by one of the British cruisers. England seized the vessel under what at the time was, according to the average opinion, her rightfully exercised power, yet acting on those moral principles which, I believe, have been growing in England, and have always characterized the relations of England with other nations in international matters, she gave way in the matter, notwithstanding that according to a good many lawyers her position was right. In 1904, when Russia had attempted to make food and coal absolute contrabrand of war, and had also sunk some neutral prizes, the question of the consideration of a code was precipitated by the diplomatic interchanges which then took place. We find that when the last Hague Conference met in 1907 it was suggested that, instead of each belligerent taking its captured prizes, to be condemned according to its municipal law, in its own prize courts, it would be better to ascertain whether some consensus upon nine or ten of these larger matters of difference might not be come to and form the basis of an international code to be administered <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Hague Tribunal. That led to what is known as the Declaration of London. Although that Declaration on some points appeared opposed to British interests there was imposed upon those who had advocated its rejection a very great responsibility since the lead in the matter was taken by England, through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey. He sent out an invitation to the various Governments who were represented at the Hague Conference to express in memoranda their views upon eight points, and having taken in that way such a very large and responsible part in the initiation of the Declaration of London it was incumbent upon him to consider very carefully whether the absence of perfection in three or four lines would justify the rejection of the Declaration. That Declaration was sent out to us. I do not know how long it was here, but it fell to my lot, as Attorney-General, to go through the papers and to see what ought to be the Australian point of view. That was expressed in a memorandum, on the whole, approving of the principles of the Declaration, but objecting to three or four provisions to which I shall make a short reference. I do not think they are quite as vital to our interests as some people believe. I may say that very eminent men who objected on these very grounds to the ratification or, at all events, to the immediate ratification of the Declaration of London have, on the whole, praised it very highly. We find, for instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Cohen, K.C., in the <inline font-style="italic">Law Quarterly Review,</inline> describing the Declaration as an instrument containing two complete and admirable codes on the law of blockade and contraband. He says - </para>

                        <para class="block">Lord Lindley, in a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> on the 9th June, said that on the whole the Declaration ought to be ratified, although there were three formidable objections, such as those relating to food supply, the destruction of neutral ships, and the conversion of merchant ships into war vessels after they had left the ports pf their country. I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that one part of the British Dominions might take a different view from that of the others. As regards food supply, for instance, the position might be more serious to us than to Great Britain. Whether food supply was absolute contraband or not has for many years been a moot point., England in 1763 regarded food as absolute contraband when it suited its purpose. The rule of might on the whole is the rule of right when war is proceeding, and it took a great deal of persuasion by other nations in 1856 to get England to surrender the tremendous power which its great navy then gave it in connexion with the rights of neutrals; but it did so. In the beginning of the last century also, I believe England did declare food as absolute contraband in connexion with some of the wars with France. Divergent views have existed, and as a matter of fact the advantage to a strong belligerent would be practically as great if we never had the Declaration as some persons think it is by its adoption in connexion with this very question of food supply, because it was within its right to say in any particular war that food was absolute contraband. What has been done, then, as regards food is that it has been made conditional contraband, and the weakness of the provision as drawn up consists in the fact that it is uncertain whether the mere consignment of food to any British port would make it contraband of war within the terms of the definition. That was one of the points to which in the memorandum the attention of the Imperial Government was directed. </para>

It is purely a question of the burden of proof. Before, when a vessel was seized for carrying contraband, the burden of proving innocence was on the part of her owner. But the burden of proof is now shifted on to the captor, and that is decreed in article  33,  which reads - </para>

                            <para>Conditional contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined for the use of the armed forces or of a Government department of the enemy State, unless in this latter case the circumstances show that the goods cannot in fact be used for the purposes of the war in progress. </para>

                        <para class="block">The latter exception does not apply to a consignment coming under article  24,  which refers to gold and such matters. It does not touch the point I am dealing with. The clause I have quoted declares the principle that for the future the burden of proof is on the captor. But then there are presumptions which are somewhat vaguely expressed, and may be dangerous, in article  34,  which is to be read with the other, and which says - </para>

                        <para>That is the destination of the armed forces of a Government. </para>
                        <para>The destination referred to in Article 33 is presumed to exist if the goods are consigned to enemy authorities or to a contractor established in the enemy country who, as a matter of common knowledge, supplies articles of this kind to the enemy. </para>
                        <para>A similar presumption arises if the goods are consigned to a fortified place belonging to the enemy or other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy. </para>
                        <para class="block">I shall not read any further than that. As regards the latter expression, it has been suggested that even Liverpool or London, as a place of consignment, would fall within that definition, and, if so, the Declaration, not as against the old system without it, but as against the comparative immunity given to continental nations who had no seaboard, and to whom this law of continuous voyage could not consequently apply - was disadvantageous . to us, while it might be helpful to them. </para>

                                <para>- All sorts of suggestions - I shall not weary honorable members by going into them - were made as to what ought to be done in connexion with that clause. I have cited Lord Lindley. I could cite two or three admirable articles on this question in the <inline font-style="italic">Quarterly Review.</inline> They do not advocate the rejection. They advocate ratification, with a reservation in relation to these matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey, I understand, has undertaken that these definitions, to some extent, at all events, will be cleared up - that the doubt as to whether Liverpool, for instance, would be a place of consignment for the purposes of the armed forces of the enemy within the meaning of these presumptions, will be cleared up by a minute attached to the acceptance of the memorandum by the Empire. So far, of course, so good. As regards the destruction of neutral prizes, there is no doubt that the position is not worse than it was without the Declaration. </para>

I believe that, after agreeing to regard food as contraband only when it was consigned to the armed forces of the enemy - that is, within the meaning of the provisions of the Declaration of London - it did sink a vessel. </para>

                                <para>- I think that the honorable member is wrong on that point, because one of the provisions of the Declaration is that the belligerent vessel must not sink, unless, after search, it is found that the contraband amounts to more than half the total value of the cargo; and, of course, he is entitled to test that. However, what I say is this : that this is a weak point, and that objection was taken by the last Government to it. It was one of the three matters to which the attention of the Imperial Government was drawn, as being - not necessarily from our point of view only - objectionable, and it should not, therefore, without some modification, be adopted. Passing over one or two points on which I have made some notes, another feature that strikes me is this. On the whole, the importance of the question is not so great as some may think. England's interest, from the point of view of neutral carriage, is rather that of a neutral trader than of a belligerent. How is that? I have taken some figures from the Board of Trade returns. They show that, between 1855 and 1859, 84 per cent. of the carrying trade between the United Kingdom and British Possessions was British. All the vessels conducting that 84 per cent. of trade would be belligerent vessels, and this Declaration of London would not touch them at all. Between 1905 and 1908, I find that 92 per cent. of the carrying trade was in British vessels, and only 8 per cent. in foreign vessels ; and those foreign vessels in some cases included belligerent vessels, which, of course, would not be affected by the Declaration of London. We see, therefore, that, as a matter of substance - dealing now with the trade of the Empire, and not purely with Australian trade - the area of the inconvenience of this Declaration is not very great. Take, now, the tonnage of sailing and steam vessels entered and cleared in the trade of Australia with the principal maritime countries - that is to say, our external trade with the principal maritime countries. In 1908, 8,581,000 was the amount of the total tonnage, and of this 6,318,000 was British, leaving only 2,263,000 tons for foreign vessels - and those would include belligerent vessels. If you take the total Australian trade, external and Inter-State, British and Colonial, you find that it comprises in round numbers 24,000,000 tons, of which the foreign trade would be only 4,000,000. It would not, therefore, be a matter of such very great, or at all events of vital, importance if these particular points were not qualified at the instance of the Imperial Government. </para>

In fact, I have other figures which go to show with quite as great force the comparative insignificance of some of these points when examined in relation to our actual trade. I could take, for instance, the trade from 1849, and show that there has been a great increase in the carriage by British vessels. There is another point of view. I have mentioned navigation. We ought to consider, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buxton</inline> stated at the Imperial Conference, the difficulties of Great Britain in connexion with our amendment of the navigation laws ; for instance, the provision that, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, was passed as regards Lascars and the employment of foreign seamen. It was pointed out that within the last four or five years there has been, happily, an increase in the proportion of British seamen engaged on British vessels. </para>

                                <para>- There has been a remarkable betterment of the condition of seamen. It is the case that the condition of men on many vessels was formerly most deplorable. But the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 is acknowledged to have brought about an improvement; and since  then the reports are that men are tempted by the better conditions to join the mercantile marine, and so strengthen what is really a main source of our naval supremacy - the great body of hardy seamen upon whom the Navy was able to draw of old. If we, by our pettifogging policy, in matters of no real substance, of not recognising our Imperial responsibilities, irritate foreign nations that are vulnerable in that way, England may seriously suffer. England is the great carrying country of the world. For instance, 36 per cent, of the vessels entering French ports are British. I believe that the proportion entering German ports is in excess of that figure. In the United States, 29 per cent, of the vessels are British. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Buxton stated at the Imperial Conference that 164,000,000 out of 285,000,000 tons of shipping going to foreign ports is British. That shows, therefore, that if we ask England to give a protection which we really do not want, and which very often will simply mean the protection of the capitalists, who are so much condemned by honorable members opposite, we may be exposing to serious reprisals the Mother Country, whose interest in this respect we need to have at heart. I am not going to trespass upon the time of the House by dealing at length with other matters, such as the dangerous  right under the Declaration of conversion of vessels at sea, but will deal now with the question of the establishment of an Imperial Court of Appeal. I regard what has been done recently as one of those half sincere propositions about which so much is made, but which involves so little. The Privy Council and the House of Lords have been practically manned by the same Judges for many years. They sat in different places, and were, theoretically, differently instituted. The Privy Council was nominally appointed as its committee by the Crown, and reported to the Crown ; and the Crown dealing directly with British Possessions, the Privy Council was a final Court of Appeal for them. But the Judges who sat in the House of Lords have been the same as those who sat in the Privy Council, and there has been practically no material difference between the judgments delivered by a particular Judge in one place, and those delivered in the other. What is now done is to give statutory expression to what has been the actual practice for the last few years. It is now agreed that there is to be one Court, instead of two. But, as I have said, the two were the same in substance, and, practically, the manning was the same. That is to say, the regular Judges were the same. Practically the Privy Council had the right of calling, among others, one Australian Judge to its counsels ; though I believe he attended only once since he was appointed in 1897.  In  a similar manner, the House of Lords occasionally has the Chief Justice of England and the Chief Justice of Ireland sitting in the Court of Appeal. But the same class of Judges sit on both tribunals alternately, and the business is, I think, apportioned by the Lord Chancellor. What has now been done is to declare that there is to be one Court of Appeal in two divisions for the future, and to strengthen it by the addition of two other Judges. If there is anything in the arrangement, I am glad that we have it; but I cannot see that it will help us very much. I think that last year we sent three appeals Home from the High Court - one appeal from the New South Wales State Court, and an appeal from an Admiralty Court. The year before there were three appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council, and one appeal only from an Australian State Court direct, and that was in Western Australia. We have been looking largely to our own tribunal - the Australian High Court. However, if honorable members think that a great stroke has been done by the establishment of this Court of Appeal, I have no desire to discount any praise that may be given for its adoption. In conclusion, all I can say is that I hope that if there is to be a reorganization of our relations, we shall follow rather the advice given by <inline font-style="italic">The Nation</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Quarterly Review,</inline> than the somewhat formidable alternative suggested by the <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> When the question of Empire on the principle not yet fully recognised of independent growth and combined strength is considered freely, without the bias of personal ambitions, the haste, and, at times, insincerity, of Conferences called to discuss difficulties and problems that arise because something must be mooted or done, it may be found that cohesion and strength, unity in external and independence in local relations, and perfect coordination of the parts with stability of the whole, depend .less upon the creation of political machinery, complicated, coercive, and disproportionate, it may be, to  the ends in view, than upon the maintenance, and without the limits of clear necessity, the modification, of the elastic system to which the Empire and its elements owe their concordance and vitality, and will again turn, without misgivings, for an assurance of continued integrity and freedom. </para>

                            <para>- - I did not intend to speak on the Address-in-Reply, because if there is one matter with which I can agree with the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> it is in the advantage to be gained by doing away with so useless a debate. After the leaders on both sides have spoken in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, all that can be said with advantage has been said, and the rest of the talk is only so much beating the air. But following the good old traditions of Parliament, I shall myself be a transgressor on this particular occasion. I wish particularly to refer to the references made by the Leader of the Opposition to industrial matters. Later on I shall deal with the caustic remarks which have been made about the loyalty of the Labour party in connexion with their omission to despatch a contingent of Australian soldiers to take part in the ceremonies connected with the Coronation of the late King Edward, and recently of King George. .1' suppose this is a free country, and, as members of a free Parliament, we have as much right to our opinion on this side as has the gallant colonel. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps you, sir, will say to whom I was referring? I may have been referring to colonels on the retired list, and not to those on active service. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday afternoon tried to make great capital out of the fact that the strike in the sugar industry was commenced at a time when the cane was ripe for harvesting. Does the honorable gentleman think that we ought to tell the enemy what we propose to do? I look upon the employers as the enemy when we are fighting them in a strike. It is our wits against their wits and their money. They have the money and the work, and we have nothing but our wits and our labour. I can tell honorable members that these struggles sharpen our wits. The honorable gentleman said that the strike took place at a particular time when the cessation of work would do most damage. I can ask any one who has read history to say whether Napoleon told the enemy when and where he was going to strike. We follow the example of the great military men in these matters, and have often been successful on that account. </para>

                                <para>- I am quoting him as such, and no one knows better than does the honorable member for Parramatta, that it is on a military basis we conduct these strikes. There must be something good and grand in the Labour movement when it has .survived the vilification and misrepresentation of every newspaper in the Commonwealth, and its supporters have achieved the position they are in to-day. It is only since 1890 that the Labour party really came into existence in Australia. Our present  Speaker  was amongst the men who did the pick and shovel work in the movement at that time, and he knows the way in which the men engaged in it were insulted by their opponents. When the first Labour men were returned to the Queensland Legislative Assembly, their opponents declined to sit in the same room with them, and refused even to hang their hats or their coats on the same pegs. That was the treatment Labour members received in those days. We were called "gin-case orators." That makes the honorable member for Parramatta smile, but he was himself one of the gin-case orators about that time. </para>

At that time we were called " gin-case orators," " shedburners," and " bank-bursters." At that time men who now occupy important public positions, including the present Prime Minister, the present  Speaker  of this House, and the  President  of the Senate, were subjected to every possible form of vilification. They were, as I have said, then doing the pick and shovel work of the movement, and sowing the seeds that are bearing fruit to-day. In 1890 and 1891 there was a rude awakening on the part of the worker. Our opponents, including the honorable member for Fawkner, who was on a committee in Central Queensland for the Pastoralists Union, said, " Why do you men strike? Why do you go in for this lawlessness? Why do you not do as we do, and put your representatives into Parliament to fight your battles in the Legislative Assemblies of the different States, where they might redress the wrongs you say you suffer from?" </para>

My heart goes out to the men who do strike and to their wives and children. I suppose that if I said what I think of free labourers, it would be ruled out of order as unparliamentary. But I look upon the free labourer as the meanest creature on the face of the earth. He cannot compete in the open market and secure employment - as does the ordinary workman - he has to come in at the master's heel. And what do the employers do when the strike is over? They give him the royal order of the boot quick and lively. Instead of giving him the order of the boot, they ought to drown him. We accepted the advice which was tendered to us by the honorable member for Fawkner, and others, and resolved to return our own representatives to Parliament. Directly we did so those in authority altered the electoral laws so as to prevent the nomadic population of the western district of Queensland from being enrolled. They made enrolment so difficult that many men who had never seen a ship afloat could not get their names upon the roll because they had no fixed place of abode. Then that great organization of which I am so proud, and which has proved such a big factor in returning Labour members to Parliament - I refer to the Australian Workers Union - sprang into existence. I say, without fear of contradiction, that were it not for that organization, many men sitting in this Parliament, and in the State Parliaments of Australia, would not be there. The other side taught us how to organize, and we have followed in their footsteps, so that now we have become a power in the land. The attempts to " down " the Labour party remind me of the attempts which are made to suppress secret societies. When once a secret society has been established, and an effort is made to suppress it, the masses at once come together, and desire to join it with a view to getting the good things which are going. Yesterday afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition stated that if things go on as they have been going, the Commonwealth will be captured by the Labour party. It was the first occasion upon which I have seen him work himself into a fury, and he did so by raising the bogie of militant Socialism. I hope that the day has not arrived - even now that we are in possession of the Treasury benches - when our force is going to cease to be a militant one. If I thought that the Labour party was going to rest upon its political haunches contentedly, I would get out of it quick and lively. The position which we occupy today is due to the fact that the party has been a militant one. Ever since it was formed we have had to fight our way against serious odds, against capitalism in all its worst forms, against bribery and corruption. We have had to fight the press single-handed. In Queensland, the only Labour newspaper that we had was a little rag called the <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> But it did its work, and it was deadly work, too. Although it was only a small journal, it set the people thinking. With what result? To-day we command a majority in both branches of the National Parliament. I venture to say that no matter how honorable members opposite- may dress their bogies, or alter the names of their political parties, the Labour party will still remain the national party - the same old party which sprang into existence in  3890  and  1891.  We have no need to change its name. We have no need to address meetings of old tabbies - of disappointed and disgruntled old maids. We have right on our side. Since the inception of this great Labour party in the different States of Australia each of the other political parties has changed its name after every election. It is said that when the police wish to ram a charge home to an individual they always give him his <inline font-style="italic">aliases.</inline> Well, honorable members opposite have a lot of <inline font-style="italic">aliases,</inline> and their character politically is not too good. The honorable member for North Sydney worked himself into a terrible passion last night over the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie in India. He declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keir</inline> Hardie went about that country making seditious speeches. As a matter of fact, that gentleman never delivered a single speech in India, although he managed to get a lot of matter inserted in the native press. The honorable member for Grampians declared that the authorities ought to have killed him - that they ought to have crucified him. But if honorable members opposite had their way to-day every man sitting upon these benches would be crucified. They have tried to do that sort of thing before. After the  1891  strike, when it was declared that bygones were to be bygones, what happened ? The employers picked out the leaders of that particular strike, and said, " If we  get  rid of these fellows, who have the brains of the organization, we shall be able to work the other men quietly so that in the future things will go on swimmingly as they have done hitherto." The result was that every time a man applied for a shearing shed, before he was given employment the black list was consulted to see if his name appeared upon it. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration in this House I produced one of those black lists. Those lists contained the names of some of the most noble men that Australia has produced. Many of them were native-born Australians, and honest, hardworking men But they struck for their rights, and because they strove hard to get them, and were beaten, they were to be hounded out of existence and out of the country. </para>

                                <para>- They profess to be Christians. I am pleased to say that many of the men who suffered as the result of the  189 1  strike are to-day occupying proud and honorable positions in the different States of the Commonwealth. When the honorable member for North Sydney was in the height of his oratory last evening the honorable member for Wakefield interjected something about a strike in Adelaide. He stated that the carters in that city had to obtain permits from the Trades Hall because a weak-kneed Government was in power. That Government was a weak-kneed one, I suppose, because it would not do just what he and his party wanted it to do, namely, to put the strikers in gaol or to shoot them. We have been afforded an illustration of what militarism and military caste will do by the cables which have appeared in the newspapers during the past two or three weeks. God forbid that such a state of things should ever exist in this fair land of ours ! When the  1891  strike was in progress in Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer said, in effect, " If you men do not return to work, and obey our laws, we will send our police and our soldiers to arrest you. We will try you by our Judges, and we will put you in our prisons." In less than twenty years what has happened? The position has been completely reversed, and we are now able to say to the other side, " If you do not obey <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> laws we will send <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> police and <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> soldiers to arrest you ; we will try you by <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> Judges, and we will put you in <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> prisons." What a wonderful change has occurred in this brief space of time! History is being made so quickly that one hardly realizes how greatly things have changed in a short time. The Leader of the Opposition said that the sugar strike was brought about just as the cane was ready for harvesting, but, as a matter of fact, the Australian Workers' Association asked for a conference with the Growers' and the Producers' Associations early in the year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, acted in a gentlemanly way about the matter. He replied that, if the employés of the company were dissatisfied, he was prepared to meet them, but that he could not treat with an outside organization. The request for a conference was made in February, so that the strike did not occur without notice. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. Notwithstanding the vilification of honorable members opposite, of manufacturers' associations, and of kindred societies, I say, " Thank God, we have a Billy Hughes." " What's the matter with Billy ? He's all right!" The other side would be only too pleased if they had a few like him in their ranks. The honorable member for North Sydney flogged the Labour party for its disloyalty in not sending a contingent to the Coronation. I have heard that you should mistrust the woman who stands at the street corner proclaiming her virtue, and should button up your pockets when a man commences to talk about his honesty. Lip loyalty may be all very well, but there are members of the Labour party who have shown their loyalty in other ways. Not one member of the party, so far as I know, has ever said anything in public or private to which the ordinary citizen could  take exception. When gold rushes were common all over Australia, we heard a great deal of the lucky digger, but nothing of the unlucky ones. The honorable member for North Sydney picked a few cases out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to disparage the Labour party, but did not refer to the speeches which would have rebutted his statements. He went back to the first session, when many of us were new to the game of politics, and said .things that we wish now were forgotten. If I had my way, I would burn the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record after every session. The honorable member, had he wished to be fair, would not have been content with resurrecting half-a-dozen ghosts to fit his purpose. </para>

                                <para>- That shows how free the members of the party are. No one ever tried to dragoon my vote. As for the reduction of the military Estimates by ^750,000, moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson, it must be admitted, even by the honorable member for Parkes, that we were getting very little value for our expenditure on Defence at that time. The Department was in a chaotic state. Indeed, nothing was done to provide properly for Defence until the honorable member for Parramatta came into office. He originated a system of Defence for the Commonwealth. The honorable member for North Sydney accuses us of having stolen the Liberal programme. This is the first time that I have heard this party accused of stealing the programme of the Liberal party. On 3rd July last the honorable member for Parkes wrote a letter to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> in which he " flogged his own Joss." When I read his letter I smiled, and said, " The honorable member for Parkes is nothing if he is not thorough." I look upon him as one of the  straightest  men in this Parliament. He says what he thinks in a most fearless manner. He goes right to the kernel of the question in one up. He does not fence nor circle, but gets straight to it, and in this letter he proved his Conservatism up to the hilt. It put me in mind of the Chinese who, when they want rain, gave their rain joss an awful doing, and when they want fine weather flog their fine-weather joss. The honorable member for Parkes flogged the Liberal joss in Sydney on this occasion, because he said the Liberal party were putting on the pace too much, and would overtake the Labour party if they were not careful. </para>

It was a Liberal organization, and I found fault with it for advocating Socialistic measures, which I thought belonged more properly to the Labour party.

                                <para>- I am very pleased to hear it. The position is this : How can we steal these Liberal gentlemen's clothes when they have none ? The Leader of the Opposition was engaged last night in cutting a suit of clothes for them, and to-night he is going to fit them on. They do not know until to-night whether the clothes will fit or not. All these Liberal organizations are to be amalgamated. Some of them have peculiar names, but they are all to come down to bedrock, and be called the People's party - the P . P . L. - meaning, in my judgment, the " People's Political  Legpullers."  That is the position in a nutshell, and then they have the cheek to announce through the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that this is going to be a grand realization of all their aspirations. Politically speaking, there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> with his banjo and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> with his tambourine, with all the hallelujah lasses on the platform behind them. It does not matter how they organize, or what they call themselves - they are the same old crowd. As the Employers Federation told them one day last week, " Those that are not with us are against us." There are only two political camps in this country now. I do not know how the honorable member for Parramatta will get on when the carpet-baggers are done away with. He is the Ishmael in the party opposite. He is the only one among them who has no business there. I do not know how he is going to get on in the future with these Tory Conservatives and crusted Liberals. God knows where they are going to find him a place to lay his weary head ; 1 do not. Last night the honorable member for North Sydney made great capital about industry, organization, and commercialism, but it appears to me that his whole and sole thought in living is militarism. To speak the honest truth, if there is one thing more than another that I quake at and baulk at every time, it is the fact that we are rearing a military caste for which some day we may be sorry. </para>

                                <para>- We know the teachings of history. I am not one of those who say that there should be no universal training. <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> say, and have said repeatedly, that the country that gives me my living, and is worth living in, has the right to call on me to defend it. If the day should come before I " shuffle off this mortal coil," although I may not be able to take my place in the fighting and firing line, I will do my best for those who do. It hurts me when <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> hear men accuse us of being disloyal. There are in our movement to-day, particularly in Queensland, many men, and no one knows them better than yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who have risked their lives in order to give us the constitutional government and free institutions under which we live to-day. Why vilify those men? Surely they are worthy of some consideration, even if some of the representatives in this House do not see eye to eye with them in everything. There are old men, whom we honour every year with a dinner, who kept the banner flying during the Indian Mutiny, and the majority of them are supporters of the Labour party. They are looking to us in the declining days of their lives to make the conditions better for them. Our only ambition is to see that the masses have better conditions than hitherto. If the Labour party were swept out of existence tomorrow, no one would be "game" enough to propose to wipe out the legislation which that party, with the assistance of honorable members here and in other Parliaments, have passed in that direction. We may sometimes say strong things about one another on the platform, though, as a rule I do not indulge in personalities, either within this chamber or outside, but give my political opponents the same fair and square treatment that many of them give to me. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know that amongst our political opponents in Queensland are some of our nearest and dearest friends. Under all the circumstances, I do not see why honorable members should accuse the Labour party of disloyalty. God forbid that an enemy should invade this fair country of ours; but if that came to pass, who would be the men to take up arms? The members of the Labour part)' - the rank and file outside. No matter what the red-rag Socialists may say, blood is thicker than water; and we all spring from a good old fighting stock. One honorable member, speaking yesterday of the referenda, asked why we on this side, having been beaten, did not give in. I can only say that Napoleon once asked why Wellington's forces, when they appeared to be beaten, did not retire; and, as a matter of fact, it is when Britishers are in the tightest corner that they fight the hardest. As I said before, our party is a militant party ; and when the clouds are darkest we show our fighting power. I hope that the Labour party will never cease to be militant, not only in Australia, but throughout the world. </para>

                            <para>.- I have listened with attention to the honorable member for Maranoa, and, whatever may be said as to the value or otherwise of this debate on the Address-in-Reply, it has certainly been given a value on the present occasion. The honorable member, at an early stage, gave us to understand clearly that, no matter how far the Labour party may have gone in the past, they intend to go a great deal further in the future. It is well that the country should know and understand clearly what the intentions are of both the great parties. I do not quite understand, however, the position of the honorable member for Maranoa in one particular. He rejoices in the fact that this is a free Parliament, by which I understand he means a Parliament in which every man is free to express his views and act according to his convictions and the pledges to his constituents. At a later stage of his remarks, however, although he had spoken of men being free to fight their life's battles according to their own judgment, he expressed the opinion that a free labourer is the meanest thing on earth.. </para>

                                <para>- Turning to the Ad  dress-in-Reply, I have first to compliment the Prime Minister on the fact that he has seen appointed to the Privy Council ; and is, therefore, entitled to the prefix of "Right Honorable." This, although I understand the honorable gentleman belongs to a Socialistic party, elevates him considerably above every other person in the ranks of that party. I have also to compliment the Prime Minister on his safe return, vigorous and able to discharge the duties of his office. It is, however, a cause of regret to me that the honorable gentleman yesterday gave us so very little information about what was done at the Imperial Conference. The country is entitled to know much more than the Prime Minister deigned to tell us ; and I feel there is justification for complaint on this score. It would, perhaps, be improper for a private member to take up the time of the House in dealing with such a subject, and with what information has filtered to us through the press regarding it. If the press has misrepresented the Prime Minister, the fact that he, yesterday, failed to put the right construction on the news, entitles us to regard what has been stated as fact. I understand that a very important deputation waited on the Prime Minister when he was in London attending the Imperial Conference, and according to a newspaper report, it represented practically£50,000,000. In other words, it was representative of the gentlemen who are contributing very largely to the great powers of development that we possess, since they provide us with the capital necessary to carry out our works. The first of the two matters regarding this deputation to which I wish to refer is that, in the course of the discussion which took place the Prime Minister chose to regard British investors as absentees. A good deal has been said as to loyalty and lip loyalty, but if we form an integral part of the British Empire, something more than lip loyalty is expected of us. We need to strengthen every tie that binds us to the different parts of the Empire; and I venture to suggest that the action of the present Government in requiring British investors to pay double rates under the Federal Land Tax Act, passed at their instance, shows that they do not recognise the true principles of loyalty. It is all very well for us to proclaim our loyalty; but if we impose additional charges upon men who are Britishers, just as we are, then, whatever we may say to the contrary, we show in effect that we are not true to them as brother Britishers. </para>

The Prime Minister more than once, during the course of the interview to which I have referred, proclaimed the fact that he regarded these British investors as absentees, and that, in his opinion, they were justly entitled to pay higher rates under our progressive land tax because they did not reside in Australia. He was told that it was an abuse of the English language to describe these British investors as absentees. </para>

If they chose to take up their residence on the Continent, or in America, I would freely admit that they had ceased to be part and parcel of the Empire ; but inasmuch as they are residents of Great Britain, and provide us with the capital necessary to carry on many of our developmental works, we are entitled to treat them as fellow Britishers. We ought to give them every advantage that should be extended to those who are prepared to render us the essential assistance which capital really means to Australia. The other point to which I desire to refer, as arising out of this deputation, relates to the statement made by the Prime Minister that there never was a time when there were fewer strikes and industrial troubles in Australia than there were then. When the right honorable gentleman was speaking yesterday, he said that strikes had not interfered with production very much. </para>

                                <para>- -I believe that, in these circumstances, we should have enjoyed prosperity under almost any Government; but it is undoubtedly true that there is not an investor of capital who is prepared to put the money at his command into large labour-giving concerns while strikes continue to occur so frequently, and the present industrial unrest exists. When the accuracy of the Prime Minister's statement was questioned by the deputation, he replied, " Well, I thought I knew something of Australian affairs." But what is the actual position ? I was so tickled with his statement as to there being fewer strikes in Australia at the present time than there has ever been before, that I determined to take a note of the number of strikes reported from day to day in the press. In the very issue of the newspaper in which the report of the deputation appeared, I read of a strike of ironmoulders at Perth. In its next issue - 13th July - there was a report of a strike of coal wheelers at Newcastle, and of a miners' strike at Powlett North; on the 14th a strike of glass-bevellers, and an eight-weeks' strike of colliers at Teralba. On the 15th no less than four strikes were reported, whilst on the 1 8th reports of two other strikes appeared. </para>

                                <para>- No; but what I do deplore is that the Prime Minister should have sought to deceive the people of Great Britain regarding an important matter of this kind. He made the statement that there never was a time when there were fewer strikes in Australia ; yet the newspapers of the day report strike after strike. Notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Parliament, from its inception, has been legislating with a view to obviating their occurrence, it is found impossible to prevent them. In connexion with the Imperial Conference there was published in the press a statement, which was denied by the Prime Minister, and that is the statement which was published at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead.</inline> It appeared in an interview with the Prime Minister, in which, he used expressions of disloyalty to the Empire. I was very glad indeed to read his denial of the statement. </para>

In view of that denial of the right honorable gentleman, I regret very much indeed the statement which he made here yesterday, and that was that if Great Britain went to war it would not be a question of our navy cooperating with the British Navy, but rather a question of whether the Government and the Parliament of the day would permit our navy to co-operate with Great Britain. That is his position, and I assert that it is as much a position of disloyalty to Great Britain as was the statement published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead.</inline></para>

                            <para>The report of the interview with Andy Fisher just before leaving the Fog City, wherein he stated a few straightout facts <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the Empire, has staggered the spineless  boodleistic  press that is at present attempting by lies and corruption to run Australia. This is how Andy puts it - " We recognise that our territory is subject to attack by England's enemy, and if we were threatened we should have to decide whether to defend ourselves, or, if we thought that the war was unjust and England's enemy in the right, we should haul down the Union Jack, hoist our own flag, and start on our own." No doubt the Labour Leader had the episode of the infamous Boer War in his mind's eye. </para>

                        <para>That is the attitude of a very considerable section of the community upon whom the Prime Minister and the party opposite depend for political support. No matter how loud they may be in their proclamations of loyalty, the fact remains that  a  considerable section, bolstered up by a section of the press which honorable members opposite recognise, is prepared to give utterance to these disloyal sentiments. </para>

                                <para>- That is the position taken up by those who are supporting this Government j and I fail to see how Ministers can, with any hope of success, carry out the defence scheme they claim to have inaugurated whilst those who are supporting them outside are so bitterly opposed to it. The facts which I have quoted show how deeply rooted is the aversion of these men to the policy that is considered necessary for the preservation of law and order.- </para>

In reference to naval defence  I  wish to quote an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoralists' Review</inline> of 15th July, 1911. That journal makes a most important statement with regard to our naval affairs. The determination and desire of this Parliament were that we should have an Australian Navy manned by Australian sailors ; that, in fact, it should be essentially Australian in its characteristics. I should like to hear the explanation of the Minister of Defence in regard to the allegations made in this extract - </para>

                            <para>As a matter of fact, from the moment of the arrival of the, new boats in Australian waters the locally enrolled men have been steadily leaving, and it now appears that of the sixty-four men who went to Europe to bring out the boats only twenty remain. The ostensible reason given by the men for this defection is that instead of receiving the wages they expected, these are being cut down by deductions of various kinds, and an example quoted is that of a stoker petty officer, whose pay is supposed to be 6s. 6d. a day, but who only receives actually  5s  ad. Another point raised is that preference is being given to Imperial naval pensioners who are being given special conditions, but, as a matter of fact, when it was found that Australians would not keep the billets, it became imperative to find others to take their places, and the only trained men available were old naval men. </para>

                                <para>- No, I do not. They may be satisfactorily answered, but if the facts are as reported we are faced with a bad lookout for the Australian Navy. Speaking on Tuesday on the Supply Bill I raised a question relating to cadets. I say again that it is a great mistake, indeed, to disband the existing cadets until the Government are prepared to proceed with their complete scheme. A number of lads were receiving, under the cadet system, a good and effective training. They were proud of their uniforms. To drop them and deprive them of their uniforms, as has been the case in numberless country towns, is, in my opinion, a very great mistake. </para>

                                <para>- When one speaks of a soldier being proud of his uniform one means that he is proud of the part he is taking in defending his country. I also think that it would be well if the Government would take into consideration the increased cost of living in this country. There should have been a reference to the subject in the Governor- General's Speech. It is a good thing to give workmen good pay, and to increase the purchasing power of the money which they earn. Unfortunately the increased cost of living appears to be world-wide, though it is attended with greater gravity in Australia than elsewhere. This is one of the problems which we shall have to consider, and I am surprised that the Government have not intimated their intention to deal with it. I intend to quote an instance which has come to light in connexion with contracts for the military service, and which shows the increased cost of articles which the Government have to purchase. This fact illustrates what is going on generally in the community. Every housewife in Australia knows that she cannot to-day finance her household with anything like the money that was sufficient five or <inline font-style="italic">six</inline> years agc.

                            <para>The Acting Minister for Defence recently called for tenders for supplying  1,800  sets of harness for the completion of the war equipment of the existing Defence Force. Only two tenders were submitted, and in regard to these the Minister expressed astonishment on finding that the prices, on the average, were about j£a per set higher than last year's contract, and <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> higher than English prices. He stated that every facility had been given to the tenderers, so that tradesmen in a small way of business could tender for any part of the whole requirements. The result, as above stated, was only two tenders, and the prices so upset the Minister that he has threatened to place the order in England. </para>

                                <para>- Who would deny such a proposition? I venture to say that the subject is one which this House ought very seriously to consider. By successive strikes and incessant strife in the Labour world the cost of production has been inordinately increased, and that increase of cost is having its effect upon prices. Wages Boards and Arbitration Court decisions have increased wages. Nevertheless, the people concerned find that they are in no better position. The honorable member for Maranoa said, a few minutes ago, that it was the poor men who were striking. Such is not the case. The legislation affecting labour is in the interests of the workers who are best able to defend themselves. The working men who are enjoying increased wages are those who are affected by the decisions of various Courts; but the persons who, by reason of that legislation, are unqualified to take work in the protected trades have been placed in a much worse position. The obvious effect of this policy is to drive the condition of those workers down, and down, and down. </para>

                                <para>-That is not so. So far from benefitking those who are unable to protect themselves, honorable mem.beres opposite are pursuing a line of action which is mar ing their condition worse than it was before. I now come to a very important question. It is : Can a union or labour-controlled Government really govern? In my view, the true functions of government are, first of all, the carrying into effect of certain legislative Acts, and then to see that those Acts of Parliament are duly given effect and observed. What do we find at the present time? We have a Labour Government in power in this Parliament, in New South Wales, and in South Australia. Is it not right and proper, upon occasions such as this, to consider some of the things which are coming to pass? I was in Adelaide at the time of the great carriers' strike there, and to my dismay I discovered that we had arrived at a stage in Australian history when a Government had ceased to govern. I say it is a sad and sorry condition of things that in any portion of our great island continent there should be a Government that has become effete. Why was it effete? For the simple reason that the men on strike were unionists, and were the back-bone and support of the Government. How could a Government supported by that section of the community enforce the law when those men placed themselves in opposition to it? </para>

                                <para>- We should be in a position of anarchy when those ruling would not be representative of the people, but a section of the community controlled by Labour unions and bosses. Let me refer honorable members to some remarkable circumstances attending the strike of fruit-gatherers at Renmark. That strike affected one of our rural industries, and had very important consequences. Though the unionists said they would not gather the Renmark fruit, at the last harvest the fruit-growers succeeded in having it gathered without their assistance. I say, all honour to them. Free men proved themselves a valuable asset to the community on that occasion. The unionists were, of course, opposed to them, and sought to enforce their opinions and views in a way contrary to the law. as established in South Australia. The law was defied, and acting under instructions from his union, a driver in the employment of one of the largest carrying firms in Adelaide declined to put on his waggon some cases of Renmark fruit. For refusing to obey lawful orders the man was prosecuted and fined. Time was given him in which to pay the fine, and he was committed to gaol on refusal to pay it. So far the action taken is against my argument, because, up to that stage, the Government had succeeded in governing and in enforcing the law. But what was the position later, because we must look to the future? </para>

A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spellman</inline> expressed the hope that the vine-growers in the Renmark district would have their vines spoiled by unskilful pruning. That is a nice proposal to destroy the assets of the country. Now, let me show what was the attitude of the unions who are responsible for the existence of the Verran Government. I should like to ask honorable members opposite if they know what it was? It is certainly as well that they should know. It is defined in the following statement : - </para>

                                <para>- I have admitted all that is' against my argument. I have said that, up to a certain point, the Government were firm, and had a man prosecuted and fined but I am dealing with the attitude of the unions, at large which was one of antagonism to the Government. The facts go to show that, with a Labourcontrolled Government,, when the unionists who are their backbone choose to take up a position of antagonism, the authorities are unable to enforce the law. </para>

                                <para>- As a result of the Renmark strike a very important deputation of fruit-growers waited on the Chief Secretary of South Australia. I wish to show just how weak that Government was under the circumstances. Honorable members will recollect what occurred on the occasion in question. They will remember that certain houses were fired, that a number of draught horses were poisoned, and that one man was shot. These acts were the outcome of the lawlessness which prevailed because unionists were not allowed to tyrannize over free labourers. Yet this is the attitude which the Chief Secretary of South Australia adopted towards these terrible crimes. He said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Is not that a lamentably weak position for a Ministry to take up - a Ministry whose function it is to give effect to the legislation which has been enacted. I shall not pursue this matter further. I might have referred to the strike which is now in progress in the sugar industry in Queensland. How great and important its results may be it is impossible to foretell. I believe that honorable members opposite are very much divided as to what is the best thing to be done in the circumstances. But the fact! remains that a large industry which the people of this country have subsidized heavily, and which has been granted a large measure of Protection - apart from the bonus which is paid for the production of sugar grown by white labour - is suffering keenly as the result of a strike. Its effect will doubtless be a diminution in the production of sugar, and a very considerable financial loss to many persons in the community. If these things are good for the community, very well, but I maintain that they are not. I hold that the position which we have now reached is largely due to the fact that at the present time Australia is governed by a faction who have come into power on a wave which, under more sane circumstances, will recede. Indeed, it is already receding. We have evidence  of that. I might quote with great satisfaction the splendid result of the recent referenda. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out yesterday, honorable members upon this side of the House represent a majority of 250,000 people. </para>

Only the other day, one honorable member said that a great change had come over the public mind during the past twelve months. In the Legislative Council of South Australia, the city of Adelaide has, for years past, been represented by a Labour man. But, unfortunately, the other day an opportunity arose for testing the will of that constituency. What was the result ? After a fiercely contested fight, the Liberal candidate was returned by a large majority. </para>

                                <para>- Before the dinner adjournment I made a statement that was slightly inaccurate. I said that a Liberal member had been returned in place of a Labour member to represent Adelaide in the Legislative Council of South Australia.. But the real facts strengthen my argument still more. At the general elections three Labour members were returned to the Legislative Council to represent Adelaide, and at a subsequent by-election, occasioned by the death of a Councillor who had been a Liberal, another Liberal was returned by a solid majority, notwithstanding a great fight put up by the Labour party. Another occurrence not calculated to cheer the hearts of Government supporters took place at Renmark recently. The hotel there is conducted on the Gothenburg system, the committee of management being elected annually by those on the Assembly rolls. Last year all .the committeemen were Labourites, but this year every one of them is a Liberal. That shows in a practical fashion the result of the Renmark strike, and how the people of the country view such disturbances. To show how impossible it is that a union or labour-controlled Government can govern, let me bring under notice the position occupied by the Attorney-General during the Queensland sugar strike. That strike, although harmful to the capitalist, has been still more harmful to the men employed in the industry and those dependent on them. It was effected and encouraged very largely by reason of the fact that the Attorney-General is also  President  of the Waterside Workers Union. It is well known that the unions work one with another, like so many wheels within wheels. </para>

How is it possible for the Attorney-General to rightly hold the dual position of president of the union and administrator of the laws of the country? It is true that he said that if the unions went beyond a certain length he would have to consider his position, and he was good enough to declare that he would retain office. He is the chief law adviser of the Crown, bound by his oath to maintain and uphold the law. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Fawkner has never taken up a position antagonistic to the law, and has never been Attorney-General. A Government controlled by the labour unions - and the Australian Workers Union is the force behind the throne in this case - cannot enforce the law against the members of those unions when they are determined to defy it, as they do day after day, and year after year. The Labour party, or, to use its right name, the Socialist party, has boasted that it is united and solid. </para>

It is impossible for a Labour Government, if it continues under the domination of the hi bour unions, to govern a country. We find that these Labour men are not a happy family. Perhaps, I should refer to them as Socialists, for I believe they have gained largely by taking a name to which they are not entitled. We, on this side, are as much " labour " men as they are. Let me refer also to the position taken up in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman.</inline> He asserted the same rights in regard to the New South Wales Parliament as the honorable member for Maranoa asserted today, when he claimed that this was a free Parliament. Yet that man's right to private judgment, and liberty, and freedom of thought was seriously interfered with by these individuals. He will undoubtedly be hounded out of the ranks of the Labour party, because he is not content to be subservient to their rule. That is another illustration of the fact that it is impossible for a Government to represent a section and still uphold the laws of the land. The position occupied by the Attorney-General is a most peculiar one. I suppose there is no man in this House who would figure publicly upon the platform as more opposed to the evils of landlordism than the present Attorney-General, yet he is not only a landlord, but a landlord of the worst type. </para>

Certainly, he does not make those absurd and stupid references to the officers of his Department that the Minister of Home Affairs does, but so far as landlordism is concerned he stands in practically the same position, except that he is rather worse. The Attorney-General is a landlord, and owns a fine farm near Sydney. </para>

He leased that farm under conditions which apparently were not satisfactory to him, for he sought to eject his tenant. We must remember that he is the chief law adviser of the Crown, and is supposed to be intelligently acquainted with the operations and necessities of law, but what does he do? He attempts to enforce summary jurisdiction ; in other words, he is a democratic autocrat. If his tenant's position was not sound in law, the Attorney-General should have resorted to the proper processes of law to secure his ejection. Instead of that he went with a force of relatives and friends and sought to put the man off by force. He did not succeed on the first occasion, but he went again with reinforcements and succeeded in forcibly putting that man upon the public road. My honorable friends may laugh, but I do not think it strengthens their position in the country. The tenant felt aggrieved, and took action against the Attorney-General in the Courts, gaining a verdict for  £250  damages and costs. The Attorney-General, who is supposed to have some knowledge of law and ought to know what law costs, was not satisfied. </para>

The result of that case does not say much for the knowledge of law possessed by the Attorney-General, upon whom I apprehend the Prime Minister has to depend for legal instruction and guidance. I am sorry the Ministerial benches are almost empty, and should be very glad if the Minister of Trade and Customs could be induced to enter the chamber to hear what I am about to say.

                        <para class="block">A statement of this kind, coming from a man connected with one of the large industries of the Commonwealth, is most important. It shows that the want of labour is preventing the development of an industry which might be more profitably conducted in the interests of the community generally, as well as of the shareholders. In the same newspaper there is a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who disapproves of anything in the form of destructive monopolies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> is thus reported -  " Preference to unionists means unionist monopoly," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> M.L.A., last evening at a largely attended referendum meeting at the Kev Recreation Hall. He pointed out that the proposals of the Labour party embodied the purpose of preference to unionists, which would do away with the common rule laid down by the Wages Boards. What unionist monopoly meant might be gathered from recent events. There was here a union of employés in the making of felt hats. It had within its ranks every man working in the industry, and forbade chances of employment to non-unionists. A few months ago a number of hatters came from England. They had clearances from the organization to which they belonged in England, but they were kept nut of the union here. That union wanted employment to be restricted to its existing members. However, as the result of exposure, and in shame and sheer disgrace, the union ultimately admitted the men from England, but laid it down that in future men should not be admitted until they had resided in Victoria for several months, and had paid an entrance fee of £20. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> (the Minister of Customs) was a member of that union. </para>
                        <para class="block">The honorable member for Yarra, as I have said, is against anything in the form of destructive monopolies, and yet he is a member of a union which prohibits others joining ; and I say that that is a most invidious position, such as no Minister of the Crown ought to occupy. </para>

At the same time, as I have already pointed out, an industry is being stifled owing to the absence of necessary labour. A case of this kind must appeal to the commonsense of the community. I am assuming, of course, that the statements I have read are true, inasmuch as they have never been challenged ; but if they are not true, the Minister of Trade and Customs will have an opportunity to lay the facts before us. </para>

                            Honorable members opposite may say what they like as to their general desire for an increased population; but, as a matter of fact, every time a practical suggestion is made to that end they are against it. I was astounded yesterday afternoon to hear the Prime Minister say that the present Government were responsible for filling the ships with the emigrants now on their way to this country. That is a claim which cannot for one moment be substantiated, seeing that everything done to promote immigration has been done by the State Governments - and that no practical step has been taken by the Federal Labour party to introduce the labour necessary for this country.

                                <para>- That is not correct. There is not an industry in the land today that is not suffering from a dearth of labour. It is impossible for practical farmers to get the men they require, and there is not the grain production there ought to be. In the case of manufacturing industries, people are afraid to venture on new undertakings, owing to the lack of labour. </para>

                            <para>An advertisement was inserted by the bureau stating that carpenters were required. The bureau had on its books the names of several contractors who wanted men, and who were offering is. 5½d. per hour, or11s. 8d. per day, for a working week of 44 hours. Thirty-one carpenters answered the advertisement, and applied personally at the bureau. No fewer than 17 of them refused the work that was offering, two were unsuitable, and 12 were engaged, one contractor securing nine men, a second one, and a third two. The 17 refusals were on the following grounds :  - Two said the work was too far from their homes; one said it was too high a building ; one said he was already in employment, and thought the job was under the Government ; one said that he could get work much nearer home; two considered the jobs unsuitable; one did not like the district; one did not want that kind of work; three, when they heard while waiting where the work was, went away and refused work because it was in the suburbs. The contractor on whose behalf nine men were engaged subsequently reported that one of the men did not report himself; that he would not allow two to start; and that two others would not have been retained had it not been for the urgency of the. work. Out of the batch of nine he had secured four men with whom he was satisfied. </para>

                                <para>- I am no advocate for sweating. I believe in the workers receiving the best payment that we can possibly give them. That is only a fair proposition, which every right-thinking person must indorse. But the Little Australian policy, which would exclude every one from Australia on the ground that we had a good thing for ourselves, and ought to stick to it, must be conducive to our ultimate failure. If we are to retain our White Australia policy, it is absolutely necessary that we should fill the Commonwealth with white people. Ruin must stare us in the face unless we make strenuous efforts to do so. I adjure the Prime Minister to take the necessary steps, in defiance of his party, if he wishes to secure the confidence of the people. </para>

The only point that I wish to make is that the cook to whom I was referring justified his claim for an increase of wages on the ground that shearers, who work eight hours a day, earn as much as <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per day. This goes to show that the position is not altogether unsatisfactory from the workers' point of view. I certainly do not grudge them their pay. So far as the shearers are concerned. I think that they are entitled to more than ordinary consideration, since they have to travel from one station to another. </para>

                                <para>- I am not complaining. I am simply putting before the House the statement, which ought to be advertised in the Old Country, that men employed as shearers' cooks receive as much as <inline font-style="italic">j£j</inline> per week, and that expert shearers can earn as much as <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per day. There is only one other matter to which I desire to allude. I have before me a copy of a series of resolutions adopted by the South Australian Post arid Telegraph Association, and presented in due form to the Postmaster: General on the  17  th February last. One phase of these resolutions has already been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition ; but I wish to deal with <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> totally different aspect. Most honorable members opposite who support the Government are Socialistic. They believe in bringing every industry under the operation of the Crown ; they believe that all monopolies and, indeed, all the means of production, should be brought under the State. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. I wish to put this view for their serious consideration : Is it not a fact that, in regard to every public Department, both State and Federal, there is the utmost dissatisfaction on the part of the people? Is it not a fact that the results anticipated are not produced ? If one has business at the Lands Office one has to wait sometimes for months to obtain information which, if the Department were under private control, would be forthcoming in a week. All sorts of disabilities adversely affecting the interests of the people also exist in connexion with the Postmaster-General's Department. Things which ought to be done rapidly are left undone. Untenable positions are taken up: Yet the public are powerless to obtain redress j and even members of Parliament, although using all the influence that they are able to bring to bear, find it impossible to do so. That being so, seeing that in connexion with all public Departments, State and Federal, there is great dissatisfaction, and a condition of things which is not of the best, should we be justified in enlarging the Government's sphere of opera' tions, and giving them control of all industries? My honorable friends opposite will say that, although that might not be in the interests of the public, it would; nevertheless, be in the interests of those to be employed. Every member of Parliament knows, however, that every Public Department is reeking with dissatisfaction. </para>

                            <para>.- I feel certain that after the scathing remarks of the honorable member for Echuca, Ministers and their supporters must be shaking in their knees. He took the Ministry and also the party to book for much of the legislation which has been placed on the statute-book - for what they have not done, and for what they should have done. At the beginning of his address he objected to the Labour Government taxing absentees more than the citizens of Australia. I feel certain that ninety-nine and a half per cent, of its people will admit that it is quite justifiable to charge persons in other lands, who derive large fortunes from Australia, for its defence, seeing that they can give only money, not their blood, if war should take place. </para>

Much has been said here about loyalty to Great Britain. The honorable member for Echuca is one of those who feel strongly that they are loyalists in every sense of the word. </para>

                                <para>- Not content with claiming to be a loyalist himself, the honorable member wished to parade his loyalty by endeavouring to cast reflections on the loyalty of others. Not alone, but in common with honorable members on his side, he endeavoured to make out that those on this side are so disloyal that they would throw over the Old Country at any time it suited them. In spite of the fact that it may not be popular to say so, I do not believe that there is anything commendable in saying, " My country, right or wrong." I do not think that that is a fair stand for any man to take. If you were to carry out that idea to its natural conclusion, it would mean that you would have to commit perjury, because, if it is to be your country, right or wrong, it must be your home, right or wrong; and, irrespective of any injury which you may do to others, you must take a stand and swear that it is in the right. I am one of those who will not believe that that is a proper attitude to take. Then, again, honorable members on the other side talk of loyalty to the Old Country, if we differ in any sense from British legislation, in the making of which we have not a word. I, as the representative of a division in Australia, claim the right to criticise the action of the British Government in just the same way as a member of the British Parliament criticises them. </para>

                                <para>- The Opposition ; because every dissentient note which is uttered by anybody in Australia against the action of the British Government is called disloyalty. We hear so much of this talk from honorable members on the other side, that one would almost think that they represented the British Crown, instead of their constituencies in Australia. I do not want to parade my loyalty. I was reared in just as loyal surroundings as was any man in this House, and have preserved my loyalty; but when I hear honorable members laughing and jubilating over the fact that a spook-raiser in England charged the Prime Minister of Australia with being disloyal - and they believed it - I must enter a strong protest. There was only one Conservative paper in Australia which did not jubilate over the accusation - it had too much sense to do so - and that was the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>

                                <para>- I should like to know whether any honorable member in this House would not reserve to himself the right to criticise - and criticise severely - a war of that character. If he would not, he would be something short of humane. When a man feels inclined to criticise any action of the British Government, it is to make a play of the word " loyalty " to charge him with being disloyal. We have heard a great deal about strikes. The honorable member for Echuca has been trying to show that if the ideals of Socialism entertained by some of us were carried into effect the turmoil and strife that are sometimes witnessed in the industrial world today would be imported into the Public Service. The honorable member says that there has been dissatisfaction in the Public Service. Of course. I do not blame those men who were dissatisfied. The honorable member should bear in mind that what has caused all the trouble is the fact that Governments in the past have starved the Public Service. It was not a Labour Government that did that. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend now has sitting with him the members of those Governments, or as many of them as are left; and I trust that he will be able to handle them better than we did. The honorable member for Echuca referred to the enormous number of strikes in connexion with private employment, and contended that there would be more if the whole of the industries and utilities affected were carried on under a state of Socialism. After arguing that the Prime Minister was in error in saying that there were fewer strikes in Australia now than ever there were, the honorable member enumerated a list of strikes which have occurred, and then compared them with the trouble which has existed in the Public Service. He knows very well that it is the right of man to be dissatisfied with his position, and to strive to improve it if he can. No one can fairly find fault with any one who does so. My honorable friends opposite always charge the wage-earner with being responsible for strikes. They never attribute any of the responsibility to those whom they themselves represent here - the employing section of the community, those who have vested interests, and whose methods often bring about the strikes that occur. Honorable members opposite lament the fact that to-day the military cannot be called out by a Capitalistic Government to shoot down people. They say that we are jubilant because such a thing cannot now take place. Let me say that if a Labour Government were to call out troops to shoot down men who often cause strikes, namely, the Capitalistic class, such action would not be a bit more condemnable than was the conduct of Capitalist Governments in the past, when they called out troops to shoot down the workers. But what is good for the workers evidently is not good for the Capitalistic section of the community, who are wild because they have lost the power they once had. We quite understand, however, that when every man in the community is trained to the use of arms, there is not so much possibility of calling out soldiers to shoot people down as there was in the past. </para>

                                <para>- When every one is trained, every one recognises that if he takes part in shooting down his fellow men he may himself be placed in a position of being shot down on another occasion. Consequently, any Government would think twice, under these circumstances, before they called out one section of the workers to shoot down another. Even in European countries, Governments may find a difficulty in future in calling out their troops to shoot down other men belonging to the same class. </para>

                                <para>- We experienced in the past the fear of certain things that might be done, but which cannot be done now. Members of the Opposition do not like the change. They are ready enough with their condemnation when they think the wage-earners are to blame, but when they know that the other side is equally, if not more, to blame, we do not find them so ready to condemn. Since this Parliament met last year, our party have endeavoured to carry into effect that which was promised on the hustings at the last election, namely, that we would endeavour to alter the Constitution in order to bring about a proper system whereby the workers of Australia could appeal to the Courts and get satisfaction of their claims, instead of resorting to the old method of strikes ; and also whereby trusts and combines, such as exist in connexion with many utilities in Australia to-day, might be controlled. I admit candidly that I was hurt when I saw the result of the referenda on the 27th April . </para>

Of course, the Opposition in this Parliament did their best as an Opposition, but there were other factors that brought about the defeat which ought to be condemned. I admit at once that there was a split in our party. The so-called Labour Government in New South Wales did more to injure- </para>

                                <para>- The so-called Labour Government in New South Wales did more to injure the Labour movement, and bring about our defeat, than any other factor in the whole campaign, bar one. I am content to leave those gentlemen in New South Wales to their electors, who, I feel certain, will deal very effectively with them in the near future. The second factor was that champion amongst gutter journals, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. What were the methods adopted by those in charge of that newspaper to defeat the referenda campaign? Twelve months ago, when the Bills providing for the taking of the referenda were under consideration in this House the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> jeered and laughed at the efforts of the Opposition in opposing them. But, blowing hot one day and cold the next, before the session was finished it was trimming its sails for the right-about-face that took place afterwards. This newspaper controlled by, I suppose, the ablest journalists in Australia, prostituted itself for a passing gain, and in order to defeat the Labour party. It was conducted in such  :i  way as to reflect discredit upon those controlling it, and, I believe, to bring about, before very long, what they will thoroughly deserve, namely, the lowering of the circulation of the newspaper by about 75 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- We shall see. lt needs only a new newspaper to secure the subscribers and the advertisers will follow. I agree that a newspaper may be justified in very severe criticism of a political party. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> has criticised us severely. It has upbraided the Labour party and ridiculed our policy, but it has, at least, been consistent. The other journal to which I refer, which with its wide circulation should be a source of, great good to the people of Victoria and Australia generally, for some passing whim or anticipated gain, turned completely round and circulated throughout this State articles supporting contentions entirely opposed to those 'which it had submitted a few months previously. It is to this I attribute, in a large measure, the defeat of the referenda proposals, assisted by the money subscribed to the Liberal party by the monopolists of Australia. </para>

It could not turn any votes in my constituency during the referenda campaign. The Labour proposals were carried there by a majority of two and a half to one. It is clear, therefore, that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> exercises very little influence in my electorate when it plays the game fairly, and none at all when it acts crookedly as it did in the referenda campaign. I have no objection to severe criticism such as we get from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which is an avowed Conservative journal. But I do protest when I find the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which pretends to be Liberal, and the leader of Liberal thought in the community in an effort to put down the only Liberal party in Australia to-day, namely, the Labour party, resorting to methods that reflect no credit on those responsible for it. </para>

                                <para>- I have said that, alongside an ably written article, there would be an article headed " The Fisher Jaunt." You, sir, know the Prime Minister better than I do, and he had associated with him on his visit to the Old Country the Minister of External Affairs and the Minister of Defence. It is difficult to imagine any three men less likely to go on a jaunt. A good dinner would be lost on all three. Yet the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper published articles suggesting that these men were going on a jaunt to Europe merely for their own enjoyment, while the fact that Ministers were going to attend the Imperial Conference was purposely concealed. It would be asserted that they were going to attend the Coronation to disport themselves in knee breeches and cocked hats, and to show off their beauty to the people of Great Britain. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> writers charged Ministers with leaving Australia before it was necessary to attend the Coronation, and had not the manliness to explain that it was necessary that they should leave early to attend the Imperial Conference which preceded the Coronation festivities. It was no doubt felt that during the referenda campaign people who would be prepared to vote for the Labour proposals might be prevented from doing so by the publication of unfair statements suggesting that Ministers were going to the Old Country on a jaunt instead of to attend the Imperial Conference. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, that is how the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper paraded the matter. Had it been truthful it would have pointed out that that expenditure did not represent the Labour Government's policy in reference to defence, but the complete scheme suggested by Admiral Henderson. However, any stick was good enough to beat the Labour party with at the referenda. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> knew perfectly well that the Conservative element was not opposed to the expenditure of money upon defence, but it was also aware that£82,000,000 would be regarded by the Democrats of Victoria as an enormous sum for a Labour Government to spend in that way. These were the electors which that journal persuaded to vote against the Ministerial proposals in many of the constituencies. We all know that a newspaper which day after day hammers at one phase of a question must exert more influence with its readers than any speaker - no matter how able he may be - can do during the course of a campaign. </para>

For instance, it harped continually upon the waste of public money which was involved in the visit of a parliamentary party to Papua. That visit was the outcome of a belief in this House that honorable members ought to be possessed of more knowledge of Papuan affairs than they were. Consequently, the Minister of External Affairs stated that he would give them an opportunity of visiting that dependency. When the project was first mooted there were fifty members of this Parliament who were willing to undertake the trip. Of course, we all know that any honorable member, if he feels so inclined, can visit any portion of Australia at any time, and have his fare paid by the Commonwealth. But the idea underlying the trip to Papua was that during the recent recess honorable members should be afforded an opportunity of gaining a fuller knowledge of that Territory than they previously possessed. Only four days before polling-day the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> published an article upbraiding those who were about to visit Papua, . and. declaring that the trip was a form of political corruption. The very next day the Leader of the Opposition walked 'into the" Department of External Affairs and withdrew his name from the list of those who intended tei make it. 1 wonder if he thought that the visit was a form of political corruption. I do not think that he did. But so strong was the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article that the party which visited Papua did not include a single member of the Opposition. They were afraid of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The idea of a newspaper with such a large circulation as that journal enjoys, lowering itself to score a point during the referenda campaign by charging the Ministry with corruption merely because they had made arrangements by which honorable members might visit Papua to obtain first-hand information about that dependency ! </para>

                                <para>- I think it was the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> which did it. It endeavoured to frighten the members of the Labour party from taking the trip, but it was unsuccessful. I might mention many other articles which were published in that journal with a view to persuading the electors to vote against the referenda proposals. It painted the Government in such terrible colours that it achieved its object. It was this sort of tactics, combined with the large amount of money which was expended by the Liberal leagues, that resulted in the defeat of the Government proposals. In Victoria alone the Liberal League must have spent  £60,000  or  £70,000.  I have heard, too, that in New South Wales men in high positions had  £750  placed to their credit to cover their expenses during that campaign. I know that in my own electorate money flowed very freely, and that money did not come from members of the Opposition. </para>

                                <para>- I admitted at the outset of my remarks that I felt very sore over the defeat of the referenda proposals. Recent events have shown the power of monopolies, like the sugar monopoly, and when a vote is taken again, the people will not allow themselves to be led away by arguments like those which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> We had not the means of educating our people sufficiently, and could not successfully combat the influence of that journal. We were told that if we had ' asked merely for the power to restrain monopolies, we should have got it. But, however much the legislative powers were mixed together, the power to nationalize was submitted separately. Nationalization ' is the only effective way of dealing with monopolies, and at the present time the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is trying, ineffectively, to prove that the Government should start a national sugar refinery to put an end to the sugar monopoly. Although they were against us when we asked for power to deal with trusts, they say now that legislation of a drastic character is necessary to break up the Sugar Combine. In support ot their contention that the Government could establish a sugar refinery, they quote an American decision which was accepted by Justices Isaacs and Higgins in the Harvester Excise case, but overruled by the majority of the High Court. Of course, the only object of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is to' make the people believe that the Labour party could do something which it does not want to do. . The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has also published a series of articles upon the laziness of honorable members. No doubt, they really attack the Opposition; but do not care to do so openly. In the last article, they spoke of the poor tired members of this House starting work after nine months of luxurious ease, and referred to the Ministers as if they had done nothing during the recess. I know that flesh and blood could not have done more than the Ministers did during the recess, and that a Labour member is more fully employed when the House is not sitting than when it is sitting. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> writers know it, too. While the Opposition members can afford to treat their constituents with contempt, we cannot do so, and we do not wish to do so. Articles such as I refer to will eventually bring the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> into contempt, and have already greatly reduced its influence. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is mistaken if he thinks that I am in a hurry to get to Canberra. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is threatening the members of this House with terrible punishment if they do not carry out its demands for the revision of the Tariff. I represent what I believe to be the largest manufacturing electorate in Australia. I have been almost a prohibitionist, and would keep out of the country every article that could be manufactured in it ; but until we are able to protect the men who sent me here, I shall' not vote for any further protection to the manufacturers. During the referenda campaign, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said that the workers already enjoy new Protection. I deny it. It declared that new Protection was given by means of the Victorian Wages Boards and similar tribunals in other States. I deny that the Wages Boards, as they exist, give Protection to the workers in anything like the same sense that the manufacturers are protected by the Customs duties. When, at the end of last year, the Victorian Council and the Assembly were fighting over the appointment of Wages Boards for certain trades, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> warned the former that by refusing to appoint such Boards it was playing into the hands of the Labour party. The Council, nevertheless, persisted. We have many callings in which the wages and conditions of labour are not affected in any way by legislation. Yet they say that we have the new Protection ; they write articles, and get the manufacturers to clamour for more Protection. The honorable member for Echuca quoted what was said about the dearth of hatters. Another hat manufacturer, not' connected with the Denton Hat Mills, stated, in replying to a toast, that more Protection was wanted' in Australia on hats, as the importations were enormous, and finished up by saying, " And we cannot get workmen enough to perform the work we have now." These gentlemen, while they clamour for more Protection, want to import more workers to perform the work they have now. It must mean one of two things. Do they want workers brought here in larger numbers, to bring down the wages of those who are here already? If their trade has gone off for the want of more Protection, why do they clamour for more workers to do it? We hear the manufacturers of Australia say that they cannot get workmen, and yet in all the strikes, such as those mentioned by the honorable member for Echuca, they say they can get black-legs enough to fill the vacancies twice over. They can never get labour in the ordinary market, but when there are thousands of men out of work, apparently, they can get all the labour they want from the black scum of Australia. They ought to be consistent in their statements, or keep silent. </para>

                                <para>- I am talking about the present position. The manufacturers object to filling in the form, and they will not say what they object to. The honorable member for Parramatta knows that when the last Tariff was before this House T fought for as high duties as I could get. I worked night and day for Protection, and no one in this House will doubt that, in spite of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. If the manufacturers of Australia are really in earnest in their demand for more Protection, there is nothing in the form put before them that can do them any injury. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly ; and I know the honorable member would do the same, if he were asked to give more Protection. The greatest contention put forward is that, because higher wages are paid in Australia than in other places, it is necessary to impose high duties as a compensation. But the peculiarity, and I speak as a Protectionist, is that there is no industry in Australia that pays as high a percentage of wages as is represented by the duty protecting that industry. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is quite right. At that time I expected fair dealing from the manufacturers of Victoria, and trusted them; but I shall not trust them and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper any more, so far as that matter is concerned. I know we shall be taunted with deserting our principles, and honorable members will very shortly see me quoted by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> as a Free Trader. If there was one action more than another that ruined the chances of higher Protection being granted to any commodity, it was that of the agricultural implement makers in refusing to give what they promised, after being granted higher Protection by this Parliament. In 1906, when the fixed duty of £12 per machine was imposed, they promised that they would give fair wages; but when they obtained the duty, and secured the increased work, they broke their promise. McKay almost lived in the House during that time, and he and his company have amassed enormous dividends out of the increased work they have obtained ; but they refused to give the workers what they promised. When they took the matter to the High Court, and it was proved that the conditions we made were unconstitutional, it sounded the death-knell of new Protection in Australia. The Victorian manufacturers who suffered because of the action of the agricultural implement makers, swarmed round them like a lot of bees when the agricultural implement makers' employés strike took place in Melbourne this year. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member knows what the fight was over. These were the facts : The Wages Board had been sitting for seven months, and had come to no decision. The union, knowing it was useless to strike while their ranks were not half filled, issued an order that there would be a strike if the members did not come in by a certain date. They all came in, with the exception of about fifty. The union were getting them into the ranks, in order to bring about the raising of wages, because they felt that unless they took action the Wages Board would never come to a decision. That is the worst of a Wages Board. Until the  chairman  gives a casting vote, you may never get a decision. The day after the strike was declared, and not before, the  chairman  came to a decision; and as to whether it was a question of wages or of unionism, I can only say that the desire was to bring the men into the union in order that they might obtain the wages which were subsequently admitted to be fair. The Prime Minister, with a view of terminating the strike, communicated with the agricultural implement makers, and offered at that stage conditions which were not as good for the workers as the conditions eventually obtained. But the Chamber of Manufactures would not allow the agricultural implement makers to give way on the point; and a letter was received from that body saying in effect that the men must "eat dirt" - that they must come back unconditionally. The manufacturers, instead of condemning the men who ruined Protection in Australia, gathered around them, and we know for what reason ; they knew that the referendum was approaching. These men, through the newspaper which represents them, are clamouring to us - who have been sold over and over again - for more Protection, although we have no chance of Protection for those we represent. As an individual, and a representative in this House, I intend to support the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Government in the stand they have taken. </para>

                                <para>- I do not say that, but I think the honorable member will agree with me that much of the imported literature might be excluded with advantage. I feel just as keenly now as ever that we must make Australia a manufacturing country as well as an agricultural and mineral producer. But that must be done under the new order, and not under the old order; and I say to those who believe with the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper that we have not now new Protection. Experience has taught that where we have two sets of men, one representing the wage-earners and the other representing the employers, and a chairman who must have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> leaning towards the employers, because of the. class from whom he is usually selected, the results are not satisfactory.I admit that many broad-minded men have occupied the position; but the result is not new Protection. We ought to have the same class of tribunal as in our Arbitration Court, where all details are considered from a disinterested stand-point. Such a tribunal ought to consider the cost of production and the wages conditions, and give judgment accordingly. </para>

                            <para>.- We have listened to a very interesting speech from the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, in which he has given us an idea of the wonderful power and ability exercised by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in relation to the affairs of the Commonwealth as regarded by the' people of Victoria. I have not the least doubt that such an excellent advertisement for the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will be remembered with gratitude by that newspaper when the honorable member's election comes along. We want, however, to discuss in this House matters other than the particular policy of a newspaper, whether it be that of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> or any other. Since we have been in recess for a very long period, we may well be excused for giving a little time to the consideration of matters that have transpired, which are not only of interest to Australia, but of some significance to the whole world. I am very glad that we have got to work at last. I must confess that I waited with considerable impatience for the long recess to come to an end. Indeed, it sometimes occurred to me that perhaps the people of Australia might come to the conclusion that, after all, since no great harm had come to the country while Parliament was not sitting, it might be dispensed with for an even longer period. I feel sure, however, that we are all of one mind as regards the sittings of this Parliament being for the benefit of Australia. One matter which attracted the attention of the people of the Commonwealth during the recess was the representation of Australia at the Conference which met at the centre of the Empire, and was also associated with the Coronation of our King. The people of Australia undoubtedly watched the development of the proceedings and the work and the sayings of our representatives there with a good deal of interest. That interest was in many cases, I believe, not unmingled with a certain amount of apprehension, which grew to positive consternation on the part of many in view of what took place at the Conference. Even members of the Labour party - supporters of the Ministry throughout Australia - felt very grave concern regarding those Ministers who had gone Home to represent them. They saw in the newspapers wonderful statements of their amazing retinue, and of the curious and unusual company into which they had entered at Home. When they discovered that these stern and uncompromising Democrats had yielded to the allurements of the Court of London, and were appearing amongst other representatives of the Empire in the unusual garments prescribed by Court etiquette, many of them,I have no doubt wondered whether they were not being betrayed by men who had so rapidly forgotten those who had sent them to the centre of the Empire. While these, perhaps, were only trifles, they indicated to many what undoubtedly took place - they indicated a complacency, brought about by the environment of Ministers, which had a rather unfortunate effect on any reputation that they might have sought to achieve at the Conference. I was rather surprised to find it stated in London, and reported here within a week of the arrival of Ministers in that city, that they were prepared to put aside their opposition to the Declaration of London. </para>

In view of the fact that those honorable gentlemen went away, as we were given to understand, determined to oppose the ratification of that agreement by the Conference, I have been waiting very anxiously to hear from them the reasons, which must have been sound and substantial, I presume, that caused them to waive any opposition to the ratification of that agreement. </para>

                                <para>- It is one of the most important matters that have been discussed at any Conference of this kind for many years - a matter affecting, in my opinion, one of the most vital interests of the Empire, arid affecting the interests of Australia even more than those of the Mother Country. I am surprised, therefore, that no word has been uttered by the Prime Minister, or by either of those Ministers who accompanied him, as to the reasons which animated them in withdrawing their opposition to the ratification of that very important agreement. </para>

                                <para>- The people of Australia are entitled to hear the reason for this <inline font-style="italic">volte-face</inline> on the part of Ministers. We have not yet heard it, and I take it that it is due to the people of Australia that the Prime Minister should avail himself of an early opportunity to enlighten them in that respect. Reference has been made once or twice to one episode to which I find it necessary to allude again very briefly, in view of a statement made in connexion with it in another place by the Minister of Defence. The people of Australia, I believe, read with a great deal of surprise and disgust that the Prime Minister had been in a manner lost in the Coronation procession in London. He was discovered, by, of course, the enterprising pressman, riding in a carriage with the Prime Minister of Canada, and surrounded by Canadian horsemen. The Minister of Defence in another place gave as a reason why the Prime Minister appeared in London without a representation of our Military Forces, such as the Prime Minister of Canada had, that the object of the Ministry was not to lead the people of Great Britain to think of the Australians merely as a military nation. Just imagine for a moment how the people of Great Britain, and the crowds in London On 1 hat occasion in particular, would have jumped unhesitatingly to the conclusion that Australia was a great military nation if: they had happened to see its Prime Minister surrounded with a squadron of Australian horsemen. It indicates, to my mind, that the Minister of Defence - a man who previously had no inclination towards military matters at " all - has become so obsessed by his office that he is actually under the delusion that Australia is at the present time a great military nation, and that it was necessary to refrain from sending a handful of troops to London lest the people of Great Britain might become apprehensive of the great military domination which might be exercised by Australia in regard to our interests in the Empire. Surely that is about the poorest excuse that could have been given for a feature of that procession which most Australians deplore. </para>

                        <para>Then the Prime Minister has congratulated himself and the people of Australia upon the fact that he, for the first time, as we are given to understand, in the history of the Empire, was taken into the confidences of the imperial Government. I want to know whether these confidences were of a personal nature; whether they were conveyed to the Prime Minister, not by virtue of his office, but for some other reason. If they were of an official nature, do I understand that they are shared with his Ministers? If they are shared with his Ministers, I want to know, also, if they are shared with his party. If they are not shared with his party, then a very singular position has been created in connexion with the Labour movement. The Prime Minister, and his colleagues I presume, have secrets from their party, and these, we are given to understand, are of very grave importance indeed. They are fraught with much significance to the Empire, and naturally to Australia, and yet the Labour party, the Labour organizations, the people who sent these gentlemen here, and made them the leaders of this Parliament at the present time, are in entire ignorance of their subject-matter. If that is the position, I apprehend that in the near future there will be some difficulty in the Labour movement. The result, I apprehend, will be that the people who constitute this party will insist that there shall be no secrets held from them by their Ministers ; that, at any rate, the members of the parliamentary party shall know them. If that is so, I arn very much afraid that the confidences bestowed on the Prime Minister by the Imperial authorities will be somewhat: regretted, in view of such a development. </para>
                        <para>There is one feature of the Conference on which I believe we can all congratulate ourselves and the Prime Minister for his efforts in that direction, and that is the conviction which is growing upon the minds of our statesmen in the Old Land - a conviction which has been present in the minds of most of us, I believe, in the outlying parts of the Empire - that the time has arrived when we must close up our ranks and present as united a force as possible to whatever danger we may be likely to meet in the near future. There is no doubt whatever of the urgency of these steps. We cannot shut our eyes to the growing danger of a war taking place that will throw into the shade anything which has occurred in the history of the civilized world ; and it behoves Australia - and I think that we are all keenly realizing this of late - to wake up and take her share of the responsibility. That Australia is rousing herself in serious fashion to take up the work which devolves upon her by reason of her position I have no doubt- whatever. But there are some features in the attitude of some of our people which I, for one, very much deplore, and I wish to refer to them now, because I think it is a fitting opportunity. Throughout the civilized world we observe a considerable amount of restraint exercised by one nation in its criticism of another. There is a kind of law of courtesy in regard to international dealings, which I think it is wise should always be observed. For some time we in Australia have felt reason to regard with apprehension danger from a certain direction of the Orient, namely, Japan, and we are pleased, I think, that the alliance which existed between Great Britain and Japan for some years has been renewed. I think it is very well indeed for us that the Japanese people should be our allies rather than our possible assailants. But throughout the years we have been allied, through the agreement of the Imperial authorities with the Japanese, I have observed in certain sections of the press the most cruel and uncalled-for writings and caricatures of that people. I. believe that in no other part of the world would these things have been tolerated to the extent - they' have been in Australia. I believe that in many other countries that kind of thing, carried to the extent to which it has been carried in Australia, would have brought about international complications. </para>

                        <para>It is somewhat amusing to notice the only reference in the Governor-General's Speech to the important matter of immigration. The subject is not altogether omitted, but the reference is of a character which makes it almost farcical. We are told that the policy of the Government in connexion with land taxation has had the effect of bringing immigration to our shores. A statement of that kind will be regarded with a smile, even in the Labour ranks. There is no doubt whatever that this Government has so far failed lamentably in encouraging immigration. The work that has been done has been carried out by the State authorities. I am very much afraid that as long as this Government is in office we shall not see that energetic action in regard to immigration that the country has a right to expect, and that is of such vital importance to Australia. The Minister of Defence admitted, in the course of a speech in another place, to which I have already alluded, that, in the past, the Labour party had not been favorable to immigration ; but he gave those who listened to him to understand that that was all changed. I challenge the Minister of Defence, or any member of this Government, or any member of the Labour party, to show in what respect the policy of the party has altered from the time when the Minister admitted that they were opposed to immigration. They carry out the pretence of encouraging immigration, but they know that they dare not actively encourage it - not even that kind of immigration that we want so badly above all other forms, namely, immigration with the object of settling our waste places with those who are prepared to cultivate the soil. Even when that is proposed the Government and Parliament are reminded from certain quarters that there is a possibility of a trickle of such immigrants into the cities, and1 that, therefore, it is dangerous. As long as the trade unions control the policy of the Labour party, as they do at the present time, no active steps will be taken in connexion with immigration by this Labour Government, nor by any other Labour Government; and I, for one, regret very deeply indeed the short-sighted policy that makes them put a mere present interest of their own, of the narrowest kind, against a policy that is of the very nature of life itself to Australia. We want immigration. We want an active policy in this connexion by the Commonwealth Parliament and Government; and I believe that any Government that plays with the subject will not be tolerated very long by the people of Australia, who keenly realize the necessity for filling up our country with that human element without which we cannot expect to hold our own, faced, as we are, by countless numbers of Asiatics so near to our shores. </para>
                        <para>The attitude of this Government in connexion with the Tariff is somewhat amusing. We are now told that Ministers want certain information from the manufacturers as regards the cost of production and the proportion of labour in the value of their products. I wish to remind those who, like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, make that a condition of increasing the Tariff, that four years ago the Free Trade section of the Tariff Commission put all those facts and figures before Parliament. They pointed out what the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has been saying to-night, that in the majority of cases, if it came to be a consideration of the exact amount of labour which entered into the production of commodities, there would practically be no Protection at all - that the proportion of labour in a given product in these days of labour-saving machinery was so insignificant that, in the majority of Australian industries of any consequence, the freights on imported goods were more than equal to the difference in the value of the labour, even taking the extreme difference between Australian rates of wages 'and the lowest paid labour that competes with us. The facts for which the present Government are asking the manufacturers are, 1 repeat, contained in the volume of reports presented by the Free Trade section of the Tariff Commission ; and 1 wish to warn the Protectionists that, if they insist on entering into this particular phase of Protection,, they will disclose a very weak point in the position indeed. I think it will be better, for them to proceed on the general question, because, undoubtedly, if it is merely a matter of protecting the labour employed in connexion with Australian production, they will find the ground sliding rapidly from under them. </para>
                        <para>I am very pleased to learn that the Government intend to introduce legislation dealing with banking. I have had occasion to bring before this Parliament, and other Parliaments, the great necessity for legislation on that subject. I hope that this will be one of the measures that the Government will carry through curing the present session. There is another matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> of very grave importance, in my opinion, in connexion with the welfare of the people of this country, that I have been waiting anxiously for some time to have dealt with, and regarding which there is no reference in the Governor-General's Speech. We have had, time and again, and particularly of late, a recrudescence of certain abominable and immoral offences on the part of aliens amongst us, and many people are crying out for a law which will enable us to send such people out of our country when they are convicted of such offences.' At the present time we can only deport alien criminals for crimes of violence. But there are other crimes, not classified as crimes of violence, to which these people have been particularly prone - crimes against the welfare of our girls and women, which they perpetrate, and for which they may be punished. But they are allowed, when their period of imprisonment is over, to . remain in the country and perhaps to perpetrate such offences again. I say that since we are determined to keep even the best of such aliens out of Australia, we should take measures to deport the worst of them wherever we find it desirable. </para>
                        <para>I introduced a measure last session having that for its object, and if the Government do not intend to deal with the subject, I shall introduce it again, and ask the assistance of honorable members to carry it into law. </para>
                        <para>The intention expressed by the Government to carry out the transcontinental railway is one I am very glad to be able to compliment them upon. I hope they will lose no time in this important national undertaking. In view of the wonderful success which has attended the opening up of Canada by the construction of similar railways, I feel sure that the pessimistic predictions of some people, especially in this part of the Commonwealth, will be absolutely falsified by the results from that railway in a very few years after its construction. I hope that no time will be lost in carrying out the work, which, as a matter of fact, the people of Western Australia anticipated, when they agreed to enter the Federation, would be well nigh completed by this time. </para>
                        <para>There is another matter, also, in which the people of that State are  interested, and concerning which no mention is made in the Governor- General's Speech. Following on the report presented by Admiral Henderson, we were given to understand that the Government intended to proceed with the construction of two important naval bases for the Commonwealth. One of these was to be at Port Stephen, on the New South Wales coast, and the other at Cockburn's Sound, near Fremantle. 1 hope that the omission from the Speech of any reference to these two important naval .works does not mean that they are to be shelved indefinitely. Surely the establishment of these naval bases ought to be taken 'in hand and proceeded with side by side with the development of our general naval policy. We cannot have an effective Navy without these naval bases, and common-sense would suggest that they should be ready, as soon as the men-of-war and various naval fighting machines are available to make use of them. I shall not detain the House any longer. I hope that we shall be able to get through a considerable part of the work put .before us in the Governor-General's Speech, and will be in a position to go into recess at about the usual time for the close of a session of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>In submitting the motion, I should like to say that yesterday, in answer to a question by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, I stated that the price paid to sugar-growers for cane was increased proportionately with an increase in the price of sugar. I find that that statement is not accurate, since only a portion of the sugar-growers receive an increased price for their cane when the price of sugar is raised. </para>
