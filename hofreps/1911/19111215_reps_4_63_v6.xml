                        <para>- I have seen the statement, but part of it is absolutely wrong, the raw material being dutiable, not at 5 per cent., or free if from the United Kingdom, but at the same rates, so far as the- bulk of it is concerned as the finished handkerchiefs. I explained that in thes chamber the other night. </para>

                        <para>The allowance paid to Area Officers is&#163;150 per annum. These officers are permitted to follow their civil avocations, as the military work can be done in the evenings and Saturday afternoons, and under the conditions of their appointment they are not called upon to give more than five days a month away from their residences. Staff-Sergeant instructors are provided in each area to carry out all routine work. When an Area Officer&#39; is required to. do any travelling he receives the usual travelling expenses. </para>
                        <para>In these circumstances it is not proposed to increase the remuneration to Area Officers. </para>

                        <para>- It will provide wholly for the purchase of land and the erection of buildings for Commonwealth offices in London, and will furnish  &#163;1,000,000  towards the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The sum of &#163;600,000 will be set apart for the acquisition of land in the Federal Capital Territory, which will pay for the resumption of nearly all the privately-owned land in the territory, it being the policy of the Government to acquire all such lands. No one can tell what that amount will ultimately prove to be, because the valuations of the Commonwealth officers may be disputed by the owners, and the usual process of arbitration may have to be resorted to. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but I hope that neither the honorable member for Maribyrnong nor any other honorable member will jump to any conclusion until they know exactly what is proposed. There are two courses open to a sensible Parliament under such circumstances. One is to leave this land in the possession of private owners, with all the advantages of the unearned increment arising from expenditure of public money, and the other is to acquire the land with public money and secure the unearned increment to the Commonwealth. The latter is the policy of the Government, and I should be curious to hear the arguments of the advocates of private ownership on Federal territory. The money is provided by this Bill in order that land may be taken over by the Commonwealth, and it is only fair to the present owners and the Commonwealth that a speedy determination should be arrived at. </para>

I need not offer arguments in favour of the purchase of the London site, because members are unanimous on that point, especially those who know most about the matter. This is an investment that no one can challenge either in regard to the site or the proposed building. Treasury bills to the amount of  &#163;226,000,  issued by the South Australian Government in connexion with their indebtedness on the Northern Territory, fall due this year, and their redemption is provided for in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is not concluded yet. The Engineer-in-Chief has reported to the Minister of Home Affairs, that vary little money will be expended during the financial year, beyond that rendered necessary in getting ready for the works. It is desired, however, to be able ito proceed in the most economical way when once a start is made ; and I understand that there will then have to be considerable expenditure. As to the whole financial position, this is undoubtedly a Loan Bill ; and do not let any honorable member get it into his head that it is anything else. But it can be j.ust as definitely stated that it will not be necessary to appeal, either publicly or privately, to any persons or bodies other than those in the Commonwealth for this money. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am glad that question has been asked, because it enables me to say that the money can be provided without in any way amending the Australian Notes Act. I may as well mention that the net capital sum in that trust fund, and available for investment, will, before this money is required, be increased by &#163;250,000 in the shape of accrued interest. This will be available in the same way as the principal sum itself ; and I have given instructions that as the interest falls due it is to be reinvested, thus giving us compound interest. The proposed investments are permanent ; and almost immediately, and certainly in the future, they will be worth more than the original sum. At the same time, the policy of the Government, and, I believe, the policy of this Parliament, is that not only shall the Consolidated Revenue be charged for the interest on this expenditure, but that there shall be added an amount equal to&#189; per cent, as a sinking fund. This will wipe out the indebtedness in the lives of many of the young Australians toddling about at the present time, because, on a 3 per cent. basis, a sinking fund at&#189; per cent. would pay off a loan in sixty-six years. That is the basis of this financial proposal, and it is a sound one. There is no doubt that ultimately these investments will be profitable, perhaps beyond the dreams of any of us, particularly in regard to the Federal Capital area. The other great work, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta : railway, has to be further provided for. There is no provision for a sinking fund in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Because there is really no provision even for interest - this is only an appropriation. The sinking fund is provided for in the Inscribed Stock Bill. Under ordinary circumstances it would be excusable if there were no sinking fund at all ; but that is not the policy of this Government or this party. </para>

                        <para>- I said there would be; in other words, there will be charged to each of these works separately the interest that will be paid to the Trust Fund out of which this money will be advanced, and an additional amount for a sinking fund. It will be an annual appropriation debited to the particular Department by which  a  work is carried out. This will mean that in the lifetime of a man, the property will be owned by the Commonwealth without any further indebtedness or obligation. </para>

                    <para>.- This Bill marks the fact that the Government have at length realized the inevitable conditions upon which the development of the continent must proceed, whether that development takes the form of railway construction or of any other public works. The present is not the first occasion on which this Parliament has been asked to authorize such a loan - honorable members will recollect that one was sanctioned by the last Parliament, although not proceeded with. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">In the present instance, the Government, as soon as they were brought face to face with the necessity of providing for the development of this country, have been compelled to devise means for the acquisition of funds which cannot be expected to come out of the ordinary revenue for the year. As the opening up of the Northern Territory, the construction of a line of railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and other undertakings of a similar character, can never be financed out of the annual receipts of the Commonwealth, it has become necessary for Ministers, who have hitherto constantly and sometimes angrily, condemned a borrowing policy, to recognise - now that the turn of events has placed responsibility upon their shoulders - that the adoption of this course cannot be avoided. </para>
                <para>We may congratulate ourselves that the introduction of this Bill has been postponed until now only because of financial considerations. As a matter of fact, it would have been enormously to our advantage if it had been possible to authorize the construction of these great works at an earlier date. Personally antagonistic to any borrowing by the Commonwealth that is not rendered obligatory by the absolute business demands of the situation, I have always jealously regarded the terms and conditions upon which this necessary creation of a debt would have to be made. The statement of the Prime Minister shows that he has realized these obligations and responsibilities. When the Bill, which is covered by this motion, comes before us, we shall be able to criticise in greater detail the particular undertakings which the Government propose. Speaking generally, it relates to works that ought not to be longer postponed, but constructed with all possible economy, consistent with efficiency, for which we should provide a reasonable sinking fund from the first hour of their initiation. These few observations are offered merely to mark the present occasion which represents the entry of the Commonwealth upon that stage of effective national action to which we have been looking forward so long, restrained by force of circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. - I think we all recognise that this is the first time that the Commonwealth have decided to borrow money for the purpose of carrying out public works. Whilst it is true that this Parliament on a former occasion authorized a borrowing policy, it is equally true that up to the present that policy has not been put into operation. I realize to the full the necessity which exists for carrying out certain great national works, and I agree that it is impossible to construct those works entirely out of revenue. I am one of those who is opposed to borrowing if that course can possibly be avoided. There is one very commendable feature about the proposal of the Government, namely, that instead of the Commonwealth being called upon to pay interest upon the loan which it is intended to raise, to some money-lender, that interest will be paid to our own people. I am very pleased that provision has been made for the payment of a&#189;percent. per annum upon the amount of the loan into a sinking fund. I wish also to impress on the Prime Minister the fact that in years to come some of these works will be more than self-supporting. In other words, they will return more than sufficient to pay working expenses and interest upon their capital outlay. Therefore, the Prime Minister will do well to provide that any moneys returned by them in excess of the sum required to cover working expenses and interest should be utilized for the purpose of wiping out their indebtedness. I look upon this proposal purely as a business one. If we construct a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and if twenty years hence the returns from it are more than sufficient to pay interest and working expenses upon the capital outlay, it would not be fair that the excess receipts should be treated as revenue. Instead of that excess being credited to the general revenue it should be devoted towards wiping out the cost of this undertaking. I feel sure that in regard to the resumption of lands in the Federal Capital the Government are doing the proper thing. That land must become much more valuable as time goes on, so that the Commonwealth must reap a substantial benefit from it. If to-day those lands will return 3 per cent. upon the money invested in their purchase, twenty years hence they will return considerably more; and the excess, I maintain, should be devoted towards liquidating the Commonwealth indebtedness in that connexion. I believe that this is one of those points which has been lost sight of in the past by our State Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the old pawnshop. He has stated that the projected loan will absorb practically the whole of the Trust Funds from which we are now borrowing. Now, if a railway is to be constructed from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, this vote of &#163;1,000,000 will have to be an annual one until that work is completed. And if we absorb the whole of our Trust Funds now we shall be compelled to resort to the same old borrowing process. It is absurd to endeavour to draw a distinction between the flotation of this loan in Australia and its flotation abroad, because we know that some of the State&#39;s have been offering their Treasury bills - which are simply short-lived loans - over the counter. What has been the result? The result has been that money from abroad has been invested in those debentures. </para>

Upon that occasion the present Treasurer was absolutely opposed to the Commonwealth borrowing until the States debts had been transferred to it. He said - </para>

                        <para>- The London money market was not mentioned. I have already pointed out the fallacy of believing that a distinction can be drawn between floating a loan locally and floating one in London. The greater portion of a loan floated locally will be taken up by London capitalists if it suits them to do so. If these great works are to be carried out, I can see no possibility of constructing them year by year out of revenue. It is proposed, for instance, to expend &#163;1,000,000 a year on the construction of the Western Australian transcontinental railway. </para>

                        <para>- It would be impossible to construct the line out of revenue in four or five years. Notwithstanding the position taken up by this House ever since I entered it, and particularly by the Labour party, in opposition to the policy of borrowing, we are now proposing to resort to the same old system, with the exception that during the first year we shall be able to borrow from the Trust Funds of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister says that he will control the Trust Funds by this Bill, but next year, if the transcontinental railway is to be completed, and the Northern Territory developed, we shall have to pass further loan Bills. In the second year we shall be in precisely the same, position as are the States. We shall be issuing short-dated Treasury Bills, and laying the flattering unction to our souls that we are borrowing from ourselves. There should be a sinking fund, and it should be impossible for any future Treasurer to raid it, as such funds have been raided by some of the States, or to refrain from making further contributions to it. If the Government do not raid this sinking fund, or stop contributing to it- </para>

                        <para>- No, and I never knew a Treasurer who would not raid such a fund in preference to proposing unpalatable taxation. So far as the Federal Capital purchase is concerned, I think that the land to be so acquired there should be almost reproductive from the start. From the moment we&#39; commence spending public money upon it, it will be reproductive, and I believe revenue-producing. But who would suggest that the Western Australian railway will be for many years remunerative? Out of the revenue of that line we are going to create a sinking fund, and we are going to make good out of revenue the losses sustained on that railway. That, after all, is only a bookkeeping system, in so far as any practical results are concerned. It is absurd to say that out of the slight earnings of the line we are going to take&#189; per cent. to build up, a sinking fund, whilst we are taking directly from the people the moneys required for the building of the line. By creating a sinking fund the Government are not going to make these works reproductive, or to enable the Commonwealth to pay for them out of receipts. I admit at once that if these works are to be carried out we must borrow to provide for them, but it will be a bad day for us when we proceed to add to the indebtedness of Australia- </para>

                        said he was in favour of a policy that would be for the good of the citizens and the Commonwealth generally. We are all on that line of pious aspiration ; but I want to point out to him when considering his policy speech for Gympie if he will take into account that the no-borrowing policy when carrying out a huge public works scheme might be very embarrassing to the States. Because, if he is proposing to do these huge national works out of revenue year by year there must be less money to go back to the States. I want him to consider that in his speech - that no State can possibly carry on huge reproductive works out of revenue, and we cannot afford to do it by relinquishing revenue that we have a right to expect to come back from the Commonwealth in order that the Commonwealth may carry on such a policy.

                    <para>The PRIME MINISTER : I would like to say I view with the utmost political horror a seventh borrower in Australia going on the money market. I feel that the desire of the people of the Commonwealth is to have one borrower instead of several, and it would take something to move me to launch out into a borrowing policy until some arrangement was come to between the States and the Commonwealth. I shall, of course, give consideration to the question. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The State Premiers were afraid that the Commonwealth, having control of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, would retain the whole of its revenue, and,  perhaps, construct public works out of it. When the question of raising money for naval and military purposes arose, I said that in no circumstances except in case of war or national &#39;emergency, would I resort to borrowing for that purpose. These are the facts of the case. The honorable member for Franklin made one or two short quotations from the report which placed upon my attitude a perfectly wrong construction. This party has never been pledged to oppose borrowing. We have been too wise and sensible to so pledge ourselves, but we are the one party in Australia that has led the people out of the disastrous position in which they were placed by the States - and in no State was the position worse than it was in Tasmania. We put a stop to the borrowing that was practically ruining the country, and insisted upon provision being made for a redemption fund in connexion with every loan. </para>

My own view is that it has proved successful, and that the States have acted wisely in investing Savings Bank funds in this way, and so rendering it unnecessary for them to go abroad for money. I am not dealing with the point of where this money is to come from. That, I think, will be discussed on another Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman has said that the Labour party have led the way in putting an end to wasteful loan expenditure without provision for redemption ; but, with all respect to him, others have been equally ready to do that, and have given statutory effect to their determination. I remind the Committee that in the Naval Loan Act passed by the Fusion Government, for the first time in an Australian Parliament, the principle of a redemption fund was affirmed. From the inception of Federation, every one of the Treasurers of the Commonwealth have advocated the establishment of sinking funds for the redemption of loans. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, in 1902, advocated that, on loans, there should be at least 1 per cent. paid to a sinking fund. In the Naval Loan Act provision was made for a sinking fund to bring about the redemption of the loan within a period co-terminous with the life of the ships, so that by the time they became relatively useless, the full amount necessary to replace them would have accumulated in the sinking fund. I wish it to be understood that the principle of a sinking fund has already been laid down, and that in that respect the present proposal of the Government is not novel. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen but for the suggestion of the honorable member for Hunter that  any surpluses of revenue from these business undertakings in excess of what may be necessary to pay interest and redemption should be paid into a sinking fund. I do not regard that as in accordance with a correct principle in connexion with public services, as every effort should be made to make them as cheap as possible to the public. In my opinion, after interest and a fair redemption fund have been provided for, all surplus revenue from such undertakings should go towards a reduction of the cost of the services to the public. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hunter is a little previous in his remarks, and his interjection is not very sane. I am referring to surplus revenue during the time the works are being paid for, and not after payments to the sinking fund have ceased. It would be absolutely idiotic for any man to say that the service should then be given free, while the capital account remained unreduced, although the nearer we could get to giving public services free to the people the better I should like it. I should make no complaint if we were in a position to give the service of the Western Australian railway absolutely free to the public. Some people are of opinion that the more the public are charged for services rendered the greater is the amount of statecraft shown in the conduct of public affairs. While a loan is being paid off, to allocate the whole of the surplus from the work on which it has been expended might mean to continue an exorbitant charge upon the public for the use of the service. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that that will help the honorable member very much. If the Government do not provide money for the purpose, Tasmania will not get it. Apparently Governments that have been supported by the honorable member in the past were not prepared to do justice to the State from which he comes. It was left to a Labour member from that State to set on foot an inquiry into the matter referred to in order that a report upon it might be submitted to Parliament, and it is left to a Labour Government to give the State the necessary assistance. In spite of this, all the thanks we get from the honorable member is misrepresentation of the attitude of the Prime Minister in connexion with this proposal. I was very pleased with the  statement made by the Prime Minister, and it is not necessary that I should touch upon a number of the matters he referred to, because he cleared up, by answering my interjections, a number of points about which I was anxious. As long as it is provided somewhere in the Statute that&#189; per cent. per annum shall be paid for redemption, it is all the statutory protection in that connexion that we can require. We can make no provision that would prevent any future Parliament, if it thought fit, from passing a Bill to reverse the present policy. The Government of the day, however, will  have to take the responsibility for any such course. As far as the present Government are concerned, they are initiating this policy upon absolutely sound business-like lines - namely, that we shall raise loans only for purely reproductive services. </para>

                    <para>.- The statement of the Prime Minister, indorsed by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, and the evident uneasiness which exists amongst honorable members opposite, must make us realize that the, Government have now started upon a loan policy. One by one all the great ideals which the Government and their&#39; supporters laid before the people of Australia are fast disappearing from view. Now another one of them is being thrown aside. A piece of policy out of which they have made much political capital at the expense of other parties is now, on the admission of the Prime Minister, disappearing. </para>

                        <para>- I know all about reproductive works ! Honorable members on this side of the House were never in favour of borrowing, and throwing money recklessly about. All the borrowing that we favoured was for absolutely necessary purposes, and for the advantage of the people of Australia. Now that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have thrown upon their shoulders responsibilities in connexion with such great works as the development of the Northern Territory, the building of the transcontinental railway, the erection of the Federal Capital, and other enterprises to which reference has been made this morning, they realize just as keenly as do others who have occupied the Treasury bench that in order to realize the policy that Australia requires we cannot depend entirely upon the current year&#39;s revenue. The Government are now compelled, to take the first trip to the pawnshop on the part of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister spoke pretty strongly, and I am entitled to put the matter quite plainly in answer to him. This, I say again, is the first trip to the pawnshop on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. That will be realized by the people of this country when they understand the departure that is being made this morning. </para>

                        <para>- I am not now referring to loans to the States. That question does not now arise. I shall probably have something to say about it on a more suitable occasion. The honorable member for Franklin has referred to what happened at the Conference in Hobart&#39;. Quotations from the report have been made, both by the honorable member and the Prime Minister. I find that on no fewer than three occasions the Prime Minister made a definite statement on this subject. On page 16 of the report he said - </para>

                        <para>- The position is that in the first year the money will come out of the Trust Fund. But we are launching very big works, including the Kalgoorlie railway, the development of the Northern Territory, and others. Whilst the money in the Trust Fund may be sufficient to meet the needs of the Government in the first year, there is no doubt in my mind that after the first year the Government will find it necessary to borrow. They must do so unless they are going to allow the transcontinental railway to remain unfinished and&#39; the development of the Northern Territory to stand still. The Prime Minister, at the Conference in Hobart, realized this very position, as the following quotation from the report will show : - </para>

                        <para>- Of course, we must all agree with the right honorable gentleman. It is perfectly clear that when the first year has gone by, the Prime Minister, if he be still in office, in order to carry ore the development of the Northern Territory, which is necessary in the interests of the defence of Australia, the construction of the trans-continental railway and other works, will be compelled, as the States have been compelled to do in connexion with their works, to go on to the money market, either in Australia or in London, to obtains the necessary capital to complete these great national undertakings. I must commend the Prime Minister for this. I have often attempted to realize what Australia would be at the present time if she had not had the advantage of the money which has been borrowed for developmental works - how should we have had our railways, our roads, and other great undertakings, which have made Australia what she is to-day? They could never have been constructed! without loan money. As long as loan money is devoted to reproductive works, it. is proper to borrow, especially for the development of a great and growing country like Australia. But I shall await with interest what will be said by those throughout Australia who have supported the Prime Minister and his party in their opposition to borrowing. In regard to the site for London offices, I heartily approve of the proposition made by the Government. I had an opportunity of inspecting the site when I was in London, and I believe that the Government are doing absolutely the right thing in connexion . with it. But I trust that before any buildings are put up on the site, the Prime Minister will give consideration to a suggestion which I am about to make. We have in Australia a number of highly-skilled architects, and I trust that an opportunity will be afforded to Australian talent to show what it can do. Our architects should be afforded a fair and reasonable show. </para>

Personally, I feel satisfied that whilst great expenditure may be required on account of this public work, there are magnificent resources within the Federal Territory which it will be remunerative to -develop. I am now thoroughly familiar with the Territory, and I wish some other honorable members, who are always gibing at the expenditure, would visit YassCanIberra and see for themselves. </para>

He would then be satisfied that the Government are doing the right thing in resuming the private lands within the area. I hope that in the future - in the near future - these lands will have such a large incremental value that they will more than justify the expenditure which will be entailed on account of the resumptions and the building of the &#34;Capital. </para>

                    <para>.-- I have long recognised that it is impossible to carry on the various works that the Commonwealth will have to undertake without eventually going in for a borrowing policy of some sort. The undertakings mentioned in the schedule show the enormous expenditure in front of us, which it is impossible to meet without borrowing money. Whilst I have always deprecated any wild system of borrowing for every possible purpose, and living beyond our means, and recognise that when we do initiate a borrowing policy we must exercise&#39; all due economy in the expenditure of the loan funds, I am bound to say that no one can look into the future without recognising that shortly the Commonwealth must become a large borrower of money. The honorable member for Hindmarsh said he had never heard that the Labour party had committed itself in any way to a non-borrowing policy. I should like to refer him to a dodger issued in his own State during the recent by-election for Boothby. That election was fought by the Labour party on the non-borrowing issue. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that the money is coming due, but it is not due to-day. The Government are asking for authority to borrow practically two and a half millions, but the money is not now free, and will not be free for six months or more. Although the Prime Minister may be correct in theory up to a certain point, he is not actually correct in stating that at the present time the money is in the Australian Notes Trust Fund Account, free to invest in these securities. He has investments falling due, and can transfer the money from them to these particular investments, but he has not the money to invest now. &#39;If he sets more money free from the Australian Notes Trust Fund Account, he may transfer the money from the investments in which it already is to these Commonwealth securities, and put the money which he proposes to set free by another Bill into the old investments. That juggling with figures may be done. </para>

                        <para>- The position is perfectly clear. There are certain investments in which the money from the Australian Notes Trust Fund Account is at present invested. They are falling due ; and the money could- be re-invested in exactly the same way. Instead of doing that, the Treasurer proposes to set the money free and invest it in these particular Commonwealth securities. There is nothing to prevent him from doing so; but what is to become of the old investment? It simply means that the money which is to be set free later on is to be invested, perhaps, in the old way, and that the other money is to be used for the loan fund of the Commonwealth. What I wish to point out is that at this moment the money is not in the Australian Trust Fund Account, but is invested otherwise. </para>

                        <para>- No. All that I am endeavouring to show is that the money might be indefinitely invested without Commonwealth securities. Although the Government may say that they use a specific sum for this investment, nevertheless it does not follow that it is that particular sum which they use, if there is another &#163;2,000,000 which is re-invested in the old investment. </para>

                    <para>.- I heartily congratulate the Prime Minister upon the proposals which he has submitted to the Committee. They commend themselves to me, especially those relating to the sinking fund. On previous occasions I have protested against the spending of any money on the Federal Capital site. To my mind, it is an absolute waste, and the sooner we sit on any proposal of that nature the better it will be for Australia, I think. The proposal of the Prime Minister to acquire all the freeholds in the Federal Capital site is one which must commend itself to every member of the Labour party, if not to every member on the other side. We are in entire accord with a sentiment of that nature. The principles which we have been evolving for years are being brought into effect. At the same time, I am opposed to the spending of any money at all on the Federal Capital site, and, with the object of &#34;testing the opinion of the Committee, I propose to submit an amendment. I am not opposed to the acquiring of these freeholds, but I want to get an assurance from the Prime Minister that if the amendment be carried it will be regarded as an instruction to the Government to spend no more money on the Federal Capital site until a direct vote of this Parliament is again taken.

                        <para>- In certain circumstances I shall lend my aid to any scheme which will lead to the best development of the Federal Territory. I am glad that a sum of  &#163;600,000  is to be expended upon* the purchase of private property, with a view to nationalizing it, and turning it to the best use for the purpose of the Commonwealth. I am pleased to know that the members on the Opposition benches this morning have come to that view; but I- would prefer to see it spent on a more suitable site, with good land. I have very much pleasure in seconding the amendment. I hope that even at this the eleventh hour honorable members will come to the rescue of the honorable member for Herbert, and relieve the Commonwealth of a&#60; burdensome expenditure. </para>

                    <para>.- The advance towards Socialism and Nationalism, in this Parliament has been rapid in the extreme. We are confronted this morning with &#34;a big nationalization proposal. There is no denying the fact that if the land be purchased by the Commonwealth it will be worked by the Government under socialistic conditions. The amendment is in strict agreement with a motion which I have on the notice-paper, and if carried,, would do practically all I wish to accomplish. Therefore I am bound to give it my support. The Bill is evidence that Ministers are returning to sane views regarding: developmental works. But the establishment of the Federal Capital is neither &#38;- developmental nor a necessary work. I do not believe that the majority of the people of New South Wales desire it. </para>

In my judgment, the expenditure of large sums on the Federal Capital is almost sinful, &#34;and should&#34; be resisted by those having the welfare o&#163; Australia at heart. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was very pleased to hear from the Prime Minister that all the privately-owned land within the Federal Capital Territory is to be resumed by the Commonwealth, because ever since the Seat of Government Act was passed the owners of it have been considerably annoyed and inconvenienced, through; not being able to dispose of their properties because purchasers will not buy on account: of the indefiniteness of the position. Only recently a deputation waited on the Minister of Home Affairs in regard to the subject, and I am glad that finality is about to be reached. The charge that the members of the Opposition are becoming Socialists and advocates of land nationalization is ridiculous. We favour the resumption of the privately-owned land in the Federal Capital area because that is the only satisfactory course to be taken. The Prime Minister inadvertently misstated the position in saying that the alternatives are to leave the privately-owned land in the possession of its present holders, allowing them to obtain the increment which will accrue from the improvements effected by public works within the Territory, and to resume their properties and let the Commonwealth have the advantage of this increment. May I remind him that section 6 of&#39; the Seat of Government Act of 1908 says that the amount of compensation to be paid by the Commonwealth for any land to be acquired within the Territory shall not exceed the value of the land on the 8th October, 1908, and in other respects the provisions of the Lands Act Acquisition Act are to apply. </para>

                        <para>- I think correctly. When I was contesting the Werriwa seat, the honorable member who now represents the division, made a point of the declaration that I was in favour of public borrowing, and he was not, and that whereas the policy of the Liberal party was a borrowing policy, that of the Labour party was a non-borrowing policy. I am aware that the Labour party is free to. borrow on conditions, but if those conditions were strictly observed, its borrowing would be impossible. According to its platform, money is to be borrowed only for the redemption of loans and the construction of public works which will pay from the commencement, and contribute1 per cent, to a sinking fund. The railways represent the greater part of the expenditure of the States on public works, but not one of them, and no railway built by the Commonwealth, will pay interest from the commencement, let alone a contribution of 1 per cent. to a sinking fund. I am delighted that the members of the Labour party now feel constrained to do what the Liberal party would have done. When a Government, or a financial institution, or a private individual has credit, it is foolishness not to borrow when good investments offer. It is the purposes that justify borrowing. </para>

                    <para>.- There is a great deal in what the honorable member for North Sydney has said. Individually, we object to borrowing entirely. That has been my position for the last twenty-one years. The borrowing plank of our platform, however, pledges us merely to the &#34; restriction of public borrowing.&#34; I shall always protest against borrowing by this Government or any other, though, if there be a logical reason for such a course, it is that money may be expended in nationalizing our Territory. Of the sum to be borrowed, &#163;1,000,000 is to pay part of the cost of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and &#163;640,000 is for the site and erection of the Commonwealth offices in London. </para>

                        <para>- I was going on to show that a single experiment in economics had shown that there is no need whatever to borrow money for revenue producing public works. This experiment, and the natural law underlying it, is occupying the attention of economists throughout the world, and it is one that, in my opinion, could be tried with success in a community like that of Australia. There is now, practically speaking, only one bank note in place of the forty-two notes of the various banks previously in circulation. We shall, I hope, soon be rid of the present composite note, and have simply one Commonwealth note throughout Australia. Such a note could not be interfered with in any way- </para>

                        <para>- In the past, most Australian loans have been raised in London, though some have been floated in the local market. The returns show that in fifty years the State of Victoria has borrowed  , ?50,000,000,  and though some  ?48,000,000  has been paid in interest the debt remains. If the suggestion I am about to make had been carried out, secured State Railway Notes to that amount could have been raised, and, by earmarking a sum equal to  3?  per cent. per annum for twenty-eight years, the principal would be repaid at the end of that period, and the whole obligation wiped out. Honorable members may have heard of the mode adopted by the Guernsey people for raising funds to provide a new market, and of how in this connexion Daniel De Lisle Brock, the Governor of the island, proved himself to be one of the great statesmen of the world. For many centuries the markets in St. Peter&#39;s, Guernsey, were held in the high street, and much inconvenience was felt in consequence of the confined situation. It was difficult to borrow in London, and the Governor, having ascertained that brickmakers, bricklayers, carpenters, and so forth were available, suggested that the work should be undertaken without any outside help. It was public land, and the means adopted was to issue  ?5,000  worth of what was called &#34; Market House scrip,&#34;  or  legal tender notes founded on the credit of the island. In the case of Australia a similar undertaking would be guaranteed by the credit of the Commonwealth. After the market was. built, the rents received every month reduced the total of the scrip, and in less than ten years all the scrip had been paid back into the Treasury and cancelled. Referring to this experiment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John.N.</inline> Day, in the <inline font-style="italic">Star,</inline> California, thus, writes - </para>

                    <para>If Daniel de Lisle Brock had been President of the United States at the time the Pacific Railway was built and Congress composed of men holding the same ideas and principles which the legislature of Guernsey carried to so practical a result, he would have sent a message to Congress recommending the building of a transcontinental railroad, and the issue of railroad legal tender notes of credit. It would have been shown that the necessary material in some form was already in the United States, and only required labour to set it in motion. The notes of credit would then have been issued, and the road built. The notes of credit being, in the meantime, used as a legal tender and accepted by theState in payment of freights, fares, and other dues, the transcontinental railway would long before this have become a source of revenue to the people. <inline font-style="italic">This flan is the most perfect system of money yet known.</inline> It can neither contract nor expand.

But the debt has not shrunk, and the creditor sells the farms to repay a loan representing only half the value of the farm at the time of the loan.

                <para>It is estimated, according to a careful writer, the  Hon.  Henry Winn, that the fall of prices since 1873 has given the creditor classes of the world, at the expense of the debtors, an unearned increment of 3,000,000,000 dollars per annum, equal in eight years to the whole assessed valuation of the United States by the last census, and aggregating, in the quarter of a century covered by the estimate, a sum exceeding the full value of all the property in the country; and this vast value has been paid by debtors, in addition to the principal and interest they originally agreed to pay. </para>
                <para class="block">If Victoria, in the building of railways, had followed the Guernsey example, she would not have owed a single penny to-day. The Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway may not pay in its early days, but will ultimately do so, when population and settlement have increased. Would it not be better, instead of the plan now proposed, to issue notes or scrip in the way I have already described? What could be a greater guarantee than the land granted on either side of the line, together with the permanent works, rolling-stock, and so forth, all backed by the credit of the Commonwealth. What a day it would be when the profits enabled some of the scrip to be cancelled, even if it were only to the extent of &#163;500. Transcontinental railways would increase tenfold, and Australia would be banded together north, south, east, and west, merely at the expense of printing and publishing the notes. No doubt such a plan would hit the money-lenders of the world very hard, but it would be well for Australia if we were out of their hands altogether. I believe that the example of the Governor of Guernsey will be largely followed in the not far distant future, because the concentration of the money power into the hands of the few is becoming the curse and the bane of all countries.

                        <para>- Yes. The Bill providing for the creation of Commonwealth inscribed stock, although a purely machinery measure, and wholly non-contentious, is certainly far-reaching. It will not only lay down principles regarding the raising of money by means of the Commonwealth inscribed stock, but will provide ample machinery for the conversion of the State debts. It will require that, in addition to the payment of the rate of interest at which a loan is negotiated, not less than&#189; per cent. shall be paid into a sinking fund. I do not know that I need go into the details of the schedule to the Bill now before the House. As some criticism may be directed, however, to the provision of only &#163;1,000,000 for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, I ought, perhaps, to point out that, while that sum will not provide for the construction of the whole line, it would be wrong to lead the public to believe that the Commonwealth will find it necessary to provide by loan for the remaining expenditure. I should like honorable members to recollect that, at present, the Consolidated Revenue is being taxed to an unprecedented extent every year by the demands made upon it in respect of the construction of the Naval Unit. In all likelihood, however, in succeeding years, after the construction of the Fleet Unit has thus been paid for, there will be available out of the Consolidated Revenue a sum for other purposes. I make this statement in order that there may be no fear that we shall have to go outside the Commonwealth for further money. I have no apprehensions in that regard, but, even if we had to do so, the proposition would not be a staggering one. Provision is also made in the schedule for the purchase of land in :the Federal Capital Territory, with the fee-simple of which the State has parted, and which, it is desired, should become Commonwealth property. The acquisition of London offices for the Commonwealth is a justifiable financial proposition in every sense, and twenty or forty years hence, no doubt, they will be worth far more than they were when erected. The Northern Territory bills which are falling due are, fortunately, being provided for by the Commonwealth out of the money available in the Trust Fund, instead of our having to go outside to redeem them. </para>

Honorable members should not forget that, having regard to the cost of the transferred properties and other liabilities, the Commonwealth has an indebtedness of from  &#163;13,000,000  to  &#163;14,000,000.  The policy of the Government is to regard the whole of the transferred properties as representing a debt. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth is t saddled with the responsibility of redeeming the capital charge against the transferred properties, whether we meet it by way of interest and sinking fund, or take over the debts and deal with it in another way. The same remark will apply to the Northern Territory debt, which has been taken over from South Australia. The indebtedness of  &#163;226,000,  which is set out in the schedule, will be redeemed and transferred into Commonwealth stock. In order to avoid confusion, we have placed in a separate item an amount of  &#163;34,476,  which was expended by the South Australian Government, out of revenue, in the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. A claim has been made for it, and our law officers advise that it is a legal claim which must be paid as portion of the Commonwealth indebtedness to the State. I do not know that there are any other points to which I need refer, save that made by the honorable member for Richmond in regard to my statement that there are ample funds available and in sight, in connexion with the Australian Notes Fund, to provide for these matters, without any alteration of the Bank Notes Act. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not intend to convey the impression that it is not proposed to amend that Act, in so far as its provisions as to the proportion of gold reserve to be held are concerned. This proposition, however, does not depend upon any alteration of that Act; and when we are called upon to deal with the amending Bill, in regard to the Australian Notes Reserve Fund, I shall be able to give a further assurance, which should remove any doubt in the public mind as to the policy that is to be pursued. I think it is wise to inaugurate a Commonwealth inscribed stock, because,  sooner or later, we shall have to enter upon large commercial transactions, without, perhaps, increasing the indebtedness of the Commonwealth in any way. I ask honorable members to agree to the passing of this measure. </para>

                    <para>.- One must regret that the introduction of  a  notable measure of this kind has been reserved for so late a period in the session. There is no reason for alarm or apprehension ; but one could have wished that it had been introduced at a time when public opinion was less divided between the multitude of proposals now before this and our State Parliaments. The people then might have obtained a clearer insight into the financial situation which they affect. As the Prime Minister has said, it is very desirable that misapprehensions should be removed wherever they are without foundation; and in most matters connected with these propositions I can see no reason for alarm. Not a lengthy discussion, but an explicit setting forth of the present financial position of the Commonwealth in relation to these great enterprises would have had a steadying effect upon public opinion, would have avoided unnecessary alarm, and have enabled the jury of our fellow countrymen to look with a calm eye upon the forward movement represented by the propositions submitted. That is the chief reason why I regret that these proposals should have been submitted at a time when numerous interests are conflicting in our public records for a share of public attention. </para>

                <para>There is little to comment upon in detail in these proposals. Some question may be raised as to the order in which these measures are introduced. The more familiar mode, both in the Commonwealth and the States, has been to introduce first what the Prime Minister calls the financial machinery Bill, in order that it may be discussed quite independently of any particular set of propositions. That was the course followed from the outset of the Commonwealth by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. </para>

                <para>The schedule touches upon five of the greatest projects with which we are a.t present associated. These are the construction of the Western Australian railway, the establishment of the Federal Capital, the provision of an Australian centre in the heart of London, the commencement of the assumption of responsibility for the Northern Territory, and payments to the South Australian Government towards the railway which is to be taken over from that State. The last-named question brings us, although not perhaps directly, into touch with our greatest financial proposition, that of the transfer of the State debts. The Treasurer had no other choice than to include all these projects in this measure. Not one of them could have been omitted. I trust that their full significance will be felt throughout the Commonwealth by those who realize that in each instance this is only the first step. Not one of these propositions closes any chapter of financial responsibility. On the contrary, each and all of them open financial m chapters, and a large outlook towards the future. In them we find five keys to the Australian Treasury - five keys to our Australian future. If time permitted it would be no unfruitful task to take into account all they will imply in the course of growth, and in financial calls upon the Federal Government. At this period of the session, however, it would be unfortunate if time were occupied even upon matters of such special moment, when the bulk of us are already thoroughly jaded by an endeavour in unduly prolonged sittings to cope with many pressing questions. These have indeed absorbed all our time and energy, and also most of the attention which we are likely to receive from the public. </para>
                <para>The schedule being approved, the next question is the machinery Bill which will follow. Personally, I have no doubt that will be approved, because it is practically a duplicate of the first measure of the kind ever submitted to this Parliament by our first Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. A certain method is common to all Inscribed Stock Bills in all countries, but this Bill receives an added recommendation from the fact that such an extremely cautious Treasurer long since set the seal of his approvaL upon its form. </para>
                <para>Whatever criticism we may offer on minor outcomes of these proposals, in their essential particulars and broad outline they are sound and essential. They premise a period of Commonwealth development in which financial considerations will require to be much more often before us, and for much longer periods, than heretofore. There is no antagonism to either of these measures, unless it be in details; and, as the Prime Minister has said, we are not called to debate at unnecessary length even a few of the almost innumerable issues raised by them. My own remarks are directed more as a reminder to the House that, although we may pass- a Bill of this kind with rapidity, and, owing to the haste, may overlook some considerations both pertinent and pressing, our handling of it in this way is due entirely to the period of the session, the exhausted, condition of the House, and the necessity of putting this legislation upon the statute-book before we rise. </para>

                    LYNE (Hume)  &#91;2.52J.  - The Government has introduced in this case a necessary and important Bill - one of the most important that has been before this Chamber at any time, because it establishes a loan policy. From this I do not differ, but I hope the Treasurer will&#39; be extremely cautious- as he is a canny Scotsman, I believe he will be - in the powers which he takes to obtain and spend the money. I hope he will not fall into the error of which, the States have been guilty for a great many years. I understood him to say that the Bill will absorb most of the Trust Fund.

                    <para>- I should not care if it absorbed the whole of it, because it is wise for the Government to invest Trust Funds in good securities. Of course, I do not mean that the Trust Funds which the States have borrowed should be taken away from them again. When I referred to the error committed by the States, I meant that, it would be unwise for the Commonwealth to go in a haphazard way to the London money market. I think I was the first Treasurer in New South Wales to borrow money locally for Government purposes. At that time there was a difficulty in getting money abroad, owing to the South African war, and I think we obtained in Australia two-thirds of all we then raised. I do not object to borrowing money, and scarcely care how much it is, within reason&#39;, so long as we borrow it from ourselves. If we borrow it from abroad, we have to bleed Australia for all time to pay for the interest. If we borrow it from ourselves, it is like transferring the money from one hand to another, and we give the interest to our own people. There is the difficulty, however, that if you borrow in Australia a certain amount of money is sometimes sent first from England, America, or elsewhere, to the credit of the financial companies and the banks, and that is not Australian money. I admit that we cannot stop this, but it is a secondhand way of borrowing the money from outside. That has happened to my knowledge in some cases, and the interest filtered through the banks. That is not a good position to be in, but I do not see how the Federal Treasurer can prevent it. In this particular case, has the Treasurer considered how much he is going to receive under the new provision which has been made for a Commonwealth Savings Bank? </para>

State security. I think it is quite legitimate for the Federal Treasurer to borrow that money from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to invest in these or other securities of the kind.

All I asked the Prime Minister was that the States should be allowed to use the post-offices for Savings Bank purposes until they no longer required them. No doubt they will be required by the States for two or three years, but the upshot will be that the people will place their money in the Commonwealth Savings Bank in preference to those of the States. Thus I believe nearly the whole of the money invested in this way by the people will automatically pass into the Commonwealth Savings Bank, and then the post-offices will be very little required by the States to receive deposits. </para>

                    LYNE.If the Savings Banks of the States are wiped out it will be by the transference of their accounts by the depositors themselves. Any one possessing commercial sense would say that the security of Australia as a whole is better than that of any part of it, and the depositors will go where they will get the better security, and thus gradually transfer their accounts to the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The Treasurer will then have a very large sum of money at his command. The control of the money of the Savings Banks is not to be regarded as the right of the State Governments. This money will enable the Treasurer to do his financing without going beyond Australia to borrow.

                        <para>- I hope that the Treasurer will be firm in regard to the State debts. To my mind, the State debts question and the payment for transferred properties should be dealt with together, as they hang one upon the other. I approve of the proposal to establish an Inscribed Stock, because by-and-by the machinery thus created will have to be largely used. The Treasurer must be careful not to make the financial and general public of Australia think that there is going to be a seventh borrower, which will raise money in a wholesale fashion. </para>

                        <para>- The information given to me was that the freehold could not be sold until fifty-nine years had elapsed. I hoped that the Commonwealth would then acquire it, or make arrangements with the London County Council for its acquisition at that date at a price to be agreed upon. I could not conclude a bargain because I was restricted to 14s. a foot, and did not employ the architect whom the Government is now employing. I was told in London that I could not purchase the site unless I employed the man who is architect for the London County Council. The Senate was very strongly against employing any particular architect at his own instance, and wanted an Australian architect. I was restricted to 14s. a foot, and the price jumped up at once to 16s. at the instance of this man. That precluded me from purchasing at the time. I do not say that he is not a good architect. Very likely he is, but I was desirous of employing an Australian architect should his design be as good as any other.  1  was absolutely against being dictated to by any London architect as to whom I should employ. I was acting with the then Prime Minister, who left me to make what arrangements I could. If possible the proposed premises should be erected out of revenue. While land is a good security, a building is not the best. </para>

                        <para>- If \ per cent, will pay off the principal in sixty-six years, the arrangement is a very good one. The erection of this building will do more to bring Australia before the public .of the United Kingdom and Europe than anything that has yet been done. It will face the Strand, and will lead to Australia being very much more widely known than she now is. With the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who thought that the Commonwealth should acquire a site in the city near where the South Australian office is, all the members who saw this site formed the same opinion in regard to it as I had. Four years ago Australia was very little known. Since then she has become better known, but is not yet known as we wish her to be. I am sorry that the Government has determined to spend large sums of money on the Yass-Canberra site, which 1 regard as an absolute abortion - a site that will never give satisfaction to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and besides there are better sites close to Yass-Canberra. The Federal Capital city should, above all things, be on a fine river, not on a muddy stream. It would not have mattered had the choosing of the site been delayed for a much longer time, so long as we got the best in the end. Remember that the capital will be the home of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I do not object to the Government borrowing money in the way proposed for the purchase of land, but I do object to the selection of this most unsatisfactory site. When the jealousies of two or three of the States have died away, I venture to think a change will be made, even if a few millions have in the meantime been spent. What are a few millions of money to Australia? A fleabite ! I am sorry to observe that the Sydney press and a few people in that city are assisting in the perpetration of this great blunder. In the land purchased we shall, of course, have a good asset, so long as too much is not paid ; and if ever we desire to re-sell, in order to change the Federal Capital site, we shall get our money back again. Am I to understand that the Commonwealth is taking over the whole of the responsibility for the Oodnadatta railway? </para>

                        <para>- I have not much, to say against the Oodnadatta line,, but my impression is that a better route to Port Darwin could &#39; be obtained from* Hergott Springs, to the east of the lakes instead of to the west, and touching the border of Queensland. I am prepared to abide by the reports of expert surveyors, but, at the same time, we ought to take care to select a route through country which is suitable for settlement; and there never can be much population along the Oodnadatta route. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear that, because it would be folly to adopt the Oodnadatta route without further investigation, followed by expert reports. I was informed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> that the route I have suggested is liable to floods, and that, of course, may, be true ; but, at the same time, I personally know that the land where the line would touch the Queensland border is remarkably good. All I desire to have now is an assurance that, before any money is spent, there will be a thorough investigation. In my opinion it will not be long before it will be found necessary to build a line to Port Darwin. </para>

                        <para>- We have entered on the Northern Territory, and we cannot allow it to remain dormant, but must adopt some means by which it can be settled and vitalized. If the reports I have seen may be relied on, this is a great and wonderful country, although at present undeveloped, and comparatively unknown. I am inclined to think that the Northern Territory will shortly be tapped by railways from Queensland, as well as from South Australia. The Queensland line is how very close to the border at Cloncurry, and there has been a survey made to Camooweal. Some arrangement might, perhaps, be made between the Commonwealth and the States to have a line constructed to connect with the Pine Creek country. Altogether the project of the development of the Northern Territory is a gigantic one. The debate to-day has not shown that any great objection exists to the Government entering on the work of constructing such railways, but has rather been directed! to belittling the Treasurer in the light of some previous utterances which are construed into meaning that he would never consent to borrowing on the part of the Commonwealth. But if the public thought that the Treasurer, in controlling and developing a country like Australia, would mot have to borrow, they must have regarded him as a Heaven-born Treasurer, able to get money by some means quite unknown to ordinary mortals. </para>

                        <para>- This railway will develop an area . of country which is very much better than is at present imagined, though I was aware of the fact many years ago. I have had two conversations with the Engineer-in-Chief ; and, though I gather that the country is dry, a great deal may be done with artesian water land, as part of this is. For 400 miles without a break there is limestone country, and we know that such country is always good for stock, at any rate. At present the country is undeveloped and producing no revenue ; but in addition to ordinary settlement, there is a chance of the discovery of one or two Kalgoorlies because it is all mineral country on one side or other of the proposed line. Has any arrangement been attempted or made in regard to a grant by the States of land along the route? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In time to come, I think that the line will have a very considerable passenger traffic. People going to Western Australia, and to many places beyond, will prefer to go overland to Fremantle rather than &#34;suffer the inconvenience of a rough trip across the Bight, where, in nine cases out of ten, bad weather is experienced. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Those who are bad sailors, and especially ladies, will avail themselves of the overland trip rather than go round by sea to Western Australia. Complaint was made earlier in the debate that this and other kindred measures had been introduced rather late in the session. I appeal to any honorable member who has held office as Prime Minister or Treasurer to say whether it is not almost impossible to avoid introducing such measures somewhat late in the session. Such a thing is hardly to be avoided, and measures of this kind have almost always to be rushed through. </para>

                        <para>- There are a good many ways of doing business, and I sometimes think that our business would be more satisfactory without the debates that occasionally take place in this House. If our measures are well framed, I do not think that debates in this House tend much to improve them. Some discussions are very long and tiresome, and sometimes they are not very illuminating. I believe that this Bill will do just as much good as it would have done had it been introduced earlier in the year, and discussed at great length. I wish to compliment the Government on the work they have done, particularly during the latter part of the session. Excellent work was done by the passing of the Bill that recently engaged our attention during a remarkably long sitting. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that honorable members will not forget the words used by the honorable member for Hume with regard to the construction of a line through the Northern Territory. If we do now assume that, within a reasonable time, at all events, that will be one of our responsibilities, I think we should regulate all our responsibilities with a view to the building of that great railway. I regret that we have been forced to pass a Loan Bill, since the principle of non-borrowing was clearly laid down in 1903 by the rejection of the first Loan Bill, which was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. Incidental to that measure, a Stock Bill was introduced, which, I believe, is the basis of the measure now before the House. </para>

                        <para>- I rose chiefly to ask the Treasurer to examine the Government Stock and Sinking Fund Act of South Australia, which was passed in 1896, and which contains many provisions that ought to have been included in the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Bill. Under the Commonwealth measure there is no power to issue inscribed stock in redemption of other securities. Such a provision ought to be embodied in it. Then, again, there is no power to issue Treasury-bills instead of inscribed stock. There are many other omissions in the same direction. I drafted the South Australian measure myself, under instructions from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, and know that it contains many provisions which it would be very useful to have in any legislation we may pass enabling us to issue securities to give effect to such a loan Bill as this. I point out to the Treasurer that very often short-dated loans are justifiable. For instance, in respect of a work that will have a life of about ten years. there is no reason why interminable securities should be issued. We have power under the South Australian Act to issue- short-dated securities, and we meet small obligations by the sale of those securities, which are redeemable in, perhaps, eight or ten years. For the larger works of a more permanent character inscribed stock, or bonds, are issued. I wish to assure the Treasurer that there are in his proposals many oversights as to the purposes for which stock should be issued, and one to which I wish particularly to refer relates to the redemption of the public debt. There is no provision for the automatic issue of any stock to pay for the transferred properties. It is certainly a mistake to omit one-third of the necessary provisions in this regard. Then, again, the principle of issuing interminable securities is bad. In South Australia, in  1889,  we adopted the very same class of stock, but found that there was a difference of between  1  and  2  per cent. in the actual values. </para>

                        <para>- That may or may not be the reason; but I have heard others given. We had fixed terms of ten and twenty years; but people did not want to be at the mercy of the Treasury as to when they should be paid. All these redemption funds attaching to particular loan funds are bad. The proper system of redemption is to have a fixed proportion of your total indebtedness found every year out of revenue, and with those funds you would be able to redeem any security falling due in that year. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking of the prices of the securities in the market, and those to which I have referred were affected by the fact that the loans were not redeemable. Latterly, however, they have recovered a good deal. I could not, without really trespassing upon a Bill that is not at present before us, indicate what I consider to be omissions from the Inscribed Stock Bill, and I rose only to call the attention of the Treasurer to the existence of later precedents than that upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner founded his draft Bill in  1903.  I have also to express regret that we are adopting the pernicious system of borrowing to meet small obligations. Surely we should be able to provide out of our ordinary funds for the amounts of  &#163;226,000  and  . &#163;34,476,  appearing in this schedule in respect of the Northern Territory. </para>

                    <para>.- Under this clause the Treasurer is empowered to borrow money, but no terms or conditions are set out. I know that the answer to my argument is that they will be set out in another measure - the Inscribed Stock Bill - but that Bill has not yet been passed, and it is not incorporated with this one. We had a somewhat similar position in connexion with the land tax. A Land Tax Assessment Act, providing the necessary machinery, was passed, and a Land Tax Act was also passed, but the latter especially incorporated the machinery measure with it. We ought also to incorporate the Commonwealth Inscribed. Stock Act with this Bill, and I. therefore move - </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the Treasurer cannot agree with the amendment. Within the last month, there was decided in South Australia a case in which the bank sought to get out of an obligation under circumstances in which this clause would give the Commonwealth an immunity. A person whose pass-book was taken out of his possession through no fault of his own might find himself minus his money, and have no redress. The Commonwealth Bank has full power to provide efficient checks, because the clause says, &#34; subject to the rules of the bank.&#34; The person presenting the pass-book may have forged the owner&#39;s signature, and in that case the bank should take the risk, because it can prescribe whatever checks it likes against forgery. It seems to be going to great lengths to say that the average depositor, who will be a comparatively small man, must lose money drawn from his account by fraud to which he is not a party. This provision seems to appear in only one State Act. I am certain it is not in the South Australian Act. </para>

                    <para>- As this is a public bank, instituted under the law of the Commonwealth, it ought to have the same responsibilities and liabilities as other banks. The Government, in accepting deposits from the public, assume the position of a trustee, and take the sole responsibility for the safe custody of the money. No bank in the world has ever been allowed to escape liability for unlawfully parting with its customers&#39; property. If private banks part unjustifiably or improperly with their customers&#39; money, they do so at their own risk. Unless we make the Government officials in this bank liable, they will protect themselves by the statutory immunity given by clause 48. They will not be under the same compulsory obligations to keep the money safely as they would otherwise be. </para>

                    <para>.- Parliament has insisted on private banking institutions being responsible for wrongfully paying out their clients&#39; money. That was done by Parliament refusing to relieve them from the result of the decision in Marshall&#39;s case, when the Bills of Exchange Act was being passed. The banks are liable for paying forged cheques. The Savings Bank is intended for the savings of small depositors who can ill afford to lose their money. It is nonsense to say that if a man loses his pass-book it is always, the result of his own carelessness. The bank that makes a profit out of getting the use of people&#39;s money ought to be responsible for looking after it. </para>

                    <para>- - I am glad the Senate has taken a sensible and businesslike view of this matter. The liability should attach to the Commonwealth just as it attaches to private banking institutions. I would remind the honorable member for Brisbane that a big depositor has as much right to be considered as has a small one. The Savings Banks are established for the convenience of small depositors, and to encourage them to be thrifty. The fact that the Commonwealth is taking over the Savings Bank business is supposed to instil into people&#39;s minds the idea that1 they will be taking absolutely no risks, and obtaining the best possible security for their money if they leave it in the custody of the Commonwealth. The, fact that some one steals a man&#39;s bank book, forges his signature, and draws out his money through no fault of his own, should not entail the loss upon him without hope of redress. The question is : Who is best able to afford the loss, apart from who is really morally responsible for it? It is the concentrated quintessence of meanness for a Commonwealth institution, with its millions behind it and the credit of the country to back it up, to throw on the small depositors, who can put by only a few shillings week by week, the responsibility for loss, should their money be fraudulently withdrawn. </para>

My desire is to see established a National Savings Bank, which can be used by a depositor in Melbourne, in Croajingalong, or in Queensland. The Commonwealth could&#39; easily be robbed of many thousands of pounds if proper means were not taken to prevent it. The insertion of the clause will not mean that the Commonwealth will! not accept any responsibility.

Undoubtedly the bank authorities will take all steps to prevent the depositors from being injured by fraud. When money is fraudulently withdrawn, it is generally the fault of the- depositor. Years ago I knew of &#163;73 being stolen through the carelessness of the depositor, who allowed himself to get into bad hands. I hope that the Government will insist on the clause. </para>

The proposal of the Government is infamous, ::.id if it were made in regard to private banks, it would be like laying the axe to the root of the tree.

                        <para>. - A  practice has arisen amongst several honorable members on this side of casting reflections calculated to injure me simply because they disagree with something  I  may say or do; and this has placed me in a false position before my electors. During the all-night sitting I felt it my &#39;duty to deal with some of the items under discussion ; and in no case did I attempt  a  long speech or do anything calculated to block business. Nevertheless, the honorable member for Hunter, in an interjection, asserted that I was taking up time, and that, probably, I would be absent all the next week. The insinuation was that  I  have been extremely lax in my attendance in Parliament, and that when  I  do attend I occupy unduly the time of the House. I was extremely annoyed at this, method of trying to silence me in the debate, and used words in reply which I should not have used under less provocative circumstances. The same suggestion has been made on two or three other occasions, once by the Government Whip. Some of the Government supporters seem to think that  I  ought to sit here absolutely dumb, and simply vote with the Government without any regard to my constituents. I am not responsible for the wearying sittings we have had of late, and cannot on that account keep quiet when the interests of my constituency require that I should speak. These statements and insinuations made have found their way into the Sydney press, and my attendance has been compared with that of another honorable member. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I find, however, on consulting the records, that the number of my attendances is considerably greater than that of the honorable member referred to ; moreover, a number of honorable members on this side have been absent on many more occasions than myself. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately, during the present session, I have suffered from severe domestic affliction, and this has kept me away for a few days. Further, I have been trying to carry the burden of a large industrial organization of over11,000members in New South Wales., with the result that some time ago my health broke down, and I was obliged to go under medical treatment. </para>
                    <para>It is most unfair for honorable members, in a temporary spirit of spite or pique, to make insinuations which are carried by a hostile press to my constituents and absolutely misrepresent my position. </para>

                            <para>- We ought not to suffer at the hands of our own party, whatever we may have to endure from our opponents. Even the Minister of External Affairs a few days ago, in the course of a discussion, adopted the same tactics towards me. When the Public Service Arbitration Bill was before us, and I was asking for some information the Minister used words to the effect that my attendances were irregular. The honorable members I have named have no real grievance against me, but, at the same time, they are putting me in an entirely false position. I can only say that, if I am to be thus treated by my own party, I am prepared to retaliate; and I can make things unpleasant for some of those who are placing me in a false position. </para>

                        <para>.- I have heard only a portion of the statement made by the honorable member for Cook. Had that honorable member been free from the spirit of which he complains in others, he certainly would have acquainted me with his intention to mention this matter to-day. Honorable members will, I think, give me credit for always trying to do the fair thing by my fellow-members ; and, in any case, I am not given to interjection, unless it be particularly relevant to the matter before us. On the occasion referred to by the honorable member for Cook, we had been sitting-all night, and it was well understood that the Tariff had to pass. The honorable member occupied considerable time; and to this I do not take exception, because he has to consider the interests of his constituents. But the honorable member went on to ask for an adjournment, which meant, practically, holding up the business. At that time,I was quite under the impression that the session would end to-day, and I interjected, perhaps with some little warmth, that the honorable member would not be here the following week. Of that remark, the honorable member has been complaining ever since; and even this morning, earlier on, he rose simply because I had been addressing the House. The honorable member has never asked me for an explanation. I have no wish to injure him; indeed, I do not remember to have mentioned him before. He ought to remember that his fellows have feelings the same as himself. He has said something about not retaliating ; but on the occasion referred to, he called me some sort of a benighted fool, and had to be called upon by the  Chairman  to withdraw the expression. I have no desire to injure the honorable member; and if at any time I can do anything to assist him, I shall be only too glad to do so: </para>
