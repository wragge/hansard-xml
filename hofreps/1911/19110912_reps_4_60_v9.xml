                        <para>The final paragraph of section 127 of the Act, and Universal Training Regulation 26, authorize the BrigadeMajor to vary the duration of Senior Cadet parades, if considered necessary, provided that the annual total of the half-day and night parades be not less than seventy-two hours. </para>
                        <para>It is considered, however, that if the training is sufficiently varied and interspersed with periods of " standing easy," the duration of the parades prescribed by the third paragraph of section 127 of the Defence Act will not be too long in the cooler weather. </para>

                    <para>In the summer months, however, it would appear to be advisable to - take advantage of the above-mentioned clause of the Act. The greatest care should bc observed by officers and instructors in the case of any weak or delicate boys, so that no injury may be done by overexertion. Such boys should be ordered to frequently stand aside and rest. </para>
                    <para>While standing down or standing easy, advantage should be taken, by all officers and staff instructors to deliver lecturettes on patriotism and the necessity for discipline and military training, and in giving instructions in military organization and in the Universal Training Regulations, particularly those paragraphs relating to the statutory requirements of the Act. This can also be varied by means cf questions and answers, and by asking boys to detail certain portions of drill. </para>

It is not at present proposed to establish a horse station there, and there will be no objection to making the report, when received, available to members, if it be found that the giving of the information will not prejudice the Government in purchasing land. The honorable member for Laanecoorie on the same date asked for a return showing the number of officers imported into Australia, for employment in the Defence Forces for each of the three years ending 30th June last.

                    <para>. -It will be generally acknowledged, I think, that, in the comparatively short history of the Federal Parliament, honorable members have seldom or never been confronted with such a quantity of material for legitimate criticism and comment. Under ordinary circumstances, we always have the administration during the period of recess, and also the programme of the Government for the current session, as matters for criticism. But on this occasion we have something very unusual, and something much more far-reaching than either of these heads of subject-matter. Three of  His  Majesty's Ministers have been accredited by this House to proceed to the Mother Country to take part in, I suppose, one of the most important Imperial Conferences that has ever taken place; and those Ministers have expressed opinions throughout the Mother Country, both as to what is alleged to be their party's policy and as to the alleged opinions of the Australian people. I find much food for comment in both these subjects : and, in addition, since the House met we have had a "variety of excuses offered to account for the overwhelming - I might almost call it the cyclonic - defeat of the referenda submitted to the people by the Government. I intend to say something this afternoon with regard to the Conference, and the conduct and expressions of opinion by  His  Majesty's Ministers in the Conference, and also something of a critical character with regard to the speeches which have been made in the Mother Country by those same Ministers, in some cases professing to be the principles of the Labour party, and, in others, professing to be the opinions of the Australian people. </para>

                <para>The press of this country has in several cases deprecated the continuance of this debate on the ground that it is dragging its length along in a way wearisome to the public. I should like to point out, however, that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> does not follow that, because the editor of one or a number of papers has, in the quiet of his editorial parlour, settled all these matters to his own satisfaction, that we in this House are to give up our duties to our constituents with regard to criticism. One must remember that those editors have been for nine months pouring out leaders for the edification of the public at the rate of two or three a day ; and on many of these great questions, no doubt, imagine they have said the final word. But I should like to know what some Victorian newspapers would say if one of the Victorian members were to come to the House and announce that he did not intend to speak in this debate because the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> had settled the questions before us. L coming from New South </para>
                <para class="block">Wales, feel very much in the same frame of mind with regard to the criticism of the Victorian newspapers. This is essentially a Chamber for the discussion of the public affairs of Australia; and a duty devolves on every honorable member, not only to the public generally, but to his constituents, to show that he is familiar with what is being done in the country, and that he has opinions of his own on the various questions involved. I desire to say, first of all, that I do not think this House has yet sufficiently considered the question of conferences generally. It seems to me that we are gradually entering on a series of gatherings at the heart of the Empire without having laid down any sort of principle which should guide our Ministers in taking part in them. They are a new growth; there is no procedure with regard to the way in which they should be approached by Ministers from this country ; and we find already a very different course being pursued by the different Prime Ministers with regard to the subjects discussed. This, it seems to me, is a matter of the highest importance. We are practically bringing into existence a new tribunal - a new arena - for the discussion of political questions, and, although it is consultative, and although its decisions are of a tentative character, to that arena the whole world is looking for the discussion of the problems of the British Empire. If the course which has been adopted by this Government with regard to the last Conference is going to be followed, this House will, I think, sooner or later have to resolve on some new practice. There is a danger in unregulated Conferences. We all know that it is assumed, when men attend such gatherings, that they are going to discuss matters apart from party - that they are going to discuss the great problems of the Empire from a purely Empire stand-point. If that be the case, it is due to every Parliament in every Dominion - that is to say, every one of the higher Parliaments like the Federal Parliament of this country and that of Canada - that the members of those Parliaments should be made acquainted in due and sufficient time with the character of the questions to be discussed. There is a danger if something of the sort is not done. From time to time Ministers may proceed to the Mother Country with -the expressed object of discussing questions from an Empire stand-point. It is essentially an Empire gathering, and it can never be supposed that Ministers from Australia are going to the centre of the Empire merely to put before the people of the world - because that is their audience - the views of their particular party. If honorable members read the utterance of the Prime Minister of England, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> they will see what he says about members of the Conference assuming that every other member has left behind him the views of his particular party, and comes to hear the views of members from other parts of the Empire in order that some conclusion may be arrived at which will contribute towards the unity of the Empire. Honorable members may not have been supplied with a copy of the Conference proceedings, for one of which I am indebted to the courtesy of the Prime Minister ; and I should like to refer for a moment to one or two expressions of opinion on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith. His</inline> opening address was particularly short and pregnant, containing a large amount of valuable matter. He said at the outset - </para>

                    <para>There have been, in the past, Empires which (like our own) <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> widespread, populous, rich in mineral wealth, the prolific breeding ground of art, and science, and . literature. </para>
                    <para>But this Empire of ours is distinguished from them all by special and dominating characteristics. From the external point of view it is made up of countries which are not geographically conterminous, or even contiguous, which present every variety of climate, soil, people, and religion, and even in those communities which have attained to complete self-government, and which are represented in this room today, does not draw its unifying and cohesive force solely from identity of race or of language.  . . There is, as there must be among communities so differently situated and circumstanced, a vast variety of constitutional methods, and of social and political institutions and ideals. But to speak for a moment for that part of the Empire which is represented here to-day, what is it that we have in common, which amidst every diversity of external and material conditions makes us and keeps us one ? There are two things in the self-governing British Empire which are unique in the history of great political aggregations. The first is the reign of Law - wherever the King's writ runs it is the symbol and messenger, not of an arbitrary authority, but of rights shared by every citizen, and capable of being asserted and made effective by the tribunals of the land. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think that, in this country, we have conformed altogether to the ideal there laid down; but I shall leave for a later part of my address my observations on the absence in Australia of an approximation to that ideal. There is a danger about these conferences, and it is that if Ministers of the Crown from different communities or dominions proceed to this arena, which, as </para>
                <para class="block">I have indicated, is intended for the discussion of Empire questions, and give vent there to mere party opinions on the representation that they are the opinions of the people of the country from which they come, they will naturally mislead the representatives of other dominions there. It is quite possible - for I am speaking now in the abstract - that Ministers from different dominions may give to their fellow - members of the conferences an entirely wrong idea of the national stand-point of the countries from which they come. Agreements of a tentative character may be arrived at - such as the Naval Agreement, which was made at the last Conference - that may be entirely incorrect as expressive of the wishes of the people of the country from which the delegates come if they insist, from time to time, upon mere party representations. And by and by the further danger will arise, that if the Parliaments of certain dominions repudiate arrangements .tentatively arrived at in this way, the Conferences themselves will lose their reputation, and the public will give them less and less attention. The Conferences have two objects, and the first of these is to try to harmonize the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the British Empire. Our Empire is only now, by the process of these repeated Conferences, " finding itself," as Kipling says, or taking shape, as a separate and distinct political entity; and it is 1io the interests of every part of the Empire that they should not only be looked up to by the people who attend them from time to time, but should be represented to the people of the world as being true Empire Conferences, to which all eyes may be turned with confidence that the conclusions come to, whatever they may be, will be respected throughout the Empire. I intend in a moment to show that the Prime Minister and his two colleagues did not observe the first principles laid down by .the Prime Minister of England. When the honorable member for Ballarat proceeded to the Conference of  1907,  he paid this House the compliment of placing before it a category of the subjects with which he intended to deal there. It was not possible for him to put before the House a detailed statement of the way in which he was going to deal with each of those questions; but he sufficient])' indicated <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> honorable members the nature of the propositions which he was .going to advance. This House, however, was entirely iri. the dark, except, perhaps, on the Ministerial side, as to what was going to be put before the last Conference of representatives of the Mother Country and of the several Dominions. However we may differ on party questions, the time has arrived when we should recognise that the whole House should be taken into the confidence of the Ministry of the day in connexion with any future Conference, in order that we may know, generally, at least, what propositions are going to be put before it. If it is made a mere party question - if the Prime Minister in this case has merely discussed these problems in caucus, or, if you like, in a free meeting of the whole of his party, ignoring this side of the House, and not giving the Opposition a sufficient opportunity, before he starts, to offer its protests against anything that he proposes to do - then, not only this party, but the whole Parliament, isbelittled." The representation of Australia at the next Conference might be in the hands of the honorable member for Ballarat. </para>

                        <para>- I said that it " might." If it were, then I should like to know what the party on the other side of the House would say if the honorable gentleman went to England, with his Ministers, having consulted merely the members of his own party as to the propositions to be put before the Conference. I am speaking in this way. in the interests, not of any one party, but of Conferences generally of an Imperial character. I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith's</inline> statement of the fundamental purposes of these Conferences, and I do not see how any one could take exception to it. It is not a mere echoing of the party feelings and aspirations of different political bodies in different Parliaments of the Empire. The Imperial Conference is an arena in which all the delegates should meet and. as I have said, endeavour to harmonize their peoples' views on questions common to the whole Empire. With regard to the last Conference, I intend, as I have said, to show that the principles laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> were not observed. Before doing so, however, I propose to read one other passage from his address, which, I presume, not all honorable members have had' an opportunity to read for themselves.

                        <para>- Everything' 1 say to-day is from my point of view. Perhaps that will get rid of a number 'of objections. I am not speaking foi honorable members opposite, because I am not in sympathy with many of their views.' ' I contend that many of the views put before the Conference by the Prime Minister were party views, and do not represent the opinions of the people of Australia. In the first place, after the right honorable (gentleman had left Australia, the whole constitutional ground was taken from under his feet by the result of the referenda. The honorable member for Ballarat pointed out that in the last general election in the Commonwealth there was a total majority of 5,000 in one House, taking the aggregate of all the votes recorded for the Ministerial side of that House, and 9,000 of a majority, taking the aggregate of all the votes for members of the Senate throughout the Commonwealth - or a total of 14,000 votes. I do not agree entirely with his figures, foi I think the total amounted to about 40,000 ; but by the failure of the distribution of seats, on account naturally of the constantly varying numbers of some constituencies, and the stand-still character of others, those 14,000 or 40,000 votes resulted in the return of a majority of eleven members in this House, and gave a majority in the Senate altogether out of consistency with the number of votes recorded for each member. But whilst the Prime Minister was on his way to England, relying upon his majority of eleven in this House, the people of Australia had submitted to them a programme of Labour politics under which the States were to be denuded of most of their legislative power by its transference to the Commonwealth Parliament. Those referenda embodied almost the whole policy of the Labour party ; and what did the people of the Commonwealth say when they were  asked to approve of that policy, and to give the Labour party in this Parliament an opportunity of entering the States' and doing for the people by Commonwealth legislation what the States previously had the liberty to do for themselves? They rejected the proposals by  250,000  votes; and I say unhesitatingly that if the ethics of party government which existed in England years ago, and even in some of our States thirty or forty years ago, had been applied to Commonwealth politics, no Prime Minister would have suffered the indignity, but would have resigned his position at once, saying, " Let the country find other Ministers." The Labour party consists of comparatively young men, some of whom are trying to make themselves look even younger by sartorial changes, but my political experience goes back a long way. I can recall a time in  1890,  when that eminent statesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, was trying to pass a measure through the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. When he discovered something in it of which he disapproved, and sought to move the  Chairman  out of the chair in Committee in order to have an opportunity of reconsidering it, and when the Committee declined to allow the  Chairman  to go out of the chair, that statesman resigned his position next morning on this ground - " That if honorable members take the conduct of business out of my hands, they must find somebody else to manage it." And I say with stronger reason that when the present Prime Minister, or his party, found that the country had rejected their proposals by a quarter of a million votes, if they had been guided by the same political ethics they themselves would have said, " We have no longer the confidence of the people of Australia, and will resign our positions and ask them to call upon others." I can readily understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that this argument should be met with guffaws to-day, because the whole standard of political ethics has changed. It is not a question of what is honorable; it is not a question of what is dignified; it is a question of how long men can hold on like limpets to a rock and suck all the nourishment they can get out of it. I hope that honorable members will excuse me from answering their interjections, because I find that interjections which are not answered need not be reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> One hardly knows how much the Prime Minister changed his views of politics and Imperial affairs after he went to England. We know very well that if he has come back with very much modified views he is still helpless in giving voice to them, and is still entirely unable to modify his political conduct according to the change of his political opinions. I cut from one of the newspapers, while the Prime-Minister was in England, a very interesting extract in which the honorable member for Hume used certain observations ; and I have no doubt that the modification in opinions which the honorable member underwent was shared to some extent by the Prime Minister and his colleagues, especially after they had been admitted to the " inner councils " of the Imperial Government, and had been intrusted with some of the great secrets of Imperial administration. The honorable member for Hume said - </para>

                <para class="block">Whether the Prime Minister underwent changes of that sort I am unaware; but it seemed to me on reading that extract that, even if he did, he would nevertheless come back here and still have the Caucus to control him, still have the resolutions of its conferences to force him to take a certain line, however illiberal it might be, and however much in the teeth of the liberal education which he had received while in Great Britain. I want to say, in the first place, that if it was the case, as the Prime Minister of England said, that every man who entered that Conference entered it with nothing but Empire considerations and purposes, then the Prime Minister was totally unfitted by the constitution of his party to take part in it. Because, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> when the Prime Minister went to England, he went with a cut-and-dried programme from his party, and he had, willy-nilly, to put that through if he could. I shall show that the Prime Minister and his colleagues had to withdraw every one of eight proposals which were put forward by them in the Conference. They did not pass a single proposition. This fact suggests that they entered this Conference contrary to the general proposition laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> and with a view to palming off some of their party considerations upon the people of the Empire. I took from a leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> a few weeks ago a reference to the Conference, and to the position that the Prime Minister occupied in it.

                <para class="block">I shall show to the House that the right honorable gentleman and his colleagues lacked information with regard to that Conference; they lacked the broad Empire spirit, and showed little consideration in their action - if not in their words - for the wider Empire interests. I shall show, further, that in putting some of their views before the Conference as expressive of the wishes and aspirations of the people of Australia they did an injustice to the Commonwealth, and misled many of their hearers as to what the Australian people thought and think. </para>
                <para>The first question with which the Conference dealt related to the Declaration of London.

                <para class="block">The debate showed that neither the Prime Minister nor his colleagues really understood the Declaration of London ; and the proceedings at the Conference show that the Prime Minister did not understand even this simple proposition - that what the British people were approving was not a final agreement between the nations affected, but an agreement which reached to a certain point, subject to later modification. I shall show in a moment what was said by the Prime Minister of Great Britain as  President  of the Conference, and what was said by the Prime Minister of Australia. Having made a close study of the proceedings of the Conference, I am able to say that our Prime Minister's motion was a piece of arrogance on the part of a man representing 4,000,000 of people in an Empire which consists of about 65,000,000. He affirmed that it was to be regretted that the Dominions had not been consulted prior to the acceptance of the terms. </para>

                        <para>- I shall show the right honorable gentleman that  in  that attitude adopted by English Ministers  a  great injustice has been done to the  British  people, by  an  undertaking to consult the different Dominions  as  to how Great Britain should act concerning great problems as to the conduct of her wars, for which the Dominions are not going to be responsible, must be regulated. This Declaration of London is a question of war, and of the conditions of war. Yet we were presented with the extraordinary spectacle of the Prime Minister of a country which has reserved to itself the right to decline to join in a war undertaken by the British Nation - a country which does not contribute a farthing towards the maintenance of the British Navy, but merely provides  a  navy to defend its own shores - attempting to dictate to 48,000,000 of people the conditions which they should attach to compacts which they entered into with the other nations of Europe. If Australia were contributing her quota towards the maintenance of the fleet which was to engage in the war, I could understand the Prime Minister saying, " We contribute our <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> amount of the expenditure upon the war, and ought, therefore, to have a <inline font-style="italic">fro rata</inline> say in the conditions governing it." But over and over again the right honorable gentleman has said, in effect, "We look to the British Empire to defend the Empire, and we are content to provide for the defence of Australia." </para>

I should like to know how he can reconcile that statement with the attitude which the Labour party have taken up in this country. When the honorable member for Ballarat was introducing a Defence Bill to the notice of this House about four years ago, I recollect that when, he came to deal with the question of whether the Australian Navy should, in time of war, pass automatically into the hands of the Imperial . Government j whether it should come under the control and direction of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet, our present Prime Minister, who was then leader of his party, said, " Certainly it should not, without the question being first submitted to Parliament." So that to-day he is in this position : that if the Mother Country, from which the right honorable gentleman has accepted one of the greatest honours - that of a member of the Council of the Empire - were to go to war to-morrow, he might have to face a Parliament which decided to reject any proposal to join in defending it. Let me read to the House the utterance of the ablest statesmen present at the Conference outside of the representatives of Great Britain. I do so, because they entirely confirm the view which ,1 am putting to honorable members. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, in speaking upon this question at a later stage of the debate, said - </para>

                    <para>In the proposition which was moved by our colleagues from Australia, especially as commented upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> - certain principles were laid down which seem to me to be very far-reaching. If I understand him correctly the proposition he' laid down was that the Dominions should be consulted upon all treaties to be negotiated by  His  Majesty. There are two sorts of treaties between nations. First of all, there are commercial treaties, and, secondly, there are treaties of amity which are calculated to prevent causes of war or to settle afterwards the effects of war. With regard to commercial treaties,  His  Majesty's Government has already adopted the practice of never including any of the Dominions beyond the seas except with their consent. That implies consultation prior or afterwards. Liberty is left to us to be included or not included in such a treaty as that, and I think that is very satisfactory. Coming now to the other class of treaties, which I characterized as treaties of amity, H would seem to me that it would be fettering, in many instances, the Home Government, the Imperial authorities, very seriously, if any of the outside Dominions were to be consulted as to what they should do on a particular question. In many cases the nature of the treaty would be such that it would only interest one of the Dominions. If it interested them all the Imperial authorities would find themselves seriously embarrassed if they were to receive the advice of Australia in one way, the advice of New Zealand in another way, and the advice of Canada, perhaps, in a third way. Negotiations have to be carried on by certain diplomatic methods, and it is, I think, not always safe for the party negotiating to at once put all his cards on the table and let his opponent know exactly what he is after. I noticed particularly what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> a moment ago, that the British Empire is a family of nations, which is perfectly true, but it must be recognised that in that family of nations by far the greater burden has to be carried on the shoulders of the Government of the United Kingdom. The diplomatic part of the Government of the Empire has of necessity to be carried on by the Government of the United Kingdom, and that being so, I think it would be too much to say that in all circumstances the Dominions beyond the seas are to be consulted as far as the diplomatic negotiations are concerned. That is what I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> te desire. </para>

We have taken the position in Canada that we do not think we are bound to take part in every war, and that our fleet may not be called upon in all cases, and, therefore, for my part, I think it is better under such circumstances to leave the negotiations of these regulations, as to the way in which the war is to be carried on, to the chief partner of the family, the one who has to bear the burden in part on some occasions, and the whole burden, on perhaps other occasions. </para>

I do not hesitate to repeat that it was a piece of arrogance on the part of the Prime Minister of this country to profess to represent the views of the Australian people in attempting practically to reproach the Imperial Government for not having consulted Australia in a matter in which Australia has no right to be consulted. According to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, it is clear that in connexion with commercial treaties all the Dominions are consulted, but this matter dealt with a question of amity, in connexion with which  Great  Britain might become involved in relation to war. If the people of Australia were consulted, and were aware of the facts they would, in my view, sweep the honorable gentleman's opinion out of consideration. They would certainly not agree that we should send delegates to the United Kingdom to begin a Conference of this sort by deliberately reflecting upon the Imperial Government because they had not done something  which  Australia in an insular  kind  of way was represented as thinking  they  ought to  have done.

After having contended unsuccessfully that we should be consulted, our representatives absolutely refused to assent to a motion approving of a matter which Great Britain, through its Ministers, desired; which the whole of the Empire through the Dominion representatives desired, and which the Prime Minister of Australia first said he did not understand, and then said he would not approve of. </para>

Honorable members will recollect that in this House some three or four years ago the then honorable member for North Sydney, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> tabled a motion for the adoption of decimal coinage and weights. We know that it was discussed on a Thursday afternoon, when there are sometimes not more than ten or fifteen honorable members present in the chamber. Thursday afternoon is the occasion upon which fads of various kinds are brought forward, questions like the bi-metallism. single tax- </para>

                        <para>- Just so. The adoption of the decimal system of coinage and weights was brought forward on such an occasion in this House, and carried. There would be a very small attendance. We could hardly call it a House, and I doubt if there was a quorum present. A small number of members of this House approved of a motion for the adoption of the decimal method as applied to coinage and weights and measures. Will honorable members believe that the Prime Minister of this country represented to the people of the United Kingdom that this was the wish of the Australian people, and actually had the temerity to propose that the whole of the commerce and finance of the British Empire should be transposed and converted because a majority of the Federal Parliament, on a private night sitting, had approved of this fad? Do honorable members consider that a question of Empire, or that the Prime Minister was justified in raising it at a Conference which was called to discuss Empire problems ? This is the motion moved by the Minister of External Affairs - </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that a Select Committee dealt with the matter, but what the Minister of External Affairs said was that the Commonwealth Parliament had declared in favour of uniformity. What I object to is that the Prime Minister and the Minister of  External  Affairs should suggest that the whole of the Australian people believe in the proposal because of the division on that motion in this House on a Thursday afternoon, and should attempt to impose such a system upon the whole British Empire. The right honorable gentleman ought to have known enough of the calibre of the men with whom he was dealing, to understand that he might as well have tried to get them; all to go up in an aeroplane. It was a ridiculous proposal, for the mover does not seem to have had a conception of the stupendous character of the trade and commerce and finance of the Empire which he was trying to turn topsy-turvy just as the Socialists would do with society in order to satisfy a theoretical aspiration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buxton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> offered some practical objections, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward said that he approved of the proposal in spirit - which, I suppose means theoretically - and added that if it were possible to start the business of the world again, he would probably approve of it in practice. The proposal was withdrawn - that was the second withdrawal. Then  we pass on to the question of the commercial relations of British shipping. An attempt was made here to revive that old question of stopping foreign ships with coloured crews from trading in Australian waters. Honorable members are aware that the shipping laws of the United Kingdom require all such matters to be dealt with uniformly, and a Bill of that sort would not pass without being submitted to the Imperial Government for approval, because it would touch the question of British shipping in every part of the world. But our Prime Minister did not seem to understand or appreciate that fact. He moved - </para>

                <para>There is much irony in that complimentary observation -  and as far as possible to give an advantage to British shipping over foreign shipping in the Commonwealth. As far as the object is concerned, therefore, we are obliged to the Commonwealth for what they have done and what they were desiring to do. But the question had to be considered not only from the point of view of British shipping in connexion with the Commonwealth, but we had to look at it from the point of view of British shipping all the world over. . . . What we representatives of British shipping here, and representatives, I hope, of the British Dominions as well, are nervous about is the power and opportunity of retaliation against our British shipping all the world over on any of these matters. </para>
                <para>I would point out to the Conference that out of the 285,000,000 tons of British shipping all the world over, no less than 164,000,000 tons goes to foreign ports, and a comparatively small portion goes to Australian ports, and therefore for the advantage, and no doubt the considerable advantage, of the trade of the Commonwealth, we do not think that it would be worth while  to  risk the possibility of disadvantage accruing to the very enormous trade which we have with other Powers. </para>

In fact, I think there must be a misapprehension, because we have worked together at the Navigation Conference with a view to assimilating our shipping laws, and our practice in New Zealand is to send an outline to the Home authorities of any new law on the subject that we contemplate submitting to Parliament, for it is desirable, upon points upon which the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act would be in conflict with what we are doing that we should know beforehand in what direction the British authorities can assent to our legislation. I want to make it quite clear that we do not accept the kind of intimation conveyed by them as any direction to us that we should not submit legislation on any lines we think proper, but we are, all the same, very glad to know where the conflict may arise, and in what direction we may, as far as it is possible for us to do so, avoid the conflict. </para>

                <para class="block">That was a very cut-and-dried proposal ; and, so far as I can see, it would have involved the Imperial Government contributing a proportion of the expense of sending emigrants to Australia. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Burns came upon the scene, and he submitted a body of figures of the most interesting character, showing how the emigration went on from England, and stating, as honorable members will perhaps recollect reading in the press, that she could only afford to dispose annually of 300,000 of her population. Our Prime Minister incidentally claimed that Australia had not applied the education rest to any people of European descent, although he said that " for five years a thousand newspapers had vilified them." That -is not an accurate statement. Those who have taken part in Australian affairs can remember that over and over again the education test was applied to various people. Some of the cases became notorious. In others, the persons so injured had not sufficient influence to make the facts known. In several instances the education test was applied, not only to Germans and other Europeans, but even to citizens of the Empire. This motion also was withdrawn. I cannot go through the proceedings to show all that was said for and against the proposal, but the result of the discussion was that it was " resolved to continue the present policy." The motion was still-born. That was the fourth proposal moved by our representatives in England which was rejected by the Conference. </para>
                <para>Honorable members are aware that for years there have been advocates of the amalgamation of the two Courts of Appeal - the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the House of Lords. The House of Lords is the tribunal for all British legal appeals, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for appeals from other parts of the British Dominions. Either our Prime Minister or our Minister of External Affairs informed the Conference that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is "only a Board;" but the Lord Chancellor of England, who was present, drew attention to several facts with which our representatives seemed not to have acquainted themselves. He pointed out that the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is frequently identical with that of the House of Lords ; so that whichever Court is appealed to the same legal talent deals with the case. He showed, too, that of seventy-eight Privy Council appeals, only three affected Australia, while no fewer than forty-one came from India. He pointed out many difficulties in the way of the proposed amalgamation, which, I suppose, our representatives did not understand. He showed that every Dominion has a. different set of rules regulating appeals, and that it would be impossible to provide for appeals to the House of Lords or to a joint Appeal Court without legislation in all parts of the Empire affected, including the Commonwealth. These difficulties did not seem to be appreciated by our representatives, but after the explanation of the Lord Chancellor the motion was withdrawn. He pointed out that the existing procedure regarding appeals could not be altered without an amendment of our Constitution, which, in its turn, would require an Imperial Act. Our Prime Minister spoke of such an amendment, but admitted that it could not be made now, and contended that the right of appeal to the Privy Council was provided for " under duress " - a very wrong statement to make. The question was fully discussed in this country when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was sent to England in connexion with the consideration of the Imperial legislation covering bur Constitution; and, although at the time there were many who desired that the decisions of the Australian Courts should be final in all cases, a large body of public opinion contended that the ultimate right of appeal to the King should be retained. That right has been retained in the Canadian Constitution, and it is retained in our own, except in constitutional cases. The Lord Chancellor of England pointed out that we could not easily abolish this right of appeal ; that we "could not consume our own smoke entirely, as some seem to wish to do, without an amendment of the Constitution." In regard to this question, our Prime Minister has never had an opportunity to ascertain the wishes of Australia, the only expression of the public view in regard to it being made when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was sent Home prior to the granting of the Constitution. The provisions in the Constitution are in conformity with that view, and Parliament should have been consulted before any attempt was made to alter them. As I have said, the motion was withdrawn; that being the fifth of those submitted by our representatives which was so dealt with. </para>

                <para>I do not say that something of the sort is not necessary, but the motion, like others, was crudely conceived. It overlooked the difficulties, and had no regard to the effects of its adoption on the legislation of the Empire. </para>

                <para>When we come to the subject of an All-Red Pacific steam-ship route, -one would think that the men who desired, by hook or by crook, to nationalize the cable, would be perfectly ready to take part in subsidizing an All-Red route <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Canada; but the Prime Minister as representing Australia declined. The motion was submitted, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward ; and the Prime Minister of Australia said that the Australian Governments were not hostile; but he refused to join Canada and New Zealand in subsidizing the Vancouver service. I understood the right honorable gentleman the other night to take exception to the way in which this statement was framed by me in a question which I asked ; but I took it from the cabled report of what he said ; and the reason he therein gave was that New Zealand sells the same class of produce as Australia does, and there was some feeling amongst Australian producers that they would be subsidizing their competitors. It seems to me that the statesmanlike course to take in a matter of this sort, if it was felt that by subsidizing the new All-Red Pacific route we should be giving a great advantage to New Zealand producers over those of Australia, because of the reciprocal arrangement between New Zealand and Canada, was for the right honorable gentleman to state that we contemplated a reciprocal arrangement with Canada, and that when we have made it we shall be ready to join with Canada and New Zealand in embarking on this route.

                <para>I now come to the subject! of the Imperial shipping law. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward moved that the self-governing Dominions should be intrusted with wider legislative powers in respect to British and foreign shipping. The object of this motion was that, in conference with the British people, there should be some Imperial arrangement by which the Dominions should have greater powers in making shipping laws for themselves. The Prime Minister may think it desirable that they should, in the teeth of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buxton</inline> said, have those powers, no matter what effect they might have on the shipping of the Empire. Honorable members will recollect that I pointed out that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> moved his first motion - which I submitted did not really express what he meant- and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward moved another, requiring the Imperial Government to modify treaties with foreign Governments so as to give the Dominions the opportunity of withdrawing, the Prime Minister then declined to admit the proposition, because, he said, it would be a confession of our present legal inability. When the question came forward again, under the more direct form of the Imperial shipping laws, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier generously said that he was not anxious to impair the spirit of loyalty of native populations, and so make it difficult for Great Britain to maintain good relations with them. I desire honorable members to observe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier thus generously recognised the fact that India contains  300,000,000  people, whose anger has already been stirred up because of their countrymen's deportation, or threatened deportation, from South Africa ; and that, in dealing with the shipping of the Empire, England has to consider other people outside those of Australia, because the trade of British shipping is infinitely larger than that which concerns Australia. He, therefore, said, as I have already pointed out, that he was not anxious to impair the spirit of loyalty of native populations, and so make it difficult for Great -Britain to maintain good relations with them. In a speech delivered before the Conference Earl Crewe gives us a very interesting  summary of the difficulties that the Mother Country has to face in connexion with the question of coloured labour. Although the English people do not see the difficulties of this coloured labour question, the Imperial Ministers quite recognise that it is one of great complexity in all the Dominion Parliaments. Earl Crewe, and, indeed, all the British Ministers, frankly admitted that at the Conference. I should like honorable members to hear what Earl Crewe had to say - it is of an educational character for most of us - in regard to the great conundrum which this question offers to British statesmen - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Now there is no doubt, I think, that  our  national British traits lead us into some temptation and difficulty in this matter. I remember hearing of  a  witty observation made many years ago, which was to the effect that  a  Frenchman begins by having  a  good opinion of himself, but an Englishman begins by haying  a  bad opinion of other people. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid,</inline> who knows both races so well, would be disposed in any way to confirm that statement; but, that being so, if it is so, shows, I think, what our national temptations are when we come to consider the claims and the  merits  of people of  a  race entirely different from our own. What those claims and merits are are set out in the words which are quoted on the first page of this memorandum which has been circulated, among the observations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> in his address to the Conference in 1897. Those words are, if I may venture to say so, well worth weighing. I will not attempt to enlarge upon or in any way to develop what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> there so admirably said. I might, however, venture perhaps to remind you that, on the point of the national claims of Indians grounded on their past history - on their long descent - and other questions of the kind, this, at any rate, is not  a  moment when we desire to ignore those considerations. The ceremony of Thursday next, to which we are all looking forward, depends, to  a  great extent, for its meaning upon the long line of British sovereigns, through the Stuart, Tudor, and Plantagenet dynasties back to the lime of the  Norman  Conquest and the dim ages of the Saxon Monarchy ; and yet there are to be found in India those whose pride of descent is no less well founded and no less real than that of the King of England himself. Then, again, as regards history, we must never forget that not merely has India produced a great number of remarkable men, both in the public service and, to go back further, notable in ancient literature, but that she is most closely linked to  a  great number of the most famous men of our own race - statesmen; soldiers, and others. Now. of course, these considerations do not appeal  to  everybody. We know very well there  is a  large number of persons to whom the particular appeal of history and tradition  does  not come home; but on the eve of the Coronation I can hardly help alluding to this particular aspect of the question. But when  you  pass on to personal qualities in order to decide whether a man possesses  a  claim for consideration, really I think the case for those who object to Indians as Indians is worse still. If "A man's a man for a' that" is to be our motto, the claim of a large number of Indians is a real and- solid claim indeed. Whether we value intellectual culture, whether - apart from questions of creed - we value the religious mind, whether we value that remarkable devotion to and understanding of the things which are not seen which is so exceptionally deep in India, and which, I think, appeals to many people in these harder and material days - whether, again, we value simple intellectual force, uncertain in its exercise in some directions I admit, but which in others produces as keen and fine an instrument as you can find in any part of the world - whether we value all of those things, or any of them, it is undoubtedly the fact that India and Indians can establish a high and real claim for our consideration, apart from all others. </para>

                <para class="block">I am sorry to trouble honorable members with such a lengthy extract from this speech, but it all has a valuable hearing on the question of excluding Indian people from British and foreign ships. </para>
                <para>As things are, I fully admit that there is no short cut to the solution, so far as I know, in any part of the self-governing Dominions, of this question of Indian immigration by the adoption of heroic legislation - that I fully admit. But I do submit, with confidence, to the Conference that the relations between India and the rest of the Empire may be most materially improved by the cultivation of a mutual understanding. So far as the Indian stand-point is concerned, I quite admit that India must admit the main postulates with which I opened these observations, that is to say, the undoubted liberty of the self-governing Dominions to lay down the rules of their own citizenship, and I can say cheerfully on behalf of the India Office and the Government of India that we will always do our best to explain to the people of India how the position stands in this matter. We will not encourage India in any way to develop what, as circumstances are, can only be called extravagant claims for entrance into the self-governing Dominions, and we will do our best to explain to them what the conditions of the Empire really are. In turn, I think we are entitled, and, indeed, it is our duty, to ask the Ministers of the self-governing Dominions to spread within their own area in each case a realization of how deep and how widespread feeling on this subject in India is. As I think the memorandum points out, the question is an almost unique one in this - that it combines all sections and shades of Indian opinion - all classes and all creeds and political schools - those who are most devoted to the British Crown, and those - few in number, as T hope and believe, but sometimes noisy and sometimes in their way even formidable - who desire to see the end of British rule in India - all these combine when it is a question of Indian disability in any part of the British Empire. It cannot be denied that this difficulty is a very real asset, and a valuable asset, in India to those who are opposed to our rule there. This is an aspect which I venture to impress strongly on the Conference. It puts into the hands of those - some of them entirely unscrupulous people - who object to our presence in India, and who desire to undermine the Government, a weapon which they are not slow to use in attacking us. </para>

We cannot be <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> united Empire for two reasons : in the first place, you cannot properly speak of a united Empire so long as acute and active difficulties exist between the different parts composing that Empire; and, secondly - this, I am sure, will appeal to Ministers here - it is a distinct misfortune and a derogation from the unity of the Empire if the Mother Country continually finds itself implicated in difficulties between various parts of the Empire. </para>

                <para class="block">I have read all this to the House because I think it is full of wisdom as to the friendly attitude that Australia and the other Dominions should take up towards the people of India in regard to' the necessity for placing some restrictions upon their influx. We know that English politicians have been in India stirring up public feeling ; that they have been trying to persuade the people there that they are as fit for self-government as the British race, which, I am sure, they are not, and that they had better escape from British rule and govern for themselves. That speech of Earl Crewe really appealed to the representatives at the Conference to remember always that, however lightly and irresponsibly we may say to a particular race, " We shall not allow you inside Australia," it still imposes upon the Mother Country, whom I suppose we are naturally anxious to help, very grave difficulties in harmonizing our legislation with their difficulties. The same thing applies to other countries. Honorable members will recollect that, no less than four years before this Parliament existed, the Japanese people appealed to the people of the different States in these terms : " We do not mind if you do not wish us to come into your country, but do not exclude us by an Act of Parliament in which you group us' with all the inferior Asiatic races. Enter into a treaty with us, and in that treaty we will undertake not to come into your country. You will in that way treat us as a civilized nation. You will not put a statutory embargo on us, and we shall feel that you have treated us as a self-respecting community." That has been done with Canada, and I have among my notes a testimony by the Canadian Ministers as to the thoroughly conscientious way in which Japan has observed her treaty obligations to limit her people entering Canada.  I brought this question up in, I think, 1902, when the Immigration Restriction Bill was before the House. I then pointed out that Japan had for a long time been asking, us to treat her as one of the civilized nations, and to be satisfied that if we entered into a treaty with her she would conscientiously observe it. I was able to show at that time, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will reveal to honorable members, that in the previous two years a larger number of Japanese and Chinese had left Australia than had come into it. I showed .this by figures laid upon the table by the Prime Minister himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. This all shows, as was pointed out in the statesmanlike utterance of the Earl of Crewe, that the Dominions ought, in all cases where they are taking steps which are likely to be offensive to other races, especially those of Asia, to take into consideration the position in which the Imperial Government is placed in reconciling those people to laws passed on the part of her Dominions. Although we are keeping out the Indians, the Earl of Crewe made it clear that we ought not to make it more difficult than necessary to enable certain of them to come in; and I am happy to say that the Minister of External Affairs, in the course of the debate, uttered some expressions of opinion of which all must heartily approve. </para>

                    <para>On the general question raised by Lord Crewe with regard to a United Empire, the mixture of black and white races, or a freer admission of them into the countries now inhabited by the separate races, I think any suggestion that would work towards that would tend to a disunited Empire rather than a United Empire. I feel that very strongly. I think we recognise that there are localities in which both black and white can live separately, and that we should have the best possible and most harmonious relations with the two races. In that way we shall maintain the unity of the Empire. I would like also to put it in this way. Take the case of the Commonwealth : There was some years ago a very strong feeling, much stronger than there is to-day, of prejudice against the Asiatics. </para>
                    <para>I am glad to see that admission. He continued - </para>
                    <para>That prejudice is very largely going. I think one of the reasons why it is very much less to-day than it used to be is a better understanding, on the part of the statesmen in this country, of the position which we have taken up. There is not the same irritation caused by a wrong understanding on the part of our statesmen, or a wrong statement of the case by them of our position. Irritating statements used to be made in the press with regard to the position the self-governing Dominions take up in this matter. We have to-day a very much better feeling in that respect. We have been enabled so far to relax portions of Statutes in which any difference was shown with regard to the treatment of Asiatics and others. We have in two or three cases been able to carry resolutions removing the disabilities which Asiatics were formerly under. So far has this been extended, that we got a resolution through the House of Representatives to give Asiatics exactly the same privileges in old-age pensions as white persons. It was defeated ultimately, and it was not finally passed into law, but that was owing to accidental circumstances which I do not think will occur again. In every possible way we seek to place those who are resident in Australia in precisely the same position as other races. </para>
                    <para>I could not help thinking of the unfortunate Pacific Islanders whom the Australian people brought from their islands years ago, and induced to settle here and to establish homes. Their children were civilized, Christianized, and educated within our own country ; and then we deported them to the savage communities in which their parents had been reared. I always felt that that was not only the most unchristian, but the most inhuman, thing that was ever done by the Australian people. </para>

Bearing on this question, in 1902 I said, standing in this House, that I regarded it as a factor in statesmanship that, however favorably a Parliament might view a particular proposal, it should not be adopted if it seemed to be strongly objectionable to the people; and I have always recognised that the people of Australia had a strong animosity to the idea of introducing coloured races. </para>

At all events, there it was : and I recognised it in 1902 as one of the factors in whatever statesmanlike views one could take upon a question of that sort. The Australian Ministers declined to vote for the motion in question, because they said it would amount to an admission that Australia had not already the right to pass laws without consulting the authorities at Home. I noticed in the press, immediately after this had been cabled to Australia, that the Attorney-General emphasized that view. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">That may be an aspiration, but, as the law stands to-day, a Governor-General has a perfect constitutional right to defer approving of any measure passed by this Parliament if he thinks that it will interfere with some important law of the Empire which has been passed by the Imperial Parliament. Therefore, the right is there. Whether the Imperial Parliament will exercise it or not depends upon the correspondence that takes place. But it was shown clearly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Buxton that, although Australia may be anxious to have unlimited power to deal with foreign or British shipping coming to Australia with coloured crews, to do so might disorganize the whole trade of the British Empire, because it would conflict with treaties with foreign countries and act as a kind of incentive to them to retaliate against British shipping, which I am sure the people of this country do not wish to do. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want the right honorable gentleman to say just now whether he thinks that expression of opinion sound or not, but only whether the words were uttered  at  the Conference. At all events, I say that that statement was a complete misrepresentation of the feelings of the Australian people. I remember that the honorable member for Barrier, when a private member, moved, on a certain private members' day, a motion in favour of a State-owned line of steamers. On that occasion he made a calculation of the most callow description. I asked him, in the course of his speech, whether, in estimating the profit which would be derived, he had taken into consideration two common-place and stereotyped items. One was the depreciation in shipping, which ship-owners almost invariably put down at 5 per cent. ; and the other was the insurance of ships, which is equal to another 5 per cent. The honorable member said that he had not allowed for those two items.  Vet  he made a calculation by which he professed to show that Australia would make immense profits out of a line of steamers.' To represent to the British people that the Australian people, as a whole, are so impressed with the unreasonableness of the existing lines of steamers that they desire to run a competing line as a State affair, is the grossest misrepresentation of public feeling. There has been no agitation, and such a proposal is not even in the programme of the Labour party. Of course, there are plenty of people in this country who are prepared to advocate such a thing. They are of the same type as those who would nationalize everything, even to the haloes which some of us are going to wear by-and-by. But I say that this utterance, as a representation of the feelings of the people of Australia, was absolutely unjustified. The people have never had an opportunity of expressing their opinion on the subject. We have such a multiplicity of lines running between England and Australia at such various rates - passenger fares ranging, I suppose, from <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> up to <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">£80</inline> - that it is impossible to say that a State line would do any better than existing lines do. But, whether or not, the people of Australia have never expressed an opinion. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite right : because one of the referenda proposals which I had the pleasure of opposing and of criticising, both in the press and by my voice, was for the nationalization of everything. The result was that the people denounced it. The serious part of the matter is this : that if Conferences are going to be used solely as a sort of arena in which subjects of this kind - with regard to decimal coinage, with regard to a Commonwealth line of steamers, and other such things - are to be paraded, Conferences will be discredited in the eyes of the world.- </para>

                        <para>- I do not know about that, but I am sure that those views to which I have called attention do not represent the opinions of the people of Australia. However, summarizing the Conference, I find the following to be the result : - Eight motions - I know of no others - were brought forward by the Australian representatives, all of which were withdrawn ; that they refused to admit that the shipping laws were subject to Imperial powers; and that, on the Declaration of London, they declined to support an approving motion as far as negotiations have gone. That was, I submit, a poor exhibition. The Prime Minister may think that it was a poor exhibition, because the Conference did not see fit to approve of his resolutions ; but I do not hesitate to say that the whole of the motions brought forward by the Government were of the crudest and callowest description. They had not been fully thought out; and they had been brought forward without consideration for the interests of the rest of the Empire and of the position of the British people, who have to cope with difficulties they do not share. I therefore say that, as far as Australia is concerned, the Conference was anything but a success ; and I do not think that, if we could consult the private opinions of the leading men who took part in it, they would accord to Australia a very large meed of praise for the part they took in it, or even for the Imperial sentiments of the men who represented us. </para>

                        <para>- I desire now to make a few references to opinions expressed by the Prime Minister and his colleagues outside the Conference. The right honorable gentleman went to many centres in Great Britain, being entertained here and there. He returned to his native heath, and I have no doubt felt that there he was at liberty to speak very broadly as to what public opinion and public practice in Australia were. I am prepared to show to any impartial audience - I do not say that I shall convince honorable members opposite, but I could show to an impartial jury, if I had one before me - that the right honorable gentleman wholly misrepresented public opinion and public practice in Australia, and that he also misrepresented the ideals of his own party, and the condition of industrial matters in Australia. Honorable members know that the Prime Minister was waited upon in London by a very large deputation from the Chamber of Commerce. They represented many millions of money. According to the correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> they represented a capital, of ^50,000,000. This deputation waited upon the Prime Minister for the purpose of protesting against the principles underlying the imposition of the land tax; and its recognised spokesman was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Williamson, who is  chairman  of four or five Anglo-Australian companies. He said - </para>

I dare say that there are very few honorable members upon the Ministerial side of the House who did not use that argument. They declared that the object of the tax was to break up the large estates, which were said to cover, not acres, but degrees. Although the tax was primarily intended to affect the great areas used for pastoral and agricultural purposes ; when the Government came to consider the legal possibilities they discovered that they had to make it applicable also to city and suburban lands. The measure was deliberately aimed at the large land-holders of this country, and was coupled with a political bribe to the small holders to assist in securing its consummation, because they were told that they would then be able to get cheap land. </para>

                        <para>- I say, then, that the exemption had that effect. I must not say that it was intended to have it. The measure was passed to impose a land tax upon the people, and, in effect, it stated, " All holders of less than ?5,000 worth of unimproved value may go scot free." I say that the effect of such an exemption upon the small holders was to offer them an inducement to assist in passing it. They did not resist it because they were thus assured it would not hit them. The idea underlying that legislation was that it would cause the big land-holders to break up their estates, and thus give the small holders an opportunity of purchasing at reduced prices. But, like many of the economic experiments of the Labour party, it has recoiled upon them like a boomerang. Strange to say, contemporaneous with the imposition of the tax the price of land increased, and rents were raised ! Yet the Prime Minister stated in London - </para>

I directed attention to the fact that the tax was so severe that in many cases the mortgagor would probably say, " Take the whole property. My equity in it is not valuable enough to enable me to pay the tax." But my statements evoked no spark of sympathy whatever. The matter had been decided in Caucus, and the Bill had to be passed.

The honorable member for Cook in this House, or in a newspaper, once said that it was resolved to levy a tax of 4d. in the £1, but at no general election were the people ever told what the Labour party were going to do with regard to this tax. A land tax in the abstract is a thing to which anybody may agree, because it may be a very legitimate way of collecting money from the public; but it is a very different thing to come upon the people with a tax which to my knowledge in some cases amounts to 50 per cent. of the net proceeds of an estate. That is calculated to bring ruin upon certain people. I know of one estate in New South Wales returning a net 5 per cent. by very careful management; and this tax has taken 50 per cent. of that profit, leaving the owners but half the profit previously derived from it.

Honorable members opposite know very well that that verdict meant a complete change in public opinion, as they will see when the next election comes round. Then the Prime Minister had the temerity to say that he did not favour the referendum. I should think that he did not; that is like the man who went to gaol, and said he did not approve of the institution at all, because he was in it. It is perfectly natural that the Prime Minister should have told the people of England that he did not approve of the referendum because of the way it had treated him and his party. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I shall be glad to hear a speech from the Minister. We know very well how, in public, Labour members talk of the need for encouraging persons coming here from the Mother Country and elsewhere. Some of them want persons to come when they have a little capital, while others do not want capitalists in the country, so that it is very difficult to know what they do want. I have seen telegrams and letters sent to England and published in the press, showing that they do not want anybody to come here, on the ground that there is no room for immigrants. Only yesterday, from the cablegrams, honorable members saw what took place at a great Trades Union Congress, because it was supposed that our Prime Minister had told the miners of Ton-y-pandy, or was reported to have told them, that there was plenty of room for miners in Australia. The party here sent to the Congress a message saying that there is no room for miners, that there is no work for them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable' member saw the statement in the press, and now he says that there is no room for workers here. I have seen numerous communications, from the Trades Halls and letters coming here to say that the party did not want immigrants. They know very well that public opinion has completely swung round in this country, and that if they did not now advocate immigration, and assist it, it would sweep them out of Parliament. Yet they cut down the Estimates to the extent I have named. Honorable members know what Canada is spending on immigration in London. </para>

                        <para>- That is the view of the honorable member, and of each member of his party, that anybody who comes here is what they call " cheap labour." I do not know how he came out himself ; but I know that a great many men in this country who cry out about cheap labour came out with nothing to their backs - except, of course, the suits they stood in. It is hypocritical for any honorable member to talk in that way, and at the same time to cut down the vote for advertising. In England the Prime Minister said, "Australia wants honest, healthy immigrants, whether with money or not." We pay a High Commissioner  £5,000  a year, and equip him with an expensive staff of officers to advise us as to how best we can induce people to come here ; but honorable members opposite, while pretending to desire to increase Australian prosperity by assisting immigration, are taking steps calculated to deter immigrants from coming here. I wish now to deal with representations made by the Prime Minister about the freedom of Australia. When banqueted by the Ayrshire miners, he said - </para>

He said nothing about the intimidation and the violence used in regard to non-unionists, who have been forced to run for their lives, and have been hounded out of employment and prevented from obtaining employment where their labour was needed. The Prime Minister went on to say that " privilege had not been eradicated." How could it be when the Labour party has tried to obtain by legislation for one section of the community privileges as unfair as any existing in the old Tory days? He did not tell his audience that his party has done its utmost to create privileges of a particular class. He said, too, that ' ' he hoped to see greater freedom." The situation was a Gilbertian one. We had the Leader of the Labour party hoping to see greater freedom, although he knew of a union which required £20, and of another which exacted £40, from men desiring the right to work at their trades. He went on to say that we " passed legislation for the whole nation," and that there was no class here.  His  statement is almost too ludicrous to comment upon. As the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> pointed out, " he could not have more greatly misrepresented the attitude of the political Labour party towards the workmen of Australia." The journal showed that the Labour party is organized on the basis of preventing freedom. </para><para>Let me now draw attention to some of the attempts of Ministers to encourage this desired freedom.

                        <para>- Then I will say that while Attorney-General he continued to be  president  of an organization which was entering on a strike in contravention of the law. Further, at an earlier date he went to Newcastle, and became a member of the Strike Congress which was organized during the coal trouble, when 14,000 men were out of work, and various activities of the community were "held up." It was said by Bowling that the honorable gentleman actually moved the motion for the general strike. If our Judges were found to be contributing to the support of parties appearing before them, would their impartiality be trusted? </para>

A good deal of controversy has taken place in the Commonwealth over an interview of the Prime Minister, in which the right honorable gentleman is represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> as having said that if England went to war and Australia did not approve of the war, Australia would have to haul down the British flag. That statement was duly contradicted. I desire to point out - what a great many people do not seem to see - that the condition of things which the Prime Minister is said to have represented to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> is the condition of things that must come about in certain circumstances under Labour administration. Honorable members know very well that, under the Naval Agreement arranged by the Prime Minister, Australia is to have the right to say whether or not she will join in any war in which England may be engaged, and that the question of whether the Navy shall be under the control of the Commandant of the British Navy is to come to this Rouse to be determined. It is not impossible that this House might determine in the negative ; and, if so, what would have to be done? Should we keep the Union Jack flying on the Australian Navy? Could we? Would not the presence of the Union Jack at the masthead of the Australian Navy be an indication to the world that we were remaining under the Union Jack; and would it not be necessary under such circumstances as I  have suggested to remove the Union Jack? Would ' we not either have to haul down the Union Jack or join in the war? There is, therefore, nothing very improbable, to my mind, in the Prime Minister having said what was reported. Let me see what the principal organ of the Labour party said before the right honorable gentleman had an opportunity to contradict the interview. <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> of 27th July, less than two months ago, said - </para><quote>
                    <para>An interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> is published in the English <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews.</inline> W. T. Stead was long ago noted as an interviewer. It is evident that his hand has not lost its cunning. The passages of the interview cabled out to Australia read .most interestingly. And they express a view of the Empire which, while widely held by intelligent private citizens and by all radical thinkers, are rarely expressed - too rarely expressed - by responsible statesmen..... </para>
                    <para>Yet Australia's Prime Minister does no more than put into characteristically blunt speech a fact which must be patent to any student of world affairs whose mind is not beclouded with false ideals of patriotism. . . . What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> has done is to frame in everyday language the new concept of Empire. It is a concept which is held by the most intelligent sections of the community and by the most notable thinkers on public affairs. It is a concept, accordingly, which is shaping itself, in the trend of event, towards universal acceptance. All which goes to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> merely voiced the trend of progress. He stated no views peculiar to himself, or to any party. He uttered no personal aspirations. He did not say, " I would like so and so to happen." He ventured on no prophecy. He did not say : " This and that will take place." He did no more than call attention to certain well-known facts, and point to the direction in which the current of human events is flowing so strongly that only prejudice, blind and stupid and fanatical, refuses to recognise it. </para>

At the time of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> excitement, I called eleven meetings in and around Sydney, taking care that they should be held in town halls, with the mayor in the chair on each occasion ; and I submitted two motions, and two only, to crowded audiences affirming, first, that they acknowledged the deep indebtedness of the Australian people to the British people for having protected them over a period of over 120 years ; and, secondly, that they desired to assist in upholding British supremacy by sea, by contributing as largely as possible to the funds required to that end. Those motions were passed without one dissentient voice in each of the eleven town halls ; and I communicated the' fact to the present Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is absolutely incorrect; the meetings were open to the public throughout the suburbs. Judging from the result of those meetings I am convinced that if the question were submitted to the people of Australia whether they desired to exempt themselves, when it suited them, from any war in which England was engaged, they would, with one voice, denounce the idea as contemptuous and disloyal. If we declare that we will take the assistance of Great Britain when it suits us, but that, as soon as there happens to be a conflict with some fad or idea we may happen to have, we are going to say, " We are glad to be protected by your assistance, but in this particular instance we will not help you in the war," England would reply, "Thank you for nothing; I .can assist myself in any war, and the question is whether you will not be running under my wing for protection from people who find your land open, because there is no British flag flying over it." </para>

                        <para>- I wrote to the Prime Minister telling him how many meetings were held in those town halls, that the mayors had taken the chair, that the meetings were open to the public, and that there was not one dissentient voice in the whole. I had intended to deal with His Excellency's Speech, but I shall have an opportunity of discussing the subjects therein referred to when they are brought before the House. I should only like to say now - though not by way of peroration -that I have fought the Labour party for twenty years, and please God I shall fight them for another twenty, or so long as they hold their present opinions. I consider that their ideals are wholly selfish, thoroughly narrow, and in the interests of one class only. I have had the satisfaction, at all events, of placing myself in one of the niches of the trades hall of this country. In order to show that I have not taken a partial view of industrial questions, I may mention that, years ago, I had the pleasure of receiving a most flattering letter from the  president  and secretary of the Trades Hall of this State, complimenting me, and thanking me for the improved relations between Capital and Labour, which had been produced by my efforts at conciliation. Those, however, were efforts for voluntary conciliation. I believe we shall never have peace between employer and employe1 as long as we have to depend upon compulsion. The effect of compulsion has been to train up the younger generation, on the employes' side, to believe that their province is to be inimical to the employers, and to train up the young employers to believe that their province, also, is to be inimical to the employes. I hope honorable members will not think I imagine that the employers of this country are a group of saints ; in many cases they are just as selfish as the employed. I have done my best always to try to hold the balance evenly between the two parties, and have always been satisfied that if we wish to bring up the younger generation of employés to recognise that it is to their interests to work amicably with their employers, and to bring up the younger generation of employers to recognise that it is to their interests to work amicably with the employes, we shall have to teach both of them that the settlement of their disputes depends not upon force, but upon goodwill, brought about by a recognition of their mutual interests. I have the satisfaction of believing that, far from taking a one-sided view of these industrial questions, I have long ago taken what I believe to be an impartial view. I take it to-day. What I am objecting to to-day is that, by what the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> calls "tampering with disorder," by allowing themselves to wink at the initial stages of social disturbance, Labour advocates are preparing for a time when the two classes will be at one another's throats. It behoves every thoughtful man who desires to see the best possible relationship existing between employer and employe1 in this country to realize that, if we are to make a great country of Australia, we must look to its industrialism ; that if we are going to push on its industrialism, we must encourage capital to come here; and that we must impress upon the two younger classes of employers and employes the view that their interests, and those of Australia generally, will be best served by mutual recognition of one another's interests with a view to the well-being of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- We are all indebted to the honorable member for Parkes for his exceptionally exhaustive speech, and for his concluding remarks which proclaimed to this House, and will proclaim to the country, if the newspapers report him sufficiently, that he is a missioner of peace. But since the honorable member tells us that he is strong for industrial peace, may I remind him that only a little while ago, he was criticising the actions of an honorable member, occupying one of the highest positions in the Ministry, who has done more for industrial peace in Australia than has any other man in the House. I refer to the Attorney-General, the honorable member for West Sydney. Some would endeavour to make out that the honorable (gentleman is in a rather invidious position since he holds office as  president  of a trade union, whilst occupying the position of chief legal adviser to the Commonwealth. But if the Attorney-General can use his legal knowledge, his arguments, his persuasive powers, and his peaceful tactics in the direction of bringing about industrial peace in this country every member should back up his efforts; and until it is proved that he is doing otherwise, I shall most heartily approve of his actions. The honorable member for Parkes urged, as the basis of one of his complaints against the Prime Minister and those of his colleagues who attended the Imperial Conference, that they did not, in the first place, represent public opinion. Indeed, from his remarks, one would have imagined that every honorable member on this side of the House represented a minority. The figures relating to the last general election have been quoted in a way so misleading that one feels constrained to review them, in order to make sure that one has not fallen into any mistake regarding them, I have, therefore, been scanning the figures again, and I find that the people, not at a referendum, but at the last general election, when they had the platforms of both parties before them, approved in the most pronounced manner of that placed before them by the Labour party. I am proud to be on this side of the House, and prouder still to be able to say that not one member of our party represents a minority. </para>

I hesitate to refer to these figures, because it might not be thought to be altogether in good taste to do so; but since the Opposition are always talking about majority rule, I feel it necessary to remind them that no, fewer than six members of their party represent a minority of the electors in their constituencies. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable member, I would say that there are lies, big lies, and statistics. Figures, as we know, can often be made to prove anything. We have had even the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Parkes differing by thousands as to the majority obtained by the Labour party at the last general election; and since two such competent authorities can differ to that extent, there must often be sad deficiencies in their computations. The figures to which I have referred, however, have been taken from the parliamentary returns, so that he who runs may read. Another complaint made by the honorable member for Parkes was that this Parliament should have had an opportunity, before our delegation left for England, to express its opinion upon the subjects to be brought before the Imperial Conference. Because this Parliament did not express its opinion on those subjects, he contends that the Prime Minister and his co-delegates, did not represent the opinions of this Parliament. The honorable member belongs to a party which is led by the honorable member for Ballarat. Let me read from last year's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what occurred, certainly during the closing hours of the session, when the very subjects afterwards discussed at the Imperial Conference were debated, although to a limited extent, in this Chamber. I find, under the heading of "Supplementary Estimates, ' ' that the Attorney-General, who was then leading the House in the absence of the Prime Minister, brought before this </para>

                        <para>- Very briefly, I admit; but that gave all the more opportunity for the Opposition to comment on them. The honorable member for Wentworth laughs ; but 1 think it showed a very kindly consideration on the part of the Attorney-General simply to read the questions, and leave it to the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader, and other members on the other side, to discuss them. </para>

                        <para>- No; we dealt with a Considerable amount of business after the Supplementary Estimates were passed. Private members' business was proceeded with to a considerable extent. T remember being ruled out of order in the discussion of a Bill relating to banking, which was brought in during the last hours of the session, and which the honorable member for Illawarra wanted to get through. I " stonewalled " that Bill, showing that considerable time was still left for the House to do business. The honorable member for Capricornia delivered quite a long speech upon a proposal which he brought forward ; and after that, the honorable member for Brisbane introduced his motion regarding the abolition of the refreshment bar in this building. In fact, a considerable amount of business was done after these items were discussed. I wish to say to the honorable member for Parkes - and I do not want to say it in his lecturing style - that when these proposals were brought before the House, he was conspicuous by his absence. The chief ground of his complaint to-day was that no opportunity was given to the House to discuss the questions which were to be submitted to the Imperial Conference. As a matter of fact, they were all read to the House by the Attorney-General, and discussed by the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and the honorable member for Angas. </para>

                <para>Mr.F E NTON. - The honorable member's complaint was that the Government had not submitted the resolutions to the House. They did submit them to the House, and there was a fair opportunity of discussing them. I propose to read for the honorable member's special edification what the honorable member for Ballarat had to say about them. I understand that the honorable member for Parkes owes some allegiance, at any rate, to the party opposite, and I presume he recognises in the honorable member for Ballarat, his leader. </para>

The honorable member says that they were withdrawn, but <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> many occasions, in his long parliamentary life, when he has submitted resolutions, he has had to withdraw them, but why? Simply on account of the promise made by those in authority that his views should be carried out; and for my own part, I believe that most of these resolutions will substantially be carried out by the Imperial Government. </para>

                <para class="block">I speak of the Declaration of London with some humility, being a layman, because it is, of course, an exceedingly technical subject, and I could not attempt to deal with it elaborately; but the honorable member for Parkes seemed to make a great point of the contention that the Declaration concerned the British Government and the British Isles alone, and that there should be no interference in the matter by representatives of the oversea Dominions. I cannot conceive why the honorable member for Parkes should assume that attitude, because I understand that the Declaration of London was considered by the Chambers of Commerce, and by the commercial section of this community generally. It particularly affects the exporting sections, who are sending from this country millions of pounds worth of exports every year. We are, therefore, very much concerned as to its terms. We have constantly tens of thousands of pounds worth of produce upon the high seas, and these commodities would be affected by the Declaration of London in time of war. Therefore, the commercial world of this country necessarily has a great deal to do with that document. </para>

                        <para>- The motions submitted by the Prime Minister were laid before this House last year. I admit that the honorable member for Parramatta complained that they were brought clown at an exceptionally late hour in the session ; but the approval of the Leader of the Opposition, and of the previous Attorney-General, was given to the proposals submitted. They having therefore received the approval of this House, backed up by resolutions passed by Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Manufactures throughout Australia, the Government were fully justified in submitting them to the Conference. I have read a considerable amount of correspondence published by English journals in reference to this matter. I find that, during the discussion of the Declaration of London by the Imperial Conference, the leading journals of Great Britain were flooded with correspondence. In one instance there was a protest signed by 113 Admirals, as well as by the London Chamber of Commerce, against the Declaration. Surely, then, it was the duty of Ministers to represent the Australian view of this very important document. The honorable member for Parkes quoted the <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> It is fair to say that the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> gives a more impartial view of public questions than does any other journal published in the Old Country. It is not tarnished by extreme partisanship. What did the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> say in regard to the handling of this important subject by the Australian representatives? It said that the way in which this very intricate subject was handled by the Australian delegates was a credit to the Delegation, and to the countries whence they came. </para>

I have no desire to weary the House, but I should like to rite some of the remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta, who, in discussing this question upon the Supplementary Estimates  for  1910-11,  complained that the Government were obeying the behests of the InterState Labour Conference held at Brisbane.

Further, it was known that the Conference was to be" held ; and if the honorable member for Parkes had wished to know the subjects to be brought before that body, he could have obtained the desired information by merely putting a question upon the business-paper. This afternoon, he attempted, by innuendo, to detract from the very great ability which was displayed by our delegates at the Conference.

This is an age of practical men; and I say that our delegates displayed as much practical common sense as did any of the other delegates at the Conference. In such circumstances, any attempt to disparage their work at that gathering comes "with ill grace from any member of the community. Particularly does it come with ill grace from the honorable member for Parkes, when we recollect that, whilst the delegates to previous gatherings of this character had stood only at the portal, our representatives on this occasion were invited to step right into the innermost councils of the nation. The Prime Minister of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward</inline> Grey, and his colleagues, said, in effect, " Come as brothers and look into the great secrets of the Empire." </para>

                        <para>- That may, or may not, be. The honorable member for Parkes founded the whole of his argument upon a certain statement. That foundation having been knocked away, the whole of the superstructure which he erected upon it falls to the ground. But, not content with discussing the matters which were debated at the Conference, he attacked the speeches which were delivered outside of that gathering by the Prime Minister and his colleagues. He was particularly severe upon the Prime Minister for the way in which the latter answered one of the most representative deputations which waited on him in London - a deputation representing  £50,000,000  worth of capital which has been invested within the Commonwealth - and which protested against the injustice inflicted upon British investors by the operation of the land tax. I would ask the honorable member, who is always prepared to put up a fight for those who are possessed of more than their fair share of this world's substance, to look at the other side of the picture. Are we going to allow the wealthy in other parts of the world to escape taxation, while the poor have to contribute more than their proper proportion? I say, no. If the poor of the community are to be consistently neglected, very great trouble is in store for us. Such a noted writer as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederick</inline> Harrison has put the position in language which I could not hope to improve upon. He says - </para>

                    <para>Ninety per cent, of the actual producers of wealth have no home that they can call their own, beyond the end of the week, have not a bit of soil, or so much as a room that belongs to them, have nothing of value of any kind, except as much old furniture as will go in a cart, have the precarious chance of a weekly wage, which barely suffices to keep them in health, are housed for the most part in places which no man thinks fit for his horse, are separated by as narrow a margin from destitution that a month of bad trade, sickness, or unexpected loss brings them face to face with hunger and pauperism. If this be the permanent arrangement of modern society, civilization must be held to bring a curse on the great majority of mankind. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like honorable members on- the other side to consider these questions. Can we permit these things to continue in this country or abroad ? Do we not, as a- Parliament, exist for the purpose of ameliorating the position of those who have to live under such conditions as are described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederic</inline> Harrison? If not, we have no right to be here at all. If there is one reason for which, more than another, I belong to the Labour party, it is because the members of that party have taken up the evangel on behalf of the poor, and are fighting their battles in the Houses of Legislature and other deliberative assemblies. If the honorable member for Parkes were to come forward with a more democratic programme than that of the Labour party, and I could rely upon the honorable member to carry it into effect, I should be a follower of him. I do not think it is likely that such a wonderful change will come about, because, judging by the expressions I have heard from him in this House, the honorable member is a confirmed Tory. There is no party in the world to which the masses of the people can look with so much confidence for their amelioration as to the Labour party, of which I am an humble member. These are matters which should concern us. As I have said before in this House, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the human family is only as strong as the weakest of the race. </para>
                <para class="block">We have to look after the condition of the weakest ; and if we do not, the future of humanity will not be very bright. To show how people are dying off in the Old Land, as the result of bad conditions of life, I may give a few comparisons of the average length of life in different places. These may appear stale, but it is necessary that the facts should be dinned into the ears of some people, in order that they may realize the state of affairs that really exists. I find that at the fashionable watering place, Harrogate, the average length of lite is stated to be forty-seven years; whilst at Dewsbury, a neighbouring place, where the people live in crowded quarters and engage in unhealthy occupations, the average length of life is only twenty-six years. This means that in such places the human race is dying off, not by slow degrees, but very fast. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Drysdale,</inline> a very eminent authority, gives the average length of life of the nobility, professional classes and the gentry, at fifty-five years: whilst the average length of life of an artisan at Lambeth, owing, again, to unhealthy surroundings and employment, is given at only twenty-nine years. These are figures which we should do well to think over. I do not wish to parade the conditions of any of our big cities, but we know that in Melbourne and Sydney, and other large centres of population in Australia, men and women and boys and girls are working under conditions that are a disgrace to our civilization, and a great reflection upon our common Christianity. Unless we are going to remedy these things, we do not deserve to continue to exist as a" Parliament. Professor Huxley, the great biologist, and a man who travelled practically round the world, said, on coming back to Great Britain after one of his journeys, that, in some of the islands of the sea, he had seen humanity in absolutely its lowest and most degraded form; and yet, in a speech delivered at the Mansion House, he said - </para>

                <para class="block">Is not that an awful reflection upon Christianity? If such things are to continue to exist at the seat of the Empire to which we look for enlightenment, it is difficult to say what will happen in the future. I have some other quotations on similar lines, but I shall not weary the House with them. I wish now to say one or two words on the subject of Commonwealth expenditure. It must be very carefully watched. There is a certain Department in which, of course, it is increasing by leaps and bounds. We passed Acts of Parliament in the last and in previous sessions, which have involved very considerable expenditure upon our Naval and Military systems. I claim, without fear of successful contradiction, that there are no men who love their country more than do those who form the bulk of the Labour party, whether inside or outside this House ; but, while paying every attention to the proper defence of Australia, I say we have a right to closely watch the expenditure for this purpose. If we should be attacked, we shall have to depend on the thousands of workers of Australia, who will be prepared to shoulder arms to keep out the invader. I remind honorable members that the accumulated debts of the various nations of the world incurred by reason of wars, is estimated at £6,000,000,000. That is the great weight which is hanging round the necks of the people of the various countries of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> a member of the present Imperial Government said - </para>

                    <para>The whole of the civilized nations to-day are spending no less than £500,000,000 every year in order to maintain naval and military defence. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That means that the huge debt .pf  £6,000,000,000  incurred for war purposes by the nations of the world will be increased every ten years by almost a similar amount. That is an awful thing to contemplate. In the circumstances, I" am exceedingly glad that, in almost every one of his public addresses, and wherever he had the opportunity, the Prime Minister voiced the magnificent note, not merely of peace for the Empire, but of the world's peace. That was one of the grandest notes he struck when in the United Kingdom, and if the honorable gentleman did nothing else, he did well as a representative of Australia in making it clear that we love peace and desire the maintenance of peace. </para>

                        <para>- The great majority of the people of Australia, on the 13th April, expressed a decided preference for a particular party in this House. I believe that that preference will be found to have been strengthened when the people are appealed to again. That is the kind of preference I delight in. I notice that whenever a certain party gets into power, there is always a demand for some measure of electoral reform. I will mention what we intend to do, and in doing it I claim the assistance of every honorable member on the other side. This party intends to purify the electoral machinery, and the conduct of elections to the utmost extent possible, and we shall do it. I believe that the most rabid reformer on the other side will be amply satisfied with the proposals which will be introduced later. I shall claim the vote of every honorable member who is anxious to bring about electoral reform. That reminds me of the referendum on the constitutional amendments. I am. very pleased that it was taken during the early part of this year, but I am not satisfied with the result. I would have liked to :see this Parliament clothed with power to protect the people. The taking of the votes disclosed certain matters which I hope we shall be able to remedy in the future. Several honorable members ha&lt;ve spoken about the expenditure of money on that occasion, and the Leader of the Opposition, his  deputy,  and other honorable members on that side have replied that they did not see any money pass. Well, near the time for closing the poll I happened to be conversing with one of the most prominent members of the Victorian Parliament. I remarked to him, " If you cannot win on this occasion with the aid of all the boodle, all the misrepresentation, and everything in your favour, you have no hope of ever being able to win." He replied, " I quite agree with you, but what do you mean by ' boodle ' ?" I said, " It is no use to talk to me in that way ; any amount of ' boodle ' is floating round." " Oh," he said, " you mean plenty of money?" "Yes," I replied. He then emphatically said, " They have spent money this year, and they will have to spend it next year, and the year following." Yet we have honorable members on the other side denying that money was spent, and spent freely, too. </para>

                    <para>The servile, deceptive, cringing and trust-owned newspapers shout at every opportunity that Socialism means murder and anarchy ; that it would break up the home, destroy religion, incentive, and ambition, and stifle the noble and higher aspirations of life. They publish all this trash which they well know is false, because they are paid to do it. Editors are compelled by the profit system to cringingly stultify themselves in order to live. Not an editor in all Christendom would continue to do this slimy work if they owned their papers, or did not depend on capitalistic advertising for support.

I am paid $150 a week 101 keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with - others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things - and any of you who would be so foolish as to write 'honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know this and I know it, and what folly is this to be toasting an ' Independent Press.' We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping-jacks ; they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities, and our lives are the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes." </para>

                        <para>- I do not care to make harsh remarks like that. Sometimes our observations do get a little harsh, but I always like to be cn good terms with honorable members opposite, although we may disagree politically. There are many items in the Governor-General's Speech with which, but for the address of the honorable member for Parkes, I should very much have liked to deal. Some honorable members have said that there is not much business to be done this session, and that Parliament will soon rise. But I consider that there is a considerable amount of work to be done. I was glad to hear the .Prime Minister say, " That is the work, and it will have to be done before we rise." If it is not completed before Christmas it will be done after Christmas. I trust that in respect to Tariff and other matters we shall have a good time, and that they will all be dealt with from a national standpoint. . </para>

                        <para>- I am reminded of an ever-prominent question. I reserve to myself the right to speak on it when it is brought forward. I have heard vague remarks about large sums which are likely to be spent -on the Federal Capital. But I trust that the expenditure will be of  a very limited character indeed. When I think of the great expenditure which we must incur in developing the Northern Territory, constructing transcontinental railways, and carrying out the defence scheme, I see very little opportunity of spending money on any fantastic schemes like that of the Federal Capital. I hope, however, that we shall have ample opportunity to discuss that matter when it is submitted. It may be that for the time being I may have to desert comrades who have stood by me in many a noble battle, and enlist under the same banner as the honorable member for Echuca. Certainly it will be a peculiar political mixture if it should fall to my lot to range myself side by side with him. I trust that we shall soon get to work, and pass the legislation which is outlined in the opening Speech. I believe that when we have passed these measures, including the great Commonwealth banking scheme, we shall have done that which will be to the advancement of the highest interests of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - We all agree, I am sure, thai the honorable member for Maribyrnong is thoroughly in earnest and conscientious on the lines which he believes to be right, but the trouble is that his lines are all wrong, and that makes the difference. I feel certain that we can hold different political views without having bitter personal feeling. In the few words I have to utter to-night, I want to speak plainly and candidly. I would remind the last  speaker  that we all deplore as much as he does the dire poverty and distress of the unfortunate submerged people in the Old Land, but he should understand distinctly that the conditions in glorious Australia are as different from those obtaining there as daylight is from&gt; dark. I would also remind him that the conditions there are peculiar, not only by reason of the fact that, through many centuries, the people of the Old Country have had to civilize and raise themselves, but because they have had an open door, through which have poured into their land the unfortunates of almost every other nation. The problems confronting the Imperial Parliament, the municipal councils, and other authorities in Great Britain,, are as great as, if not greater than, those which have to be faced in any other part of the world. If the honorable member reads the history of our own race, he will see that, during the last seventy or eighty years, its progress in civilization is without parallel. All that statesmen and philanthropists could do has been done to turn the face of the unfortunates towards the sunlight. </para>

                        <para>- There is a great difference of opinion on the subject. Honorable members opposite have not a monopoly of humanitarianism. They are not the only persons who desire the improvement of our social conditions. They talk as if they monopolized all virtue and all goodness, and their strong, and almost violent, feeling for reform certainly ought to augur well for the future. If their desire is to purify politics and electioneering, I shall help them with all the ardour of my nature. The Parliament of South Australia has appointed a Select Committee to inquire into the stuffing of rolls, and if the inquiry results in greater purity, and a higher sense of honour in the conduct of elections, no one will be more delighted, or gain more, than the Liberal party. </para>

                        <para>- I shall return to the point later. It is a matter in which I take a great deal of interest, and on which I hope to enlighten honorable members. They may not like the advice which I give them, but it is being offered in the best spirit. I am going to show them where they are wrong. I sympathize with them. in the position in which they find themselves, and hope that in the future better counsels will prevail, so that we may have true Liberalism, in place of a spurious Democracy. We are living in times of great political change. When the session opened, the mace had disappeared from this chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I do so only by way of illustration. It is one of the emblems of authority that have disappeared. I find no fault with what has been done. But honorable members opposite are not entirely consistent. Among those who went to the Coronation, we did not find this extreme desire to abolish everything in the way of show. I have seen in an illustrated paper the portraits of three of our present Ministers in Court dress, looking magnificent. They had a good time, and enjoyed themselves, and I am delighted that they did things well ; but their actions were not consistent with the deportment of certain members of the party at conspicuous public functions. Is the disappearance of the emblem of authority suggestive of the great change that has taken place in this Parliament in connexion with constitutional government? The power of originating a policy has been transferred from the Parliament to an irresponsible gathering of unionists outside. Responsible Ministers are to-day in a position different from that of their predecessors. The Prime Minister is merely the  chairman  of a Committee. That Committee is the Ministry, which is immediately responsible to the Caucus inside, while the whole box and dice of the Caucus is responsible to a larger Caucus outside, consisting of Labour Conferences and unions. </para>

Industrial unionism to-day has become a political machine absolutely. The paid professional organizer - the Socialist organizer - is defying and setting at naught most of the constitutionally provided means for the settlement of industrial disputes and the promotion of peace amongst the workers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member reminds me of a story of the clark days of Australia, when droughts had depleted the flocks and nearly wiped out the squatters. When the owner of a station went into the bank manager's room then he took off his hat, and was as civil as possible; but, by-and-by, in the prosperous times, as he entered the room, he spat on the carpet. The honorable member for Maranoa is just about as much afraid of the bank manager as was that squatter on his second visit. I should now like to say a few words about the referenda, of which subject I was reminded by a statement of the honorable member for Maribyrnong in his opening remarks. The honorable member referred to the district of Wakefield, and said that some members of the Liberal party on this side represented a minority of their constituents, and that I was one of those members. That is quite true. </para>

                        <para>- Do not be in a hurry. Since the last election, however, twelve months last April, the Wakefield district has been organized from end to end'; and when the referenda were taken the Labour party scored just about the same number of votes as they received at the general election, while the Liberal party received 5,500 more. Moreover, the average percentage vote of those on the roll in Wakefield topped every district in South Australia, and every district in the Commonwealth. </para>

I can assure the honorable member that the money that was employed for the referenda campaign in the district of Wakefield came from half-crowns and five shillings a great deal more than from pounds. I was in one of the townships one day when one farmer, more generous and more considerate than the rest, said, " What is the good of organizing if you don't do like the Labour fellows do - make the farmers pay up?" He said to a farmer alongside him, "How much did you pay?" The other said " Five bob." " Why," said the first, " I pay five bob to register my dog, and surely I am better than my dog."

On a sheep-farm there were only five shearers, and there would not be many rouseabouts required for them, but the owners sent away last week a cheque for £25 2s., which these men had to pay.

                <para class="block">In spite of all the talk by the Attorney-General, particularly in Adelaide, about sums varying from £70,000 to £100,000 being subscribed to defeat the referenda, I do not know where the money was, but I do know that the greatest difficulty experienced by the Liberal party in South Australia is to get money, and to make the men pay who ought to pay. If it had not been for organized effort, and for small subscriptions of 2s. 6d. and 5s., we should have been without money almost altogether, because large contributions are very infrequent. On the other hand, the money that the unions of Australia raise is simply fabulous, and it is raised under compulsion. Why are not honorable members opposite sports enough to take their licking over the referenda like men, instead of growling like bears with sore backs? They practised so much bluff when the result was announced that one would think it would all be exhausted by now. All sorts of reasons have been advanced why the referenda were decided against them. When it was all over they said they never expected to win, but on the morning of the poll in Adelaide a Labour senator said to a friend of mine in the House of Assembly, who is known to the Minister of Home Affairs, " I will bet you a fiver that we beat you to-day by 30,000. votes." I do not understand odds or betting, but I said to my friend, the member of the State House, " You take it on, and I will have a bit of it." It was simply by-play for them to say they did not expect to win, and there was evidence when the numbers went up at night that they had had a bigger shock than the Prime Minister talked about when he said that Australia would fall down with fright, because we could not find them, and next morning they were not to be seen at all. Another excuse put forward is that the Labour party were disunited on the question. It was not the fault of the Labour party if they were, because the slipper was applied wherever possible. In any case, that pretext could not be advanced in South Australia. In that State there was a Labour Government in power standing behind the Federal Government, and supporting it right up to the hilt, and every Labour Minister and Labour member of Parliament, and a lot of others, were stumping the country night and day for about eight weeks. Another little incident that shows that they expected to win is this : I think it was the Commissioner of Crown </para>
                <para class="block">Lands and Treasurer, who was coming through Balaklava on the morning before the election. I was on the platform, and a few of his supporters were there to see him off. "Good-bye," he -said, "Australia will be a glorious country after Wednesday." And so it was - it was still free. I have heard a good deal about the fibs that were told. I do not like the word " lie," but one honorable member opposite said there was a good deal of lying on the other side. That is another bit of bluff, and I fancy the honorable member who used it had his tongue in his cheek all the time. If one wished to hear two policies on the referenda, one had only to listen to some of the Socialists when speaking to the farmers and to others who, as the honorable member for Maranoa described it, were on " the gin case " in the Park Lands and in the Square enlightening the people on the question. The honorable member for Parkes originated the description of honorable members being on " the tar barrel " ; it remained for the honorable member for Maranoa to speak of " gin-case stumping." </para>

                        <para>- I never heard the expression until it was used last week by the honorable member. I do not wish to appear as saying uncharitable things, because I am too charitable and too kindly in my feelings towards my honorable friends opposite to do so. But examine the statement of Labour Ministers on the referenda proposals and see what they were like. There was never a more inadequate explanation given of a big question in the political history of Australia than that of Federal Ministers on their referenda proposals. </para>

                        <para>- I did not growl about the misrepresentation of Ministers. I complained only that they did not tell half the truth. Some of the statements made by the rank and file, and particularly the " tar-barrel " statements in the Park Lands, were a tribute to the inventive genius of the speakers. Generally speaking, when they endeavoured to deal with the subject-matter they piled on the agony about awful monopolies that did not exist to anything like the extent described by them. They talked also about the United States and other countries, and, in short, of everything under the sun except the conditions obtaining in Australia. They did the sentimental business as if they were  to  the manner born, and played to a very large extent on the sentiments of the people. Responsible Ministers might reasonably have been expected to give a definite interpretation of what was involved in their proposals, but they did not do so. They talked about monopolies- </para>

                        <para>- Of monopolies mostly in America rather than here, because some of the monopolies in Australia that were talked about by members of the Labour Ministry had received, in days gone-by, the blessing and benediction of some of the self-same Ministry. They did not tell the people that ; but I did. I quoted their cases, and complimented them for saying what they did. Then, again, the responsible policy and the after policy were two different things. </para>

                        <para>- As tar as I knew it. Responsible Ministers did not tell the people how far their proposals would go in competition, side by side with State authority, until they had monopolized and cribbed everything co-ordinate with State authority, which meant according to. -our Constitution, the State authority becoming effete. They did not dwell on the inclusion of railway servants, and a thousand-and-one other matters which meant taking the whole inside out of the Federal Constitution, and giving us a mere sham and apology for the Federal union that the people of Australia had fought for and accepted. The reason why the Labour party went down was that they were too impatient of reform. Led, I believe, by their Attorney-General, they were too greedy, and " bit off a great deal more than they could chew." That was the whole trouble. It was not that the people of Australia were misinformed, but rather that, when they were properly informed - when they understood the truth and the whole bearing of the proposals - the congest was over. The victory was absolutely assured. </para>

                        <para>- A perfect cyclone. My honorable friends opposite say. again, that it was owing to the disaffection of the Labour party ; that they could not keep the party intact, and that Labourites left the party in all directions, and voted on the other side. I do not believe that that is correct. The supporters of the Labour party are too loyal to do that. Whilst a considerable number certainly did vote with us by far the greater number, who did not believe in the referenda proposals, and would not be whipped into voting for them, simply stayed at home and refrained from voting. The enormous majority against the referenda proposals - a majority that staggered all Australia - was got by arousing the indifferent people of the Commonwealth and bringing them to the poll, or by the more perfect organizations in which the Labour party themselves took a hand, doing really more for us than we did ourselves, notwithstanding that we did all that -we possibly could. </para>

                        <para>- He said so. like a man. Another reason for the failure of the referenda proposals is that the Labour party to-day is not what the Labour party was ten or fifteen years ago. There has been a good deal of crowing about their success of eighteen months ago. The Australian people then said of the Labour party, " We will give these men a chance, and see how they can manage public affairs." The Labour party got a chance and showed unmistakably and immediately that they were not independent men in managing the affairs of this great continent. When the people of Australia found that, concurrently with the advent of a Labour Government in the National Parliament and of Labour Governments in some of the States, there came a period of industrial unrest that increased day by day, and has been increasing ever since- </para>

                        <para>- There is no nonsense about it. When it was seen that representatives of the people, were, in many instances, inciting encouraging and supporting, both by voice and by active help, an open defiance of constitutionally provided measures for settling labour disputes, then the people revised their opinion about the Labour party as an administrative force in the government of the country. And that is largely the reason why the people of Australia refused to give the Federal Parliament practically unlimited power, and to take power away from the State Governments. I can assure my honorable friend, the Minister of External Affairs, that he is looked upon as quite a paragon of excellence, and that there is a great deal of sympathy with him because he is in such bad company. If he were on the Liberal side, he would be an exceedingly popular man. He is not the only man of his party who is possessed of a virtuous desire to do right, though others with whom he is associated will not let him. </para>

                        <para>- There are fifty reasons for strikes in Great Britain to one which exists in Australia. I sympathize with the workers of that country. I do not sympathize with the revolutionary practices of some people there; but I do with a great number of the struggling workers in their aspiration for better conditions of life than they have had up to date. 1 have been led off my track, and have taken up more time than I intended on the referenda proposals. I wish to come to the industrial question, and to say this : There is no question now engaging public attention in Australia, or that has ever engaged public attention here, that is of greater moment than the industrial question. I regret exceedingly that so many of my honorable friends opposite are so impatient of reform, and are apparently so wanting in loyalty to the provisions which the Legislature provides for the workers of Australia for bettering their condition. We had thought that the old barbarous method of the strike was to be a thing of the past when Arbitration Courts were established. </para>

                        <para>- A great many of them did not, and would not, and you could not whip them into doing so. I heard one of the workers in Victoria say that no blessing had ever been conferred upon the working men in this State equal to that of the Wages Boards, and that they had done more for the workmen than every strike that had taken place since the year one. The records confirm that statement. There is no getting away from the fact. </para>

                        <para>- I advise my honorable friends to leave the rural districts alone. They are very well able to take care of themselves. Moreover, I may tell' them that the position of workmen in the rural districts is such that they are able to put away more money in the savings banks every year than are the workers in the metropolitan districts. I know that for a fact, and it is the case, not only in Victoria, but throughout the Commonwealth. This industrial question, however, does not simply affect the employes and employers of one State. It affects our national industries, and through them it affects this nation. The time has come when this business will have to be tackled very seriously, and when the people of Australia have a right to expect more loyalty to the law for settling industrial disputes from, the representatives of- the workers in Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I like to give people a little credit for honesty. I met a man the other day in a certain State where a Labour Government came into power twelve months previously. The Premier's name being mentioned, he said to me, "Is he not a blooming wonder?" I said, "What is wrong with him?" He replied, " From the very moment when he came into power God Almighty smiled on this country, and He has been smiling on it ever since." This man really believed that, and he was so happy in his charming simplicity that I would not disturb his ideas for the world. The point is this : It is time that we began to realize that three out of four strikes in recent times have been mischievous and absolutely unjustifiable. It is right that men's wages should be high, and that they should participate in the general prosperity. They have been participating in it. </para>

                        <para>- If they have not been participating sufficiently, let us get to the reason for that, following sound economic lines. If the wage-earners have had their remuneration increased in some instances - in some trades twice and three times, and properly so, let me ask this question : Is the wage-earner, as a rule, giving a fair return for these increased wages ? Is he working as he did when his wages were very much lower? </para>

                        <para>- I should not like to say that the honorable member is giving a better return. He had better refund the extra money. But I am not going to be side-tracked from this point. If the wage-earners have had their remuneration increased as they were entitled to do, are they, on their part, loyal to their industries, and are they giving as much of their labour for the increased wages as they used to give for lower wages ? I want to know, because I want to tell honorable members opposite this : I recognise that we have a high Tariff in operation, and that a great many honorable members who are not high Tariff advocates have agreed to  give it a fair trial as a means of promoting the industries of Australia. But if, in spite of that generously high Tariff, the increased wages granted to our workmen from time to time are attended by lesser production, there is trouble ahead for the industries of the Commonwealth. I know that the people of Melbourne, more than those of any other city, are very sensitive in regard to their industries, and in every step that we take we must remember that we have not to recklessly destroy our industries by neglecting to secure a fair deal all round. But I do not hear any response from my honorable friends opposite when I ask if the pace is slackening? </para>

He then deals with the coercive principles of Socialism which are put forward in the name of Democracy, and he adds that it is a false and spurious Democracy.

                    <para>They attack a conception of democracy which is true, in its every aspect, in the hope that they may enthrone in its stead a democracy which is false and futile. They begin by playing on the term " labour." Taking note of the fact that the world's workers constitute all but an insignificant remnant of the world's citizenship, they would set one form of labour against another, and confuse and confound the meaning of the term "labour" itself. All the world over, these mischief-makers, when they put forth an academic theory, use the term " labour " in a way to include every form of productive activity. for that purpose the inventor, the overseer, the manager, the guide and inspirer of an undertaking, is a labourer ; but when from the height of academic theory they come down to the plane of popular agitation, then they make the term "labour" apply to manual labour alone. It is true that leading economic writers themselves are responsible for the widespread confusion between these two uses of the term " labour." As a matter of fact, ordinary manual labour is just the opposite of what the Socialist supposes it to be. Instead of it being the sole instrument in the production of wealth, as the modern world knows wealth, it is a subordinate element in that production. Manual labour is always essential, to be sure; but manual labour alone does not now produce, nor has it ever produced, much more than a mere minimum of subsistence. All of the increment in production which has made the modern world possible is due to the directing faculty, to the capacity to organize, to manage, and to apply. These powers and capacities operate both through labour and through capital. Therefore, to attempt to substitute the mob for the people, manual labour for labour in all its forms, and economic equality for liberty, is to destroy all those institutions and accomplishments upon which man's progress has rested for three thousand years, and which man's progress during that period has developed and applied in so astounding a fashion. </para>

                        <para>- Those who are responsible for teaching the workers have led them to believe that they are practically everything in the matter of production. By encouraging strikes, they are destroying Australian industries; and if the worker will not give improved service for the advanced wages which he receives, he will be simply cutting his own throat. He will drive the industries of Australia across the seas. I shall give one illustration which is universally recognised. I take the bricklaying industry, and say that it is known, and not only in Australia, that the average bricklayer does not lay much more than half the number of bricks he used to lay. </para>

                        <para>- I have just said that it is, and I should add that bricklayers get several shillings a day more pay than they used to get years ago. There are men who to-day lay as many bricks as they used to lay before, but they are laying them for themselves. They are their own masters, and they are doing the work without turning a hair. I am intensely in earnest in this contention, but, to satisfy honorable members opposite, let me  say that it is alleged that a bricklayer does not lay much more than one-half the number of bricks he used to lay some time ago for several shillings a day less wages. A bricklayer can get almost any wages now upto£1 per day, and even more to go to the country. </para>

                        <para>- Bricklayers can get£1 per day to go into the country in South Australia, and cannot be obtained at that wage. I believe that one Victorian contractor, who has a big work in hand in South Australia, is paying some men 25s. per day for bricklaying. He says that two of these men will lay more bricks in a day than any three of the others, and it therefore pays him to give them higher wages. </para>

                        <para>- That statement needs qualification. As good a class of brickwork was done twenty years ago as is done to-day, and as good bricks were burnt twenty years ago as are made to-day. But, assuming that better bricks are made to-day, it must be remembered that it is easier to lay good bricks than bad bricks, because there is less work in handling good material than in handling inferior material. If there is any truth in what is alleged, it is as well that those who are responsible for teaching the workers of Australia should know that they are not only damaging the national industries, but their own interests, since they are merely playing into the hands of industrial countries across the seas that are getting a bigger return from labour. Let me tell honorable members, however, that this is part and parcel of the principle of Socialism as opposed to the principles of true Democracy. What is the principle of Socialism? It is to bring every man down to the level of the average. </para>

                        speaks with a frankness that is unusual in a politician, for he openly demands that Labour Ministries shall make no pretence of national responsibility, but shall bow the knee to- the Trades Unions only.

                    <para>He asks that the unionists shall be elevated into a privileged class without any further consideration. " They wanted preference to unionists generally, and not at the discretion of a Wages Board or of any Judge." This attitude of class selfishness is usually denied by the Labour party in theory, though consistently adopted in practice, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> imprudently tells the plain truth. Labour Ministries must be considered as representatives of the trades unions and not of the people, and it is not the people but the trades unions who are to look to the Ministry for aid. At the same time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> being in a strong and numerous union, bitterly dislikes the presence of the smaller unions in the Labour machine. The wirepuller and boss of a big organization wants to crush the weaker unions on his own side. </para>

                        <para>- It was said while the Minister of External Affairs was in England, and it was reported in all the newspapers of Australia. I suppose that my honorable friends on the other side have told the Minister of it long ago. A number of remarkable events happened while he was away. A similar statement was made at Lithgow the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen,</inline> a trades unionist. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the statement was made in connexion with the Lithgow strike. I apologize sincerely if I was wrong as to the place where the statement was made, but I am not wrong as to the statement itself. If it was made at the Melbourne Trades Hall, as the honorable member has interjected, it must have been circulated much more effectively than if it had been made at Lithgow. If my honorable friends want to serve Australian industries there must be fair dealing all round. These strikes will have to come to an end. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend disputed one statement I made, and so I mentioned another name. I do not accept the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> is not a real good employer. These matters need to be looked into, because the Commonwealth is paying a bonus for the protection of an Australian industry. In Adelaide the trade unionists are getting a bit of grace after all, and it is about time that they did. This very day, I think, a Labour Government in South Australia, is introducing a Bill to make a strike illegal - and it is about time that it was done - until the parties concerned have submitted their dispute to and received the award of a properly constituted tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and the danger is that the unions may so nullify that help that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> may one of these days, from the factory he has established in England, send agricultural machinery to Australia for distribution. Why was the iron-workers' strike in Melbourne entered upon? Because it was confined to this State, the unions persuaded the poor, simple unionists at Gawler, South Australia, where there was no dispute, to knock off one day and go to work next morning, in order to create an Inter-State dispute, enabling the unions to get to a certain Court. The real reason for the iron-workers' strike in Victoria was that the unionists would not work alongside free labourers. In the Sunshine factory there were only eleven free labourers when the unionists went out. The latter lost tens of thousands of pounds in wages, and every one knows the distress which obtained in the homes, particularly among the wives and children. Then the unionists went back to work alongside 600 non-unionists. </para>

There is not only the evidence furnished in Adelaide in connexion with the drivers' strike, which constitutes the blackest page of Australia's industrial history. We have also the evidence of the strike at Renmark, which was attended by even aggravated circumstances, and which was due to irresponsible paid agitators. </para>

                        <para>- I am laying the blame wherever it should rest. There is another matter which has arrested the attention of Australia, and it is similar to many instances which operated at the referendum against extending the power of Labour in the National Parliament. When he was Acting-Prime Minister a little while ago, the Attorney-General was also president of the Waterside- Workers' Union, which occupies a strategic position as regards determining the fate of almost any industry in the country. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know the particulars to which my honorable friend refers, but I know that no Attorney-General, either in the Commonwealth or in a State, ought to be an active president of an industrial union, particularly when industrial unions are engaged in strikes, because he is in a position to practically direct strike operations. Do my honorable friends on the other side wonder that the people of Australia are rebelling against this kind of thing? They said eighteen months ago, " We will give the Labour party a show." They gave the party a show, and they say to-day, " We have had enough of it," and no wonder, either. A very considerable proportion of the steady, solid-thinking, honest unionists of Australia are sick of this business. These strikes are not determined by them, and, nine times out of ten, if their real opinion were obtained by means of a secret ballot, there would be no trouble. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General, during the referenda campaign, told the people that the Labour proposals were necessitated by the existence of monopolies like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; but he did not tell them that the Deakin Government had proposed to appoint a Commission which would be non-political and independent, consisting of a Judge, as  President,  and two of the best experts obtainable, which would go to the root of the matter in its investigation of conditions, obtaining the views of growers and refiners, of workmen in the fields and in the mills, and "of all connected with the industry. What was intended was a thorough and unbiased investigation, in order to obtain a report which would enable the solution to be found to a problem which this House, as constituted, cannot solve. It is not the division of the House into Labour members and Liberal members, but the domination of the sugar interest in Queensland, that makes it impossible for us to solve the question. The appointment of the proposed Commission would have removed an awkward and ugly question from -Parliament, and would have saved us the -trouble of dealing with the industry until  we knew the exact facts, and particularly  the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. What we desire to know is how -much of the profits appearing on the company's annual balance-sheet are derived from its Australian business ; its profits from other ventures are no concern of ours. But the Labour Government, on coming into POWer, abandoned the Commission. The only solution of the present difficulty is to do what the Deakin Government proposed to do, and what the Prime Minister, after a delay of fifteen months, has now promised to do. I wish to know whether the promised Commission will be non-parliamentary or non-political? </para>

We are not ready to support the industry as it is being supported unless the whole truth is laid bare, and we know that the industry is beneficial to Australia, and not one which only produces a sovereign by means of an expenditure of  22s.  6d. It is in the interests of the workers of Queensland, and of the whole Commonwealth, that a proper inquiry be made. </para>

                        <para>- It is because I know nothing  Qf  the conditions of the sugar industry that I ask for the appointment of a competent Commission of Inquiry. The report of a political Commission would have no influence with me. But it is playing the fool with the sugar industry not to provide Parliament with the best information obtainable regarding it. The people should know that the trouble in connexion with the industry would, in all probability, have been settled now, had not the Labour Government refused to appoint a Commission, although pressed to do so by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B, Edwards, among others on this side, and some of its supporters representing Queensland electorates. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards</inline> made a speech on the question which showed considerable knowledge of the industry and of the industries connected with it. The appointment of a Commission is now promised by the Government. I hope that the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission will prove, not only in name, but in effect, non-parliamentary and non-political so far as party is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Some of the women of the League would, I think, put many of the honorable members opposite to shame for really good work in many directions. Immigration is, perhaps, next in importance to the industrial question. In my opinion, the industrial question is first and foremost ; and we must end the present industrial unrest. If the arbitration legislation is not what it should be, let us perfect it, and so with the Wages Boards. The best solution ever yet suggested is the extension of the Wages Board system under the proposal of the late Government to co-ordinate the work of the Boards throughout the States by means of an Inter-State Commission. </para>

                        <para>- I tell the honorable member that that would be infinitely better than a good many of the efforts made to-day, because nothing could be more futile or destructive than some of the tactics on the other side. An InterState Commission must be appointed before the Federal Constitution can give effect to its best work in the interests of the development of the country. I hope that the Government are really sincere in their immigration proposals; but I know that in this respect they have a difficult task. Immigration, with many of the trade unions, is extremely unpopular. In every State, and in every part of every State, we find unionists, at properly constituted meetings, passing resolutions in condemnation of an immigration policy, especially by a Labour Government ; and their objections simply express a fear of competition in labour and the bringing down of wages. That is a short-sighted policy, which, in a country like this, will be falsified <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the results of any effective immigration system. The workers of Canada might just as well, at the beginning of the movement there a few years ago, have raised the same objection ; but I may tell honorable members that immigration in Canada has been sustained, not so much by' the Government, as by the Pacific Railway Company. </para>

                        <para>- Australia, however, is in a different position, because here we do not believe in privately-owned railways; according to the Socialists, such railways are an evil, and yet this privately-owned railway in Canada has made that country what it is to-day. All that has been done for twenty years by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, with an able Government behind him, is infinitesimal compared with what this company has done for the settlement, development, and enrichment of Canada. The attractions of Australia are superior to those of the Dominion. An honorable member opposite, the other day, interjected that it was the high wages that attracted population from England to Canada in preference to Australia. It is true that very high wages obtain in Canada ; but that is simply a denial of the theory that immigration will bring down wages. The high rate of wages there, however, is no test, because work can be carried on for only about eight months in the year, and. in some severe winters, for only about seven months. From a producer's point of view, particularly that of the primary producers, the attractions offered by Canada are not to be compared with those offered by Australia. If there is anything that this country requires, it is more money and more men. We have the largest unpeopled area of any nation in the world, and it is the richest area of the kind. Immigration and defence are correlated, and cannot be separated. To have an effective defence, we must spend millions and millions of principal, with _a recurring expenditure of millions every year ; and, even then, we cannot keep these vacant areas of Australia, seeing that, on the highest moral plane, the strongest right of ownership is occupation and use. If we spend millions to promote a citizen soldiery and an Australian Navy, and in buying big guns, we have only half done the work ; but if, in addition to all this, we bring men to put behind the ploughs, we shall not only more effectively defend Australia, but turn these men into producers, and increase avenues of wealth production for the country generally. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the man behind the plough who produces wealth and also defends the country. If millions are to be spent as recommended in the expert reports, which are largely accepted, it will mean a burden of taxation that  4,500,000  people can never endure ; but if a vigorous immigration policy is pursued, and the population increased to  9,000,000,  then the burden will be eased by distributing it over a wider area, while making the defence more effective. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. I am glad that the honorable member has raised that point, because I can tell him that, last year,  1,000,000  emigrants went to Canada. I must say that I never heard that idea suggested before. I am sure that my honorable friend, upon  reflection,  will admit that where one person comes to Australia fifty go to Canada. But the tide of immigration into Canada has been increasing at such an enormous rate that it has overtaken, for the present, the demand, and I believe, in the very, near future, there will be a check to that inflow. When that check sets in, Australia will have its opportunity. Do not let us be misled. Little has been done up to date to encourage and promote immigration to </para>

                        <para>- That is why the Labour Government dare not do anything in that direction. But, after all, the chartering of a vessel does not mean Socialism. The Government have refrained from taking action because they are afraid the forces outside would stop them. That is a very serious position for Australia. There is not a Labour Government in any of the States that is attending effectively to this work. Why do not the Labour Ministry show their independence, courage, and statesmanship, by trying to convince the unions existing in Australia that the right thing to do is to encourage immigration? If they did that, the unions would make kings of them, instead of humiliating them, as they have done, by passing resolutions regarding Governments that they cannot trust. I do not say this offensively, because what obtains in regard to the Federal Labour Government in this connexion is obtaining in regard to Labour Governments in the several States. Any effective action taken to encourage immigration has been confined to States where Labour is not in power. That is the position in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I think of Western Australia when I have in mind the great future of the Commonwealth. Western Australia has a great future before it, and, in order to make that future, it needs immigrants, and is getting them. Despite all the trades unions in Australia which oppose immigration, immigrants are coming to Australia. The country is so good that it will advertise itself. </para>

                        <para>- Then, I know that the honorable member will have indoctrinated them with some of that awful Socialism which is unlikely to be of any service to them, and possibly they would have been better men if they had not come in contact with him. "Evil communications corrupt good manners," and in view of the industrial disturbances in the Old Country of late I am inclined to think that the workers there have been assimilating some Australian ideas. I am afraid that some of my Socialist friends from the Dominion Parliament have been putting them up to a trick or two. </para>

                <para class="block">I am that, on great questions which ought to be free from party considerations, we shall all put aside our party differences. We should all try to settle these great industrial questions. Sacrifices have to be made. Let them be made. Let us come to some solution of the problem. Surely it is to be solved. Let us come to that solution as soon as possible, and let us come to it on fair and square grounds. Let us understand for all time that "what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander," and that on both sides men must be amenable to the law. They must be amenable to the provisions passed by the representatives of the people with their concurrence - because they must have been passed with their concurrence if the Parliament represents the people. Let us endeavour to pass provisions which will give the worker his fair due, and also protect the industries of Australia. In the future the biggest nation will be the nation that is industrially strong. The industrial question in the future is going to be all important. So far as power and influence is concerned the nation which is industrially strong will be even bigger than that which has the largest armament or the biggest navy. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Some of my honorable friends opposite have been talking about arbitration. There is -not one of us who, in his heart, would not rejoice if the time were to come when the nations would settle all great international disputes hy arbitration, and when the awful expenditure in keeping up armaments could be reduced very considerably. But in the meantime we have to accept tie position as it stands. We have, as Australians, to trust in God, keep our powder dry, and keep plenty of it in stock. But industrialism is going to make us strong as a nation. We, as a country, have a heritage greater than has any other nation. No other nation has such an opportunity. Let us make the best of it, and then those who come after us, if we have done our duty, will give us their blessing, rather than their curse. </para>
