                        <para>Queensland is full up. This great continent is crying  out for people, and there are not snips enough to carry those who want to come, yet Queensland has actually asked that agricultural immigrants from Russian Siberia should be warned off. The Russian Consul in Melbourne waited on me to-day concerning some of these immigrants. He stated that the Consul in Brisbane had been informed by the Queensland Government that the immigration depots were full, and had been asked to stay the immigrants from Russia and Siberia. </para>

                        <para>- The statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is correct with this exception, that it was the Vice-Consul and not the Consul for Russia who called on me. He informed me that a number of Russian immigrants have been going to Queensland for some time past, but that the Consul there has been notified by the State Government that, as the immigration depots are required for immigrants coming from Great Britain, it would be glad if he would take steps to prevent further immigrants coming from Siberia. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in an amiable frame of mind this morning, and do not intend to say anything that will hurt the feelings of honorable members opposite. We all seem to be in a. rollicking mood after the moving events pf yesterday, and apparently there is no disposition to trouble about Budgets and such things as natijortal expenditure, which, after all, would seem  to be only trifles light as air compared with what took place yesterday. However, we must come back to sober reason and look into the Budget, since it affects every man, woman, and child in the community to a very vital degree. I shall ask&#39; honorable members this morning to consider one or two of its financial aspects, away from the heat of party conflict, and with a desire only to see exactly where we are  going and whether it is not time to call a halt in the extravagant manner in which we are disposing of the national funds. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I take it that when taxation is imposed the reason for it should be well established, but the outstanding feature of this Budget, in its accounts of last year at any rate, is that taxation has been imposed which was not needed, and taxes have been brought into the Treasury to be put into Trust Funds for use in years other than that in which they were raised. In that respect this Parliament is setting a precedent to all the Parliaments of Australia, and even, I think, of the world. This is the first time that I recollect taxation having been imposed in a time of rolling prosperity to meet the demands of the year, and the whole of it being diverted to years other than that in which it was raised. In other words, this Budget shows a surplus of _&#163;2, 000,000 last year. We were previously told that land taxation was needed for purposes of revenue, and the Prime Minister altogether discarded the idea that he wanted to. impose it for penal purposes or for purposes of social experiment. He said, &#34; I need the revenue,&#34; but the year&#39;s operations, show that he did not need it, nor did he use it, because that and a great deal more has been put into a trust fund and specially appropriated this year. In order that there may be no mistake about that matter, I have here the record of what the Prime Minister said when introducing the Land Tax Bill. The honorable member for Angas asked him why, since he did not expect much revenue from the Bill, he did not combine an acreage tax with a value tax, and to that the F&#39;rime Minister replied - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I .hope the honorable member is not under that delusion, because I do desire revenue, and I have never uttered a word to&#39; the contrary. &#39;Honorable members will see that the taxation applies, not only to large estates, but to city ana town areas, and therefore could not be justified alone on the ground of breaking up large estates. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">There is the explicit statement of the Prime Minister, when introducing the land tax last year, that his revenue needed it. The result shows that he woefully, I had almost said wilfully, under-estimated his receipts for the year. It is about time to say something on this question of under-estimating revenue. It is just as criminal to underestimate your revenue intentionally for the purpose of imposing penal taxation as to over-estimate it in order to avoid taxation. The one is just as reprehensible as the other, yet this Government, in a time of rolling prosperity, imposed taxation unnecessarily. </para>
                <para>This is the first time in the history of any civilized Government that we have had a Government bringing down propositions for special taxation when the country has been on a boom tide of prosperity. It is the first time that a Government have brought down proposals for taxation to meet the ordinary needs of a normal year of expenditure. In that respect therefore the Government are creating precedents, and are being followed now, in New South Wales in particular, by a Government actuated by the same ideas. The Government there are bringing down taxation for the mere sake of putting on a tax, and not because they need the revenue, just as we do not need it here. They are imposing the tax with a penal object in view, in order to hit savagely at a section of the community, under cover of needing the revenue for the ordinary purposes of government. </para>

                        <para>Freight s and fares in booming, prosperous times are generally reduced without the imposition of extra taxation. What merit is there in im- . posing additional taxation in order to cut down charges and decrease the revenue in other respects? That is not statesmanship, but simply taking from one section of the community to give to another—th every essence of class Government.</para>

                        <para>It is the very perfection of statesmanship, so long as the taxation is fairly and equitably adjusted amongst all classes, and so long as the object is to make the principle of sacrifice apply to every individual in the community in proportion to his ability to pay it. That is the fundamental principle which ought to underlie all taxation. But is that the case here?</para>

                        <para>I should have thought that, after the tongue-wagging in which my honorable friends opposite have been engaged all the week, they would have been quite tired this morning, but here they are, as fresh as paint, notwithstanding what befel them yesterday. I repeat that this is the first time in the history of any country that I know of, when, at a period of booming prosperity, special taxation has been levied for the ordinary purposes of Government. Usually at such a time surpluses are supposed to be accumulating by reason of the buoyancy of the ordinary revenue; and it is the opportunity to reduce the charges on the people. Yet, in two or three of the States, as well as in the Commonwealth an d in the States where labour Governments are reigning—i t is supposed to be in acordance with their canons of taxation to place imposts on the people when prosperity is at its highest. We should remember that every pound we put into circulation now creates a vested interest for itself; and, later on,' when the revenues begin to decline, as they will do. in- the lean years, we shall have exhausted our reserves of taxation, and will find the vested interests the most difficult problem of all to deal with. In my judgment there is a very serious time ahead of the Commonwealth; and I say that in no Cassandra spirit. There is every indication that the years are beginning to turn, arid both the Prime Minister and myself regret the fact.</para>

                        <para>It is not for us on this side to " cheer up " ; honorable members opposite may have occasion to "cheer up " themselves before this Parliament expires. The Government would not get through this year but for borrowing money - from previous years to pay present bills; they are drawing on their capital in a time of prosperity, and, with all the land taxation, they have to borrow ,£1,750,000 from last year to pay the bills of this year. If that happened in connexion with any outside business, the shareholders would ask whether it was not time to wind up or have different management.</para>

                        <para>Quite right; though, happily, or unhappily, for us, it does not " wind up " the condition of affairs in this Parliament—the Labour party are here just as jaunty as ever! Let us hope that what has taken place will lead to a little sober reflection, so far as the finances of the Commonwealth are concerned, and cause the Government to look ahead of the immediate present to that inevitable time when there will be greater stringency in our revenue. But even if there be no greater stringency, and next year is an equally booming period, we must look for a certain deficit of ,£2,000,000.</para>

                        <para>The Honorary Minister need not be insulting; he is somewhat like myself—whe n he tries to be humorous he becomes anything else. I do not claim any authorship for the principle, but merely quote it as one laid down by Mr. McGowen. The second principle is that no Government has a right to collect taxation unless it can be shown that necessity demands it.</para>

                        <para>Has necessity been shown for the increased taxation now being collected? I am aware that a brave effort in this direction is being made both by this Government and the Governments of the States where Labour rule obtains; but an analysis of the expenditure shows that they are creating artificial needs in order to justify the imposts on the people—tha t the money is not required for the ordinary purposes of government within the year.</para>

                        <para>I shall leave that point, as honorable members opposite do not seem to care about it. I do say, however, that incorrect statements have been made in this House, and incorrect statements are being made to other Houses in Australia, for the purpose of justifying penal taxation, and for no other purpose. We are creating vested interests in out expenditure, which will push us further next year. As sure as we are living today, there are financial difficulties looming ahead, which we shall be unable to sur-mount without further taxation or the most drastic retrenchment next year.</para>

                        <para>I do not see how they can spend £[4,500,000 in six months. So far as we know, the Government have never spent even £[2,000,000 in a similar period; and a great deal of the money we are now voting will fall back into the Treasury at the end of the year. It is not fair that the Estimates should be inflated on the one hand or depressed on the other.</para>

                        <para>I say that a Treasurer who under-estimates his revenue to the extent of £[2,000,000, and on that estimate bases further taxation, ought not to hold his seat ten minutes in any civilized community. With the small population of Australia, it is a crime against the people of the country to wrongly under-estimate the revenue for the purpose of justifying further taxation.</para>

                        <para>If the honorable member, by putting words into my mouth, wishes me to indicate that the Prime Minister tried to delude the House, I say no. The honorable member can see only one thing, and that is always something ulterior. I am charging the Treasurer with culpable inability to size up the financial -affairs of the country. Does the honorable member understand that? That is different from imputing unworthy motives.</para>

                        <para>I say that the Treasurer who under-estimates his revenue to the extent of £[2,000,000, and on that estimate imposes further taxation, is not the man to hold the position of Treasurer in any country. It is just as bad to under-! estimate as to over-estimate revenue, especially when we run into big figures like these.</para>

                        <para>The Treasurer's estimate was £[500,000 below the actual receipts. I shall not deal further with that point, but I wish to make it clear that it is time we stopped under-estimating our revenues to the scandalous extent that we have been doing of recent years, and that it is more than ever necessary that we should do so now that we are making that underestimate of revenue a basis for wringing further taxes out of the people.</para>

                    <para>I invite the attention of honorable members to the very serious fact that the taxation of this country during the last ten years has gone up enormously. In 1901-2 Commonwealth taxation amounted to £[2 5s. 5fd. per head — I am referring to taxation alone, not to services or charges—whereas , according to the Estimates it will amount to £[3 9s. 1d . per head for 1911-12, or an increase of £[1 3s. 8d. per head in respect of every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. If we add to that the increase of State taxation to the tune of 6s. per head, we find that in ten years our taxation has increased by practically 30s. per head.</para>

Mr. Fell is a competent accountant, and a friendly one, so far as my honorable friends opposite are concerned, and he showed that our taxation was much heavier than that of the Old Country, Germany, and nearly every .European country.</para>

Even if he includes local taxation in the taxation of -the Old Country, the honorable member will find that our taxation is quite as high as that of Great Britain.

                        <para>It includes everything. The cost in 1906-7 was £[36,250,857, whereas this year it amounts to £[56,006,021, an increase of practically £[20,000,000. In other words, there has been an increase of 55 per cent, in five years, and the population during that time has increased by only 10\ per cent. I do not wish to draw a wrong inference from these figures. I do not mean to suggest that it is costing 55 per cent, more to govern this country than it did five years ago. A great part of this increase is due to the increased prosperity of the country, and some of it to increase of population. But we have the significant fact that the expenditure is equal to the revenues. That is the ugly fact we have to face. While we are spending 55 per cent, more than we did five years ago, we are spending more this year in almost every State than we are raising; and during this five years' period, the increase of population has 'amounted to only ioj- per cent. I am able now to give the honorable member for Hindmarsh the figures relating to tiie taxation of other countries, to which I referred a few moments ago. Here is what Mr. Fell said the other day, and it is very interesting as bearing on this question—</para>

                        <para>I am inclined to think that they do not include some forms of local government. I looked up the matter some time ago, and quoted in this House figures showing that even including local government, our taxation is some shillings per head more than is that of the Old Country. I do not pretend to make any adjustment. I merely quote' these as the figures of a critic friendly to this Government, and they may be taken for what they are worth. I shall establish my point if I ask honorable members to look into this question of the increased cost of government. I am not talking now of any of my honorable friends' Socialistic ventures. I am talking of taxation pure and simple, which has in Australia increased in ten years, as I have said,' to the extent of £[1 9s. 8d. per head. That is a very serious matter for the working men and women of Australia, who have to pay this taxation, and who are already beginning to ask why the cost of everything they eat and drink and use is increasing.</para>

                        <para>May I remind my honorable friend that, of the increased taxation to which I have referred, only 6s. per head represents the land tax. I have heard him say many times in this House that by taxing the people we hinder and injure rather than help them. He tells now a very different tale. Taxation is going up by leaps and bounds, yet we are already in financial difficulties. In these rolling times, we are borrowing money to pay our way in respect of the present year. In other words, we are using money that we have been able to save up by means of special taxation. There is no danger of the Government making savings from their ordinary revenues. They impose extra taxes and secure a surplus; and, out of last year's surplus, we are paying our way this year.</para>

                        <para>—That would have been too sensible a procedure for this Government. 'Every Government in the world borrows for reproductive works and works of a permanent character. Great Britain provides for new naval bases, large docks, and works of that character, not out of revenue, but out of loan money. My honorable friends are not following precedents. They are making them. But the people are already beginning to wonder why so much taxation is needed, and the Labour party will have short shrift when the truth becomes known. At present honorable members opposite are living a merry life, and recklessly spending millions obtained by taxation.</para>

                    <para>I wish to say a word or two regarding the Department of the Postmaster-General, which is seething with discontent. Strong feeling .is rife there; public services are being curtailed, mail deliveries and other privileges are being taken from the public, but the more we spend on the Department, the less efficient it seems to be. It is time that the matter was looked into. This year we shall incur a deficit in connexion with the Department of ^2,000,000, or, deducting a year's interest, £[1,750,000. The Department has been a very costly one, and has not paid its way since it was taken over by the Commonwealth. Although we are told that for eleven years the receipts exceeded the expenditure by £[1,797,000, the statement is misleading. A private company might just as well say that, putting out of account wages and charges, its. operations showed a profit. The Department of the Postmaster-General' shows a profit by putting aside interest charges on expenditure upon buildings and plant and new capital. In eleven years we have expended on the Department £[4,753,000, which was not taken into account in making the statement that the receipts have exceeded the expenditure by £[1,797,000. Actually the expenditure has exceeded the receipts by £[2,956,000, or, adding interest for each year, by £[4,873,000. If we add also the £[600,000 to be put into a trust account this year for expenditure on new works, the deficit can be set down as £[5,500,000. In my judgment, the cause of the trouble is poor management, and the sooner the muddle is ended the better it will be for all concerned. I should now like to say something on the subject of management, but it may be better to defer it until we are dealing with definite proposals.</para>
                    <para>Certain honorable members opposite, and some on- this side, have made a great fuss in the belief that the States which they represent do not receive as much expenditure as they should get. We thought that we should have done with  State feeling under Federation, but it still obtrudes itself, and we hear talk of a Country party, being formed to see that the country districts get their fair share of expenditure.' To make a fair comparison, it would not be right to take only one Department. The comparison I am going to make includes the whole expenditure of the Commonwealth for the year in each State. According to the figures on page 55 of the Budget papers,, the expenditure per head in New South Wales last year was £[1 os. 3*Jd., in Victoria. 18s. ito^d., and in Queensland £[1 5s. 6jd. What' does the honorable member for Maranoa say to that ? Then Western Australia got £[1 ns. ojd. per head, South- Australia 19s. 9^d., and Tasmania, whence comes the honorable member for Franklin, £[1 os. 8£d. Apparently the States whose representatives are most clamant get the largest expenditure per head. These figures should prove a useful corrective to some of the statements that we hear.' While New South Wales receives a shilling' per head less "than the average expenditure of the Commonwealth, it contributes between 2 and 3 per cent, more revenue than the average contribution of any other State, with the. exception of Western Australia The conditions of life in the States vary, and their requirements vary, as does also their capacity to contribute revenue. It is this diversity which provides the vitality and virility of our Federation, and without differences in requirements and production we should not have the prosperity which makes Federation a success.</para>
                    <para>Regarding Defence, I have no general criticism to offer. As I have said before, I shall leave nearly all details alone so long as I find the Government contributing handsomely to the defences of the country, although the Labour party's policy is contrary to that of its confreres in the other parts of the world.</para>

                        <para>Even for defence money could be provided differently, and in a more business-like way. The outstandking fact is that we are contributing this year for. defence an amount which places us, I think, third in the entire world. The vote works out this year at 21s. id. per head, and there are no countries in the world, except Great Britain and France, with a higher expenditure on defence. From my point of view, having 'regard to the, menace that surrounds . us, that is a very satisfactory feature. ; .1 only.,'hope that honorable members opposite will 'continue in this, good .way. If they dp, '.and carry out the schemes 'which' have .been sketched for them,'and the details of which they are filling in very fully, they' will hear no more adverse criticism from me. There are, however, one or two points on which I should like to help them by offer ing detailed criticism, because I think there is a real danger ahead of the compulsory training scheme. In the first place, I must refer to the pay of the area officers, already alluded to by the honorable member for Darling Downs. According to Lord Kitchener, this matter is the key of the whole position. He lays it down that the Citizen Forces will depend for their military proficiency entirely upon the efforts of the area ofiicers. So important does he consider it that he proceeds to emphasize it in several paragraphs in these words—</para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>In this connexion, may I repeat that the whole success of the Citizen Forces depends upon the thoroughness and amount of the home training under the area officer</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In that clause are two suggestions—on e concerning the area officer, the other concerning home trainng. The '.Government are paying the area officer ^"150 a year to do work which, if well done, is worth £500 a year. That is the plain English of the situation. They are drawing the area officers from militia men, in many cases young lieutenants, who are doing their best, but who are not well enough equipped for the important work of area commands. I speak in no spirit of derogation of these men, who are doing their very utmost, but you cannot expect the best available military talent in the world for a paltry .£150 a year. It is sweating the job, and sweating of the most dangerous kind. Remember that the system of universal compulsory training is going to be marred or made in the next five years. Before the staff corps can come from the Military College, the- efficiency and tone of the Forces will have been determined. It is, therefore, of the utmost consequence that we should have in the area officers men capable and competent for all the supremely important and multifarious duties which have been placed upon them. To place the duties on young officers and others in the militia ranks is most unfair to them and to the scheme itself. The Labour Government, who believe in high salaries) are paying,£[150 a year to a man who,-if he does his work' competently, ought to be getting at least. ,£500. If I had been carrying' out that scheme,. I should have .made a definite, appointment in each case, for five years, fixed the salary at from £400. to .£500 a' year, and obtained the most competent men 1 could get from anywhere. If they are available in Australia, all right, and a good many of them are here, but we. are not tempting the. best men here into these positions. They cannot take them. ' It means an immense sacrifice for them'. I verily believe that the Government are getting more than they are paying- for, but they are not doing the best for the trainees bv the appointment of area officers at £15° a yeai.</para>
                    <para>Another point in connexion with defence concerns the training. I wish again to emphasize the fact that the Government are not carrying out Lord Kitchener's scheme. There is no provision for home training in their scheme, so far as I can find out. It is like the minimum wage. The Government have made the minimum training the maximum.. It is all the training these men will get, and it is not enough. The amount of training which was put into the Act, and which is being given, will not make the trainees' soldiers ready to meet a modern enemy.</para>

                        <para>The Government are endangering the whole scheme by the way they are setting it off. In one part of his report Lord Kitchener says the area officers are the key to the whole position, and in another he calls them the foundation of all success. Yet the Government, by not giving an adequate salary, are not getting the best men available to do the work as contemplated by Lord Kitchener. In the next five years the tone of the whole force will be set, and at the end of that time the Government will have to begin all over again to get a different state of affairs into the service.</para>

                        <para>Cursed for getting efficiency into the military service? That comes well from an honorable member who has been worrying his life out for years because of the inefficiency that prevails in another Department. Why should he condemn another honorable member for standing up for just a little efficiency in the Defence Department? The honorable member should not be so inconsistent. The matter is far too important to trifle over. In addition to well-paid area officers, there ought to be some more incentive to home training, without which the present training will not turn out soldiers efficiently equipped for service. Lord Kitchener says that everything depends upon .the home training in connexion with his scheme. The Government are departing from the scheme in that respect. Instead of home training continuously the year round, and area officers paid to devote their whole energies to their areas, 'and to bring about home training by making it attractive in every way, the Government have limited the amount of training in the Act, and made the minimum the maximum. I hope to see some improvement in both1 these matters before long. It would be far better if the Government had started boldly, at the first, obtained area officers competent to perform all the duties laid upon them, and given them at least .£400 or £500 a year to look well after the area commands.</para>

                        <para>Under Lord Kitchener's scheme, it was intended to be voluntary training, and the compulsory training was to test the value of the voluntary training. Instead of that, the Government have given more compulsory training than Lord Kitchener said was requisite; but, on the other hand, they are. hot providing for home training, upon which Lord Kitchener relied for efficiency.</para>

                        <para>—That does not much alter what I say. The party may not have discussed it collectively in caucus, but they have made the Prime Minister go back on everything that four of his Ministers said only last week. If it has not been done in caucus, it is the more reprehensible. One could understand the party insisting on a change of that sort, but if the party did not do it, who caused the change of front ?</para>

He also said a few other things not recorded in Hansard about the financial side of the matter, indicating that the Government would make a lot of money out of a site so near to Sydney; but that is all by the way. After the Minister of Home Affairs came the Postmaster-General, who, in the absence of other Ministers, I presume, seemed to be in charge of the Committee.

After four Ministers had declared that to be the best site, we find them, in three days, showing a complete reversal. Now we are told that the College is not to be placed where the experts said it should be, but must be in Federal Territory. On whose advice or authority? What later authority has come into the arrangement? I think we are entitled to ask these questions. I should like to go a little further and say that, before I left office I had this matter specially inquired into. When the offer of the Lord Mayor of Sydney was made, it was accepted conditionally on the best site being available near Sydney. Commander Pethebridge, as good a man as we could get, made investigation; and I requested Admiral Poore also to make inquiries. The latter decided, without hesitation, that of all sites Middle Head was the best. All these facts are set forth in the papers which I ask the Minister of Defence to produce, so that honorable members may know exactly what has taken place. 'We have it that two admirals decided that Middle Head was the best site for a Naval College, "for amongst other reasons, that it is near Garden Island, where we have a dockyard and engineering and construction works, which are invaluable in the training of cadets. However, nothing was done; and then came Captain Chambers, a comparatively young man from Home, and of whom I have never heard as a very distinguished Naval official. I do not desire to say a word against Captain Chambers, who, I dare say, is an excellent man. In my judgment, however, the opinions of Admiral Henderson and of Admiral Poore are at least equal to that of Captain Chambers. However, Captain Chambers, before he had been, as it were, in the country ten minutes, condemned the Middle Head site as too near Sydney. I may say that I asked Admiral Poore to inquire into that point particularly, and, while he. admitted that it would be preferable if the College were a little further away, he regarded it as a small disadvantage which could easily be balanced by the discipline of the College.</para>

                        <para>Indeed ! As to the objection that the site at Middle Head is too near town, what do we find Lord Kitchener recommending in regard to the Military College? He does not say that that College should be placed in the bush, but that it should be at the Federal Capital, which, we hope, is going to. be a populous centre in the future. In my judgment naval and military cadets ought to be able to live near a large town just as other citizens have to do. If the Spartan discipline of such a college cannot overcome the disadvantage of the proximity to town, it is a poor look out for us all. At any rate, nearly two years ago Middle Head was recommended as the best site, and, subsequently, after an expert inquiry, Burraneer Bay was selected. Three Ministers in this .House support the' Minister of Defence in that suggestion; and yet now, without rhyme oi reason, or any explanation whatever, we are told that the College ought not to be on the site recommended by experts, but on Federal Territory.</para>

                        <para>A s to suggestions that there is a strong desire on the part of honorable members on this side to supplant the present Government, I. am afraid that there would be such a " mess " to clean up as to make it extremely unlikely, for any one to hanker after the .job. _ By that" I must explain I mean nothing more than . reckless government. I have already pointed , out that on the basis of the Estimates there will have to be faced next year a deficit of ;£[2,000,000; and anybody can see what is coming. Nobody, therefore, need covet the job of correcting the mistakes, inflation, and recklessness of the various Labour Ministries of Australia. It is due to this House that the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, or the Prime Minister himself, should explain why the advice of expert Admirals is being slighted—wh y the advice of the special expert imported is being deliberately set aside in favour of a site said not to be the best. It is obligatory on the Government to explain why this sudden change has taken place in the course of three or four days. We ought to know whether our future Navy is to be shaped by political rather than by naval considerations, because this is a blow, it seems to me, at the future efficiency and strength of the Naval Forces of Australia. In these Estimates, I find that the Northern Territory this year takes from our revenues £411,060, and that there will be on the year's transactions a deficit of £[345,000 in respect of it. We are waiting for some policy of development. We have had this legacy passed over tr&#62; us now for eighteen months, and yet we do not know what we are going to do with it. We have not begun, save in a fragmentary way, to deal with this very serious problem that we have taken over from South Australia. There are proposals for the appointment of Professor Baldwin Spencer, and for the expenditure of a little more money on the investigation of tropical diseases, but we have not yet any territorial policy put before us by the Government. I do not wish to be unreasonable. I know that this is a gigantic work, that its proportions are nothing less than Titanic; but for that very reason we should have from the Ministry a full statement as to what is in their minds regarding it. Surely this is not a party question. The Minister appeals to the House for suggestions. Has he none to offer?-He is placed specially to investigate this problem, yet all we have had so far from him is' a' piteous appeal to the Opposition to give him suggestions.' It is time .the Minister gave the Committee the benefit of any, proposals he has in his mind. So far as I can see, the £[25,000 or ,£[26,000 on these Estimates for the opening, up of the Northern Territory is a mere bagatelle-compared with what will be required for an adequate" policy of development. When the Government have a proposition on which they are losing £[345,000 a year, they are only trifling with it in making proposals for tie expenditure of about £[26,000 a year to convert that debit into a surplus.</para>

                        <para>The Government are, in some respects; but this is not one of them. Wise expenditure here is simply investment. They will have to spend a great deal more in connexion with the Northern Territory, and the more lavish they make their expenditure on right and reproductive lines in the Territory the better. But we have no indication of any adequate policy maturing in the minds o'f Ministers to make this a reasonably paying proposition.</para>

                        <para>If it is to be a sink into which we shall keep pouring our money we ought to be made aware of that fact, so that we may take steps to minimize the loss. My own impression is, however, that whilst the Territory is a white man's burden, white men will be able to shoulder it, and that it can be improved by a reasonable policy of development. Without going into details, so far as I can see, the one outstanding requirement of the Territory is facilities. It needs railway facilities first of all, then roads and bridges and settlement. We shall have to take the "bloated squatter" up there, and the sooner the better.</para>

                        <para>It takes a man about a fortnight to travel from the nearest railway to a station in the Territory, and I believe that the cost of carrying supplies' to many of the stations there ranges from  £[20 to ^30 per ton. It is not the 'shilling per mile in respect of the land, but the cost of transport, that is the problem. We are confronted there with the problem of facilities and of climate. I believe a modification of the climate will come in time, but the two requirements are men who will raise stock there,' and railways, roads, and bridges to enable that stock to be taken to market. I should think that vvith our rolling seasons now is the time to begin a movement in that direction. If it be not, what are we going to do when the bad years come? They will be on us, it appears to me, before we have sketched for us any adequate policy for the development of the Territory. We need something more than a policy of detail regarding the appointment of an officer or of a medical man to investigate tropical diseases. We need a broad and complete plan of territorial development.</para>

                    <para>This year the bounties are costing us ,£703,000. Inquiries are being made with regard to the sugar industry, and very properly so. It is time, now that a policy has been effected up there, to know exactly . where and how we stand with regard to the .continuation of the bounty.</para>
                    <para>I wish now tb refer to the question of old-age pensions. For a long time I have felt that our scheme is upon a wrong footing. Old-age pensions should be lifted out of the charitable rut in which they are running. The taint of pauperism and charity should be entirely eliminated from them. Moreover the Act as administered is harsh arid irksome in every way. All sorts of inquisitorial inquiries are being made before a man is granted a pension, and the sooner that kind of thing is done away with the better.</para>

                        <para>Yes . I think the system should be upon an insurance basis. It should be an insurance and not a pension. It cannot be justified in equity that a man who has been thrifty all his life, and saved enough to buy a house, .should have to sell that house in his old age in order to secure a pension; while another man who has lived better than he has, and has not practised thrift as the other has, can secure a pension without difficulty. Some of the provisions of the Act need attention. For instance, the provision which joins together the private income of man and wife is working very harshly. I know of two men who have been separated from their wives for about thirty years, and cannot obtain an old-age pension. One of them is seventy years of age, but cannot get a pension because his wife, from whom he has been separated for thirty years, and who is in some other part of the world, is supposed, to have a little money. Such a provision needs to be modified. We ought certainly to have some standard of character as a pension basis, but under this Bill it seems to me there is no such thing as forgiveness. If a man happens to have separated from his wife thirty years ago, then there is no forgiveness for him—i f his wife happens to have a little money he cannot get a pension, and vice versa. The more I think of it the more convinced I am that we must come ultimately to a form of national insurance which will give every man—the millionaire as well as the poor man who has subscribed to his own insurance fund the right to receive that insurance, without taint of pauperism or charity, in his old age. That is the scheme which commends itself to my mind.</para>

                        <para>There would be no need for the Old-age Pensions Act if there were in operation a scheme such as I have in mind. Of course, I would not repeal the Act until something better could be put in its place. What is the relevancy of the interjection? Does the honorable member wish to make political capital of the poor old-age pensioners? That is a contemptible thing to do. But whenever any humanitarian question is debated here, that attempt is made by those on the other side. The Government will have my hearty support for any scheme to remove the taint of charity and pauperism from old-age pensions.</para>

                    <para>. - I shall not occupy time with a criticism of the Budget such as that of the honorable member for Parramatta and others, but I wish to refer to a matter upon which it is necessary to speak at this juncture. The Postmaster-General, in giving what was alleged to be a reply to certain statements by me, made misleading remarks regarding the work of a branch of his Department. He wished the House to believe that the main recommendations of the Postal Commission were without justification, and emphasized the statement that the service is well treated. I admit that since pressure was brought to bear, it is better treated than it was formerly. The honorable gentleman also desired to prejudice the telegraphists at Sydney, and the honorable member for Franklin, in his usual confident and cock-sure manner, interjected that I was doing those officers no good. The Minister tried to show the House that these men are not giving to the Commonwealth a service proportionate to that given by telegraphists in other countries, and to do so applied the test of averages, which is always delusive and deceptive. He stated that the men do not operate at a rate exceeding twelve words a minute. Whenever an innovation is tried in the Department, those responsible begin to blunder and bustle about, until they do not know what they are doing. The Minister has put on one side a system introduced by the Public Service Commissioner, the wonderful organizer who has brought the Department to the pass in which it is to-day. Had not his scheme been discarded there would have been trouble such as I do not wish to see in Australia. No doubt, the Public Service Commissioner is the source from which the Minister got the information that the men do not work at a rate exceeding twelve words a minute, because he is a past-master in the application of averages. It may be news to the Committee that only recently in London, when picked telegraphists were employed on a quad, line, having been told off to do certain work, their average was &#39;only 1,3.7 words per minute. They were picked and specially qualified men. Regarding the work of the New South Wales telegraphists, we had no information as to the character of the lines on which they were working, or the qualifications of those with whom they were working. </para>

                        <para>I have read the newspaper report, which has not been contradicted. The abolition of proportional grading seems likely to prove a bigger curse even than the systems which formerly prevailed, because of the inability of the man at the head of affairs to understand the needs of the Department, and to apportion its work so as to get the hest results. Men who are supposed to work broken shifts have been working from 8.30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. overtime twice a week, and from 3 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. and on to midnight, two or three times a week.</para>

                        <para>No , a very large percentage. A change of system was made without understanding the business to be done. On the 2nd November, the Minister intervened, and set aside for the moment the Public Service Commissioner's great scheme, which was paying an honour to that officer. Overtime has been worked by every staff since. Seventy-two men more than the schemes of the Public Service Commissioner provided for have been kept past 8 p.m., and some of them to midnight, although they should have gone off at 8 p.m. There have been rosters every day at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Some men are working from 9.15 till 12.30, and others from 3 to 6.15. Most of the thirty-six who should go off according to the broken time arrangement have got away only at the sacrifice of public business.</para>

                        <para>It is a good thing that some one is acquainted with what is going on, so that the men's case may be properly stated in Parliament. Evidently, when the Postmaster-General made his speech he thought that no- one was acquainted with the true position. He failed to remember that the test of telegraphists in the Commonwealth is 25, 28, and 30 words per minute. A telegraphist is not often called on to work up to his top speed, and no man could work at that speed always, nor would any man be expected to do so. But men are expected to be able to work at that speed when the public business requires it. To say that these officers are getting a better deal now than they got previously is misleading. We alf know what the condition of the lines in New South Wales has been. I know they are not yet like the lines in the Old Country, nor are they working with the ease and regularity of a well-developed and complete system. I am aware that there are faults and drawbacks in a country of such vast area as ours, making the work of the telegraphist more arduous than it would be in other countries. I know also, that, if the operator at one end of the wire cannot go beyond twenty words a minute, because he is not an expert telegraphist, the man at the other end of the wire—eve n though he may be albe to take forty words a minute —canno t exceed the average of the first man. The proportion of words sent per minute is governed by the condition of the lines on the one hand, and by the expertness of the officer who is transmitting or receiving, as the case may be. I would point out to the Minister that he will not get the best out of any men by misrepresenting their position. Whether they are in Government or private employment, no men will do their best work if only half the facts are given, or if it is made out that, they are working only three hours and some minutes instead of six hours. As soon as it is frankly admitted that they are working overtime, that they have to work up to. midnight, that they have rosters for evening and night duty in order that men may be allotted to carry on the public business i.n hours which are not provided for even in the new scheme of the Public Service Commissioner, or in any suggestion that has been made since, then the House will be seized of the f u l l position, and will be able to judge more leniently, at any rate, what services are being demanded under an incomplete system. The system will never become what it ought to be unless we get some other means of devising what is a fair and reasonable duty to be expected from the men, and have it fixed by experts who understand the business.</para>

                        <para>I have given the times. I cannot give the hours each man is working, but some men are working from 3 to 8.15 p.m., and on to midnight, two or three times a week. That is not in the scheme, and it represents overtime- Some of the men living in the suburbs work till a very inconvenient time to reach their home, the trams having stopped running. The scheme provided that the men should get off at 8 p.m.; but seventy-two more of them are being kept past that hour, some until midnight.</para>

We do not see the full text of documents of- that kind, although the House is entitled to know exactly what they contain. I do not see how the Minister could have become acquainted with the twelve words per minute statement unless it was part of the report, and specially called for, for the special purpose of undermining the position taken up by the telegraphists of the Sydney office.</para>

                        <para>The honorable member can prove the truth of my statements if he will go the right way about it. I have no hesitation in saying that if the present conditions continue they will "be the worst that have ever prevailed in that" branch of the service, and will lead to trouble that none of us want to see. If the present state of affairs is not remedied,1 not only will the men engaged in the service suffer, but the public, who are more important to me than those men are, will likewise suffer by reason of a lack of system. This is merely a jumbjed-up proposal, brought in on -the spur of the moment by the Minister, as a substitute for the Public Service Commissioner's grading proposal, which would not work from the first. I certainly expect the Government to give us an opportunity Before the session closes of at least going to. a vote on. the motion which I have placed .on- the notice-paper. I have been promised that, and I expect the promise to be fulfilled. It may not do more than merely indorse that portion of the report which has been largely adopted, but I hope it may be the means of inducing the Government or those responsible to consider the remainder of the recommendations which have not yet been dealt with. I believe that the honorable member for Bendigo, after eulogizing the Public Service Commissioner and condemning certain other things, expressed himself, towards the end of his speech, heartily in favour of a Board of management such as the Commission recommended.</para>

                        <para>There is one other matter to which I desire to refer at this stage, because I shall not have another opportunity unless I make one on some item of the Estimates. The fallacious argument used is that a Board of Control for the Post and Telegraph Department would leave an opening for political influence, while under the present system that influence, it is alleged, cannot be exercised. We are told that the Public Service Commissioner is the only safeguard against politics in the administration of the Departments. It appears, however, that as to political influence, most men have in their minds one feature only. They think of some member of Parliament who, by reason of his position, is able to bring such influence to bear as to obtain concessions not enjoyed by the ordinary citizen. There is, however, another kind of political influence. For instance, the great officer, who is supposed to be the safeguard, is practically the greatest example of that influence of any man I have ever known. I should like honorable members to look through the declarations of the Public Service Commissioner and observe the attitude he has taken up at different stages from 1907 to the issue of his last report. When a Royal Commission was granted a certain political party was in power—no t the party at present in power—and * no move was made by the Public Service Commissioner to interpret what he might regard as the will of certain members of the Legislature. A little later another party came into power; and we saw at once how the atmosphere affected the departmental barometer. Advantages, which had hitherto been denied, were showered down on the Post and Telegraph servants. The Public Service Commissioner recognised that, owing to political action there had been an exposure of the existing conditions, and he realized that some one was looking into the matter, and learning more than it was discreet should be known. When the second party came into power— a party which, he presumed, would be better pleased with his efforts— he began to raise the emoluments of the lower paid men in the service, by giving them what he called long-service increments, as a kind of apology for a direct recognition of their claims. While the inquiry was proceeding another party came into power; and the Public Service Commissioner was asked to give evidence before the Royal Commission. He then declared that everything was all right in regard to emoluments and conditions in a general sense, and that there was no warrant for any alteration in the system. Here we observe, not the influence of one politician, but the influence of the party in power; and we also see the ability of the man to read the political barometer and observe which way it was safe to proceed. The door has been not only open, but wide open to the worst form of political influence that I have known in any Parliament I have studied. With the Public Service Commissioner what was right under certain political conditions was absolutely wrong under other political conditions. We know the political influence that may be exercised on a Minister or official to make concessions not quite within the regulations, or to obtain advancement or other advantages for an officer in the Public Service. But is' there not equally political influence when the man at the head of the Public Service denies, under one Administration, the need for any alteration, and then, under another Administration, admits the justice of recommendations to the contrary made by a Royal Commission? Under a Board of Control the Post and Telegraph service would be ten times more free from political influence, collective or individual, than it has hitherto been.</para>

                        <para>No; where the authority of a Board or Commission is strictly laid down, it is strong enough to resist any influence o'f the kind. A Board has no need to study the political barometer, because it is appointed for a given term, and fortified in its position by certain laws and regulations. Of course, if honorable members say that, in spite of all safeguards that may be devised, there is no Board proof against political influence, they have a poor opinion of humanity, even as we find it to-day. I admit that men born and bred under the present system cannot be expected to be free from its faults; and the Public Service Commissioner is one of the keenest political observers I have ever known. The men in the Department today give more attention to political indications than they do to the improvement of the system of which they are a part; and that feeling permeates the whole service under present conditions. Matters could not be worse from this point of view, and they could be made much better, not only in the interests of the officers themselves, but of the public. I may say that, whatever the result of my proposals may be, I shall return to this question. When I have convinced myself that a certain course of conduct is the best for the Commonwealth and the service, it will be a queer day when I cease to advocate the change I deem to be necessary. To present a report, and have some of its recommendations adopted, is a mere palliative. The concessions made by the Public Service Commissioner—wh o is a wise man, and knows when to ' ' come in out of the wet'' —ar e not by any means a radical cure for the situation; and so sure as we leave the canker there, the trouble will appear in worse form later on. We must go to the root—w e must eradicate the disease that has affected this great Public Service, not only under the Federal regime, but long before. With the expenditure of £[250,000 per annum, we have left scarcely a vestige of the system of the Public Service Commissioner. All the grading, re-grading, and so forth, on which that gentleman has been building for years, has gone out of existence as if it were a matter of no importance— it has melted under the light of criticism and common sense. The only thing that has not gone is the Public Service Commissioner. I have no personal feeling against him. Indeed, I entered upon the inquiry prejudiced in his favour. But a man who could give evidence as he did, and subsequently shelter himself behind a report dealing with the report of the Commission, in which, in effect, he declared that he did not mean what he said when before the Commission, and that he had other things in his mind which the Commission failed to draw from him, must lose my respect. It would have been far better for him to stand like a man by his evidence without trying to excuse himself, and to make it appear that he knew all that the Commission reported before the Commission made its report, although he gave no indication of that knowledge to us. VVe are spending nearly ,£4,000,000 per annum on our Public Service. That service comprises 20,000 permanent and temporary employes, and there is every probability of a vast increase in its numbers during the next few years, since every Department is likely to grow in importance, and its expenditure must grow with it. Is the Parliament prepared to allow this great instrument of- public utility to be handled by the same men as have handled it in the past, and to produce even more dire results than have occurred since 1906-7. If the Parliament decides to do so, it will do so with a f u l l knowledge of the actual position. The changes which we recommended are based on evidence clearly set forth in our report, and available to every man who seeks for information and guidance. The experience of the service is no longer a closed book to the Parliament. Honorable members can no longer plead ignorance of the state of affairs that has prevailed in connexion with it. We have opened everything to them. As to political influence, there is no man in Australia Who knows more of politics than does the gentleman who is" at the head of the Department which is supposed to suppress political influence.</para>

                        <para>If the right honorable member will .read the Public Service Commissioner's report on the recommendations of the Postal Commission, and read it in the light of .his actions, he will say that I have given him only a homoeopathic dose. I wish to refer for a moment to the financial feature of this question. In 1906-7, and during part of 1908, when the Treasurer's purse strings were drawn tightly because of the desire to return to the States money that ought to have been retained to provide for our own departmental requirements, what happened ? We have it in evidence that about that time the Public Service Commissioner met the Treasurer of the day on' a trip across from Sydney. He admits that he warned the Treasurer to be careful of his Estimates because of the prospects . of a drought. Whether that is all- that he told the Treasurer" I do not know, but One can hardly believe that nothing more happened between two old friends in the course of that long railway journey. The result was, however, that the Treasurer began, to be careful with his Estimates, and that meant refusing the Post and Telegraph Department the assistance necessary to effectively work it.</para>

                        <para>There are, and indications of those influences are not altogether wanting. We created the office of Public Service Commissioner in order that the service might be kept free from political influence. It is because I know it is the general feeling that political influence should be kept out of the service that I am pointing out that it is a fallacy to suppose that the present system is a safeguard against anything of the kind. I shall not attempt to distinguish between political and social influence, the influence of the club or family influence. Nor shall I attempt to distinguish between political influence and the influence of relatives, or the influence of the bridge table. I shall not refer to the influence that results from men playing bridge night after night, and which, wittingly or unwittingly, forms a bridge over which one of their friends can walk to a place of greater safety than he had before. It is a delusion that we are safeguarding the Public Service from political influence by keeping, it under the control of a gentleman of the calibre of the Public Service Commissioner. I shall reserve until we reach the Postal Estimates other comments that I may have to offer with respect to the Department. I have fulfilled the mission which I rose to fulfil this morning;</para>

                    <para>.- With the indulgence of honorable members I should like my first words in this House to be a personal tribute to my predecessor and friend of many years&#39; standing, the late Honorable Egerton Lee Batchelor. In addition to the ordinary responsibilities which a new member must feel on entering this House, I have cast upon me the obligation of following a gentleman who set in this Parliament a high standard of personal character, whose work was distinguished by great party loyalty, and who gave efficient service to the public of Australia. It shall be my endeavour to gain that party confidence which my late friend was able to secure from his side of the House, and my aim to win, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr-. Batchelor</inline> was able to do, the respect of honorable members of all sections, and that of all loyal Australians. I do not know that I should have been so presumptuous as to take such an early opportunity of entering into the debates of the House but for a remark that was made yesterday by an honorable member opposite which suggested to me a train of thought with reference to a subject that has always been very near to me. I refer to the obligation assumed by the Commonwealth when it took over from South Australia the Northern Territory. I know that in the opinion of some people the Commonwealth made an excellent bargain when it took over that Territory, and I should like to remind the Committee that for many years the State from which I come endeavoured to do its duty to the rest of Australia in respect of that vast stretch of country. For many years the State from which I have the honor to come has carried the white man&#39;s burden for the whole continent, and even during times of great financial stress has refused to allow the introduction of coloured labour, resisting all attempts to that end. Yesterday, reference was made to a medical report dealing with the difficulty of developing tropical Australia with white labour, but it will take more than one such report to convince me that Australians cannot solve the problem without abandoning the policy of keeping the Commonwealth white. I have had an opportunity to examine parts of Central Australia and the Northern Territory, and have read many reports, including medical reports, regarding the country, and shall with difficulty be persuaded that it is not possible to develop our tropical regions without black labour. At the same time, I admit that the problem of developing a tropical country with white labour is one of the greatest that has confronted the European race. Downingstreet has had to deal with tropical countries where there are native populations, and there have been created difficulties such as we shall have to face in Papua, because in such places certain diseases are always present to which the natives are practically immune, though able to communicate them to white persons. We have no such difficulty to face in the Northern Territory, where we have practically a clean slate, and we have an opportunity to set an example in the development of tropical agriculture with white labour. Australians have faced and solved other problems in the past in a way that has earned us a reputation which is the . envy and admiration of the world. With reference to the suggestion made yesterday that the Government should undertake the control of the pastoral industry in the Territory, I think that the proposal is premature, because private enterprise has been more successful in that industry than in any other. In the breeding of high-class stock, and in the development of the wool industry, until Australia is the chief producer of wool in the world, our pastoralists have set an example to all other countries. Central Australia is more or less a pastoral country, and the first step towards its development is to provide means of transportation. Today the settlers there have the same means of transportation as were enjoyed in Egypt in the days of the Pharoahs. From Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, goods can be transported Only by camel trains, and when a few years ago I twice crossed the continent during the height of the mining boom in the MacDonnell Ranges, it would have been almost impossible to lose one&#39;s way on the Gibberstone salt bush plains, because of the mining machinery strewn along the track. It had been cast off various camel trains, and was lying there to be picked up by others, while adventurous spirits elsewhere were putting money into mining ventures, and wondering why dividends were not coming to them. Not being a mining man I cannot give an expert opinion, but there is every reason to believe that the mineral prospects of Central Australia are worth developing, though they cannot be developed until better means of transportation is provided. I view with some concern the choice of the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, because that may mean the choice of that gauge for the central transcontinental line. My desire is &#39;that for our connecting trunk lines that gauge shall be chosen which will give the best hauling capacity, the highest speed, and the maximum comfort. May I add that we in South Australia regard it as an obligation on the Commonwealth that it shall give attention to the matter of railway communication at the earliest moment. But we do not consider that this Government should have accomplished in eighteen months what the State was struggling to do for over forty years. I appeal to the Minister of External Affairs to make himself personally acquainted with the Northern Territory at the earliest opportunity. South Australia laboured under great disadvantage in having that Territory administered by Ministers who had no personal knowledge of tropical conditions. If the Minister of External Affairs were to travel from Port Darwin through Central Australia, he would find the trip of great interest, and would appreciate, as most Australians fail to do, the vastness of the continent and of the Northern Territory. I have heard it said, and I have also read the statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that the transcontinental railways are desert railways ; but the representatives of South Australia know that it is not competent for any man, whatever his experience may be, to apply the word &#34;desert&#34; to any part of Australia. I resent the suggestion that the word is a proper one to designate any part of Central Australia, or of tropical Australia washed by the Indian Ocean. If I at any time use the word, it is merely &#39;in a comparative sense. We have no right to label, and at the same time to libel, any part of Australia as desert. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Bullen, a writer of excellent sea stories, after visiting Australia, wrote a book in which he characterized its central districts as a vast and howling wilderness; but he did not go further north than the park lands surrounding Adelaide. It is not only the libels of the &#34; globe trotter &#34; of which we have to complain ; our own people are often guilty of running down the country, and referring to its central districts as a veritable Sahara. Without proper means of communication, they might as well be a Sahara, because it is impossible to bring produce ,from them. The finest cattle country I have visited in Central Australia, lying between Barrows Creek and the Gulf of Carpentaria, is on the Frew River; but an Adelaide company, after breeding cattle there for some years, had finally to leave them there to die of old age, because it was impossible to drive them across the dry belt to a railway station. The rainfall of a portion . of Central Australia is the smallest on the continent, being less than 5 inches; though it increases to 5 feet at Darwin. South Australia is not impatient ; but we hope that the Minister of External Affairs will, before the session closes, state the policy of the Government for the development of the Northern Territory. If, as some critics affirm, South Australia did little in developing the country, it must be admitted that it did that little uncommonly well. It sent explorers through the Territory, constructed a telegraph line across the continent, and commenced a railway which our financial obligations alone prevented us from continuing. In South Australia there is a fair average number of Scotchmen, yet, it is thought that the State would have been well advised, from a business point of view, in extending the line a few hundred miles further, . tq, make the connexion of the Northern Territory by the shortest route. We must remember that there are two Australias, one lying in the tropic or semi-tropic zone, the other in the temperate. We are endeavouring as best we are able to develop the tropical region whilst living in the temperate, and having very little knowledge of the burdens which the tropics always impose on a white people. However, I am quite sure that we, as a people, accustomed as we are to pave the way and break the roads for others, will be able to face the problem, with the courage born of the certainty that we are endeavouring to solve it for the benefit of a White Australia. A remark was made to-day that &#34; the squatters had had every chance to develop the Northern Territory, and had not availed themselves of it.&#34; I prefer to refer to them as pastoralists, which is the more modern term. We have left behind the squatter of the old days within the rainfall line, and the pastoralist of to-day often has not a very easy row to hoe. A few years ago, in company with my late friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> and the, honorable member for Hindmarsh, and to the knowledge of yourself, sir, I had the pleasure of making an extensive trip through the Gawler range country. It was the time of the great drought. The heat was terrific, the thermometer being day after day at 117 and 118 in the shade. We saw then at first-hand the difficulties against which the pastoralists had to contend in developing the parts of Australia west from Port Augusta. I should like to recommend the honorable member who made that remark about the pastoralists and the Northern Territory to read that little Australian classic, <inline font-style="italic">We of the Never -Never.</inline> He will then realize how the pioneer pastoralists have faced the difficulties of that part of the country, how they have had to fight Nature at first-hand, and I think he will agree with me, when he looks at&#39; the statistics in relation to the Northern Territory, that a great amount of pioneering work has already been accomplished there. I say advisedly that until we are prepared to do away with the system which prevailed in South Australia during the transfer negotiations - when it was possible for pastoralists to obtain only an annual permit - and to give them long and favorable terms, we cannot hope to have the Northern Territory occupied and developed to the extent that it should be. These are matters which I know will receive the attention of the Minister of External Affairs in due course. I am not in any way complaining. All I say is that we from South Australia, and, indeed, all the people of Australia, are looking to the Government for some sort of lead in respect of a policy which will enable Central Australia to be occupied and developed, and tropical Australia to be also made use of. I hold that the best defence possible for Australia is to have people of our own choice in Australia developing its great natural resources. The man behind the cultivator is always going to be a better defence to Australia than the man behind the cannon. I wish to deal with the question of defence.  I  desire, first, to congratulate the Government on having introduced into the Cabinet an honorable member who has had practical experience of military work.  I  refer to the honorable member for Adelaide, who, I understand, represents the Minister of Defence in this Chamber. I am sure that in him the House will have a man who will give his serious attention to all matters that may be brought before him. I hope the honorable member will not take it as a joke - I am referring to it purely in a military sense - when I say that I intend, as an old volunteer, to do what I can to check any conservative instincts which the Minister may have in respect to the development of the military system. I allude, of course, to conservative instincts on the military side. I do not wish to discard anything in relation to uniforms, armaments, or other things that may have been used in England, so long as they are good; but in starting a military system here we must not be so conservative as to follow the patterns of older countries merely because they have been used for centuries. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister might ascertain if it is a fact that it is intended to adopt the old postilion style in connexion with ammunition and other waggons used in the military service. Another matter about which I asked my. friends in the service to give me a note is the objection to the  Westley Richards  rifle that has been chosen as the weapon for the cadets. Its bore is .310, and the bullet weighs 125 grains. It is claimed that the breech action is different from that of the .303 rifle, and that, therefore, the cadet, after learning to use it, will have to be taught the. .303 bolt action when he is drafted into the militia at eighteen years of age. This seems to be an argument against the use of an obsolete weapon at this early stage of our cadet movement. The War Office miniature .222 bore is a cheaper weapon, with the sights and breech action .of the .303, and is certainly more accurate. These are matters of detail which I was asked to bring under the notice of the Minister. I shall be glad to supply him with further details regarding them. I merely refer to them in order to sound a note of warning that, in connexion with the military and naval system, we must be careful in this House, and in Australia generally, not to lose our heads over militarism. For my own part, I am quite prepared to be patient in regard to the introduction of what is known as the compulsory cadet system, although I do not like the word compulsory. I do not object, to the young Australian having some discipline. I think it is good for him; but we shall have to watch very carefully any attempt to multiply expense in regard to militarism in Australia. I believe too much might be made of our danger from attack.- We must be prepared to defend our country ; but I repeat that the best possible defence for Australia, is to increase our production and develop our great natural resources. To get here people of our own choice is the best means of preventing any one else choosing our population for us. </para>

                    <para>.- I. should like to compliment the honorable member for Boothby upon the very excellent speech which he has just delivered. I am sure that members on both sides of the House can come only to the one conclusion: that the honorable member must prove an acquisition, not only to his party, but to the Federal Parliament as a whole. I was very pleased to hear the eloquent tribute which he paid to the memory of his predecessor, the late Mr: Batchelor. I am  sure that it found an echo in the heart of every man <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this House. As I understand that the &#34;Leader of the Opposition is desirous of helping the Government to conclude the debate on the Budget this afternoon, I regret that it will be impossible for me to deal with many subjects upon which I wished to touch. I must, therefore, content myself with referring briefly to some matters chiefly connected with Australian defence. I am pleased to find in the Estimates an item, for new works and additions in connexion with the Military College at Duntroon. I had the pleasure of visiting the College recently with a number of other members of this Parliament, and I am sure every one of us came away convinced that the College is being run upon workmanlike lines, and not for show. It is being carried out absolutely in the spirit of the recommendations laid down by that great organizer, Lord Kitchener. I am sure every one of the party was absolutely convinced that an honest endeavour was being made to establish and maintain the College on the lines of the great American College at West Point. It is well that that should be done, because we shall have to look to this College later on for the officers to command the great Australian Army that is to be cheated under the compulsory service scheme. The Defence Department, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> are deserving of every credit for the way in which they ar.e carrying out the work in connexion with the College. While I give the Government every credit in that regard, I must deny their claim to be responsible for the inauguration of the system under which the College has been established. As a matter of fact, they were not responsible for bringing Lord Kitchener to this country ; and it was he who was primarily responsible for the establishment of the College. It was the Liberal party that brought Lord Kitchener to Australia, and therefore to them is due the inauguration of the scheme. As to the Naval College, I was very much surprised to find that the Government had decided to change the site from Burraneer Bay to Jervis Bay - a decision which is most difficult to understand in the face of the expert recommendations. We had Captain Chambers brought from England, and a great deal of trouble and expense was incurred; and yet suddenly, for some reason that I do not pretend to understand, Jervis Bay has been selected. Several honorable members have suggested reasons for this change of front, but it is absolutely inexplicable to me. Jervis Bay is practically in the bush; and we know the objections that have been raised to the Capital Site on that ground. Jervis Bay is only a small settlement on the wildest part of the coast; and there are no dockyards or provision for those stores of ammunition and so forth which are so absolutely necessary. Of course, we could cart all the stores and appliances, and provide a college with all accessories at Jervis Bay, but it would be only at enormous expense. It would be of great advantage if the cadets were near the University of Sydney, so as to be able to avail themselves of its lectures and other educational advantages. </para>

                        <para>The most recent experts recommended Burraneer Bay, and Hobart was out of the question. Although I am a Nationalist, I may tell Tasmanian representatives that the late Mr. Tyson, pastoralist, once desired to buy Tasmania for a ram paddock, and that I do not think that Tasmania' is- at all a suitable site in which to have the Naval College. Speaking of Defence generally, I think a great mistake is made in not giving the area officers adequate remuneration for their services. These officers must be responsible for the making or marring of our' great scheme of Defence, seeing that they have cast upon them the responsibility of moulding the compulsory: trainees into- shape. We are not encouraging the, best men to offer their services with a salary of' £15°- I know from experience, that these men have very little time to devote to their own affairs; in fact, if they carry out the duties as they ought, they will have no time at all. Then, again, the salaries paid to the non-commissioned officers who have to do practically the whole; of the work in the areas, are inadequate. The general question of the pay of our Military Forces I have already dealt with on a motion; but I emphasize the fact that it is absurd to expect the best material for pay so poor. These non-commissioned officers are actually receiving the same salary they did ten years ago, although we have been told by the Honorary Minister that there has been an increase of 40 per cent. I can prove that there has been no increase, except in the payment of the lower ranks, and that was only because, otherwise, recruits could not be obtained. We may take it that the senior non-commissioned officers are really not receiving as much as they did ten years ago, if we consider the allowances. I should like to refer to the treatment of the contingent of cadets which visited the Old Country at Coronation time. There has been considerable discussion on this question, and Major Wynne, the officer in charge, has been blamed in some way. I have some papers here in connexion with that visit, which, I think, will prove very interesting to honorable members. It will be remembered that, in reply to me, the Honorary Minister said that the whole position was due to the action of Major Wynne.</para>

                        <para>I shall obey your ruling, sir, and not deal with any question raised in connexion with my motion. The reason why it was supposed that Major Wynne was to blame was that he sent a wireless message of congratulation to the King. I have the original message here, and I think the House will see that it was not exactly a congratulatory message, but simply an expression of loyalty from Major Wynne and the contingent under his command. Exception was taken, however, to that message; and the following telegram was sent to Major Wynne :—</para>

                        <para>Sir,— I have the honour to report to you the arrival at Plymouth to-day by T.S.S. Themistocles, of the Australian Commonwealth Coronation Contingent of New South Wales cadets. Officers, N.CO.'s and men are all in' good health. The discipline throughout the voyage was excellent, and there has been a marked improvement in the drill and general appearance of all ranks as the result of the " setting-up" work daily.</para>
                        <para>The necessary reports and returns have been supplied to the port officials and others as required by the Regulations.</para>
                        <para>You will, I am sure, be pleasantly surprised when you see the Contingent on parade. The average physique is up to the standard required for adult regiments, except in the case of the juniors, who are, however, well advanced foi their years.</para>
                        <para>On Empire Day, a big demonstration was held on board the ship, and great enthusiasm prevailed. Similarly, on King's Birthday, there was a parade and march past. The members of the Contingent are imbued with the proper spirit, and will do their best to uphold the honour and credit of Australia.</para>
                        <para>The news from Captain Collins concerning the camp at Richmond Park was warmly welcomed. The lads are keen on soldiering, and anxious to learn all they can of their future profession by association with British troops. The opportunity of doing so would have been lost at Crystal Palace.</para>
                        <para>I received a-cable at Santa Cruz, asking for an explanation of my " irregularity " in sending a message of loyalty to. the King on Empire Day. I am sorry to say that I had not until then realized that I had neglected to follow the proper course, and I promptly cabled you expressing regret if my omission to do so had given you offence—</para>

                    <para>The Government would have acted wisely in placing on last year's Estimates a sum to provide for the proper equipment of a contingent of not only Commonwealth cadets, but Commonwealth soldiery, to take part in the great festivity of the Coronation. It has been said that the whole trouble arose from Major Wynne's action; that other officers who went home were quite satisfied, and had no complaint to make. As bearing on that point, I propose to read the following letter from Captain Rushall, of Victoria, the officer commanding the Australian Mounted Cadets on the Coronation tour, to the officer commanding the New South Wales contingent of cadets—</para>

                        <para>They were dissatisfied about the whole thing. I was sorry to hear some honorable members opposite cast aspersions on the lads who composed the New South Wales contingent. What has become of their statement with regard to certain scandals alleged to have taken place in Paris? I take it that they are not prepared to follow up that statement. They were not prepared to allow my motion to go to a division in order that a full inquiry might take place. Those who made allegations regarding scandals in Paris were not prepared to give any information to the press; they were dumb as oysters. I challenge them to give proof of the so-called scandals. I defy them to do so. The contingent, from its commanding officer to the youngest cadet, has absolutely nothing to fear. I do not know whether there is an arrangement to close' this debate this afternoon.</para>

                        <para>If honorable members opposite will give me an assurance that one of their number is not going to rise as soon as I sit down I shall be prepared to bring my remarks at once to a close. I wish to know why the Government has not attempted to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission which at so much cost investigated the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department? The public is ready to pay for an efficient service, but at present the service is anything but efficient and satisfactory. The Department reeks with 'discontent, and its employes are often on the verge of striking. I do not wonder at that, in view of the many disabilities under which they labour. The new Postmaster-General promised to remove the grievance of broken shifts from which the telegraphists suffer, but he has not done so. The men are not able to have the time off to go to their homes which they should have, and could have if the work were differently arranged. The letter sorters, too, complain that, although the maximum rate • of .the letter-carriers is .£156, their minimum rate is £144, so that a man on being promoted from carrying to sorting has to lose £12 a'year. The postal officials are, orr the whole, underpaid, and an efficient service is not to be expected from men who are not contented with their remuneration. Again, there is a large'body of temporary employes, who do not know from day to day how long-they will be kept on. Many of these men should be appointed permanently, some;.of them 'having been in the service for as long as twenty-two years: Their- position is not an enviable one, since the Minister of Home Affairs sent out his famous-'memorandum calling on his officers to- supply him with a list of the non-unionists under his control. But as it is the general wish to report progress, I shall defer my further remarks until the several items with which they deal are reached.</para>

                        <para>- This morning I asked the Minister of Home Affairs a question, to which he gave no satisfactory reply, an observation which I made at the time, and I have since confirmed it by reading the printed report of the answer. A previous Government, taking advantage of the experience of the officer holding the highest position in the Victorian Public Service, made him Commissioner for the distribution of the State into Commonwealth divisions. He carried out this duty with satisfaction to every one, there being the fullest confidence in his integrity and ability, although two members might have been expected to have a grievance in regard to his recommendations. He still holds his commission, but the Amending Electoral Bill provides for three Commissioners. I was informed, not by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp</inline> himself, that he was asked by the Minister to become  Chairman  of. the Board of Commissioners, and agreed to accept the position. He is a devoted public officer, who would place his private desires in the background to carry out what he conceived to be a public duty. But, as it is stated in the press that three new Commissioners are -to be appointed, one naturally wishes to know if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp</inline> is to be superseded. I asked the Minister a question on the subject, and he gave a reply which showed that he did not know what the facts were. I do not blame him for that, because he cannot carry all the details of the administration of his Department in his head, but I then put a question on the notice-paper, and expected, as the question was put in a categorical form, to receive from the Minister categorical replies. Instead of that, the replies to questions  1, 2,  and  3  were grouped together, and the very important question contained in number  2  was not answered at all. In that regard the Minister did not act fairly by me, or by the House. When questions are put on the notice-paper, the least we can expect is that answers should be given to them. If the Minister does not consider  it expedient, or is unable, to supply an answer, he should frankly say so. I asked whether he would ascertain if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> A. Topp&#39;s  proposed visit to Europe would interfere with the discharge of his duties under his commission. I believe, although I have had no communication with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp</inline> on the subject, that he is prepared to remain in Australia until the work of the Commission is completed, and even until it is adopted by the House. In those circumstances a grave injustice .is being done to a highly esteemed public official by the want of consideration which has been shown to him. I do not say that the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, the officer who we presume is to supersede <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp,</inline> is not fitted to carry out the duties, but I do question the advisableness  of having the officer who might be regarded as the chief adviser of the Minister on this very subject, acting in a judicial capacity. It would stand to reason that any advice which he might give subsequently to the drawing up of the subdivisions would be in the direction of getting those subdivisions adopted. The Minister himself is losing an opportunity of getting from the Chief Electoral Officer that advice which I feel sure he would ask for if he were in a position of difficulty, and which I am sure he would get. I wish to disabuse the House and the Minister of the idea that I have any objection at all to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham.</inline> I have none, but I am speaking on behalf of a late officer of the Victorian Public Service, who has done this work admirably in the past and is pre-eminently fitted to do it again, because of the wealth of knowledge that he has at his command, and&#34; his perfect personal knowledge - more perfect than that of any other man in Victoria or the Commonwealth - of the conditions which should govern such a subdivision. We are throwing all this away for what reason I do not know. The only thing I ca.n conceive of is that the Minister was led to believe that&#34; this gentleman was going oh a trip to Europe, and that his services Would not be available. .1 now ask the Minister &#39;to ascertain from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp</inline> whether his services are available, and if they are to remove from him what undoubtedly would be regarded as a stigma upon his reputation. He has done the work more than once, and should be allowed to do it again if he is prepared to undertake it, unless there is some grave objection in the mind of the Minister. If there is, it ought to be stated. If there is not, then he should undoubtedly be again intrusted with this very responsible duty. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure the Minister has no intention of injuring a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Topp&#39;s  attainments, the record of whose life is so good: that the matter should be cleared up. He was certainly appointed previously, and I understand that that appointment was not limited as to terms. If that was so, he should have been asked to do the work again on this occasion, or his commission1 should have been ended. No member of this House has objected to . the division of the State of Victoria when, unfortunately, it lost a member previously. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Topp&#39;s  record in Victoria is such that any one conversant with it would hesitate for a long time before passing him over if he was available to carry out these duties. I have nothing but commendation for the three officers who have been appointed. Their names are as familiar as household words to any politician in Victoria. One of them comes with a good record from New South Wales. If one way of getting over the difficulty was to appoint four Commissioners, that might be done. If any Federal officer is taken away from his duties to do other work during the hours, that he would have devoted, to his usual, duties, I do not see that a separate sum of money should be paid to him. If special payment is to be&#39; given in those&#39; circumstances I want to enter my protest against it. If it is done, a record should appear in the Estimates showing the total a mount of salary and allowances received. </para>

                            <para>Unfortunately , in one sense, Melbourne, within a 10-mile radius, has increased its population to nearly 600,000, which is within 50,000 of being half of the total population of Victoria. I would like to ask the Minister if , in the subdivision, it will be possible to give two extra members to the metropolitan area, because the Constitution provides that the number of electors in each constituency must be as nearly equal as possible. In that case it might mean one or two country seats being lost. Perhaps if that fact were made widely known, it might stimulate the State Parliament to make better land laws, so that more people would settle in the country districts. Could the Minister bring pressure to bear in that way upon the State Government, in order that the country parts of Victoria may not become depopulated, as, unfortunately, some of them have been? I understand that some parts of Victoria, have to-day fewer inhabitants than they had twenty years ago.</para>

I should be glad if he would delay his decision on that matter until I am able to place before him certain particulars, which I shall be able to obtain in Sydney tomorrow, with regard to premises at Trial Bay, on the .coast of New South Wales, which have been in the occupation of the Harbors and Rivers Department, and by the gaol authorities, for some years, but are not now used. </para>

                        <para>.- I am rather surprised that a question like this should be raised on the motion for adjournment by the honorable member for Laanecoorie. I could quite understand such a step if the honorable member were not satisfied with the answers to his question ; but it is certainly most undesirable to discuss the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of a body which has the duty of dividing the constituencies. </para>

                            <para>No ; but I should like to know where we could get two men who know more about such work than Mr. Reid, the Surveyor-General, and Mr. Molloy, of the Electoral Department. It appears to me that these gentlemen, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, are about the most expert that could» be found for the work.</para>

                            <para>In my opinion, we ought not to discuss the men who are to do this work, because, as the honorable member for Melbourne says, we do not know what may happen. During the last ten years the population of Victoria has increased by only 114,000, and 96,000 of these are within '.the metropolitan area.- That is an exceptional state of affairs; and I am not speaking as from the point of view of the city against the country, because no one regrets more than myself that the increase is not greater in the country districts. According to the Electoral Act, if the population increases in one particular portion, we may assume that that portion is entitled to increased representation; and it may happen that practically two country members will be wiped out, and an extra member given to the city. I am sorry that that should be so, but whatever subdivision may be made, I hope it will be fair to Victoria.</para>

                            <para>No ; he was speaking of Mr. Topp with the greatest praise, as every one does. As to the changes that may be 'made, I say that, under no circumstances, will I discuss the matter with anybody until the report of the Commissioners is on the table. I never talk to the Commissioners about what they are going to do, or what they are not going to do. When the report is made, I will place it on the table for honorable members to reject or accept.</para>

It is not proposed at present to have any extra sitting days, but it may be necessary to ask honorable members to make a sacrifice a little later on, and sit for some extra time in order to clear up the  business before Christmas. </para>
