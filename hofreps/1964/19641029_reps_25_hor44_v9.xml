                            before you call on the orders

                            recently. In the course of
              answering a question which I had asked about Boeing 727 aircraft, the Prime Minister
              said -

                            is fortunate or unfortunate enough to
              see me once a year. I understand that he is a much closer personal friend of the

                    <para class="block">
                        That was an unwarranted insult and I withdraw it and apologise for
            having made it. 1 am completely opposed to the Prime Ministers politics, as he well
            knows, but his integrity has never been in question. It is of the highest order. I do
            not want the remark to remain uncorrected in respect of

                        either. I do not like the way Ansett has obtained all the benefits and
            advantages that he has, but I honestly do not believe he has ever obtained anything by
            bribery. I do not think he would offer a bribe and I do not think any Minister or any
            public servant would take one.
                    </para>
                    <para>I have made amends in this matter. I would like to say that I would not want not to
            be on friendly terms with all members of the House, as far as I can be - and I use the
            double negative to emphasise the positive. However, sometimes we become worked up and
            annoyed and make insulting comments to each other. What I have quoted to the House today
            did not appear in "Hansard", although the "Hansard" staff recorded
            portion of it. The last portion, the insulting portion, appeared in the daily Press. I
            think more people read the Press than read "Hansard" and therefore the damage
            was doubly important and could have a doubly bad effect.</para>

              for fixing the cost of Moonie oil to the refineries? Is the price of imported crude
              oil below that of Moonie oil because it is heavily subsidised by either the exporting
              country or the company? Will the Government take appropriate and prompt action to

                        <para>- I believe that the agreement to purchase Moonie oil runs till about the end of
              August next year. In the meantime my Department has been active in seeing that the
              local users of the oil and the owners of it get together to arrange for the sale of
              the oil. We hope that the sale will be concluded between the seller and the purchaser
              without Government intervention but, if it is not, obviously the Government will have
              to intervene. The Government has already looked at this problem to see what steps it
              can take in the event of a breakdown of negotiations.</para>

                    <para>The honorable member has asked whether imported crude oil is cheaper than Moonie oil
            because of subsidies. To the best of my knowledge imported crude oil is cheaper not
            because of subsidies but because it comes from very large fields whereas Moonie is quite
            a small field. Further, many of the overseas fields have been in operation for a long
            time and their capital has been amortised, so the price of oil produced from them is
            much cheaper than it would otherwise be. Obviously, the policy of the Government is that
            all crude oil produced in Australia should be taken and used fully in Australia. This is
            a matter of policy which it would not be appropriate to discuss during question time,
            but I can say that the Government will see that the policy is implemented.</para>

                        <para>- Yesterday the honorable member for Barton put a question to me concerning, among
              other things, recommendations in relation to teaching hospitals, and I said that I
              would find out the position. If I may, I will complete my answer to that question.
              This matter has been outstanding for 12 months. The Australian Universities
              Commission, which, as the honorable member knows, has had a rather busy year, will
              make recommendations for both capital and recurring grants to teaching hospitals some
              time in December, we hope early December, and the Government will, of course, deal
              with those proposals at the earliest possible opportunity.</para>

                        <para>- I point out that the function of the Northern Division of the Department of
              National Development is to advise generally on northern development, and particularly
              to advise the Commonwealth Government in relation to projects put forward by the
              States of Queensland and Western Australia. Since the Northern Territory is
              administered by the Commonwealth, the position in relation to projects which are put
              forward by the Territory does not exist in respect of projects proposed by the
              Governments of Queensland and Western Australia. I point out also that the Minister
              for National Development and I are Commonwealth Ministers and the work of the Northern
              Division of the Department of National Development affords us useful opportunities for
              collaboration and consultation.</para>

                    <para>All funds for works, particularly development works, in the Northern Territory are
            provided by the Commonwealth Government. This also is different from the situation in
            the States. The relationship between the Department of National Development and the
            Department of Territories is one of consultation and collaboration. Within this
            framework, however, the Department of Territories is responsible for works and
            development relating solely to the Territory. The Northern Territory also has a very
            great interest in the Commonwealth beef roads project and in the Ord River scheme. I
            think that about one-third of the Ord River basin is within the Territory. Many
            developments are being undertaken in the Territory by private enterprise, including the
            manganese projects on Groote Eylandt. The Government hopes soon to receive proposals for
            the development of the bauxite deposits on the Gove Peninsula. Finally, I assure the
            honorable member that the Commonwealth is very anxious to promote development of the
            Northern Territory, particularly in the pastoral, mineral and agricultural industries.</para>

              statement in this morning's "Australian" about changes in the Petroleum
              Search Subsidy Act. As the report, in my view, does not make clear the
              Government's intentions, will the Minister assure the House that the Government
              still intends to aid exploration for new oil and gas deposits? Is he satisfied that
              the expected changes in the Act will not penalise future exploration or the full
              proving of a field when oil or gas is found?</para>

                        <para>- One of the problems that we have faced concerning the petroleum search subsidy
              was brought about by the very success of the subsidy scheme. Honorable members will
              recall that when the subsidy was introduced the search for petroleum deposits in
              Australia was almost grinding to a halt, and this was the reason for the introduction
              of the subsidy scheme. I think that in one year only 14 wells were drilled throughout
              Australia. The Government introduced the scheme with the aim of encouraging the search
              for oil. It has been so successful that we are now reaching a rate of drilling of over
              200 wells per annum, and we have had great success in finding oil. Altogether, some
              £15 million has been paid out in subsidy, and we aim at paying in subsidy £5
              million this financial year.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Because of the success in drilling for oil, so many more applications have been
            received as to make it impossible to satisfy all out of the £5 million allocated.
            Therefore, the Government has had to decide whether to increase the sum - this would
            have to be done at the expense of the taxpayers- or to evolve some new system to
            encourage the search for oil in areas where deposits have not previously been located. I
            have discussed this matter with representatives of the Australian Petroleum Exploration
            Association and the various interests that are searching for oil in Australia. They have
            agreed that the system we adopted of limiting the subsidy in respect of operations in
            areas where oil or gas has been found is best. Oil or gas has now been located in some
            17 areas in Australia and we have two oilfields as well. In areas within a specified
            radius of these locations, the subsidy will not be paid. It will be paid in respect of
            operations in more remote areas, and we hope that it will encourage operations resulting
            in more oil and gas strikes.</para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question. Has the honorable
              gentleman seen the statement by the financial editor of the "Sydney Morning
              Herald" that prices have already deprived pensioners of the value of the recent
              Ss. a week increase in pensions? Does the Minister know that the Australian consumer
              price index reveals rises of from 8s. to 10s. 6d. a week in the last two quarters -
              the greatest rise in any two quarters since 1956? Does he recollect that on 30th
              September, in reply to my request that he assist in preventing galloping inflation
              from robbing workers of the value of their wages, he stated that I was not in my right
              mind in suggesting that there was a danger of galloping inflation? If inflation is not
              galloping will the Minister agree that it is speeding along at a merry old canter and
              may at any time break into a gallop? Will the Minister now assist workers and
              pensioners to obtain adequate income increases? Will he also assist in preventing
              those increases from being taken away by unjustifiable price rises?</para>

                        <para>- I doubt whether I said that the honorable member for Scullin was not in his
              right mind. If I did use those words I regret it. I have a great deal of respect for
              the honorable member. As to the matters raised by the honorable member, I did point
              out yesterday that you cannot take month by month or quarter by quarter variations in
              the consumer price index as indicating the true trend. I pointed out that only a few
              days after the last consumer price index was issued the prices of potatoes and meat,
              particularly mutton and beef, fell substantially. I still adhere to what I said
              earlier - there is no galloping inflation or sign of galloping inflation. As the
              honorable gentlemen well said, inflationary pressures are being reflected in the
              consumer price index. Nonetheless, the matters raised by the honorable gentleman will
              be considered by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when it next
              reviews the basic wage. Equally, price changes are one of the things that influence
              the Government when it considers pensions.</para>

                        <para>- I presume that the honorable member is referring to the fact that under the
              Sugar Agreement sugar is delivered to the metropolitan cities freight free, but not to
              country areas. There have been some representations from country industries asking for
              a reconsideration of this matter. It is the sugar industry that is directly involved,
              as also are the Commonwealth and State Governments by virtue of the Sugar Agreement. I
              have taken this matter up with the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries. He has
              discussed it with representatives of the sugar industry. I have advised
              representatives of country industries who have approached me on this matter that the
              sugar industry is not particularly happy about providing further assistance by way of
              freight concessions. The Agreement specifically provides that sugar is to be delivered
              to metropolitan cities freight free. The freight is added from there on to the country
              industries. We cannot consider alteration of this position until we have another
              review of the Agreement. The matter will be looked at when that review is made.</para>

              Convention, held in Hobart, an announcement was made on behalf of
                      Sir Garfield
                            Barwick that Cabinet had authorised him to
              design a new Federal superior court. I ask the Attorney-General whether he is pursuing
              this matter. If so, when may we expect a bill to be brought before this House?

                        <para>- As might be expected, the substance of the honorable member's question is
              correct. Cabinet did authorise my predecessor to draw up a bill for the establishment
              of a Federal supreme court. That matter is being pursued. A senior and experienced
              officer of the Attorney-General's Department has been working on it, and
              considerable progress has been made along the path of drawing up the principles for
              such a bill. One real problem that arises is what is to be done with the Commonwealth
              jurisdiction which is at present vested in State courts. Is that jurisdiction to be
              taken to the Federal supreme court, or left in the State courts? No decision has been
              taken about this matter at the present stage, but one will need to be taken in the
              future. One thing which is relatively urgent, of course, is the need to relieve the
              High Court of much of its original jurisdiction because the work load which is placed
              upon the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction is very real. I hope that the bill
              can be introduced next year.</para>

              apprentices in the country, particularly in the provincial centres of Queensland?</para>

                        <para>- I cannot comment on the peculiarity of the problems in Queensland country areas
              relating to apprentices. The honorable member is right when he says that the
              Government introduced what he calls a well conceived scheme for increasing the number
              of apprentices in country areas. What the Government did, if my memory holds good, was
              to provide an incentive payment of £3 a week to country employers for each
              apprentice they engage over and above their normal quota.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Government also provided that country apprentices who had to live away from home
            in the country or go to the cities for special training would receive living away from
            home allowances. I am not certain of the exact figures for Queensland, but there has
            been remarkable success, which is reflected not only in the overall number of
            apprentices who have signed indentures but also in the number of those who have taken
            part in the scheme initiated by the Government. I think that in Queensland about 300
            country apprentices over and above the normal intake have been registered and 136 have
            received living away from home allowances. I will check those figures. The numbers for
            Queensland represent, I think, nearly half of those for Australia as a whole. Some
            States have not yet participated in the scheme and others are just beginning to
            recognise its great advantages and are now showing a willingness to participate.</para>

                        <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. It relates to the
              increased guaranteed minimum price of 19d. per lb. for lamb shipped to the United
              Kingdom between September and November, and 17½d. per lb. for lamb shipped between
              December and February. In view of the fact that these guaranteed prices seem to have
              had the desired effect of inducing primary producers to ship their lamb early, will
              the Government now extend the increased minimum price guarantee to cover all lamb
              shipped from Tasmania, and so remove the unfair discrimination against us, and against
              the spirit of Federation, having in mind that we are unable to ship during the earlier
              three months period because of our climatic conditions?</para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member is under a misapprehension when he suggests there
              is discrimination against Tasmania. It is really a discrimination as between the
              periods of the year during which these exports are received on the United Kingdom
              market. The Government has tried to encourage the early delivery of lamb to that
              market so that Australian producers can get their lamb there at a time when other
              countries are not delivering lamb, and so reap the benefit of the market at that time
              of the year. That is the only discrimination. We have fixed prices or, in other words,
              given guarantees for different periods of the year with these considerations in mind.</para>

                        <para>- In the pursuit of increased industrial efficiency in the plants operated by the
              Department of Supply, we have constantly been seeking new techniques, work gain
              studies and things of this kind which are generally lumped under the term "methods engineering". It is not to be supposed that this has been greeted with
              unrestrained enthusiasm. Indeed, work measurement has been the subject of two appeals
              to conciliation commissioners. But on both occasions it was said that this was a
              legitimate part of modern management and, therefore, the Department of Supply received
              approval to go ahead. This procedure began in Lithgow in 1958. It has been singularly
              successful there, in one case reducing the production time for a rifle from something
              over 60 hours to something under 30 hours. So, in the course of time, the employees at
              Lithgow sought to receive some reward for their increased productivity. The Department
              of Supply developed a formula by which measurable productivity would produce
              measurable results for employees. Under the formula which was put into operation in
              May last, employees today are earning anything up to £2 per week over their
              normal salaries because of measured productivity. In the course of producing this
              happy situation for the factory, and, indeed, for the employees, we have had a good
              deal of understanding and cooperation from the Australian Council of Trade Unions and
              also from the officers of the Department of Labour and National Service, for which we
              are very much appreciative. A proposal to extend this scheme into other factories
              operated by the Department of Supply is under review at the present moment. The
              procedure adopted at Lithgow was for a trial period of six months, and has now nearly
              reached termination. When the results of this procedure are assessed, I believe it
              will be shown to be successful and certainly to the benefit of industry and employees.</para>

                        <para>- I did see a statement in the Press recently relating to this matter. I think it
              applied principally to the danger from the importation of toys into the United
              Kingdom. Of course, this danger applies equally as far as Australia is concerned. The
              history of this matter in Australia goes back some years. In 1955, the National Health
              and Medical Research Council did recommend that legislation be introduced on a uniform
              basis in all States to prevent the use of paint which contained more than 1 per cent,
              of lead on toys. At that time Queensland had already introduced such legislation.
              Since then, the States of Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania have introduced
              similar legislation. I am not quite sure of the position in the other two States, but
              I recommend that they consider again the recommendation of the Council.</para>

                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen certain Press reports suggesting
              that the Minister for External Affairs has been snubbed or rebuffed in Moscow. Would
              he care to comment on those reports?</para>

                            - I am happy to be able to say that the report that tie Minister for External
              Affairs has been snubbed or rebuffed is completely untrue. Indeed, the opposite turns
              out to be the fact. Admittedly, he arrived in Moscow at a fairly awkward time - just
              after a changeover. We all know that a changeover produces difficulties. But normally
              the person to be interviewed by a foreign minister is another foreign minister. I am
              happy to say that cables that have come in this morning indicate that our Minister for
              External Affairs had no less than two and a half hours with
                            Mr. Gromyko,
                            the Russian Foreign Minister, and his two principal
              assistants.

                                - Guilt by association, yes. The Minister for External Affairs had two and a

                        <para>- My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Defence Forces
              Retirement Benefits Fund had an income of more than £64 million in the year ended
              30th June 1964 and paid to ex-servicemen benefits amounting to less than £34
              million? Is the Minister aware that the Fund has been the subject of considerable
              criticism by Service personnel in recent years and is recognised as the main reason
              for the high rate of resignations of commissioned officers from the forces, especially
              the Army, over the past two years? Is it a fact that the total investments of the Fund
              as at 30th June last-</para>

              time before wool growers have to decide on the reserve price plan, can the Minister

                        <para>- I have always said that the Government's approach to this matter is that it
              desires that all organisations should be represented on a conference to speak for the
              whole industry. So far as my understanding goes, when the Australian Wool Industry
              Conference discussed the application of the Australian Primary Producers Union it
              found that the wool section of the Union did not have sufficient autonomy to speak for
              the wool growers. I understand that in consequence, and after a discussion between the
              executive of the Wool Industry Conference and the A.P.P.U., the A.P.P.U. has amended
              its constitution. I have not been officially advised of this, nor is there any need
              for me to be advised officially of it. I suppose that in the course of events there
              will be another application on the basis of the amended constitution. The honorable
              member asks whether the A.P.P.U. is likely to be represented on the Wool Industry
              Conference when the reserve price plan proposals are further discussed. I suggest,
              looking at the situation from the outside as I do, that there is no possibility of the
              Union's inclusion at that stage, because the next time the Conference meets it
              will probably be discussing the reserve price plan proposals and the application by
              the A.P.P.U. at the same time.</para>

              Australian air requirements are, in the main, being supplied by France, the United
              States of America and Canada. Has the Minister any plans to make Australia self
              supporting in this branch of defence? Is he aware that Sweden, with a population of 8
              million has achieved this, whereas Australia still relies on overseas supplies?</para>

                        <para>- I have not studied in detail how Sweden manages to accomplish this, but no doubt
              the Swedes work a good deal harder and to more purpose than we do in Australia. The
              fact is that with the number of aircraft required in Australia we cannot reach
              production quantities of aircraft to fill Australia's needs. It is quite
              impossible to tool a modern piece of equipment like a sophisticated aircraft for the
              relatively small needs of Australia. However, we will certainly go as far as we can in
              providing either part production or assembly, and I hope that at least in the aircraft
              trainer field we will be able to provide a project which will be eminently
              satisfactory to the Royal Australian Air Force.</para>

                    <para>Yesterday the Prime Minister was asked a question by the honorable member for the
            Australian Capital Territory. The Prime Minister has discussed that matter with me. The
            first part of the honorable member's question related to the concession as it
            applies to the Australian Capital Territory and implied that the rental payable, even
            with the concession, would be higher than it was prior to the alteration of rates. This
            matter has been considered. It has been decided that we will maintain the telephone
            rental at £20, less the one-third concession, because this gives the proper
            relationship between the pensioner and the ordinary telephone subscriber in Canberra.
            The second part of the honorable member's question related to the reinstallation of
            a telephone for a pensioner who has requested a cancellation of his service since 1st
            October. On application by the pensioners, such telephones will be reinstalled without
            the payment of any installation fee.</para>

                Linus
                            Pauling has predicted that the proposed French nuclear explosion in
              the Pacific could seriously affect 300,000 children now unborn and cause 70,000 people
              to die prematurely of cancer. In view of these horrifying prospects, I ask the Prime
              Minister whether everything possible has been done by the Australian Government to
              discourage the French from proceeding with the test. Is any other action
              contemplated or does the Government accept the test as inevitable?

                    <para class="block">This Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Export Payments
            Insurance Corporation Act 1956-1961. The most important of these amendments would
            provide the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, known as E.P.I.C., with the power to
            issue guarantees of payment to banks and other lending institutions, which provide
            finance for certain types of export transactions. Another proposes to increase the
            present maximum contingent liability which the Corporation may assume under its
            contracts. The remainder are designed generally to strengthen and improve its ability to
            provide payments insurance.</para>
                    <para>The purpose and general functions of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation will,
            by now, be familiar to the House. Briefly, it was established by the Government in 1956
            to promote exports, by insuring Australian exporters against risks of non-payment not
            normally insured by commercial insurers. The outstanding progress it has made since it
            commenced operations in 1957 demonstrates, quite dramatically, that there was, and still
            is, a real need for these facilities, and that the Corporation is fully alive to its
            responsibility to meet this need. In 1957-58, its first full year of operation, E.P.I.C.
            wrote business to the value of about £11 million; in 1963-64, the figure was almost
            £64 million. Over the same period policy holders increased from 43 to 436. In
            short, export payments insurance is now firmly established as an important export aid.
            Indeed, there can be no doubt that the security it provides has encouraged many
            exporters to penetrate and develop markets which would otherwise hire been virtually
            inaccessible, because of the trading risks involved.</para>
                    <para>Security against the risk of non-payment, however, is not the only benefit of export
            insurance. E.P.I.C. can, if the exporter wishes, assign the insurance policy to a bank.
            The transfer of security in this way is often an invaluable aid to the exporter in
            securing finance for exports on credit terms. In most large capital goods transactions
            involving medium or long term credit, for example, E.P.I.C. insurance is usually
            required as part of the security if the exporter is to obtain bank finance. Even with
            this added security, however, it is not always easy for banks to accept the residual
            risks involved, which E.P.I.C. insurance cannot cover, and agree to provide medium or
            long term finance. It is this feature of export insurance which the major amendment in
            the Bill before the House is intended to strengthen. Under the proposed amendment the
            repayment of advances which banks make to finance export transactions may be guaranteed
            by the Corporation against non-payment by the buyer for any reason.</para>
                    <para>The normal E.P.I.C. contract covers only specified risks of non-payment whereas the
            guarantee covers non-payment for any reason. The guarantees would work in this way:</para>
                    <para>The exporter would obtain from E.P.I.C. normal payments insurance cover on the
            transaction and assign the policy to his bank.</para>
                    <para>If the bank required further security the exporter could then obtain from E.P.I.C.,
            for a small additional premium, a guarantee in the bank's favour which would extend
            cover to include risks of non-payment not insured against, under the normal policy.</para>
                    <para>The extent of indemnity under the guarantee would be 90 per cent, initially, rising
            to 100 percent, if, after two years, performance of the contract had been satisfactory.</para>
                    <para>This reduces the need for the exporter to provide collateral security to the bank
            and protects the bank's interests - if non-payment occurred the bank would receive
            payment under the guarantee within three months of the date of nonpayment, regardless of
            the cause of non-payment.</para>
                    <para class="block">Guarantees of this sort will not be required for the bulk of our
            exports which are transacted on a cash or short term credit basis. They will therefore
            be confined to transactions in which:</para>
                    <para>Capital or semi-capital goods are involved; </para>
                    <para>The value involved is £100,000 or more; </para>
                    <para class="block">Credit terms of two years or more are being extended to the overseas
            buyer.</para>
                    <para class="block">It is worth noting at this point that a number of overseas countries
            including the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom - the United
            Kingdom is the model for our proposal - provide similar guarantees to their exporters.
            It is quite probable that guarantees will be required in cases where the Government, in
            the "national interest", which in this context is a technical term, accepts
            liability under the insurance contract. These are normally likely to be transactions
            involving capital goods of substantial value. Indeed, this is very often why they cannot
            be insured on a commercial basis by E.P.I.C. and are therefore accepted by the
            Government under the national interest provisions of the Act.</para>
                    <para>It is proposed under the Bill that where guarantees are issued in national interest
            cases the Commonwealth will be liable for any claims. The Bill proposes several other
            amendments to the Act, which I shall now deal with briefly. It is proposed that the Act
            be amended to allow E.P.I.C. to share with the Government some part of the insurance or
            guarantee contract where national interest cover is provided by the Government. There
            have been cases in the past where, due to the size of the contract and the risks
            involved, the Corporation has been unable to accept for insurance on its own account the
            full amount of the transaction. Nevertheless it would have been prepared to accept part
            of it. It is proposed to amend the Act to enable the Corporation to participate in such
            national interest cases if, and to the extent, it wishes.</para>
                    <para>It is also proposed that the maximum percentages of cover which the Corporation may
            offer should be removed from the Act where they are now specified, and alternatively be
            prescribed in regulations to the Act. This will enable changes to be made in the levels
            of cover provided, without undue delay, and thus allow E.P.I.C. to move quickly to meet
            changing competitive conditions in international trade. It is not proposed, however,
            that there should be any change for the time being in the maximum percentages now
            specified in the Act, namely 85 per cent, of loss where the cause of loss is commercial
            - identified by the description " commercial risk " - and 95 per cent, of loss
            from any other cause - identified as "political risk". In addition it is
            intended to make provision for the Minister to approve, in special circumstances, higher
            percentages of cover than those prescribed in the regulations.</para>
                    <para>Special circumstances warranting consideration of higher cover could rise where the
            insurance cover under the standard E.P.I.C. policy would expose the exporter to unduly
            high financial risk, and where the effects on the exporter of accepting this risk could
            endanger current or future export transactions in a particular market. Special higher
            cover might be justified, for example, on large commodity transactions, where margins
            are very fine and the amount at risk on the exporter's own account is very large. In
            the drive for exports it is important that facilities should exist under which E.P.I.C.
            can seek ministerial approval to issue special contracts of this type.</para>
                    <para>The maximum contingent liability which the Corporation can assume is specified in
            the Act and sets an upper limit to the Government's liability in respect of export
            payments insurance, and, in effect, to the volume of business the Corporation can write.
            When the Corporation was established in 1956 its maximum contingent liability was fixed
            at £25 million. As the business insured by the Corporation increased this figure
            was found to be inadequate and was increased to £50 million in 1959. The continued
            success of the Corporation in developing Australia's export trade has led to a
            situation in which the total of its firm commitments and business under firm offer or
            negotiation is very close to the maximum contingent liability at present specified in
            the Act.</para>
                    <para>As at 30th September 1964, the Corporation's actual contingent liability on
            contracts was £34.4 million. Since business under firm offer or negotiation
            totalled £12 million at that time, the total current and prospective contingent
            liability of the Corporation is now of the order of £45 million to £46 million
            - only £4 million or £5 million short of the statutory maximum. There is
            therefore an urgent need to increase the maximum contingent liability of the
            Corporation, and the Bill proposes that it should be raised from £50 million to
            £75 million.</para>
                    <para>Finally, the opportunity has been taken to make several minor amendments to certain
            sections of the Act. It is proposed to amend the banking provisions of the Act to take
            account of the change of name of the Commonwealth Bank and to bring them into line with
            the corresponding provisions included in other recent Commonwealth legislation relating
            to statutory authorities. It is also proposed to raise from £2,500 per annum to
            £3,500 per annum the maximum salary of a position which the Corporation may
            determine without ministerial approval. The proposals contained in this Bill are
            designed to strengthen and improve the facilities provided by the Export Payments
            Insurance Corporation in a way which will enable it to add to the already valuable
            contribution it is making to the drive for increased exports. I therefore commend the
            Bill to honorable members.</para>

                    <para>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the Commonwealth to enter into an
            arrangement with a State or a State meat authority for Commonwealth inspectors to
            undertake the inspection of meat for consumption in Australia. The Commonwealth has the
            responsibility of inspecting meat for the export markets whereas the inspection of meat
            intended for home consumption is the function of the State authorities concerned. In
            most approved export meat establishments Commonwealth and State inspectors work together
            on the inspection of meat for both export and home consumption. There has been a
            commendable degree of co-operation between Commonwealth and State inspection services,
            but a certain amount of overlapping has been inevitable.</para>
                    <para>The problem associated with CommonwealthState inspection has been considered by the
            Australian Agricultural Council over a lengthy period but an acceptable solution to
            cover all States has not been found. It has been generally agreed that there would be
            considerable advantages in having meat inspection under one authority in each State, but
            it has been recognised that a number of difficulties such as disease control, seasonal
            conditions affecting transfer of staff, salary differentials, etc., must be overcome in
            achieving this objective.</para>
                    <para>The desirability for the introduction of a single inspection service has been
            further emphasised recently by the import conditions applied by the authorities in some
            of Australia's important markets. One of these conditions is that the control of
            meat inspection must be under " a service organised and administered by the national
            Government". This implies that the overall control of registered export premises,
            including those which process meat for home consumption as well as for export, must be
            under a Commonwealth department. To comply with this requirement it has been necessary,
            in States which prefer to maintain their own inspection services, for agreements to be
            made for Commonwealth and State and\/or municipal inspectors to work together under the
            supervision of a Commonwealth veterinary officer. This has ensured uniform inspection
            procedures and standards for export and home consumption meat and meat products.</para>
                    <para>The Bill is primarily intended to enable an arrangement to be concluded with the
            South Australian Government and the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board in South
            Australia for Commonwealth officers to inspect both export and home consumption meat in
            registered export establishments in that State. The Bill has, however, been expressed in
            a manner which would enable other States to enter into a similar arrangement if so
            desired. If, at the request of a State or a State meat authority, the Commonwealth
            undertakes the inspection of meat for home consumption, action will be taken to ensure
            that there is no retrenchment of State meat authority or Commonwealth inspectors.</para>
                    <para>Under the proposed arrangement with South Australia, all State Department of
            Agriculture and Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board meat inspectors will, if they so
            desire, be transferred to. the Commonwealth Public Service as permanent officers. The
            Bill provides for the South Australian inspectors to preserve their eligibility for
            accrued recreation leave up to 30 days, also the total credit of sick leave and furlough
            credits. The Bill also makes special provision for those officers who are contributors
            to the South Australian Superannuation</para>
                    <para class="block">Fund to transfer to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund on
            appointment to the Commonwealth service.</para>
                    <para>It is proposed that the Commonwealth will be reimbursed for the inspection of meat
            for home consumption (a) by the State Department of Agriculture on the basis of the cost
            to the Commonwealth of the work performed and (b) by the Metropolitan and Export
            Abattoirs Board on the basis of a formula which will determine the upward or downward
            movement of charges based on the throughput for home consumption. There have been
            tremendous changes in the character of the meat trade in recent years. These changes
            have been brought about by the development of the North American market for Australian
            meat and the fact that 99 per cent, of exports to that market are in the form of
            boneless beef and mutton, which requires much more extensive inspection and supervision
            than that provided in the previous carcass inspection procedure. This tendency is also
            developing in respect of the United Kingdom market, to which approximately 90 per cent,
            of the export meat now being shipped is in boneless form. The traditional trade with the
            United Kingdom for many years has been in carcass form. Associated with this development
            is the tendency for a greater number of meat works to register as exports establishments
            so that the surplus meat above home consumption requirements can be diverted to export
            markets. A combination of requirements of importing countries and the inspection
            procedures which will enable the meat to be sold for either the export or the home
            consumption market is bringing Commonwealth and State inspectors, standards and
            procedures closer together.</para>

                    <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the payment of fees in
            respect of licences for commercial television stations. I will later introduce Bills to
            provide for the payment of fees in respect of licences for commercial broadcasting
            stations, to repeal the existing Broadcasting and Television Stations Licence Fees Act
            1956 and to amend section 106 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1963, as
            amended by the Broadcasting and Television Act 1964. The 1956 Act, which is now to be
            repealed, provided that the annual fee payable by a licensee should be £25 in the
            case of a broadcasting station and £100 in the case of a television station, plus
            in each case 1 per cent, of the gross earnings of the station " in respect of the
            broadcasting or televising of advertisements or other matter ". This Act was passed
            by Parliament in 1956, the year in which television services commenced in Australia. Its
            provisions were, of necessity, framed in the light of experience with the broadcasting
            services and the manner in which, at that time, it was envisaged that the television
            station licensees would conduct their operations. Experience has since shown, however,
            that it is virtually impossible to properly assess the licence fee in respect of
            television stations on the basis now prescribed - that is, on the basis of the "
            sale of station time ".</para>
                    <para>I should here explain that broadcasting and television stations earn revenue in two
            ways - (a) in the case of sessions sponsored by an advertiser, partly by selling the
            programme itself to the advertiser and partly, but as a separate transaction, by selling
            the advertiser "station time" to put the programme on the air; and (b) in the
            case of unsponsored sessions, by selling " station time" to "spot"
            advertisers, the station itself meeting the cost of the programme but taking this into
            account in fixing the price to advertisers for "spots" during the session.
            Licensees of commercial television stations have, in determining the amount of gross
            earnings to be shown in statutory declarations lodged with the Australian Broadcasting
            Control Board pursuant to section 106 of the Broadcasting and Television Act, for
            licence fee purposes, adopted the practice of excluding not only the amounts paid by
            advertisers for programmes in sponsored sessions but also, in the case of unsponsored
            programmes, an estimated amount of the revenue received from spot advertising, as
            representing the cost of programmes with which the spot advertising is associated. The
            deductions from spot advertising revenue are being made on the basis of arbitrary and
            varying proportions which the Board has no way of controlling.</para>
                    <para>Honorable members will agree that it is desirable, from all points of view, that the
            basis of assesment of licence fees should be clearly defined and capable of ready
            determination. After considering the various possibilities it has been decided to adopt
            an " advertising receipts " basis of assessment on the grounds that the fee
            should be assessed on the station's turnover and be a first charge on revenue. Such
            a basis is also directly related to the main business activity deriving from the grant
            of the licence - that is, the selling of advertising. The adoption of the advertising
            receipts basis, to which I have referred, would mean that the licence fee would be
            levied on all revenue received from advertisers by a licensee with respect to the
            broadcasting or televising of advertisements, extending to cover both station time and
            payments for programmes. Under this basis of assessment, which is reflected in the
            definition of "gross earnings" in clause 4 of the Bill, all spot advertising
            revenue would be subject to licence fee, and likewise all revenue received from
            sponsored advertising, both with respect to station time and programme sales, would also
            be assessable. It will be noted that the definition of "gross earnings"
            specifically excludes earnings from the production of filmed advertisements. It is known
            that some organisations closely related to licensee companies perform such work on
            behalf of advertisers as a commercial activity separate from the licensee's normal
            business of operating a television station. If this exclusion were not made,
            licensees' earnings from this source could be subject to licence fees, pursuant to
            clause 7 of the Bill, which relates to the diversion of revenue to related oganisations.
            This did not seem appropriate.</para>
                    <para class="block">I turn now to the question of the scale of rates to be imposed. This
            is probably the most important aspect of the proposed legislation, as it is the rates of
            the levy which determine its impact. Honorable members will be aware of the spectacular
            increase which has occurred in the revenue of commercial television stations. From
            £1.2 million in 1956-57 the gross revenue had risen to £18.8 million in
            1962-63 with profits in that year of £3 million. The gross revenue of the ten
            metropolitan stations for 1962-63 was £16.8 million with profits, before tax and
            licence fees, of about £3.5 million - a profit margin of the order of 20 per cent.
            Again the gross revenue of the four stations in Sydney and Melbourne rose to about
            £11.2 million in 1962-63 with profits, before tax and licence fees, of £2.3
            million approximately, representing an overall profit margin of 20 per cent. The overall
            return on issued capital of these four stations, before tax and licence fees, was of the
            order of 48 per cent, while, after tax and licence fees, it was of the order of 28 per
            cent.</para>
                    <para>The country television stations, all of which are still in the early stages of
            operation, derived a gross revenue in 1962-63 of £1,978,000, incurring losses of
            £415,000. It should be mentioned, however, that such losses are a normal result in
            the early stages of the operation of television stations; in fact, most country
            television stations have reported that they are ahead of budget figures. Although the
            increase in the financial results of broadcasting stations has not been so marked as in
            the case of television stations, income and profits have increased from £7.5
            million and £1.5 million respectively in 1956-57, when the present Licence Fees Act
            came into force, to £12 million and £2.5 million respectively in 1962-63, with
            a profit margin of some 21 per cent.</para>
                    <para>Despite the spectacular increase in the earnings of both television and broadcasting
            stations, the rates of licences fees have remained unchanged since 1956. The fees paid
            for 1962-63 in respect of television stations amounted to only £112,896
            notwithstanding that their gross earnings were £18.8 million with profits of
            £3 million. So far as broadcasting stations are concerned, the fees paid were
            £109,544 as against gross earnings of £12 million and profits of £2.5
            million. I believe honorable members will agree that the present scale of licence fees
            is unrealistic and that changes are justified.</para>
                    <para>Clause 6 of the Bill provides for application of the following rates of licence fees
            on gross earnings from advertising receipts - 1 per cent, up to £500,000; 2 per
            cent. £500,001 to £1,000,000; 3 per cent. £1,000,001 to £2,000,000;
            and 4 per cent, over £2,000,000. Based on the financial results for the year
            1962-63, the effect would be to increase the total licence fees payable by all
            television stations from £112,896 to £400,000 and in the case of broadcasting
            stations from £109,544 to about £125,000. Only the four metropolitan
            television stations in Sydney and Melbourne earn in excess of £2,000,000 and thus
            they will be the only stations which will be subject to the 4 per cent, rate on revenue
            in excess of £2,000,000. All of the other metropolitan stations except Hobart are
            earning either a little more or a little less than £1,000,000- three of these
            stations earned over £1,000,000 for the first time in 1962-63 and would be subject
            to the 3 per cent, rate on the excess over £1,000,000. None of the country
            television stations would pay more than 1 per cent, on its present earnings but some of
            these stations will enter the 2 per cent, area in the years to come. Only three
            broadcasting stations earn over £500,000 at present and only those three stations
            will be subject to the higher rate of 2 per cent, on revenue in excess of £500,000.</para>
                    <para>Clause 7 of the Bill gives the Minister a discretionary power, in certain
            circumstances, to treat as gross earnings of a licensee, advertising receipts collected
            by related organisations. This provision is necessary to ensure that all income properly
            attributable to the licensee is included in his gross earnings. I commend the Bill to
            the House.</para>

                    <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942- 1963,
            as amended by the Broadcasting and Television Act 1964. The Bill proposes an amendment
            made necessary by the provisions of the Bills for the Television Stations Licence Fees
            Act 1964 and for the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act 1964, which I introduced
            earlier, and amendments to the licensing conditions for broadcast and television
            receivers.</para>
                    <para>Clause 3 of the Bill seeks an amendment to Section 106 of the principal Act; the
            amendment is of a machinery nature arising from the changes in the licence fees for the
            commercial broadcasting and television stations and the definition of "gross
            earnings" which now forms the basis of the fees to be paid by the stations
            concerned.</para>
                    <para>The other provisions of the Bill seek to amend the licensing arrangements for
            broadcast and television receivers. Provision is being made for the transfer of the
            responsibility for taking out licences for broadcast and television receivers provided
            as part of the furnishings of rented furnished premises from the tenant to the lessor.
            Under the present legislation, it is necessary for each tenant who has the use of a
            broadcast or television receiver which has been provided by the landlord in rented
            furnished premises to take out a licence at the prescribed full annual fee for the
            receiver concerned. As a result, with a succesion of tenants during any period of twelve
            months a number of such licences would be required in respect of the one receiver. This
            was not the intention of the present legislation and the new arrangements proposed by
            the Bill arc designed to overcome this anomaly.</para>
                    <para>The present Act enables the grant of a licence with effect from a date prior to that
            on which it is issued. An interpretation placed on the provisions of that Act and the
            Broadcasting and Television Regulations which relate to ante-dating of licences has
            raised doubts as to whether an antedated licence may be accepted as an answer to a
            charge in respect of an unlicensed receiver. The proposed section 126 (d) in clause 4 of
            the Bill specifies that in any proceeding for an offence against those sections of the
            Act which relate to licences for broadcast and television receivers, an ante-dated
            licence shall not be deemed to have been current prior to the date on which it was
            issued.</para>
                    <para>Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to introduce appropriate provisions to enable a refund of
            fees to be made by the Department where there is a moral or implied legal obligation to
            do so; for example, where a licence has been taken out unnecessarily or a person
            eligible for a reduced rate licence pays the full fee. In explanation of this clause, I
            would mention that there are occasions when a wife, not knowing that her husband has
            taken out a licence, also takes one out. Under the present provisions of the Act, there
            is no authority to make a refund. The same situation applies where a pensioner, not
            realising that he is entitled to a reduced rate licence, pays the full licence fee. We
            are not able to refund the difference in those cases and this clause is intended to
            enable us to do so. I commend the Bill for consideration by the House.</para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill and of those associated with it is to give
            effect to a number of desirable machinery changes in the repatriation legislation. In
            addition, arising from recent legal advisings and administrative difficulties in
            relation to medical treatment which has long been provided for non war caused
            disabilities, appropriate amendments are being made to section 124 of the Repatriation
            Act which authorises the making of regulations. The amendments proposed continue the
            Government's practice of making adjustments to legislation in the interests of
            ex-servicemen and their dependants as the need for them is brought to notice in the
            normal course of administration. Details of the proposals follow.-</para>
                    <para>Appeals to Assessment Appeal Tribunals are on two grounds - where pension is granted
            but the pensioner is not satisfied with the rate of pension allowed, or where a
            disability is accepted as due to war service but, in the opinion of the Repatriation
            Board or the Repatriation Commission, the degree of incapacity does not warrant a
            pension assessment. In the former category, the Tribunal, if it allows the appeal, can
            give effect to the increase from the same date as the commencement of the pension
            assessment against which the appeal was made; that is, three months before the lodgment
            of the claim. In the latter category the earliest date the Tribunal can fix is six
            months prior to the date of lodgment of the appeal and, because of the time taken to
            process claims, it happens in some cases that this is later than the date the Board or
            Commission could have fixed. The amendment proposed to section 78 will remove this
            anomaly.</para>
                    <para>The second proposal concerns the treatment of medical sustenance for service pension
            purposes. Medical sustenance is paid where a war pensioner or claimant is prevented from
            working because of the necessity for treatment of an accepted disability, or while he is
            undergoing medical investigation in connection with a war pension claim. Sustenance is
            regarded as income in assessing a service pension under the Repatriation Act, and its
            payment there-' fore leads to pension adjustments. Because sustenance is paid for
            relatively short periods the adjustments to pension are temporary, but can involve
            reduction or even suspension or cancellation of the service pension. These temporary
            adjustments cause a good deal of administrative inconvenience, and, moreover,
            cancellation or suspension of the service pension can result in the temporary loss of
            eligibility for associated medical and other Commonwealth benefits and for other
            benefits provided for these pensioners from public and private sources. The Bill
            therefore provides that for service pension purposes, medical sustenance, will not be
            regarded as income. Passage of this legislation will enable any necessary adjustment in
            total payment to be made to the sustenance allowance instead of to the service pension.</para>
                    <para>The Repatriation Act does not define a step-child. It has hitherto been thought that
            the expression includes only the child of a former marriage dissolved by death. Legal
            advice however, is that the expression may include the child of a marriage dissolved
            otherwise than by death, for example, by divorce. In principle it seems that a war
            pension should not be paid in the latter case unless the step-parent " member "
            has accepted responsibility for the child's maintenance, or unless after the
            member's death his widow has accepted that responsibility. The Bill inserts a
            definition of step-child which gives effect to this principle.</para>
                    <para>There have always been provisions in the Repatriation Act and in associated
            legislation which require the amount of war pension payable under the law of another
            part of the Queen's Dominions to be taken into account in assessing the rate of
            Australian war pension payable. As a result of some countries ceasing to be part of the
            Queen's dominions, war pension payable by those countries will no longer be taken
            into account unless an appropriate change is made in the relevant legislation. The
            present Bills make this change.</para>
                    <para>Three changes are being made in service pensions provisions. The first removes the
            present means test as to the child's own means in the case of the first or only
            child of a service pensioner if he is in the custody of his parents. This brings the
            service pension provision into line in this regard with the comparable provision for
            child's allowance payable under the Social Services Act to the wife of an invalid
            pensioner who has custody of a child. The position of a child not in its parents'
            custody remains unaltered.</para>
                    <para>A further amendment removes any doubt regarding the eligibility for payment of the
            higher rate of 15s. per week service pension to a younger child where the pension of an
            older child ceases and, in such a case, for the payment of the lower rate of 2s. 6d. per
            week to any younger children not exceeding three in number.</para>
                    <para>The third amendment in the service pension area relates to payment of service
            pension during the temporary absence overseas of the pensioner. Under the Repatriation
            Act a service pension may be continued during the temporary absence of the pensioner
            from Australia for a period of up to six months irrespective of which country the
            pensioner visits. Under the Social Services Act a social service pension may in similar
            circumstances be continued generally for a period of up to twelve weeks. However, in
            consequence of reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom and New Zealand, social
            service pensioners visiting those countries may have their pensions continued for an
            indefinite period.</para>
                    <para class="block">The Repatriation Act is being amended to enable the Commission to
            extend the period of payment for visitors to the United Kingdom and New Zealand, on the
            lines of the arrangements for social service pensioners, while retaining the existing
            policy of six months limitation for visitors to other countries.</para>
                    <para>Under the Repatriation regulations medical treatment may be provided for the widows
            of deceased members of the Forces as well as for certain other dependants. In
            consequence of a recent legal advising it appears that there may be some doubt about
            whether this provision in the regulations is sustained by the regulation-making power in
            section 124 of the Repatriation Act as it presently stands. An amendment to section 124
            included in this Bill will put this matter beyond doubt.</para>
                    <para>The Repatriation regulations also authorise medical treatment for disabilities not
            due to war service for certain ex-servicemen who are seriously disabled as a result of
            war service, for war nurses of 1914-18 war and for member service pensioners.
            Regulations in force since 1943 have authorised the Commission to recover the cost of
            such treatment where the patient has a right of recovery against some other person by
            way of damages or compensation. Doubts have recently been expressed about whether the
            regulation-making power authorises the provisions for charge and recovery in these cases
            and there have been difficulties in proving the cost of treatment where this has been
            disputed. The opportunity is therefore being taken in this Bill to confirm that the
            regulations may provide for the recovery of the cost of treatment in such cases and that
            the regulations may authorise an appropriate scale of charges in these circumstances.</para>
                    <para>Certain of the amendments I have mentioned will also need to be applied to other
            repatriation legislation. The Bills accompanying this measure give effect to these
            requirements. They are the Interim Forces Benefits Bill, the Repatriation (Far East
            Strategic Reserve) Bill and the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Bill. In the
            case of the Far East Strategic Reserve Bill the opportunity is being taken to insert a
            provision validating certain payments under that Act which were made prior to the making
            of regulations.</para>
                    <para>As I have indicated the Bills make a number of changes in the interests of the
            welfare of ex-servicemen and of common sense administration and I commend them to the
            House.</para>

                        As I said earlier, I am presenting this Bill on behalf of the Minister

                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Freeth),</inline>
                        because the
            greater part of the Bill is concerned with amendments similar to those in the Bills I
            have previously presented.
                    </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will recall that in the course of the debate on the recent
            Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Bill it was indicated that a further Bill would
            be introduced as soon as possible to give effect to certain other proposals. This is the
            Bill now before us. I shall deal with the main operative clauses of the Bill seriatim.
            Clause 3 inserts a definition of step-son and step-daughter, because such a definition
            has been found to be necessary in the light of recent legal advice. The definition will
            ensure that for the purposes of the Act " step-child " will be confined to a
            stepchild of a mariner where the previous marriage of the mariner's spouse has been
            dissolved by death, or otherwise than by death and the child is in the custody, care and
            control of the mariner, or is being maintained by him, or in the case of his death was
            in his custody, care and control or was being maintained by him at the time of his
            death, or after his death is in the care, custody and control of his widow. Appropriate
            wording is included to cover cases where the mariner is a female.</para>
                    <para>Clause 4 ensures that in cases where the marriage of a pensioner under the Act is
            dissolved otherwise than by death, the wife of the pensioner ceases to be eligible for
            payment of pension under the Act.</para>
                    <para>Section 53a of the Act requires that where a mariner or any of his dependants is
            entitled to receive a war pension or other benefits under the law of another part of the
            Queen's dominions the amount involved is to be taken into account in assessing the
            rate of war pension or other benefit payable under this Act. Clause 5 amends the Act to
            provide that such amounts should continue to be taken into account where the country
            concerned ceases to be a part of the dominions of the Crown, so that there will not be
            the advantage in such cases of such payments not being taken into account in the
            assessment of entitlement under the Act. Clause 6 deals with two matters. First, by
            virtue of paragraph (e) of section 59 as being inserted by paragraph (a) of this clause,
            provision is being made for the provision of medical, hospital and surgical benefits at
            Commonwealth expense for illnesses suffered by mariner pensioners who are receiving the
            full general (100 per cent.) rate pension, or a higher rate of pension, where such
            illnesses are not directly attributable to war injury, to the same extent as is now
            provided to ex-servicemen. Secondly, it inserts a power authorising the recovery of the
            cost of medical treatment for disabilities not due to war service for certain classes of
            seriously disabled mariners where the mariner has a right of recovery against some other
            person by way of damages or compensation. In addition to effecting minor amendments
            necessary to clarify the meaning of the Act and to remove certain anomalies the
            amendment confers real benefits on seriously disabled mariner pensioners and I am sure
            it will have the support of all the honorable members.</para>

                    <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>This Bill has three purposes. Two of them are quite formal, but the third is a
            matter of substantial importance in the administration of justice in the Australian
            Capital Territory and is the reason for bringing the legislation before the House at
            this time. The substantial matter is a proposed amendment to ensure an appropriate right
            of appeal to persons who plead guilty in the Australian Capital Territory to criminal
            charges before a magistrate and are committed by the magistrate for sentence and are
            subsequently sentenced by the</para>
                    <para class="block">Supreme Court. The Act presently provides for appeal to the High Court
            by " a person convicted on indictment before the Supreme Court", and leave of
            the High Court is necessary where a person so convicted seeks to appeal only against
            sentence. The High Court recently held that a person sentenced by the Supreme Court
            after plea of guilty and committal for sentence was not " a person convicted on
            indictment" and that therefore the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain his
            appeal. There has been judicial comment here in the Australian Capital Territory that
            any appeal prospect should not be denied to an accused, and with this comment I am sure
            honorable members will at once agree. I have therefore adopted an interim practice of
            signing ex-officio indictments in cases of committal for sentence. This ensures that,
            even though there is a plea of guilty, there is a conviction on indictment which is
            appealable. A permanent remedy is, however, essentia], and the Bill will therefore
            operate directly to preserve the appeal rights in cases where the simple committal for
            sentence procedure is followed and there is no indictment at all.</para>
                    <para>The opportunity has been taken to include in the Bill a provision to put beyond
            doubt that the judges of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory may hold
            judicial appointments in other Territories without affecting the validity of their
            Australian Capital Territory commissions. They do not of course receive any additional
            remuneration in respect of these other appointments. The Conciliation and Arbitration
            Bill at present before the House makes clear that the Judges' commissions as judges
            of the Commonwealth Industrial Court are not affected, but that Bill leaves it to the
            Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act to protect the Supreme Court commissions.
            In other words, the two Bills are complementary. The Supreme Court Act at present deals
            with the position so far as the permanent judge is concerned but not the additional
            judges. The Bill before the House closes that gap. It also brings the relevant section,
            8a, up to date in another respect by omitting its existing provisions that a judge may
            hold the office of Judge AdvocateGeneral of a part of the defence force and that he may
            hold other non-judicial office, not being an office of profit, with the approval of the
            Governor-General. In recent times a judge has not held the appointment of Judge
            Advocate-General and it is probably undesirable that he should do so because it is not a
            judicial appointment. Regarding a judge holding other nonjudical office, the Acts
            creating other federal and Territory courts do not contain provisions permitting it, and
            it would be consistent to omit the provision in the Australian Capital Territory also.</para>
                    <para>The remaining matter dealt with in the Bill is the matter of appointment of court
            officials such as the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, and the Sheriff. There is need to
            permit the appointment of additional deputy registrars and of deputy sheriffs. The Bill
            provides for this. It also provides that all court officials will, in future, be
            appointed by the Attorney-General instead of by the Governor-General. The
            Attorney-General appoints court officials in the Northern Territory, and there seems to
            be no reason why the Governor-General should be required to appoint them in the
            Australian Capital Territory. I commend the Bill to the House.</para>

                    <para>The immediate purpose of this Bill is to give effect to international arrangements
            covering the exercise of jurisdiction over members of the United Nations Force in
            Cyprus. Honorable members will recall that earlier this year the Commonwealth Government
            was asked by the United Nations to furnish some forty policemen for service with the
            United Nations Force. These men were not to perform military duties, but were to
            undertake roles which the Commander of the United Nations Force considered could be
            better filled by civilian police. The Commonwealth and the States have co-operated in
            meeting the request of the United Nations. The Police Forces of all States are
            represented in the unit that has been serving in Cyprus since 25th</para>
                    <para class="block">May 1964; so are the Commonwealth Police Force and the Forces of the
            Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The Australian police have been
            well received in Cyprus by the Greek and Turkish communities, and also by the United
            Nations authorities. I am pleased to inform the House that the Government has agreed to
            a request by the United Nations that Superintendent Hamilton, who is an officer of the
            Commonwealth Police Force, and who was the officer-in-charge of the Australian Police
            Unit, be seconded to the United Nations to become Police Adviser to the Commander of the
            United Nations Force in Cyprus. He will succeed the Chief Constable of Stockholm who
            formerly held this post and who has returned to Sweden. Superintendent Hamilton has for
            some time been acting as Deputy to the Police Adviser. This is a distinct honour,
            especially when regard is had to the fact that the United Nations Force includes police
            from four countries other than Australia, namely, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and New
            Zealand.</para>
                    <para>
                        The House will also be interested to know that the United Kingdom defence
            authorities have praised the efforts made by the Australian police to unravel the
            circumstances surrounding the disappearance in Cyprus of two United Kingdom soldiers,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Major Macey</inline>
                        and Trooper Platt. Although,
            regrettably, their investigations did not succeed in identifying the abductors, the
            thoroughness of their work under trying conditions was described as magnificent. The
            United Nations Force in Cyprus is operating under a status of forces agreement concluded
            between the United Nations and the Republic of Cyprus. The agreement extends to the
            Australian Police Unit. Honorable members will, I think, be familiar with the general
            pattern of these status of forces agreements, and they will recall, in particular, the
            agreement concluded last year between the Commonwealth and the United States with regard
            to the exercise of jurisdiction over United States forces in Australia. Here we have the
            reverse position, and we are concerned with the exercise of jurisdiction over Australian
            personel in another country. Under the agreement concluded with the United Nations, the
            Republic of Cyprus has made very substantial concessions in favour of countries that
            have contributed personnel to the United Nations Force. The concessions so made, indeed,
            take away entirely the right of the Cyprus courts to exercise jurisdiction in respect of
            offences committed by members of that Force. At the same time, all countries
            contributing personnel have an obligation, pursuant to the status of forces agreement,
            to see to it that their own laws apply, and that the jurisdiction of their own courts is
            available, in relation to any offences that might be committed by their personnel. At
            the moment there is, so to speak, a legal vacuum insofar as members of the Australian
            Police Unit are concerned. They are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Cyprus
            courts, and yet, as matters stand, the laws in force in Australia with respect generally
            to the commission of offences do not apply to them. The Bill now before the House is
            designed to fill that gap.
                    </para>
                    <para>I have referred more than once to the United Nations operations in Cyprus. The Bill
            itself, as honorable members will have perceived, makes no reference either to Cyprus or
            to the Australian Police Unit serving in that country. This is because the Government
            has thought it desirable to introduce legislation that will be sufficiently
            comprehensive to cover both the present Cyprus arrangements and any future arrangements
            involving civilians who may be serving at any time, and in any capacity - whether as
            members of a police unit or otherwise! - in connection with United Nations peace-keeping
            operations. The Bill, it will be noted, is not concerned - I emphasise the word
            "not" - with the position of members of the defence force. The laws applying to
            members of the defence force are already in a form that enables advantage to be taken of
            status of forces agreements of the kind that we have been discussing. Members of the
            defence force are, accordingly, expressly excluded from the definition of "person to
            whom this Act applies" in Clause 3 of the Bill.</para>
                    <para>I have just two further comments to make before looking at the scheme which the Bill
            adopts with regard to the exercise of jurisdiction by Australian courts. First, it
            would, of course, be hoped, and expected, that Australians serving with a United Nations
            force would not commit offences against the criminal law, and the Bill is not to be
            looked upon as somehow envisaging that, in particular, Australian police will be likely
            to commit breaches of the law. But - and this is my second point - if, perchance,
            expectations in that regard are not realised, the person concerned will have the very
            real safeguard of trial in an Australian court in accordance with law in the same way as
            if the act or omission had occurred in Australia itself.</para>
                    <para>Broadly, what the Bill does is to make it an offence for a person to whom it applies
            to do anything in the place in which he is serving which would be an offence if it were
            done in the Australian Capital Territory. Although, as in the present case, it is likely
            that Australian members of the force would be drawn from different States, it is for
            obvious reasons necessary to apply a single law and the law of the Australian Capital
            Territory has been selected for this purpose, as it was in the Crimes (Aircraft) Act
            passed by Parliament last year.</para>
                    <para>The Bill provides for an offender to be returned to Australia and there charged with
            an offence. It further provides that the law of the State or Territory where a person is
            charged with an offence shall apply in respect of matters such as bail, and in respect
            of proceedings brought against that person. Jurisdiction to deal with offences is
            conferred on the courts of the States and Territories. The intention is that an offender
            would, as far as practicable, be charged and dealt with in his own State or Territory.
            This concludes my survey of the Bill. I am pleased to commend it to the House.</para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to extend the operation of the Cellulose
            Acetate Flake Bounty Act 1956-1964 for a maximum period of three months to 31st March
            1965. Under the existing Act, bounty will cease to be payable after 31st December 1964.
            The industry is at present under review by the Tariff Board which is investigating the
            general question of what assistance should be afforded the production in Australia of
            cellulose acetate flake and related products.</para>
                    <para>Although the duration of the Act has already been extended for a period of six
            months, it still appears likely that the Tariff Board's report will not be received
            in time for the Government to study it and take appropriate action before the expiry of
            the extended Act. The Board has completed its public inquiry on this matter, but the
            wide scope of reference of the inquiry has, in part at least, caused the delay in
            finalising the report. The Bill, therefore, extends the operation of the Cellulose
            Ace'.ate Flake Bounty Act 1956-1964 to 31st March 1965 or to a date to be
            proclaimed, such date to be not later than 31st March 1965 and not earlier than the date
            of proclamation. This will enable continuation of the present level of assistance to the
            industry, pending receipt and consideration of the Tariff Board's report by the
            Government. I commend the Bill to honorable members.</para>

                        <para>.- The purpose of this Bill is to increase the number of puisne judges of the
              Commonwealth Industrial Court from three to four. The last time a bill on this precise
              subject came before us was in 1960, when the number of puisne judges was increased
              from two to three. The reason given on that occasion was that one of the existing
              judges was due for long service leave and that the judges in general were required to
              establish a pool of Federal judges for Territorial Supreme Courts. On that occasion
              the suggestion was made that such a pool would be a useful adjunct to Commonwealth
              powers in many fields. It was suggested that the members could man a new Federal
              superior court. This is a matter upon which there has been a great deal of speculation
              in the last few years. In fact, I first mentioned the subject in the House in the
              debate in the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department in 1958. I raised
              the subject again in the debate on the Judiciary Bill 1959, the Patents Bill 1960 and
              the Copyright Bill 1963. On the last two occasions, on behalf of my party I suggested
              that a pool of judges should be used to hear appeals in matters of industrial
              property, which is a Commonwealth preserve under the Constitution.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        I made a similar proposal for a Federal superior court at the legal convention in
            Perth in July 1959. In January last year the then Attorney-General authorised the
            Solicitor-General to announce at the legal convention in Hobart that Cabinet authority
            had been given to design such a court. I had the temerity to refer to the delay in the
            project in the debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department at the
            first appearance of the present Attorney-General

            and he abused me for having made such a great number of proposals. I would scarce have
            ventured to mention the subject again in his hearing, even in the debate o:i this Bill,
            except for the fact that this morning our learned friend, the honorable member for
            Parramatta
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowen),</inline>
                        asked his maiden question on
            this point. I did not have the gall to point out that the very question had been on the

                    <para>The reason for the increase in the number of puisne judges on this occasion is for
            no such purpose. What is the reason? The Attorney-General has stated that the existing
            members of the Commonwealth Industrial Court have been engaged in a number of functions
            over the years. The Chief Judge, in particular, has conducted courts of marine inquiry
            under the Navigation Act. He has presided over boards of inquiry into air accidents
            under the Air Navigation Regulations - not the ones which were suddenly introduced at
            the beginning of this month, but the ones which had been in force for some years. He has
            acted also as an arbitrator under the Copyright Act, pursuant to the amendment made last
            year.</para>
                    <para class="block">In addition, he has acted as the Royal Commissioner to inquire into
            the " Voyager " disaster.</para>

                        Another member of the Commonwealth Industrial Court,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Justice</inline>
                        Eggleston, has been inquiring into the proper scale of salaries which
            the Commonwealth should support under the States Grants (Universities) Act. The other
            members of the Court have been engaged, as also has
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Justice</inline>
                        Eggleston, in a great deal of work as judges of the Supreme Courts of
            the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. All these matters, except
            the Royal Commission into the "Voyager" disaster and the inquiry into university
            salaries, are functions which members of the Industrial Court have fulfilled for some
            years. There is no new feature about this work. Perhaps there is a new feature in that
            the judges have been asked to undertake specific inquiries and even royal commissions.
                    </para>
                    <para>Perhaps the House should consider whether Federal judges should be encouraged to
            accept commissions as royal commissioners. The theory in Australia very often has been,
            particularly in the States, that by asking a judge to sit as a royal commissioner one
            removes some contentious political issue into a more rarefied, wholesome and serene
            atmosphere. The result has more often been to bring the judge who accepts the commission
            into the more turbulent and contentious arena where the issue originally arose. Judges
            of the Supreme Court of New South Wales have for many years accepted such commissions,
            though probably not quite so ignominiously in recent years as they did 30 and 40 years
            ago. The Supreme Court of Victoria has always taken the attitude that its members would
            not sit as royal commissioners. The only exceptions have been pursuant to Acts of the
            State Parliament which have directed judges to accept such commissions.</para>
                    <para>
                        The judges of the High Court of Australia have always eschewed such royal
            commissions. The only case in which a royal commission was accepted by a High Court
            judge was, I think, 40 years or more ago. Judges of the United States Supreme Court have
            not accepted presidential commissions except in the most extraordinary circumstances.
            The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has just concluded such a
            commission to inquire into the assassination of President Kennedy, but it is more than
            20 years since another member of the court,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Justice</inline>
                        Roberts, accepted a commission to inquire into the conduct of the
            persons responsible for the arrangements at Pearl Harbour at the time of Japan's
            onslaught. Therefore, we should not lightly facilitate the acceptance of royal
            commissions by Federal judges. It may be that judges of the Commonwealth Industrial
            Court are expected to take such commissions. The Attorney-General did not refer to the
            propriety or wisdom of their doing so. I should have thought that this was a matter
            which should be dealt with more deliberately and specifically than it was dealt with in
            his second reading speech.
                    </para>
                    <para>It would have struck all honorable members as a matter of some novelty that one
            clause of the Bill has been inserted to permit Federal judges - members of the
            Commonwealth Industrial Court - to accept temporary apointments to sit in courts outside
            Australian jurisdiction. This is certainly a departure from every previous practice in
            Australia. The specific instance which gives rise to this change in the law is a request
            from the Colonial Government of Fiji. Surely the general principle in any democracy is
            that the law of a country is administered by judges appointed by the Government elected
            in the country. This is the basis of the objection of the Australian Labour Party to
            appeals to the Privy Council. It is not proper or democratic that actions between
            Australian citizens and companies should be determined by judges appointed by another
            government which is not responsible to the Australian people. Here again, if I may make
            bold to say so, I asked the Attorney-General, without notice at the beginning of the
            year, and on notice over a month ago, whether arrangements had been made for judges of
            the High Court, who are now all members of the Privy Council, to sit in Australia to
            hear appeals which lie from State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council - that is, whether
            arrangements will at lust be made for judges appointed by the Australian Government to
            determine issues which arise between Australian citizens and corporations. Should
            Australia participate in some sort of Pacific privy council? I doubt it. At all events,
            here again, more deliberate and specific consideration should be given to this question
            than was given in the Minister's second reading speech.</para>
                    <para>Those are the two reasons given by the Minister for appointing another judge to the
            Commonwealth Industrial Court - to act as a royal commissioner and to act in colonial
            courts. He does not mention the reason that he gave in the debate on the Copyright Act
            in April of last year. Honorable members may wonder how this subject arose when we were
            debating the Copyright Act. I remind the House that during that debate I took the
            opportunity to forecast, and then to move, an amendment that appeals under the Copyright
            Act - these are matters of industrial property - should lie to judges of the
            Commonwealth Industrial Court instead of being heard by judges of the High Court. The
            Attorney-General, before he had been elevated to the Ministry or admitted to the inner
            bar, supported the general idea that such judges should hear such appeals. He developed
            the theme further. He said that another judge should be appointed to the Commonwealth
            Industrial Court to give a prompt hearing to applications under section 109 of the
            Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. He has not given that reason on this
            occasion, but that is the reason why we now have this Bill, which provides for the
            appointment of another judge. The Attorney-General naturally has not said who the judge
            is to be, although, as I understand the practice of the Menzies Government, it is to
            appoint members of the Sydney bar to the High Court and of the Melbourne bar to the
            Commonwealth Industrial Court. In either case, there is an ample reservoir of talent for
            both courts.</para>
                    <para>
                        If the Commonwealth Industrial Court were to confine itself to its traditional
            functions - that is, the matters it dealt with during its first years of operation and
            matters under the Air Navigation Regulations, the Navigation Act and the Territorial
            Supreme Courts - the Court would have enough members to carry on its work just as
            expeditiously and efficiently as it has hitherto. Another judge is only required because
            of the astonishing increase in the amount of work arising under sections 109 and 111 of
            the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It will be recalled that these
            sections were introduced under different numbers by the Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline>
                        when he was Minister for Labour and
            National Service in 1951. The Australian Labour Party voted against the insertion of the
            provisions. The sections were renumbered in the codification of the Act in 1956, again
            at the instigation of the Treasurer, as he now is. Again Labour voted against the
            perpetuation of the two sections. Section 109 is the injunction section. This is the
            section, under which the Commonwealth Industrial Court orders that registered
            organisations shall obey awards or shall not disobey awards. Section 111 is the section
            under which the Court commits and fines for contempt such organisations as have
            disobeyed orders made under section 109 or under the corresponding section of the
            Stevedoring Industry Act. For many years after these sections were introduced, no very
            great resort was made to them. Employers had not developed the reflex action which they
            have shown in the last few years by making an application under section 109 whenever
            there is a dispute and then, if they do not achieve their ends, acting under section
            111. These sections have become a very great source of industrial irritation.

                to establish, and I am certain I will establish to your satisfaction, that it is
                only because the activities with which I am now dealing have increased so greatly in
                number and severity in the last few years that there is any call to increase the
                numbers of the judges, as this Bill does. If the activities that 1 am now describing
                had not developed to the extent that they have, there would be no need to increase
                the numbers of the puisne judges of the Court.

                    </continue><para>My party certainly supports the principles of conciliation and arbitration. There is
            no portion of the Commonwealth's Constitution, except perhaps its financial powers,
            that has flowered as luxuriantly as the arbitration power. The arbitration power has now
            become a system of discipline for persons employed in industry, and in the last few
            years the disciplinary powers inserted in the principal Act in 1951 and re-enacted in
            1956 have come to full flower. It is for this reason that the numbers of the judges of
            the Court are now to be increased. The mischief arises from the too ready resort to
            these powers by employers. It is vitiating the whole spirit of industrial relations.
            Employers always hold the whip hand over any union or organisation of employees; if
            there is any interruption in employment, any strike or any working to award, the
            employers will apply to the Court under section 109. There is never any period of
            negotiation. This applies not only to such overseas companies as General
            MotorsHolden's Pty. Ltd. but also to the indigenous employers. No opportunity is
            given for the use of the conciliation processes under the Act. Little enough time is
            given for the arbitration processes.</para><para>
                        There is an immediate resort - a reflex action by the employers - to these penal
            provisions, section 109 and the consequential section 111. I will illustrate the extent
            to which this function of the court has been called in aid by referring to an article in
            the journal of the Industrial Relations Society of October 1963 and also to answers
            given to questions put on notice in another place by my learned colleague,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen,</inline>
                        and in this place by my colleague the
            honorable member for Grayndler

                        I point
            out that there are a number of Government members who deplore this too ready resort to
            the penal provisions. If one can rely on newspaper accounts or on glances exchanged
            between members of the Ministry there is a deal of embarrassment among- Ministers on
            this subject. The Minister for Labour and National Service
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline>
                        not too promptly, but inevitably as it turned out, had to
            remove some penal provisions from the Stevedoring Indus try Act. He has been trying to
            moderate the use by the employer organisations of penal provisions in this Act, but the
            provisions remain.
                    </para><para>I shall now quote figures which will establish the amazing increase that there has
            been in the resort to these sections. In the journal of the Industrial Relations Society
            an article by Professor J. E. Isaacs, then Professor of Economics at the University of
            Melbourne and now at Monash University, stated -</para><quote>
                        <para>Since 1961, the Commonwealth penal provisions have been administered more
              frequently, more heavily and more widely than in any previous period. In the 12 years
              ending 1961, there were 203 applications for orders under section 109 and its
              precursor section 29. Of these, 109 orders were made absolute. These represent an
              annual average of 17 and 9 respectively and may be compared with 67 and SO for 1962,
              in which year a larger variety of unions than usual, numbering 20, were involved as
              respondents in these proceedings. And the annual average for the first half of 1963 is
              nearly twice the corresponding figures for 1962. In the same 12 years, SO fines were
              imposed under sections 29a and 111 amounting to £13,800. In 1962, there were 28
              fines amounting to £9,150. More than half of this amount was incurred by the
              Waterside Workers' Federation, the rest being borne by eight other unions. And in
              the first half of 1963, 23 fines amounting to £9,200 were imposed.</para>

            4; 1962, 28; 1963, 37; and in 1964, until 27th August, when the honorable member put his
            question on the notice paper, 61. I will not go through all the details of the amounts
            of the fines, but after the beginning of 1962 all fines were for amounts of three
            figures. Before that, particularly in New South Wales, more often than not they had been
            for amounts of £50 and once for £5. As a matter of fact, in the last two years
            most fines have been £500, the maximum. This illustrates the increasing number of
            times that unions have been brought before the Commonwealth Industrial Court under
            section 109, and the corresponding section of the Stevedoring Industry Act, and section
            111. The figures also illustrate the increasing severity of the fines which have been
            imposed. One might assume that the greater resort to the penal provisions of the Act has
            been brought about by some increase in the number of industrial disputes, or in the
            number of workers involved in disputes, or the number of working days lost in disputes
            in the last 10 years. This is not the position. I shall commence by giving the figure
            for 1954 of the number of industrial disputes in Australia and then read the figures for
            subsequent years - 1,490, 1.532, 1,306, 1,103, 987, 869, 1,145, 815, 1,183, 1,250, and
            in the last financial year 1,338.

                            <para>- The statistician whose industrial disputes bulletin I am quoting does not
                define " industrial disputes " other than as stoppage of work for 10 man
                days or more. It might be thought that there has been a slight increase in the
                number of disputes in the last three years. I will not give the number of workers
                involved in the 10 years, but for the same 10 years I will now read the average
                number of working days lost per worker involved. The averages were 2.44, 2.27, 2.62,
                1.87, 1.56, 1.54, 1.20, 2.02, 1.44 and 1.41. In the first two quarters of this year,
                the averages were 1.18 and 1.25. So there has been no relation between resort to
                stoppages of work by employees and resort to the penal sections of the Conciliation
                and Arbitration Act by employers. The average number of working days lost per worker
                has in fact fallen and is now very much less than it was ten years ago. Over the
                last two years, it has shown no increase. But it is during those years that resort
                to the penal sections of the Act has increased. If these penal provisions are to be
                used as often as they have been in the last two years, not only will the Government
                be embarrassed, as it has been, by the truculence, intransigence and inflammatory
                attitudes of its industrial supporters, but also hardship to all in this country
                will result. In other words, the whole spirit of industrial relations will worsen.</para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Both sections 109 and 111 should now be repealed. If the Government is determined to
            preserve the sections, it should make them conditional on prior consultation and
            conciliation. Thus, following amendments this month, employers cannot commence
            proceedings under the penal provisions of the New South Wales Arbitration Act without
            leave given by a member of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales. Leave will not
            be granted unless the judge before whom an application for leave is made is satisfied
            that the employer had not himself taken part in any lockout which had wholly or in part
            given rise to the strike, had given notice to the Industrial Registrar of the matters
            giving rise to the strike, or had given notice of the strike, and, to the extent to
            which the circumstances permitted, had made a bona fide attempt to negotiate a
            settlement. The recent amendments to the New South Wales Act ensure that employers,
            before they resort to the penal sections of the industrial arbitration legislation,
            shall make a genuine attempt to negotiate, to conciliate and to arbitrate. Similar
            provisions should now be made in the Commonwealth Act. if the Government is not prepared
            to repeal the sections outright.</para><para>As the Ministry itself realises, the sections inserted in the Commonwealth statute
            in 1951, and re-enacted in 1956, are now being abused by employers. There is no
            industrial justification for employers resorting to the penal sections as often as they
            have done. If the Ministry's wishes in this respect were heeded by its industrial
            backers and fewer applications were made under section 109, the present membership of
            the Commonwealth Industrial Court would be quite adequate to deal with all the business
            coming before the judges as members of that Court, as members of the territorial Supreme
            Courts, and in marine and air accident inquiries. The Court would be well able to cope
            with all its business, as it was able to do until two years ago. It would be able to
            deal with its business more promptly than most courts deal with their business, as it
            was able to do until two years ago. The processes of the Court are being abused by
            employers. The remedy is available to the Government. If repeal or amendment would
            involve too great a capitulation and too much loss of face, the Ministry should at least
            try to restrain its backers. It does not need to ask the Parliament to increase the
            number of judges of the Court so that employers can abuse the processes of the Act and
            so disrupt the country's economy. The Opposition will oppose the increase in the
            number of members of the Commonwealth Industrial Court proposed on this occasion.</para><para>Question put - </para><para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para></speech>

            effect to the Government's decisions in respect of the Tariff Board's reports on
            elastic and elastomeric fabrics, fish in air-tight containers, and electrical
            generators, motors and rotary converters. At a later stage I shall table the relevant
            reports.</para>
                    <para>The Tariff Board has recommended the removal of protective duties from a range of
            elastomeric fabrics in accordance with its finding that local production does not
            require assistance. Free entry is proposed under the British preferential tariff and the
            most favoured nation rate is being fixed at the lowest level consistent with
            international commitments. It is proposed to continue the present protective duties on
            canned tuna but to increase the duties on fish cutlets and the like and on the cheaper
            grades of salmon, when packed in air-tight containers. However, no alteration in the
            rates for salmon is proposed at this stage pending the outcome of international
            consultations. All other fish in air-tight containers will carry minimum rates of duty.</para>
                    <para>On electrical generators, motors and rotary converters, protective rates of duty at
            common levels of 27i per cent. British preferential tariff and 40 per cent, most
            favoured nation are proposed. These duties will only apply to electrical machinery below
            certain power ratings. Nonprotective rates of free British preferential tariff and 71
            per cent, otherwise are proposed for generators, motors and rotary converters above
            those ratings. The duties on certain generators and starting motors for motor vehicles
            remain unchanged. In the main the proposed duties amount to a moderate increase in the
            level of protection and an extension of the protected range.</para>
                    <para>The alterations proposed by Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Proposals No. 7
            are complementary to those proposed by Customs Tariff Proposals No. 23 in respect of
            fish in air-tight containers. The preferential tariff treatment now being accorded to
            New Zealand is being maintained. I commend the proposals to honorable members.</para>

                        <para>
                            .- The Bills now before the House, the principal one of which was introduced by
              the Minister for the Army
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes),</inline>
                            clearly
              have been made necessary by a change in the developing international situation in
              which the old definitions of peace and war are no longer applicable. Whilst some
              honorable members opposite may not support our views on the changes which we believe
              have developed in the international situation, it is clear that the prime distinction
              between peace and war is no longer relevant. There are some people who will say that
              South Vietnam is at war with other countries and that Malaysia is at war with
              Indonesia, if we apply the definitions of some previous time. Under the existing
              defence legislation it would not be possible to employ Australian forces, such as the
              Citizen Military Forces and the Reserves - I do not refer to the Australian Regular
              Army - in the kind of situation that could develop to the north of Australia and with
              which Australia may be faced unless we in fact entered a period of war in which the
              clean-cut definitions of earlier times were appropriate. So it has been necessary to
              change the law in relation to these matters so that Australian forces might not be
              hamstrung and forced to remain inside Australia under conditions which would make it
              necessary for them to be used in support of allies in areas outside Australia in the
              defence of things in which we believe.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I think the measures have been adequately and clearly explained by the respective
            Ministers. The permanent forces are, of course, always available to serve anywhere in
            Australia or overseas. In this legislation the Minister for the Army has made it clear
            that new Emergency Reserves for each of the three services will be established and that
            those Emergency Reserves may be used for limited periods with service anywhere abroad.
            This will be a useful addition to the regular forces. However, if the situation
            deteriorated, and if the Governor-General declared a state of defence emergency, the
            forces available to be used overseas could be increased dramatically at one stroke.
            Under those conditions, the Emergency Reserve, instead of merely being liable for
            temporary service, would then become liable for permanent service while the condition of
            defence emergency lasted. At the same time the effect of such a declaration of a state
            of defence emergency would be to make it possible for both the Regular Reserves and the
            Citizen Military Forces to be called up,</para>
                    <para class="block">Of course, if this had to be done, a report containing reasons for the
            call up would have to be made to the Parliament. So here we have a clear progression
            starting with the Regular Army and ending with the call up of the Regular Reserve and
            the Citizen Military Forces under a condition of defence emergency.</para>
                    <para>If the situation deteriorated still further and Australia entered into a period of
            war in its fullest sense, then, clearly, this would lead to full mobilisation. It is
            important to understand that the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, which will be entirely
            voluntary, will also be available even if there is no state of defence emergency, but,
            under those conditions, its members will not be available for continuous service for
            periods greater than 12 months at any one time. The provisions contained in these
            measures will make it possible for the Emergency Reserve to provide a useful, if small,
            addition to the forces immediately available to us.</para>
                    <para>It is important to examine these changes that are being introduced in relation to
            the possible threats which could confront Australia. I think most people in this House
            will agree that it is unlikely that a general or global war will develop in South East
            Asia. I think they will agree, too, that it is not at all impossible that Australia
            could have commitments, in conjunction with our allies, on more than one front, which
            would involve many thousands of troops and that such a situation could arise when, in
            fact, we were not in a condition of general war in the old sense as denned in the
            Defence Act. If such a situation did arise and the Bills under consideration were not
            passed by this House, a large part of the Australian forces could not, in fact, be used
            to help meet our commitments. The legislation now before us will make considerably
            larger forces available to the Government of the day to assist Australia in meeting
            whatever commitments might face her in South East Asia, or in the situation between
            Malaysia and Indonesia.</para>
                    <para>The House and the country should welcome the fact that the Government has introduced
            these changes. It goes without saying, of course, that everyone who volunteers for
            service in the Regular Army, in the Emergency Reserve and in the C.M.F. will be liable
            for service not only in Australia but anywhere overseas. This is an essential part of
            the Government's plan for defence forces which can much more properly and much more
            adequately meet the threats that could well confront Australia.</para>
                    <para>I am glad to see that in this legislation there are provisions which should be
            adequate for preserving the positions in civil employment of those members of the C.M.F.
            and the Emergency Reserve who may be called up for short or long periods, depending upon
            the position that may arise. Not only their positions but their right to re-engagement
            and their seniority are preserved. This is a most important clement of the legislation
            and is necessary if the Government is to expect adequate numbers to volunteer for
            service in the C.M.F. and the Emergency Reserve.</para>
                    <para>
                        This legislation should be looked at in its proper perspective. It is part of a
            graduated response that began in May 1963 with a defence statement by the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline>
                        in which he announced that
            there would be considerable additions to the Australian armed forces. Since that time
            other additions have been made, and this legislation, as the Minister has pointed out,
            is only giving effect to decisions that were announced last June with relation to the
            creation of the Emergency Reserve and a change in the conditions of service for members
            of tha C.M.F.
                    </para>
                    <para>It should not bc thought by anyone that this is the final step in what the
            Government is doing with relation to defence. It has been made quite plain that a
            general review is being made of defence at the present time, and it is hoped that a
            statement will be placed before the House before it finally rises later this year, so
            that what the Government proposes may be debated in the Parliament if necessary. The
            legislation before us will lead to a more useful addition to Australia's forces, and
            in particular, to the Army. Prior to the introduction of the legislation, we had a
            permanent Army with a total strength of 23,000 or 24,000 men to meet any defence
            situation which Australia is likely to meet As a result of this legislation, the
            Emergency Reserve and the C.M.F. can also be used. I say again that it is much more
            likely that we will face a condition of limited war, not general war as defined in the
            Defence Act, or with a need to prevent subversion or to counteract the effects of
            subversion in South East Asia, perhaps in relation to the dispute between Malaysia and
            Indonesia. The provisions of this legislation will make it possible for the Government
            and the Australian forces to meet any commitments that might confront them. I emphasise
            that this legislation should not be taken by anyone as the Government's final step
            in the current build up of Australia's armed forces which the strategic situation to
            the north has made necessary.</para>
                    <para>
                        If honorable members opposite propose to take the attitude which was adopted by
            their colleagues in another place, it would appear likely that they will support this
            legislation. I will certainly welcome that support and their recognition of the fact
            that if service in the Australian forces is to provide some addition to Australia's
            defence then it must involve service overseas in the real sense. Even though it appears
            that, generally, the Opposition would support this legislation, I can well imagine that
            one or two honorable members opposite would oppose it. Indeed, I would have thought that
            at least the honorable member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F.
              Cairns)</inline>
                        would argue that these provisions are quite unnecessary. Neither he
            nor those who think like him on the Opposition side, recognise the sort of defence
            situation with which Australia could be faced. They do not recognise the external
            threats to countries like South Vietnam. Indeed, if the honorable member for Yarra is to
            be believed, then, to use his own words, he would draw a line between Kamchatka and
            Darwin as being the line of containment against the eastward spread of Communism from
            Asia. This is an odd line to draw because behind it there is really nothing in the
            Pacific to contain. The honorable member's geography is probably good enough for him
            to realise that this line gives away not only Formosa, but all of South East Asia,
            including Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, because it clearly would come down
            well to the east of all the Philippines.
                    </para>
                    <para>If the honorable member is to argue that this should be our line of defence, we
            might well ask him which side of Australia he would be concerned to defend if the line
            is continued south of Darwin. Believing that everything to the east of this line from
            Kamchatka to Darwin should not be defended, which would seem to be the clear implication
            from what he said, then he must clearly deny the need for Australia to have any forces
            available for service in South East Asia, whether it be in South Vietnam, Malaysia or
            anywhere else where service may be required.</para>
                    <para>At the same time the honorable member does not appear to recognise the nature of the
            threat that confronts various areas of South East Asia and which makes it necessary for
            the Government not only to build up our forces in the general sense but also to
            introduce the kind of legislation that the House is now considering. I would just like
            to refer to some remarks the honorable member made a few days ago. On 21st October he
            said -</para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I have examined the evidence of this over a period of years - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>He was speaking of developments in the South East Asian area - and as far as I have
            been able to discover there is no evidence whatever of any material assistance coming
            from outside Vietnam - from any country outside that area.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member was repeating a conclusion that he had arrived at some
            considerable time earlier. In an earlier debate he had brought forward evidence which he
            claimed was conclusive but which will certainly not bear any detailed or close
            examination. This is important, because it is necessary to recognise and understand the
            threat that confronts Australia and her friends and allies in this area before one can
            appreciate the kind of effort that many people wish to have put into Australia's
            defence forces. If we do not understand the nature of the threat, what we do in relation
            to our Navy, Army and Air Force will certainly be misconceived. The honorable member for
            Yarra, in giving to the House evidence which he claimed was conclusive, quoted some
            remarks made by various other persons, of which I will give one or two examples. He said
            on 13th August 1964 -</para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The former head of the United States military forces in South Vietnam, General
              Paul D. Harkins, said at a Press conference in Saigon -</para>
                        <para>The guerrillas obviously are not being reinforced or supplied systematically from
              North Vietnam . . .</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The important word there is " systematically", because that
            expression clearly implies that a certain amount of equipment or a certain number of
            people are coming down at regular intervals, and no-one would contend that this was
            necessarily so. But it is significant, I think, that these remarks were made by General
            Harkins in March 1963, and he has since been relieved of his command in South Vietnam or
            moved to some other post. A good deal of evidence has been gathered since then of what
            is happening in this area.</para>
                    <para>
                        The honorable member for Yarra also quoted the United States Secretary of Defence,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNamara,</inline>
                        as saying in July 1964 that he knew
            of no North Vietnamese military units in South Vietnam. Again it is important to look
            closely at the words used.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNamara</inline>
                        used the
            words "military units". When I was in South Vietnam nobody tried to tell me that
            military units from North Vietnam were operating in this area as units of the North
            Vietnamese Army. But nobody would deny that there were many people from the North
            Vietnamese Army operating as hard core stiffening in the various units of the Vietcong
            in South Vietnam. So it becomes a question of defining the terms that are used in order
            to decide what a person is talking and arguing about. To quote the Secretary of Defence
            as saying there were no military units from North Vietnam or Communist China operating
            as units in South Vietnam was certainly not to say that there were not officers,
            noncommissioned officers and instructors from North Vietnam in South Vietnam, training
            the Vietcong, supporting them and giving them necessary orders, and planning a tactical
            offensive against South Vietnam.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Some later evidence has been very concisely presented on this matter in the
            "Washington Post". I think the Minister for the Navy
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chaney)</inline>
                        quoted these remarks in the House in another debate, but since
            the honorable member for Yarra has repeated his conclusions that no outside military
            support is being offered in South Vietnam I think it is pertinent to repeat these
            comments. On 22nd June 1964 in the "Washington Post" an editorial appeared of
            which I will read two paragraphs -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It has become increasingly clear in the last few months that the war now going on
              in South Vietnam and Laos is one in which great advantage lies with North Vietnam. It
              is estimated that 300 to SOO cadres a month are being infiltrated into South Vietnam
              from North Vietnam.</para>
                        <para>Moreover, it is clear that the Vietcong in South Vietnam are being continuously
              supplied by North Vietnam with automatic weapons, 50- caliber machine guns with sights
              that make them effective against helicopters, light artillery and ammunition. Hanoi
              has directed the strategy of the war from the beginning, but now it is clear that
              day-to-day operations are being handled from North Vietnamese headquarters in as
              intimate a contact with field units as a front-line command post in a conventional
              war. So the South Vietnamese, with our help, are fighting an enemy which has its
              command posts, its reserves, its reinforcements and its quartermaster corps in a
              sanctuary beyond the reach of the South Vietnamese military power.</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">How the honorable member for Yarra can say in this House in conclusive
            terms that there is no evidence of any of this kind of activity I just cannot
            understand. All of us in this House know that the honorable member recognises only the
            evidence that suits his cause, but it would suit the cause of Australia a good deal
            better if he considered all the evidence available before making a judgment, instead of
            giving out conclusions that could only mislead the House and the people.</para>
                    <para>I would just like to conclude on this note: Recognising the threat that could
            confront Australia and recognising the possibility of war in South East Asia between
            Malaysia and Indonesia on more than one front and involving not only our troops but also
            those of our allies in tens of thousands, it is absolutely vital that Australia's
            defence forces, manpower and equipment be improved and added to to the extent that the
            Government finds itself able to add to them. The provisions of the legislation before
            the House will enable us to make a useful addition to the Australian Regular Army and
            the forces that could back that Army if at some time in the future units of the
            Australian forces had to serve overseas, on the mainland of South East Asia or in some
            other area as a result of a conflict between Malaysia and Indonesia. This measure
            provides in realistic terms for us to take steps which will be quite appropriate to
            circumstances that we may have to face. It would have been quite useless to provide for
            Citizen Military Forces or an emergency reserve that could be used overseas only if a
            state of general war were declared. In these days, when there are so few blacks and
            whites, and all is grey on the international scene, it is essential for us to be able to
            use our forces to suit our objective of securing the survival of Australia.</para>

                            .- The Opposition supports these measures. Ideally, defence matters should not be
              in controversy. Although the Opposition will suggest certain amendments, they are not
              really fundamental. I would like to comment on the speech of the honorable member for
              Wannon
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Malcolm Fraser)</inline>
                            but I feel that any
              such comment would be irrelevant at this stage. It would be more relevant to the
              debate on defence review that the Cabinet is apparently going to make during the
              recess. The honorable member's speech related to applications of military strength
              and the like in South East Asia, which is foreign policy. What we have before us is
              very largely machinery legislation. We do not feel that this is the occasion on which
              to open a general debate on foreign policy in South East Asia.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As to the legislation before us, the degrees of emergency short of war which it
            envisages seem to us to be realistic. They are a response to the new policies of "
            confrontation short of war" which we may have to encounter. Therefore there are
            powers vested in the Governor-General to proclaim emergency states which would give the
            Government the power to counter confrontations. These things, we feel, should be
            supported. We are not sure that the legislation enables any government to counter a
            situation similar to the other problem that has developed in South East Asia. We have on
            the one hand the problem of Indonesia's confrontation of Malaysia. Remember there is
            the problem of the transformation of bad political, social and economical conditions
            into a situation of complete disorder, and war waged by creating a situation of complete
            chaos and disorder. We are not certain that this legislation has any answer to that. I
            am not certain that I could envisage any amendments to the Defence Act which would have
            any particular bearing on that problem. The answer is in the field of foreign policy.</para>
                    <para>I would like to put one or two critical queries in respect of some of the statements
            which have been made in this House, in view of the new power to send overseas those
            members of the Citizen Military Forces who wish to serve overseas. The statement has
            been made in this House constantly, as if it were an unanswerable proposition, that it
            is better to fight in other people's countries than to fight in your own. I suppose
            this statement is unimpeachable if the alternatives are strictly that if you do not
            fight in another country you will be fighting in your own. But if the statement means
            that the intelligent policy all the time is to be intervening overseas, then it is often
            a false proposition. Take for example the position of the garrisons at Quemoy and Matsu.
            The forces which have formed the garrisons at Quemoy and Matsu in the face of Communist
            Chinese aggression have resisted effectively because the Communist Chinese cannot bring
            to bear against Quemoy and Matsu anything other than small forces. How unintelligent it
            would be for the garrisons at Quemoy and Matsu to leave the island on the ground that
            they should fight on other than their own territory or the Chinese mainland! They would
            be destroyed. So, it would be senseless to apply the slogan to Quemoy and Matsu. There
            are many situations in which it would be utterly unintelligent on the part of Australia
            to attempt to match our manpower against the limitless manpower of Asia on the Asian
            mainland. We would sink our manpower into the bottomless pit. France came close to doing
            this in IndoChina. We should not imagine that any slogan provides a complete solution to
            all the defence problems with which we might be confronted.</para>
                    <para>The other point I wish to make is in connection with the idea of the deployment of
            masses of manpower. Australia is a country with a highly skilled manpower compared with
            some of our neighbours in South East Asia. Undoubtedly, in regulating the introduction
            of conscription, the Government has come to the conclusion that the best defence is not
            secured by mass manpower but by highly trained and highly equipped forces which from
            technology derive enormous fire power but whose numbers, in relation to the mass of
            manpower mobilised in the past, are relatively small. What is imposed upon the
            Government by this policy is to see that the Australian forces are technologically
            equipped in the most efficient manner.</para>
                    <para>I come now to the amendments which we will be putting forward in the Committee
            stage. First of all, the Opposition hopes that a clause will be added which will provide
            for the benefits of the Repatriation Act to be extended to members of the Citizen
            Military Forces incurring disabilities during service in Australia. The C.M.F. has now
            become a force which is committed to overseas service. Troops may be injured in
            Australia. At present they will receive their compensation under the Commonwealth
            employees compensation legislation. They should gain their compensation as servicemen
            under the Repatriation Act. Clause 41 should be postponed and redrafted to provide for
            re-enlistment and re-attestation on the basis of the new commitment to overseas service.
            To put it simply, as the legislation stands the C.M.F. man is under obligation for
            overseas service unless he contracts out. We feel that the C.M.F. man should be under
            obligation for overseas service if he deliberately contracts in. We feel that the
            Government would be wiser, as it is calling on C.M.F. men for a clear new commitment, to
            provide that they make that commitment definitely and consciously. In the long run, this
            will prove more satisfactory from the point of view of the Government, the country and
            the men enlisted in the G.M.F. themselves. The rest of the provisions of the Bill
            concerning reserves and the arrangement about reserves for the armed forces seem to the
            Opposition not to be controversial.</para>
                    <para>As I have said, we desire that, on defence matters, there should be the greatest
            unity possible between the Government and the Opposition. After all, the remarkable fact
            is that over the 15 years' relationship between the Government and the Opposition no
            defence estimate has been opposed by the Opposition. Some people evidently feel that by
            misrepresenting the position of the Opposition on defence they can gain a very great
            deal of political benefit to themselves. But I should think that most countries of the
            world, looking at our situation, would have been glad to have enjoyed the degree of
            unity that has existed in this country on the subject of defence. We desire to maintain
            that unity unless we feel there is some real and vital issue of principle involved. In
            the main, these amendments are realistic adjustments to the new world in which we live.
            The Opposition will have suggestions to make in the Committee stages; otherwise, we
            support the legislation.</para>

                            before I comment on the various
              provisions in the Bill, I would like to say a few words about a couple of the thoughts
              that the honorable member for Fremantle
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Beazley)</inline>
                            put forward. He said - I thought rather theoretically - that the
              statement had been made time and time again in this House that it was better to fight
              in other people's countries than to fight in your own. It is not quite right to
              say that this has been said time and time again. This proposition has been advanced as
              an argument in support of Australia having troops in countries such as Malaysia and
              South Vietnam. But I am sure the answer that is always given as the reason for this
              country having troops overseas is not that it is better to fight in someone else's
              country than it is to fight in your own. That argument by the honorable member is, I
              think, largely theoretical. The honorable member also mentioned that the Opposition
              would be putting forward an amendment for the benefits of the Repatriation Act to be
              extended to members of the Citizen. Military Forces. I think the weakness in this
              argument to provide a blanket cover for every member of the C.M.F. is that members of
              the C.M.F. could be serving in areas which are not operational areas. They could be
              going to areas for non-operational purposes. This matter has been covered in the past
              in struggles in which Australia has been engaged by the prescribing of areas or
              sectors as operational. To my knowledge, noone who has served in an operational area,
              whether he be a member of the C.M.F. or any other force, has been excluded from the
              benefits of the Repatriation Act.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">For instance, in the last war those people who served in Darwin
            between certain dates became eligible to share in the benefits of the Repatriation Act.
            Also, anyone in the Citizen Military Forces who went into any operational area at all
            was granted entitlement under the Repatriation Act. So, -I do not really see that this
            is a vitally important amendment as far as this legislation is concerned.</para>
                    <para>In these three Bills we see provisions which are designed to step up Australia's
            preparedness for war. Their introduction has been made necessary by the increase in the
            instability of the South East Asian area. They provide further evidence of the
            Government's willingness to introduce new inducements or new measures to build up
            our armed strength, as warranted by the circumstances of the time. They underline a
            continuance of a policy of voluntary enlistment and recruitment. This principle of
            voluntary enlistment, as opposed to compulsory enlistment, is appreciated, understood
            and supported by the Australian people.</para>
                    <para>These Bills represent progressive steps to encourage people to undertake service
            training and to strengthen our preparedness for an emergency. They also underline the
            flexibility of the Government's policy which has been particularly evident over the
            past two or three years as, unfortunately, the situation in the South East Asian area
            has worsened. These Bills will enable Australia to support more strongly its treaty
            alliances, particularly the South East Asia Treaty Organisation and the Australia, New
            Zealand and United States Treaty.</para>
                    <para>
                        After these Bills become law, the Army will be composed of three structures - the
            Australian Regular Army, the Regular Army Emergency Reserve and the Citizen Military
            Forces. A similar position will exist in the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal
            Australian Air Force. As the Minister for Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator
              Paltridge)</inline>
                        pointed out in another place, the introduction of the Regular Army
            Emergency Reserve is a revolutionary move in the armed forces structure of Australia.
            The target for the Reserve is 3,600 men. The targets for the Naval Emergency Reserve and
            the Air Force Emergency Force are slightly less than that figure. All these Reserves
            will be adminis tered in almost the same way and will have almost identical conditions.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The Regular Army Emergency Reserve will be open to former regular soldiers. Those
            who volunteer for service may be called up for full time service if the Governor-General
            so decides. If he so decides, these men will be liable for 12 months service only, and
            after giving that service they will not be liable for further call up until a period of
            12 months has elapsed. In the event of war, the members of the Reserve will be liable
            for full time service. But I stress that they are to be enlisted only if they volunteer.
            They will be paid the normal rates of pay which are paid to Regular Army personnel, plus
            a bounty rising from £100 in their first year to fi 75 in their fourth year. The
            establishment of the Regular Army Emergency Reserve probably will make a big difference
            to the numbers at present in the Regular Army Reserve. As the Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes)</inline>
                        pointed out, the latter Reserve
            should be depleted considerably. But I agree that the Regular Army Emergency Reserve
            will be a much more positive force and will be more useful in Australia's defence
            effort than the present Regular Army Reserve.
                    </para>
                    <para>We all should appreciate that the people who join the Regular Army Emergency Reserve
            will face a very important decision. They will virtually be making themselves available
            to be called up at any time in the event of war and for 12 months' service if the
            Governor-General - doubtless with the advice of the Government - decides that the
            circumstances constitute an emergency and require them to be called up. Under this
            legislation, the people who join the Emergency Reserves will receive - and rightly so -
            protection in their employment. Various conditions are imposed on the employer of a
            person who joins the Emergency Reserves. Such a person, when he completes his service,
            will be given back his job and will receive, as though he had worked in his employment
            for the twelve months or other period for which he was away, his entitlements to things
            such as leave and superannuation.</para>
                    <para>But I am sure that everyone will agree that that does not cover the whole position.
            If a person is away from his employment for twelve months he may get out of touch with
            the latest developments and the people who continued to work in the firm might have an
            advantage over him. So this decision that the people whom we expect to join the
            Emergency Reserves will have to make will be very important to them. I know that the
            Government and the people of Australia will be very gratified if there is a strong
            response to the call for members of the Emergency Reserves.</para>
                    <para>The new conditions that will apply to members of the Citizen Military Forces
            represent a dramatic change. I am sure that the new conditions will give such members an
            increasing awareness of the gravity with which the Government views the situation in
            South East Asia and of the fact that the Government is charged with the responsibility
            of deciding what measures must be undertaken for the defence of Australia. Although
            members of the C.M.F. will have the alternatives of continuing to serve or of resigning
            or accepting their discharge, they will be faced with making an important decision,
            particularly if they have families. They will have to decide whether they will put
            themselves in the position where they can be called up for overseas service at a
            moment's notice. The Australian people will be appreciative if substantial numbers
            of members of the C.M.F. accept the new conditions.</para>
                    <para>Speaking generally on defence, I say that at the moment it seems to be the fashion
            when in making statements for the newspapers, writing editorials in the newspapers, or
            making speeches in this chamber, to criticise the Government's efforts for the
            defence of this country. I have listened very carefully to the speeches that have been
            made on defence by honorable members on both sides of the chamber. I have read most of
            those speeches closely. I see in them varying degrees of almost panic or hysteria in
            regard to Australia's defence. I believe that a number of the people who make these
            statements and speeches are genuinely concerned about the defence of Australia; but a
            sense of balance should be exhibited in the thoughts that are expressed by honorable
            members on both sides of the chamber. A realistic appreciation of the situation should
            be made. Certainly the international position should be taken into account, but we
            should also take into account our treaty obligations and the availability of men,
            materials and resources.</para>
                    <para>Surely no one who has approached this problem in a practical manner could say that
            we can find overnight X thousand of the skilled men who are so necessary for our armed
            forces. The battle arena and the training necessary for war are entirely different from
            what they were when most of us were of an eligible age, as 1 shall call it, in 1939,
            1940 and 1941. In those days all we had to do was join up and serve a few months doing
            elementary training and we were then almost ready for combat. Today, with the increased
            technological skills required, the complexities of weapons, aircraft and naval ships, a
            great deal more training is involved. Many more highly skilled instructors are needed
            now, and we cannot obtain them as quickly as we would wish or in the number that that we
            would wish to obtain them, for we must take into consideration other factors that make
            demands on our manpower.</para>
                    <para>Over the last three years the Government has done a very sound job in building up
            Australia's defence forces. Aircraft cannot be bought off the shelf, nor can the
            latest naval ships be bought off the shelf. If we want modern aircraft, modern ships and
            modern equipment to be available for our forces we must be prepared to equip the forces
            gradually and to develop our defence efforts on a scale that accords with developments
            overseas. Many honorable members opposite seem to have come to the conclusion that
            defence is in the fashion, so they should talk about it and criticise the
            Government's efforts. Their view seems to be: Let us try to get on side with the
            people, to put fear into the hearts of the Australian people and try to make them think
            that the Government is not doing its job for the defence of Australia. Time and time
            again we hear the words " adequate defence ", but we never hear the expression
            defined. Anybody who really thinks about the situation will know very well that
            Australia, with its huge coastline and small population, has other drains on its
            resources which make it impossible for Australia alone adequately to defend itself. The
            suggestion by honorable members opposite that we should spend more money on more
            aircraft, more ships and more weapons is just not practical.</para>

                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Benson)</inline>
                                is well known, and his service to
                Australia is well known, but as he has interjected I shall comment on a statement
                that he made last week in the debate on the Estimates. He said that we should be
                training pilots in light aircraft so that they will be ready to convert and fly the
                modern types of aircraft that we need in combat today. Thousands of pilots are being
                trained in light aircraft at this moment. Training in light aircraft was all right
                20 years ago, but nowadays the ability to fly a Tiger Moth, an Auster, a Cessna or a
                similar type of light aircraft does not equip a person to fly a Mirage fighter. No
                person, merely because he can fly a light aircraft, would be able to fly a Mirage
                fighter with only a couple of hundred hours training. It would take him 18 months
                before he would be able to fly a Mirage fighter.

                        The honorable member for Capricornia
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gray)</inline>
                        said last week that the Australian Government had to equip the Australian Army with the
            self loading FN.30 rifle because America had requested us to do so, and that when we had
            equipped our forces with this rifle America decided that she would not use it. A
            statement such as this misleads the Australian .public because it does not state the
            true position. The position was that the Australian Government decided to use the FN.30
            rifle. The honorable member for Capricornia sets himself up as an expert on Army
            equipment and speaks with a very authoritative air, but he makes many mistakes. I want
            to deal with just this mistake that he made last week. We did not choose the FN.30 rifle
            because the Americans had requested us to do so; we decided to equip our forces with
            this rifle so that it would bring us into line with the other countries in the North
            Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The FN.30 was chosen because it is a self loading rifle
            which suits our conditions and is of a similar calibre to rifles used by other N.A.T.O.
            forces. Another point about it is that the Americans decided to use another rifle of
            America design which was more suitable' for their purposes but which was still of
            the same calibre as the FN.30. The ammunition for these rifles would be interchangeable.

            it would take three months to get our Army tanks into the Northern Territory. This is
            just a distortion of fact.</para>

                take three months to get the tanks to the Northern Territory. It is very interesting
                to hear comments on Australia's defence made by honorable members opposite. The

                                has been interjecting quite strongly. It was interesting to hear his contribution to
                the debate. All that he did was to theorise on the nuclear weapon set-up and to say
                how dangerous it would be if somebody exploded a nuclear bomb. We all know that, but
                we also know that it is essential to have a nuclear deterrent because of the present
                world situation, and that if we do not have a nuclear deterrent the imbalance of
                world population will surely mean disaster for countries like Australia.

                    <para>
                        I see these Bills as part of the Government's efforts over the past two or three
            years to build up our defence forces gradually in the light of the resources available
            to it. In 1961-62, the allocation for defence was £200 million; in 1962-63, it was
            £214 million; in 1963-64, it was £260 million; and for this year it is
            £293 million. The honorable member for Capricornia, when speaking on the Estimates
            last week, said that the Government would spend about £230 million on defence this
            year. In fact, the Government will spend £293 million. He was only £63 million
            out. The honorable member is supposed to be a responsible member of the Parliament; yet
            he makes these misleading statements. In the past few years, we have seen the action
            taken by the Government to build up our defences. In January 1963, the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline>
                        announced that a submarine
            arm of the Royal Australian Navy would be established. In May 1963, the manpower targets
            were increased and vast quantities of new and modern equipment were ordered. In October
            1963, two squadrons of the FI 11 A- the TFX aircraft - were ordered and delivery will
            commence about 1968. In June of this year, la-i:-a pay and allowances were substan
            tially increased and provision was made for housing for the armed forces.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        We have heard the suggestion that more money should be spent on defence; but more
            money is not the complete solution to our defence problems. If we buy more aircraft or
            ships, we must still find the people to fly them, to service them, to man them and
            generally to understand the vast complexities of the electronic equipment installed in
            them. A realistic appraisement of the situation shows that we must of necessity move
            slowly in building up our armed forces. I want to adopt some of the suggestions made
            last week by the honorable member for Calare
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              England).</inline>
                        I do not claim that these suggestions are my original ideas; the
            honorable member for Calare made them. In the defence review that is now being
            undertaken and on which final decisions will be made next week, I hope that the
            Government will consider the suggestions of the honorable member for Calare. They are
            that we immediately compile a national manpower register, that we give more active
            encouragement to the cadet corps at the various schools, that we make every effort to
            increase the strength and efficiency of the Citizen Military Forces and that the
            Government prepares plans for compulsory enlistment or national service, if either
            should ever be needed. The Bills now before the House are designed to move towards these
            ends, but probably additional action could be taken. I would like to add one thought of
            my own. I think a register of industry throughout Australia could be tremendously
            important. I am not fully aware of the position, but I have it in my mind that the State
            Governments have a register of industry. I am not certain of this and I think it would
            be wise for the Government to check with the appropriate State Ministers to make sure
            that a register of all industry, large and small, throughout Australia is kept up to
            date and is readily available to the Federal Minister for Labour and National Service
            and the Government should the need for it arise.
                    </para>
                    <para>I want to stress again that it is not money alone that counts in defence. An
            important factor is the fire power that we have in the hands of personnel in the
            Services. The Government has been turning its attention more and more to this factor and
            I am sure that it will continue to do so. I would like to mention one other factor. We
            should encourage the public generally to have a good deal more respect for and
            appreciation of the members of our armed forces than we tend to have at the moment. I
            think it is fair to say that the members of the armed forces during peace time are not
            shown the respect and appreciation to which they are entitled. It is only in time of war
            that we really show our appreciation of our forces. All of us are too inclined in peace
            time to disregard the importance of members of the armed forces. I urge the Australian
            people to show the members of the armed forces the respect that they deserve. 1 support
            the Bills very strongly and commend the Government for the action it has taken,
            especially in the past three years, in the defence of Australia.</para>

                            said, we consider that
              two very important changes should be made in them if possible by amendment, and I will
              have something to say about this in a few minutes. The honorable member for Indi
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holten)</inline>
                            has appealed for more respect to be
              shown for the members of the armed forces. For reasons that I will mention in a
              moment, there is need for this appeal. However, I believe that any decline in respect
              for the armed forces in recent years is not a result of anything done or not done by
              the armed forces. I think the responsibility for the decline can be laid firmly at the
              door of this Government. We have not had a clear defence policy for the 15 years that
              the Government has been in office. The people have not known what the Government is
              doing with the defence forces and if today they are not taking the defence of
              Australia seriously, the responsibility lies firmly on this Government. The solution
              of the problem will not be found until the people are convinced that we have a
              consistent defence policy and that the purchase of defence equipment and arms is
              following a consistent and logical pattern. I do not think it is an exaggeration to
              say that the pattern has been a shambles. I believe that this is the main reason for
              the loss of respect for our defence effort.

            from getting the finance you seek. You have the money; do the best you can with it.
            " No-one can be satisfied with what the Government has done with it. It has had its
            head, it has had its way, but it has lost the confidence not only of its informed and
            responsible critics, like some of those on its own benches, but it has lost the
            confidence and respect of the people too. It is not genuine in respect of defence. What
            it has been mainly concerned with is the defence of the Liberal Party in elections and
            not the defence of Australia in the world situation. It has given us the impression that
            we are facing great and serious threats from the north. It has given us the impression

                        chose to have an election almost 18 months earlier than was
            necessary simply, the Prime Minister said, to get the mandate of the Australian people
            to go to the defence of Malaysia. He got the mandate of the Australian people,
            presumably, but what has he done about it? The Government has designed a force to go to
            Malaysia. It has been deliberately designed so as not to become engaged in any
            hostilities with Indonesia. So it will make an unequivocal and almost unnoticed
            contribution to the situation in Malaysia. All the Government wants is for its
            contribution to be noticed in Australia. It wants to play up the feeling of suspicion
            and uneasiness in the Australian people because it believes that that pays off
            politically. On the other hand it has been completely inconsistent in what it has done
            in the north. Defence has been a sham under this Government, and the honorable member
            for Indi can find his answer there. If there is any loss of confidence by the Australian

            expenditure on defence, at the same time the Australian Labour Party is proud to say
            that it stands for peace, and we emphasize peace in all these situations. We stand for
            friendship. We recognise that today we are living in a new world, a world where new

              They talk with strong words. They are great fighters with the weapon of words, but
              poor fighters with any other instruments. Their anti-Communism is a matter of emotion,
              a matter of words, but they fail when they are tested in a situation. However, let us
              leave that aside for a moment. The world in which we live today is a world in which
              only new minds with new ideas of the future are capable of holding their own. The
              coloured world we face today is a world that so far has a better record in respect of
              aggression - a world that shows itself more capable of co-operation - that the old
              whitedominated world that is passing.</para>

                    <para>I do not think it is necessary to answer much the other point made by the honorable
            member for Indi, that what the critics are saying is that we must have more money for
            this and more money for that. It seems to me that in about 3 per cent, of the gross
            national product in present circumstances there is ample money for the defence of this
            country. I think the important thing is that the money be used better, and when it has
            been used better for a year or two we can decide whether we need any more. I do not go
            along with the cry that we have to spend more and more on defence, because I think that
            is the kind of thing which in the past has been taken as a substitute for defence. Our
            main responsibility is to make sure for a year or two that we are spending much better
            that which is now available, and when we have done that, see whether we need any more.</para>
                    <para>
                        I believe that in the measures that have been put before the House the Government is
            no more genuine than it has been for 14 or 15 years. Let us have a look at some of the
            measures. The honorable member for Wannon
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Malcolm
              Fraser)</inline>
                        said that the essence of this legislation was that it was directed to
            the availability of forces - to making more forces available. We know that one of its
            purposes is to create an emergency reserve. The member for Wannon recognised the
            limitations of this. He said it might be useful, but it would be small. Of course it is
            going to be small, and I agree it might be useful, but if the contribution that this
            legislation is going to make to the availability of forces is to be restricted to an
            emergency reserve, no member on the other side is going to say it will be more than very
            marginal and more than very insignificant.
                    </para>
                    <para>Let us have a look at what it might do to the Citizen Military Forces. It is going
            to make a change so that those who enlist, those who volunteer for service, in the
            Citizen Military Forces will be automatically committed to service overseas. How is this
            going to affect the total recruitment? We are sometimes told that the Citizen Military
            Forces have already completely volunteered for overseas service, but what has been
            happening to the C.M.F. target of 35,000 men set for 30th June next? The report dated
            30th June shows that there were 27,505 members of the C.M.F. at that date. In other
            words, 7,495 additional personnel must be found by 30th June next if the target is to be
            reached. Is the fact that members of the C.M.F. are going to be available for overseas
            service going to attract a significantly greater number of persons into the Citizen
            Military Forces? Some people feel that it might have less effect and that it might
            discourage people from enlisting, because many people in the C.M.F., whilst they want to
            train themselves and be available for service if necessary want to do it consistent with
            remaining close to their ordinary civilian occupations all the time.</para>
                    <para>One of the significant changes that this legislation seems to envisage is that there
            will be no special unit after this for home training and for home service. I should
            think that would be likely to reduce significantly the availability of forces. What are
            the inducements mentioned by the honorable members for Indi and Wannon? What are the
            inducements that this legislation produces that did not exist before? Availability for
            overseas service? What else? No increased pay is associated with it. It is well known
            that if persons cannot be secured for particular jobs one of the steps taken to get them
            is to increase the pay, improve conditions and make housing a little better for them.
            Does it ever occur to the Government that the recent pay increases did not penetrate far
            enough down into the Services? The increases were long overdue, but the pay is still far
            from adequate. If the Government were concerned about the availability of forces it
            would be primarily concerned to improve the conditions of service. This is why one of
            the amendments envisaged by the Opposition is to make available repatriation services to
            everyone who chooses to give overseas service. From the time they enlist repatriation
            benefits should be available to them; and why not? The repatriation hospital services
            are underutilised. These days some parts of the repatriation hospitals are like old Army
            camps of some years ago. Many sections of the wards are out of use. There is great scope
            for making repatriation benefits available, and this surely would be a great advantage.
            It is well known, and it has been well known among the Services for years, that where
            there is injury or sickness the rights that are available to the servicemen are almost
            19th century rights. The Commonwealth Workers Compensation Act is the most backward such
            act in Australia. It is only when there is a serious problem like that related to the
            " Voyager " recently that Government supporters - all of them - appear to have
            some dedication to servicemen. They suddenly realise that something is wrong.</para>
                    <para>Why should not repatriation services be available to those who have enlisted for
            overseas service, even in peacetime, even if they have never been away? The second
            amendment by the Opposition is one that I think provides a fair and necessary safeguard.
            We believe that section 41 of the Principal Act ought to be amended so that those
            persons in the Citizen Military Forces who are going to come under the new conditions of
            eligibility for overseas service should be required to make some deliberate act of
            enlistment or attestation and not merely have to forego this position. I know what
            happens in practice, and I am sure that anyone who has been in the Services or any of
            the Service organisations knows what happens. If a man has to contract out he has to
            contract out before the eyes of everybody who is contracting in. He has to run the risk
            of taking the position of being a coward or being put in a position where he is accused
            of dodging something. It is not fair to the men concerned. Men should have an
            opportunity to make a deliberate act of enlistment or attestation if they want to serve
            overseas. Those who do not wish to serve overseas should not be put in a position in
            which they become subject to some discriminatory attitude or some unpopularity which may
            even perhaps involve cowardice or of dodging the issue by declining to serve overseas.
            So the Opposition considers that an amendment to section 41 of the kind that I have
            mentioned would be fair and reasonable.</para>
                    <para>Broadly speaking, these measures will fail, as so many of the things done by the
            Government to achieve even its own objectives have failed. This legislation will not
            increase the number of men available for the Services. The Government is trying to do
            the job on the cheap, as usual. Amending legislation of the nature of these measures
            will not do the job required. What is the Government's attitude? It cannot face up
            to compulsory military service, which some of its expert advisers have said should be
            introduced. Why cannot the Government face it? The reason is that this Administration
            will not take from industry the number of people who would have to be taken if
            compulsory military service were introduced.</para>

                training. This Government will not do what so many honorable members opposite think
                is necessary because it is afraid of upsetting too many employers. So what does the
                Government do? It takes this mealy mouthed, half way sort of course and prepares
                legislation of this kind, though those who form the Government know very well in
                their own hearts that these measures will not meet the situation. As in so many
                other matters, the Government lacks real genuineness in its attitude to defence.</para>

                    <para>Let me now turn to some of the statements made a little while ago by the honorable
            member for Wannon. I am pleased that he has taken the debate on to some of the grounds
            that he raised. He began by stating what seemed to him to be a fundamental proposition.
            He said that there was no longer any practical distinction between peace and war. The
            distinction between peace and war, he said, is no longer relevant. This statement
            implies almost complete ignorance or irrationality. However, I do not believe that the
            honorable member is irrational. I think that he is ignorant of the great differences
            between peace and war. Peace is roughly the condition under which we live today. War
            would be a condition in which nuclear bombs would be likely to be used. In these
            circumstances, war would be a condition which most responsible men and women in the
            world today would regard as so revolutionary and different as to make it impossible for
            mankind to accept. The outstanding characteristics of nuclear weapons today are, first,
            their power of destruction and, second, the fact that only a very large nation can
            muster the resources necessary to produce them and place them effectively on their
            targets. This enormous power of nuclear weapons and the enormous resources required for
            their use distinguish the condition of war today from the condition of peace as never
            before throughout history. So I think the honorable member for Wannon has exhibited
            complete lack of knowledge of the situation by saying that there is now no practical
            distinction between peace and war because the distinction is no longer relevant.</para>
                    <para>We know that in earlier generations there was debate about the question of whether
            the ultimate weapon had been produced, even when gunpowder was developed and certainly
            when aircraft and chemical bombs came into use. But, ever since about 1957, there has
            been no real disagreement among the responsible people of the world about the fact that
            nuclear weapons represent a revolutionary change. So the destructive power of nuclear
            weapons and the large resources needed for their use are factors of first and basic
            importance in determining any defence policy. These factors mean that Australia, like
            Britain and France, can never independently have nuclear weapons. The only way for
            Australia to acquire nuclear weapons would be to obtain them from some other country.</para>
                    <para>I believe that a number of propositions flow from the significance of nuclear
            weapons. The honorable member for Wannon indicated them but did not probe into them. We
            have to state those propositions and think about them if we are to arrive at a
            consistent defence policy which would have the logical support of the Australian people
            and which would overcome this lack of confidence about which the honorable member for
            Indi was so much concerned. As I have said, nuclear weapons hardly concern us at all.
            They are a matter for the great powers almost alone. But Australia has a responsibility
            to do all she can to support every action taken anywhere to stop tests of nuclear
            weapons, to prevent the stockpiling of them in increasing quantities and, finally, if
            possible, to reduce the existing stockpiles. The Australian Government has a
            responsibility, in formulating its defence policy, to support to the full the appeal
            made last week by U Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who called on
            the powers with nuclear weapons to meet at the earliest possible opportunity and reach
            agreement about bringing to an end all nuclear tests and the production of further
            nuclear weapons. But has our Government shown any awareness of U Thant's appeal? Has
            it, in the eight days that have passed since the appeal was made, given any indication
            that it is concerned to support the proposal? Will the Australian Government support
            that appeal at the United Nations or elsewhere? I doubt whether it will.</para>
                    <para>Quite apart from this, the Government leaves aside the question that has been put to
            the nation in the last couple of days by Professor Titterton. I do not imply any
            particular fault in him as distinct from many others. His business is the production of
            nuclear weapons. That is the big field of power that would develop him to a big man in
            this nation, and that fact has something to do with his belief that Australia should
            have nuclear weapons. He is the Teller of Australia. The first thing that Australia
            should do in respect of nuclear weapons is not to think about getting them, it is to
            make sure that we seek agreement with Indonesia that neither country will ever obtain
            nuclear weapons from some other nation or try to make them itself. That is the first
            duty of any responsible Australian today. If we fail to reach such an understanding, we
            may have to deal with the consequences. For Australia, as the first nation in this part
            of the world, to think about acquiring nuclear weapons in lunacy. I say that Professor
            Titterton is involved in an act of lunacy.</para>
                    <para>
                        We have to be concerned to adopt a consistent defence policy. The trouble about
            debates on these matters in this place,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy
              Speaker,</inline>
                        is that we have too little time to discuss these affairs. I hope now
            to begin something that I can continue in the course of the next week. I believe that
            the first thing for the Australian nation to do is to decide the line of defence where
            we would have the best advantage in defending ourselves if the need arose. I think it is
            pretty clear that, if we consider that matter, we shall come to the conclusion that our
            best strategic defence position is primarily in the seas and in the air to the north of
            Australia. This, I believe, is true also for the United States of America.
                    </para>
                    <para>I suggest that the best strategic line has been described by American experts. This
            is a line that I stated recently. What I said, however, seems to have come as a great
            shock to so many of those on the opposite side of the House who pretend to have some
            knowledge of strategic factors. They behave as though I had presented a new and
            revolutionary thought. My statement was, almost word for word, precisely a quotation of
            something said by General MacArthur in 1949. He stated then that the strategic advantage
            for the United</para>
                    <para class="block">States, being an air power, was in the seas and in the air around Asia
            and that no one would consider that it was to the strategic advantage of the United
            States, as the honorable member for Fremantle pointed out a few minutes ago, to become
            involved with the millions of Asian people in war on the land if that could be avoided.
            So it seems to me that, if commonsense is any guide, we must think mainly, first of all,
            in terms of a strategic line beginning somewhere north of Darwin. For the moment, I am
            not suggesting exactly where it would be in relation to longitude. That line should
            extend as a sort of shield over the north of Australia, running westerly down the coast
            of Western Austalia and easterly down the coast of Queensland. The first requirement
            would be very fast and mobile air and sea forces. I understand that most of the new
            thinking in the Navy concerns submarines and small weapons carriers, not vessels like
            aircraft carriers, which Professor Miller so vividly described as an extremely
            vulnerable basket.</para>
                    <para>Let me leave that aside for some development, I hope, at a later stage and now
            confine my attention to the criticism made a few minutes ago by the honorable member for
            Wannon. I have tried to think first of the best strategic position. What about the land?
            What is happening on land in Asia? The honorable member for Wannon said that he would
            criticise some statements I have made. He said that I had said there was no outside
            military force assisting in South Vietnam. I have never made any such statement. I would
            have expected the honorable member for Wannon, with his educational background and sense
            of responsibility, to have at least been fair minded enough to ascertain what I did say.
            But like most honorable members opposite he sometimes takes a completely abbreviated and
            inadequate press report on some other report, but never do honorable members opposite
            take even those accurately or fairly. They always give to them their own interpretation
            to suit their purposes.</para>
                    <para>I said nothing about there being no outside military force operating in South
            Vietnam. What I did say was that the classic Western argument was that what was
            happening in South Vietnam was something that was fundamentally a matter of outside
            inspiration, direction and supply and that if it were not for this outside support there
            would be no significant problem there. I said that the interpretation that this was
            simply a matter of something that was caused by Communism in China and North Vietnam is
            what the Western viewpoint is asking us to believe. We are being asked to believe that
            this simply a consequence of Communism because honorable members opposite think that is
            the best way to scare us for political purposes here in Australia. I said that
            proposition was fundamentally unsound and I do not care who tries to contradict my
            claim.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Wannon quoted the " Washington Post " - a report
            with which I am quite familiar. The report said that 300 or 500 people a month were
            coming into South Vietnam from the north. The word used is " cadres ". That
            means one person, not 10, 20, or 100. The report said that 300 or 500 were coming in.
            The honorable member said that according to the report they were being supplied
            continuously with .50 calibre machine guns. Of course during June and July of this year
            some few hundred .50 calibre machine guns were captured in various parts of South
            Vietnam. They were captured for the first time in 1964, not in 1963, and some people who
            paid recent visits to Vietnam were able to see them. I think in some cases those people
            have been given the impression that this sort of thing has been happening continuously
            in the sense of years. But that was not the statement of the " Washington Post
            ". It said that day to day operations are being handled from the north. This is
            simply a very improbable proposition because most of the operations are 700 or 800 miles
            to the south and they just cannot be handled day to day from the north. The north is
            trying to influence the Viet Cong as much as it can but predominantly the Viet Cong has
            to solve its own problems from day to day and it is not in communication very frequently
            over more than 10 or 20 miles.</para>
                    <para>Quoting the "Washington Post" the honorable member said that command posts
            reserves and so on are in the north. That does not make sense either. Some command posts
            and reserves are in the north but they are only being supplied even now according to the
            report at the rate of a few hundred a month. The honorable member asked me to indicate
            the evidence on which I have relied and which I have given to the House for the past
            months. It goes back to the reports of the French officers after the capitulation in
            1954, published at length in a book titled "Modern Guerrilla Warfare", edited by
            Osanka and published in the United States of America. Lieutenant-Colonel Geneste gave a
            thorough detail of this and said in effect that everything done up until 1954 was
            predominantly local; hardly anything had come from the north. In 1962, General Paul
            Harkins, the American commanding officer at that point, made a report and said that
            until 1962 the Viet Cong had mainly home made weapons and weapons that had been captured
            from the Government forces.</para>

            been present at most of the committees of inquiry, said in the American Congress -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I have cross examined witnesses for some time on South Vietnam from the Pentagon
              and from the State Department Foreign Affairs Section. When I put the question to
              them: " What military personnel have you found in South Vietnam from Red China,
              Cambodia or elsewhere? " the answer is always: "Practically none." So when
              I press the witnesses further with the question: " Am I to understand the Vict
              Cong are South Vietnamese almost entirely? " the answer is: " Yes." The
              same is true of their weapons. The Viet Cong have armed themselves from South Vietnam
              Government stocks, not by foreign imports from Communist countries. The so-called
              North Vietnam supply lines that so many politicians want to bomb are little more than
              a myth.</para>

                        Can anyone contradict these statements? On 27th July in " Newsweek
            " there appeared a statement, referred to apparently critically by the honorable
            member for Wannon, made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNamara</inline>
                        on his
            return from South Vietnam, which I have quoted before. In that statement
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNamara</inline>
                        said that it is no good simplifying the
            position in South Vietnam; it is not a result predominantly of what is happening from
            outside; the problem is substantially one that is in South Vietnam and has to be dealt
            with there. There are some links with North Vietnam but the position would be
            substantially the same if they were severed.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              McNamara</inline>
                        referred to the 50 calibre machine guns that presumably had come
            from China, but they were not large or significant in number.
                    </para>
                    <para>I have examined every scrap of evidence I can obtain about this subject over a
            period of ten years and I have put a good deal of it before the House. Those who oppose
            my view have been able to produce at last one statement - the report in the
            "Washington Post". The "Washington Post" is first referring only to June
            and July of this year and only qualifies the evidence over that period of time. The
            evidence still stands without any real modification. It is important to examine this
            legislation in relation to the threats Australia faces. This legislation will not go one
            inch of the way towards meeting those threats. The Government is still as far away as
            ever from recognising the fundamental situation that it faces. I do not believe the
            Government is out to face the situation that exists today. It is out to use defence for
            purposes of Australian political consumption.</para>

                The honorable member does not seem to realise the significance of the word

                something of matter; something tangible. It does not mean none at all; it is
                material in the situation. If the honorable member takes it to mean none at all it
                is quite contrary to what I intended it to mean. He cannot claim that as its
                meaning.

                            .- It is always very difficult to follow the honorable member for Yarra
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns)</inline>
                            in a debate of this kind. Indeed, it
              is always very difficult, after the honorable member has spoken, to work out just what
              is Labour policy so far as defence is concerned. The honorable member for Fremantle
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline>
                            whom I consider a very sincere
              man and one who does not ever betray Labour Party policy, said that the Opposition
              supported the Bill and considered that defence should not be in controversy. We are
              agreed on this, and it is to be greatly regretted that we have not such a policy at
              the moment. There are many men on the Opposition side who are in agreement with us.
              but when the honorable member for Yarra gets up and, with great cleverness and fine
              techniques, endeavours to misinterpret the position and puts forward certain
              suggestions, I am sure that we and the people of Australia look upon what he says with
              the utmost suspicion.

                    <para>
                        Let us consider some of the things he has said. Apparently he admits to having made
            a 10 year study of the Vietnamese and other situations. It would appear from his
            findings and the remarks that he has made that our ally, the United States of America,
            is wrongfully interfering in Vietnam. Everything it does is wrong. Has the honorable
            member ever obtained from the generals whom he has quoted, confirmation that the views
            he puts forward are actually their views? Does he quote the whole of what they have
            said, or does he pick out a little here and a little there and mould it to what he wants
            to portray as the policy of the United States of America? Has he ever ascertained from
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNamara</inline>
                        exactly what he thinks?
                    </para>
                    <para>The honorable member made another interesting remark. He said that the Australian
            Labour Party stands for peace. I think it was proved in this chamber last week that the
            Australian Labour Party is divided on the question of peace. The honorable member for
            Yarra openly admitted - and I admire him for doing so - that he was a supporter of the
            Peace Congress. He admitted that he was a foundation member of the original peace
            congress which was called by the Labour Party a Communist front organisation. He also
            endeavours here, in an insidious way, to disseminate propaganda which, when analysed,
            certainly fits in with what is going on at the Congress in Sydney at the present time.</para>
                    <para>
                        He also stated, as did the honorable member for Fremantle
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline>
                        that the Opposition supports the principles of this Bill. He
            said that the Opposition had never opposed the defence vote. That is true. The Oposition
            has not voted against the defence estimates but, quite frankly, it did not have
            sufficient numbers to make any difference to the defence vote even if it wanted to do
            so. Let us examine some of the statements made by honorable members opposite. The
            honorable member for Yarra said: " We are critical, but we have never suggested that
            defence expenditure should be cut down". On 24th November 1957, the present Leader
            of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline>

                        <para>My point is that we should prepare ourselves to supply troops to the United

                    <para class="block">Those are the arguments of the honorable member for Yarra and of those
            who support him in his faction of the Labour Parry. He talks about the strategic
            concept. He also talks about a mythical line behind which he suggests we should stand.
            He believes that we should conduct our defence only from the air and the sea. He never
            makes clear what he thinks should be done about Thailand, which is One of our allies
            under the South East Treaty Organisation. He never says what he thinks we should do in
            respect of Malaysia, to which we are committed as a fellow Commonwealth country. Indeed,
            he never makes clear exactly what he means about anything.</para>
                    <para>If we wanted to be difficult, we could say that what he is now suggesting fits in
            with the Communist propaganda and the peace congress propaganda. He believes that we
            should withdraw all troops from foreign bases, that we should keep out of South East
            Asia, and that we should do nothing to prevent the advance of Communism. I suggest to
            the Australian people that it is a great tragedy that the alternative government of this
            nation has not a defence policy that is acceptable to the people. I welcome the Bill. It
            is something for which the Services have been asking for a considerable time, and it is
            something which, time and time again, governments of all political colours have refused
            to grant. There is no doubt that it is a move forward, although I feel that it will not
            have sufficient effect to bring the three Services up to the strength of which I
            personally think they should be.</para>

            Nazi Germany and all the other Fascist countries were doing to prepare for war while
            England, as a peace loving nation, was not doing much. At the time of writing the book,
            the late John F. Kennedy was a student, and what he said in it then applies equally to
            us today. He said -</para>

                        <para>It means that in preparing for war today, which takes such a long time and is so
              expensive, a democracy may be struck such a knockout blow by a totalitarian form of

              to bring in the latent advantages that she possesses. It is only in the long war that
              the advantages of a greater spirit and determination among the people will be

            circumstances confronting us today we will possibly not have such time available. It is
            difficult to discuss whether this Bill will be effective without knowing what the
            Government proposes to bring forward after completing its review of defence. It is
            pointless to say that the Bill is inadequate or that it will not achieve what is
            required without knowing the Government's intentions. I sincerely hope that in the

            Forces, because the Minister for the Army

                        has already said in this House that the re-organisation of the C.M.F.
            is under consideration at the present time. We do not know yet what this means. We do
            not know whether they are going to be set up on a different basis, as, indeed, many of
            us feel they should be, and we will not know until we are advised. However, as I have
            said, I welcome the Bill. I believe it is a move forward and I certainly hope it will
            have the desired effect. But I do not believe that, on its own, it is sufficient.

                    <para>When one considers what the Bill is designed to do one knows that it will be
            welcomed by the Services, both the regular Services and the volunteer Services. I feel
            quite sure that nobody wants to go back to the old system we had at the beginning of the
            last war. I am also sure that in the forefront of those who do not want to go back to
            that system are the Citizen Military Forces. We all know that many members of the C.M.F.
            had had battalion training for a long time before the last war commenced. They had a
            fine esprit de corps. The men knew their officers and the officers knew their men. They
            were prepared to go away as battalions or batteries or other groups and serve anywhere
            overseas. But because the governments of the day would not allow them to do this,
            because the legislation did not allow them to do it, they were prevented from going
            away. In many instances the C.M.F. units were cannibalised. The officers were separated
            and sent to different battalions. The units were split up and the men were sent either
            to various battalions of the Australian Imperial Forces or, if they wished to stay at
            home, to other units of the C.M.F. The provision in this Bill that the C.M.F. may be
            sent overseas will be welcomed indeed by the C.M.F. I have no fear that any members of
            the C.M.F. will not be delighted. As I have said, particularly if the re-organisation of
            the C.M.F. is implemented this will be a very good thing.</para>

            in this regard because we do not know what the Government will propose in its defence

            been moved immediately to a theatre of war because, after all, our commitment is to meet
            an advancing enemy, to stop the advance of Communism, and so our Army would have to be
            sent overseas. If the Regular Army were moved in this way, who would be training the
            conscription army envisaged by the Minister? This is a matter concerning us all at this
            time. I believe that whether we have a volunteer reserve or not, or whether there is
            compulsory training or not, the Act should be altered so that all people in the defence
            forces, without exception, should be liable and should be prepared to go overseas. I
            hope that at some stage such a provision will be made.</para>

            Regular Army. In support of this contention I would like to quote portion of an article
            entitled "British Infantry in South East Asia" by Brigadier A. G. Patterson,
            Commander, 99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade Group in Borneo, which appeared in the

              bearing on our operational effectiveness in this theatre and which are, I believe, in
              need of an airing. I do this in the conviction that the British nation, as part of
              " the West ", will be some time vitally concerned in the affairs of South East
              Asia, a region which contains two thirds of the world's population and in which
              the cold war is active in the military as well as the political and economic sense. If
              we are to make certain that the whole area does not disappear behind the bamboo
              curtain, Britain and her allies must continue to lend a hand to our friends in South
              East Asia, and this means inevitably that the British Army, and in particular the
              Infantry, will continue to be involved.</para>

            there is no doubt that if you had to commit battalions of the Citizen Military Forces to
            the jungle to fight a war they would find themselves at a disadvantage. The author of
            this article tells what happened in Indochina when the cream of the French Army was

              of fighters and bombers that passed over the jungles and rice fields each day were
              always French. So were the streams of transport, the Dakotas and Flying Box Cars,
              rushing supplies to every battlefront. The French had hundreds of artillery pieces,

                        <para>The experiences of the last twenty years have made it very clear that European
              troops pitched suddenly into the jungle are defeated by the climate, the terrain and
              lack of facilities before the enemy even takes a hand. To imagine that a soldier, a
              unit or a formation can be flown out from Europe in an emergency and flung into a
              jungle battle against the ant-like forces of Asian Communism is dangerous thinking
              indeed. It will take a good unit four months of climatisation and retraining in the
              theatre before it will be fit to take on the Vietminh, the Vietcong or the T.N.I.
              During that four months there would be casualties - men whose bodies or minds are
              insufficiently robust to accept the necessary adjustment. Furthermore only a unit
              which is really well led and well disciplined will make the grade. Jungle war will
              mercilessly expose any weakness in this respect.</para>
                        <para>Thus the forces required to fight at short notice in South East Asia must be
              stationed in South East Asia. Reinforcement plans must accept a four months

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">From the point of view of the Army, it is essential that in time of
            emergency short of war we should be able to mobilise, if necessary, and we should be
            able to move Citizen Military Forces battalions - I should like to say divisions - to
            the rear forward area so that they can receive their acclimatisation.</para>
                    <para>As I understand it, the new emergency reserve as far as the Army is concerned is
            hoped to bring about the recruitment of somewhere in the vicinity of 3,600 troops. I
            understand that there are no officers involved in this reserve. At the present moment,
            the Regular Army reserve is 4,709. It seems to me that we cannot be hopeful of getting
            the full complement of 4,709 to sign on in existing circumstances. However, this will be
            a very useful reserve from which to fill the gaps which, in my opinion, are existing at
            the moment. We have seen, and the Minister for the Army himself has mentioned, the
            shortages in our logistic forces which were found during the recent Army operation.
            Indeed, if we went to war, we might possibly be able to get one battalion or so away if
            we had this reserve to fill in some of the plugholes that would be left behind. I agree
            with one honorable member who said earlier that there should be a manpower register in
            Australia at this moment. I think this is something that nobody would oppose. Our
            defence forces, the Government and the people of Australia must know what the
            availability of manpower would be in the event of mobilisation necessitated by any
            threat to this country. If we did have a manpower register then, in a situation where,
            without actual warning, a threat could arise, such as the one to which the Minister for
            Defence referred in another place, we would know who we were calling up.</para>
                    <para>There are other matters in the Bills to which, if I had the time, I would like to
            refer. One relates to the resignation of officers. I can see little change in this
            regard as far as this Bill is concerned, lt still seems to me to be equally as difficult
            now as it was before for an officer in the service to resign his commission should he so
            desire. I can see the reason why resignations were refused a short time ago. They were
            refused because we are short of officers. But I still feel that if we are going to ask
            the right type of young man to enlist, and to go into one of the three services, or to
            go as an officer into a military college, we have to make it clear to him that after a
            certain number of years service, if he so desires, he has the right to resign, other
            than in a time of emergency. This right to resign applies to members of the Public
            Service, members of this Parliament, and also people in many other areas of employment
            of which I know. Why should any officer, if he is unhappy, if he wishes to, and if he
            has served a reasonable time, be prevented from resigning? Why should the refusal to
            accept resignations be justified because the Government has allowed the Defence forces
            to get to a stage where they have not sufficient officers at this time?</para>
                    <para>
                        I come now to the question of recruiting. I feel the recruiting campaign has been
            quite extraordinary. It has been most unimpressive. The results have shown this fact. I
            think it would be better if the three Services themselves could handle their own
            recruiting programmes because I think that those who have volunteered to join the
            Services, and who love them and have served in them, would know much more than other
            people what would appeal to the young men of today. I agree with the criticism that has
            been made that when you see a bulldozer digging a trench or when you see some character
            doing something similar in connection with working in the forces, it is pretty
            uninteresting and has very little romance attached to it. I would like to see something
            like the American system of recruiting where by the use of radio and television and
            other means of propaganda the Armed Services are put into perspective. You find that
            each morning at, perhaps, 7.30. you are told: " This is the anniversary of such and
            such a battle ", or you are told: "This is the anniversary of some event in
            which our Services were concerned." In the United States of America the armed
            services are treated with great respect. They are given a position of pride. I was glad
            to hear the Minister for the Army suggest that this is going to be one of the objectives
            of the Government. I noticed that the Minister made a plea to the people of Australia. I
            frankly feel - and this is a matter on which I could to a degree join with the honorable
            member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Cairns)</inline>
                        - that the
            responsibility for this state of affairs rests on this Government which has over the
            years in my opinion allowed the Public Service and certain associations to whittle down
            the rights and privileges of officers of the Services. As I have said before, there is
            only one difference between servicemen and civil servants and that is that the
            servicemen can be sent off on a day's notice into battle and can be asked to die. In
            my book, this demands increased privileges, and the best that can be given to these men.
                    </para>
                    <para>As far as the recruiting plan and the increases in pay and terms and conditions are
            concerned the honorable member for Yarra said that we should give more. I do not think
            that what the honorable member for Yarra said is necessarily so at the moment. I think
            most of our servicemen are quite happy with the increased pay, allowances, and serving
            conditions. But I do think that this Government at the same time as it introduced these
            increases in pay and allowances should have had a look at the Defence Forces Retirement
            Benefits scheme. This is the greatest canker from which the Services are suffering at
            the moment. If the various Service Ministers cannot get this message over to the
            Treasury, I do not know what they are going to do about the problem. This is one of the
            greatest causes of unhappiness to men in the Services. They join the Services and they
            are prepared to devote their time to them. They are retired at an early age, or under
            certain circumstances, they may even resign on a question of principle. They find that
            what they receive on retirement is whittled away because some person in the Treasury has
            said: "Well look, chum, we don't get that, so you have not any hope of getting
            it." I think that this matter is something at which this Government should look
            pretty quickly.</para>
                    <para>As far as the proposed amendment with regard to contracting in or contracting out of
            the C.M.F. is concerned, 1 do feel that the Minister and the Government could have a
            look at this matter. There seems to me to be no problem - perhaps there is - which would
            prevent the commanding officer of a battalion from calling a parade, having the
            necessary forms and saying: "There you are. You sign in if you want to." This
            contracting out does have a tendency towards the old theme to which I have always
            objected; An advertisement is put in a newspaper and, if you are lucky enough to see it,
            you are in, but if you are not lucky enough to see it, you are out. The present proposal
            is that situation in reverse, and it does seem to me to be slightly unfair. I would like
            the Service Ministers to have a look at this matter. I cannot see anything which will be
            lost. I am quite sure that few will contract out because these men have, as is known,
            already agreed to go overseas. I am quite sure that they will continue to be willing to
            do this. As I say, I support the Bill. I think it is good. I think the Government should
            have taken action along these lines a long time ago. This is something the Services have
            wanted. I hope that, when the defence review comes in, the other things which are
            required for defence will be implemented, and implemented very quickly. I say this
            because I think that the situation today is not a comfortable one for Australia. I do
            think that very much more is required than what is proposed in these Bills. I support
            the Bill.</para>

                        quoted me as saying in the debate on the defence estimates that pilots could be trained
            on light aircraft. I still believe that. I may not be qualified to say that they should
            be so trained. But this is what I cannot understand: We are to have an Air Force of 100
            Mirage fighters and the training of men to man those aircraft will probably take two
            years. If we have 100 Mirage fighters, we will probably have 66, or two-thirds of them,
            operational at any one time; the others will be undergoing repairs or performing other
            services, ls our air defence to depend on 66 Mirage fighters? I say that men should be
            trained on light aircraft so that they will have a certain amount of training in hand to
            enable them to transfer to other types of aircraft. I do not say that they should
            transfer to Mirage fighters, because 1 know that they would not be capable of flying
            those fighters. ls the Mirage to be the only aircraft in the Royal Australian Air Force?
            Are we to tlo away with transport aircraft? Are we to do away with other types of
            aircraft? Are we just to have, as I am led to believe by remarks that have come from the
            Government side of the chamber, these highly scientific aircraft, and are we to train
            only men who can fly that type of aircraft? The Minister for Air

            fly modern aircraft. I will not say that they should be so trained, because I just do
            not know about that. I deplore people trying to quote me as an expert on naval affairs.
            I want to put the record straight right here and now. I have never claimed to be an
            expert. I hope I have used a bit of horse sense in making some of the statements that I
            have made. For goodness sake, do not try to set me up as an expert. I have never claimed

            and say things that we should not say. I suppose that in a few years time, if I still
            happen to be here - having recently been returned with a majority of 703 votes -
            somebody will stand up and quote what I have said.

                            <para>- I have not come to that yet. I point out to honorable members opposite that
                they eventually adopted most of the things that we suggested, although those things
                were not included in the Government's policy speech. In respect of the Army we
                said in the booklet that we would make Citizen Military Forces pay and allowances
                free of income tax. We said that before November last year. The Government has now
                adopted that proposal. In respect of the Navy we said in the booklet that we would
                establish a naval base on the Western Australian coast and that we would con struct
                two dry docks in Victoria and Western Australia. I will leave it at that and refer
                now to matters that are contained in the Bills. I hope that I will be able to make a
                few more remarks on defence when the defence review comes before the House.</para>

                        The Minister for the Navy

                        in his
            second reading speech on the Naval Defence Bill, pointed out that many of the laws
            governing the Royal Australian Navy at the present time emanated from the British Navy.
            That is true. The time has now come when those laws have to be changed in order to fit
            in with the requirements of this country. Sad as it may be and although it may appear to
            be a break from the old traditions of the Royal Navy, that cannot be helped. The world
            is moving quickly and these changes must be made. I regret the changes because I have
            much admiration for, and considerable pride in the British Navy. In Australia we seem to
            be growing apart from the ways of the British Navy and, because of geography, we seem to
            be leaning more towards America. We cannot help that, because America is closer to us
            than Britian is. We must put in order the laws as they apply to our Navy. It is
            interesting to read the preamble to the Articles of War as laid down for the Navy. These
            words are quite famous. Many people have not heard them* I shall read only from the
            famous preamble to the Articles of War, which is well known to naval officers. I believe
            that it should be well known to other Australians, particularly at this time when we
            depend so much on having a strong Navy. The preamble, which was written many years ago,
            says -

            just as much now as it did when it was written. Today we have not a British Navy of
            strength, so it is not on the British Navy that we must depend, but on our own Navy. We
            relied on the British Navy right up until the last war, but now we have to stand on our
            own feet and build our own Navy.</para>
                    <para>The purpose of this Bill is to streamline the Navy, the Army and the Air Force and
            to attract more men into the Services. It could be said that the Bill is, in a way, an
            indictment of the present Government because, although the Government has been in power
            now for 15 years it still has not reached its defence target. It still has not been able
            to make the Services popular enough to induce the young men in Australia to offer
            themselves for duty. That is a deplorable state of affairs. Whether this state of
            affairs is the fault of the men who are not offering or the fault of the Government will
            have to be decided later. I am unhappy that so many of our young men today cannot make
            themselves available to do a bit for their country. Whether we like it or not, the time
            will surely come when some measure more drastic than this Bill will be necessary. We
            cannot sit back in an affluent and prosperous country like Australia and not do
            something to keep our defences in order. If anyone in this House or anyone in Australia
            says that at present he is quite happy with our defences, he is being unrealistic.</para>
                    <para>
                        At present Australia is confronted with forces that are pointing towards us. I hope
            that they will do no more than point towards us, but events that one sees happening, one
            after the other, give cause for concern. I do not like saying this, but 12 months ago
            when I was in Indonesia with the present Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes), Dr. Subandrio</inline>
                        was asked what he thought
            about the nuclear free zone in the southern hemisphere. It is well to remember what he
            said. He said many things about it, but all that I can remember of what he said was that
            so far as he was concerned .the nuclear free zone in the southern hemisphere was
            unrealistic. I heard him say that, and it is fair that the nation should know that I and
            12 other people heard him say it. Since then, Red China has exploded an atomic bomb. At
            that stage Indonesia was building an atomic power station and, so far as I know, she may
            have completed that atomic power station. That project shows that Indonesia is going
            ahead with its nuclear know-how.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        I believe that it is only a matter of time before Indonesia has the atomic bomb. I
            agree with the honorable member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F.
              Cairns)</inline>
                        that we should, if possible, get together with Indonesia and try to
            arrange a treaty to ensure that Indonesia and Australia will keep away from atomic
            weapons. All we can do is try to get such a treaty. That may be a weak way to solve the
            problem that we have because we are not prepared. But I want to return to the provisions
            of this Bill.

                    <para>There are a few matters that should be brought into line with regard to people who
            join the new Emergency Reserve. No mention has been made of dental treatment for those
            who join the Reserve. A few matters have been brought to my notice and I hope that the
            various Service Ministers will consider them. I should like to know what the situation
            would be where a full time or part time member of the Citizen Military Forces in
            Australia becomes ill or is involved in an accident due to Service causes, or any other
            causes. Will he remain on full pay and be kept on in the Service until he regains his
            former health? I should like to know also what the situation is with regard to a full or
            part time member of the C.M.F., whether inside Australia or outside Australia, who is
            killed while on service. Will his widow be entitled to a war widow's pension? I
            should like to know also whether this Bill will empower the call up of individual C.M.F.
            officers and noncommissioned officers for full time duty both inside and outside
            Australia. I do not think this point has been made clear. It would be of great benefit
            to people who intend to join the Emergency Reserve if the Service Ministers could make
            that point clear.</para>
                    <para>While referring to the Navy I omitted to mention one point. At the present time in
            Australia we have no register of Australian ships. Every Australian ship, whether it is
            a warship or a merchant ship, is on the British register of shipping. Every naval ship
            is registered as a merchant ship, in some respects, and consequently goes on to the
            British register of shipping. I bring this to the notice of the Minister for the Navy
            because he intends to introduce a bill to alter the law concerning discipline and the
            law governing the relationship between the British and Australian Navies. The Minister
            should consider whether Australian ships could be placed on an Australian register.</para>
                    <para class="block">Even Australian merchant ships are classed as British registered
            ships. Our warships also are registered as British ships. This is a matter to which
            attention should be given. I make another plea to the Minister: When our reserve
            officers are called up they should not be required to wear the letter " R " on
            their uniforms because when a reserve officer goes on board a warship he is set apart
            immediately by the " R " on his arm. I think he is placed on rather
            disadvantageous terms in relation to other officers. It does not happen in the Army and
            I do not think it happens in the Air Force at present. During the war, England had the
            R.A.F.V.R., but towards the end of the war it was disbanded. The Army eliminated the
            symbols on officers' uniforms a long time ago and I think the Royal Australian Navy
            should also do this.</para>

                            .- If I am not considered to be too much of a square, I would like to speak to the
              Bills. I support them, not only because I consider that they make a practical
              contribution to the solution of the defence problems in front of us today, but also
              because of the good work of the Minister for Defence
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge).</inline>
                            If ever we have 6een a new Minister have a good look
              at his new responsibilities, start work at the bottom and work up, we have seen it
              with the Minister for Defence who has produced this legislation.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        At the outset we should be quite clear about what the Bills do. This may seem to be
            trite at this stage of the debate, but after listening to the honorable member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns)</inline>
                        and other honorable members, I
            think we should Kt out what the Bills do. They do not purport to solve all the defence
            problems that face us at the moment. They do not purport to attract so many men to the
            forces that we will have full complements. They set out, first, to establish volunteer
            Emergency Reserves and secondly to deal with changed obligations for members of the
            citizen forces. Opportunity is also taken to amend other portions of the Defence Act. If
            I may gently chide the Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr.
              Forbes),</inline>
                        I think he is too modest and does not do justice when he says that
            these amendments may be treated as machinery amendments. That may be true but to me the
            amendments are of very real import both in regard to recruiting and in regard to the
            treatment of the men when they have joined the Services.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Bills take their place in a master pattern which is designed to solve our
            defence problems. This master pattern changes with the times as the Government tries to
            look ahead. A constantly changing international situation requires a changing strategy.
            The legislation takes its place with decisions that have been made in the past. These
            decisions have meant that we have acquired new equipment, new fighting stores and
            weapons, new destroyers of a very modern type, the most up to date conventional
            submarines and helicopters. We not only have the means to fight but we also have the
            opportunity to train with modern weapons. We have not previously had this opportunity.
            We also have the Mirage fighter and the Caribou transport aircraft, and we will later
            have the FI IIA aircraft. This is all part of the pattern to which these Bills belong.
            We have dealt with other legislation and regulations dealing with pay and allowances,
            better conditions for personnel and housing for personnel. We have seen changes in
            equipment and greatly changed uniforms and personal gear. All this is done to maintain
            our armed forces at a modern standard.</para>
                    <para>Now other smaller measures are being adopted and I would like to mention some of
            them. They do not of themselves appear to make any big contribution to our deffence, but
            at the same time some of them are most imaginative. Men are given a choice of the branch
            in which they will serve when they join the Army. Such a choice was not given before;
            the men were drafted. Members of the Army school cadet corps are being given the
            opportunity to go to the Antarctic at the end of the year. This may seem to be a very
            small matter to those who are not associated with the corps, but it must appeal to the
            boys. It is an imaginative move and will create interest and build up morale. It may not
            do very much to increase our fighting efficiency but it will definitely encourage the
            boys in the corps. C.M.F. officers are being sent to Papua and New Guinea. Once again,
            only small numbers are concerned, but it is important for C.M.F. officers or prospective
            officers to know that the opportunity is being given to them to see Papua and New
            Guinea, where they may at some future time be called on to fight. The wise commanding
            officer will use the men who visit the Territory in discusions with other officers and
            intending officers, N.C.O.s and men who have not been there and want to know something
            about the conditions there. Although these are small matters, they will be helpful and
            they fit into the general pattern.</para>
                    <para>Let me mention another tremendously important aspect. I have seen an advertisement
            in the newspapers seeking a director of public relations for the Department of Defence.
            One of the tasks of this officer will be to formulate the public relations policy of the
            defence group of departments. If ever we needed an outstanding man for this position, we
            need him now. We are not selling our achievements well enough. I have never said that
            our efforts are adequate, but we should tell the people what we are doing. I think that
            the appointment of a director of public relations, under whom all the other public
            relations officers in the departments will work, is a very wise move and I commend the
            Government for creating the position.</para>
                    <para>The decisions that are implemented in the Bills have been made after looking at the
            constantly changing situation in the areas that concern us most. For the moment, these
            areas are in South East Asia. The situation is changing from day to day and we must look
            at it in the light of our treaty obligations under A.N.Z.U.S., S.E.A.T.O. and, to an
            extent, A.N.Z.A.M. In the legislation before us we are creating a Regular Army Emergency
            Reserve. In the future it will become well known by the initials R.A.E.R. The Minister
            said frankly that the Emergency Reserve would comprise 3,600 men. This is a good number
            and will give us a good body of highly trained mcn. It will consist of eligible, former
            regular soldiers, men who have been trained, lt is good to see the Minister give an
            estimate that the Reserve will consist of 3,600 mcn who will be available once the
            scheme is working. They will be capable of call up for service anywhere at any time. As
            I see it they are un-officered, but I think it is the intention to assimilate them into
            other regular units which are already officered, so that difficulty will be overcome.</para>
                    <para>If I were to express a slight doubt on these Bills at all it would be to ask the
            question: Have we not gone as far as we can go with the number of parts to our forces?
            As I add them up there are 12 or more parts to our forces now. Can we handle them
            administratively? Our Defence Forces are divided into three separate arms - the Navy,
            the Army and the Air Force. The Navy, our senior Service, is divided into three parts -
            the Permanent Naval Forces, the Naval Emergency Reserve Forces and the Citizen Naval
            Forces. With the Air Force we have the Permanent Air Force, the Air Force Emergency
            Force and the Citizen Air Force, which again is divided into two parts - the Active
            Citizen Air Force and the Air Force Reserve.</para>
                    <para>Our military forces are divided into two parts. First, the Permanent Military
            Forces, which are broken up into four parts - the Australian Regular Army, the Regular
            Army Supplement, the Regular Army Emergency Reserve and the Regular Army Reserve. The
            second part of our military forces is the Citizen Military Forces. So, our forces are
            divided into about 12 parts. I hope that we do not divide them further. However, as I
            see it, there is a need for every one of these parts, because each part has a separate
            set of circumstances governing its activities.</para>
                    <para>
                        I am not au fait with the Regular Army Supplement, and possibly the Minister for the
            Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes)</inline>
                        can tell us something about it
            later. 1 can see nothing much about it in the Bill. Possibly I should be familiar wilh
            it from my other studies. However, I take it that the Regular Army Supplement is in
            existence now and that the Bill continues its existence and does not do away with it. I
            think we should be clear on some of the characteristics of the groups established under
            this Bill-
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">Let us deal first with the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, which is
              a new force. lt can be called out by order of the Governor-General. It can be called
              out for continuous service with the Permanent Military Forces and it can be asked to
              serve anywhere at any time in peace or war. It also carries an obligation to train.
              The men in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve will bc required to meet certain
              training commitments which I will not detail now. It is no good my expressing an
              opinion on this, because this is a matter for the experts. However, I think that the
              establishment of this Reserve is a masterpiece, and I commend the responsible Minister
              and the Government more particularly as its establishment was not predicted by any
              outside body so far as I know. Its establishment was left to the military advisers and
              to the Government. No outside experts, pseudo or otherwise, thought of it. I commend
              the Government for proposing the establishment of an organisation which will be able
              to produce 3,600 men at short notice and which will be able to move to any point and
              to fight on arrival.</para>
                        <para>The Regular Army Reserve is slightly different, lt may be called out by the
              Minister but, as I see it, only after a proclamation by the Governor-General of a
              state of defence emergency. In this the Regular Army Reserve differs from the Regular
              Army Emergency Reserve. Members of the Regular Army Reserve have no obligation to
              continue with their training, as I understand it. I know that if I am wrong the
              Minister will correct me. Although our Army today has many parts, they are all
              different and they all have different functions to perform.</para>
                        <para>
                            I have little comment to make on that part of the Bill relating to the ability to
              call the Citizen Military Forces out for overseas service, except to say that from my
              knowledge of the C.M.F. this provision will be received with great delight. It should
              not be forgotten that these men have already signed up to serve overseas, but
              apparently there is some doubt as to the legal processes. Although I have not seen the
              amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Fremantle
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline>
                            as I understand it - and I know to what
              it is directed - it is virtually redundant and unnecessary. Members of the C.M.F. have
              signed on the dotted line for overseas service and they are not going to worry much
              about this new arrangement, which is purely a machinery matter. The end result will be
              exactly as they expected it to be. I think it will lift the morale of the men. It
              could act as an aid to recruiting, although to what extent I would not venture to say.
              As the Minister said, it will give a real meaning, a true sense of purpose to service
              in the C.M.F. I think it will assist materially in obtaining the co-operation of
              employers whose employees want to serve in the C.M.F.
                        </para>
                        <para>The Bill is designed to protect civil employment and it restricts the employer
              from preventing an employee from serving in the forces. I have heard it said that the
              Australian employer has been put on trial. I do not think it is as severe as that. We
              are calling on industry, whether it be primary industry, secondary industry or service
              industry, for co-operation. We are calling on industry to make a sacrifice which, in
              this case, is a form of insurance - a type of war risk insurance. At the same time, do
              not let us underestimate the premium which we are asking employers to pay. I fully
              agree that we are doing the right thing, but I do not think that we should accept this
              without realising that it will cost employers, particularly the small businessmen,
              something. I can foresee difficulties for the small businessman - the grocer or the
              butcher who employs one man. The employee has every right to enlist in the C.M.F. In
              fact, many people would regard it as his duty. His employer will be hit to some
              extent. I referred to this particular problem recently and queried whether some
              thought could bc given to providing some form of compensation to the small employer. I
              realise that the problem of where to draw the line - who is in and who is out - would
              arise. We must watch the situation closely to prevent hardship, particularly to small
              employers.</para>
                        <para>The legislation, however, will help to overcome the employer block which exists at
              present. I know that an employer block exists today, not only in private enterprise
              but in some semi-governmental undertakings - hospitals and so on. I have not found
              this block of Commonwealth departments, but I am surprised to say that it exists in
              some State Government departments. I have found that difficulties arise with civic and
              local government bodies. For instance, I have recently noticed a case in which a
              Pastures Protection Board would not allow the local Citizen Military Forces unit to
              exercise on an unfenced reserve. This is the sort of thing that occurs. When I go into
              these matters I always first approach the C.M.F. members concerned and ask whether
              they will be embarrassed if I talk to anyone about the problem. I inform them that
              they can talk to me quite freely. If the persons concerned are embarrassed, I respect
              their situation. I find that those concerned will always tell me what has happened.
              However, usually, like many other people, they are somewhat afraid of politicians and
              they also fear for their future in their jobs. Nearly always, they ask me not to go
              ahead with the matter. I believe that the raising of the status of the citizen forces
              as proposed in these Bills will largely overcome the employer block that at present
              exists without any further action on the part of the Government by way of regulation.</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I turn now to the Naval Defence Bill. I see that it will establish a Naval Emergency
            Reserve which will be composed of fully trained officers and men and will be subject to
            call up by the Governor-General in circumstances short of war. However, this force will
            differ from the other emergency reserves because it will be a third part of the Naval
            forces, not part of either the Permanent Navy or the Citizen Naval Forces, unlike the
            Regular Army Emergency Reserve. Members of the Naval Emergency Reserve will have an
            obligation to undergo refresher training. That is reasonable. I would be most interested
            to learn the number of men who are likely to make up this Emergency Reserve. Perhaps the
            figure can be stated. I am sorry that there has so far been no mention of it.</para>

            indication of how many men are likely to be available, but we have been told that 1,200
            are likely to be required and that keen competition for the available places is
            expected. So it looks as if we shall have in this reserve 1,200 fully trained Air Force
            personnel who, of course, will be subject to further training. Preference is to be given
            to former members of the Permanent Air Force or present and former members of the active
            Citizen Air Force. We have been told that there are now no pilots in the active Citizen
            Air Force. I understand that to be correct. All the members of that Force are ground
            staff. Preference is to be given also to members of the Air Force Reserve and the
            University Squadrons.</para>

                        There appears to be little mention of the Air Force Reserve in the Air Force Bill.
            What is intended to happen to that Reserve in the future? There has been little
            explanation of its role in peace, times of emergency or war. I think the Minister for
            Air
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson)</inline>
                        will recall my asking a question in
            September about doubts in the minds of members of the Air Force Reserve, particularly
            those who act periodically as instructors for the Air Training Corps. I asked about
            their role in the event of a national emergency arising. I hope that the Minister will
            give us some information on this matter. These men have devoted a good deal of their
            time and patience, and, in many instances, a good deal of expense, to the initial
            training of the youth of Australia in the Air Training Corps. I should say that they
            have done much to assist in moulding the character of young men who have served in the
            Corps. I believe that they do a most commendable job. I hope that their future will be
            well looked after, though their future role is not made clear to me by the Bill. I
            should like to hear more on the subject so that I may advise a number of Air Force
            Reserve officers in my electorate.

                        I point out that these
            measures will establish Reserves of trained men. These Reserves will facilitate rapid
            movement of those who are trained and will provide a sound basis for the expansion of
            training. The members of the citizen forces will feel more wanted than in the past. They
            will feel that the Parliament has assured them that they have an effective role to play
            in times of strife. This legislation will also bring us up to date in a number of
            smaller matters. Though they may be described as smaller matters, anybody who has had
            any association with Service life will realise that these improvements will be
            particularly welcome in all the Services. They are most constructive.

                        Finally, I ask the Government to consider representations that I have made
            previously about the advisability of instituting a manpower register. I hope that the
            Ministry, during its deliberations on defence next week, will closely consider the need
            for a more virile and more dynamic recruiting campaign than we have at present. We are
            already spending big money on recruiting, but I believe that the campaign could be much
            improved. An effective manpower policy is necessary. Perhaps there is provision for it
            tucked away in the archives somewhere, but I know nothing of it. The need for a proper
            manpower policy has particular application to the citizen forces. Wc must know which
            occupations will be reserved. What is to happen to medical officers, nuclear physicists
            and skilled machinists? They will be in great demand when a national emergency arises.
            They will want to be in the thick of things, and I know that many such men are already
            in the Citizen Military Forces. But is it right for them to undertake expensive training
            only to be pulled out of the forces when an emergency arises? We only pull our own legs
            when we say that we have so many trained men in the citizen forces, if we know that,
            immediately hostilities are declared, or just before, a national manpower policy will be
            adopted and many of these mcn will be removed from the forces. I ask the Government to
            consider this matter earnestly during its deliberations on defence next week. I commend
            these measures as constructive ones,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline>
                        I
            believe that they will be very helpful in our present situation. We look forward keenly
            to the next series of proposals that will be submitted after the deliberations to be
            undertaken by the Ministry next week.

                            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                            as previous Opposition speakers
              have pointed out, the debate on these measures does not raise any great difficulties
              for us on this side of the House. Our general view, however, is that the
              Government's proposals are relatively infinitesimal and of little consequence. One
              would have thought that the Emergency Reserves for the Army, the Navy and the Air
              Force which are provided for in these Bills could have been reasonably well
              accommodated in the permanent forces. Not a large number of men will be involved. I
              believe that the Regular Army Emergency Reserve will number some 3,600 men. No more
              than 1,200 will make up the Air Force Emergency Force. The Government has failed to
              mention any specific number. So if the intake is, say, 5,000 personnel in total, it is
              a fair contention in my view that the Australian permanent forces could have stood
              expansion to this extent. After all, it is intended that these Reserve personnel are
              to be on hand in times of emergency. This, of course, would not be anywhere near as
              good a situation as if we had an extra 5,000 men in the permanent forces who could be
              trained and capable of giving leadership and training to other personnel to be
              recruited in times of emergency.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        Nevertheless, we do not oppose the legislation. It is little enough. It is another
            case of too little too late. The Regular Army Emergency Reserve is to be engaged for a
            period of four years. Its members are to be paid the same salary as is applicable to
            Army personnel and at the end of the period of engagement a £100 bounty is to be
            made available to them. I agree with the honorable member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns)</inline>
                        who contended earlier in the debate
            that better attractions could have been offered to these people. I have referred to such
            things as repatriation benefits. Not infrequently honor* able members interview
            ex-servicemen from the last war who never left this country and who were not engaged in
            combat but who, nevertheless, incurred some injury or disability which necessitated them
            applying for repatriation, benefits. It seems reasonable to expect that the members of
            the Emergency Reserve should be covered by repatriation.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The legislation provides that preference in respect of recruitment for the volunteer
            Emergency Reserve will be given to former regular soldiers who have had three years
            continuous service. One wonders why such emphasis is placed on the type of personnel to
            be engaged. After all, it is some considerable time since the last war ended. I suppose
            many former regular soldiers have had enough of the Service and are not inclined to go
            back to it. In the 19 years since the last war ended a large number of young men have
            become available who may be willing to engage in this Service. I hope that at the
            Committee stage the Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr.
              Forbes)</inline>
                        may have an opportunity to say why, except for members of the Citizen
            Military Forces, some opportunity to engage in the Emergency Reserve is not given to
            younger and less experienced men.

                provisions of this legislation relating to the volunteer Emergency Reserve and I
                expressed the hope that the personnel to be engaged in this service would have
                repatriation benefits extended to them. Of course, we on this side feel that this
                kind of protection should be given to the entire Australian community. A decent
                national health scheme would give it to everybody. Just as ex-servicemen from the
                last war who did not engage in combat or go overseas have benefited from the
                provisions of the Repatriation Act, so does it seem reasonable that servicemen being
                enlisted in this particular service should receive similar benefits.</para>

                    <para>
                        I wish to refer to the general inadequacy of the Government's defence policy.
            Every time an election is held the defence issue is trotted out. Somebody said earlier
            during the debate that the Opposition is intent on putting fear into the minds of the
            people, but obviously that is a stock in trade of this Government at election time. When
            we examine the Government's defence policy we see that it is a fairly patchy sort of
            thing and that it is directly associated with the deficiencies of the Government's
            foreign policy. For example, this morning I asked the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline>
                        whether a protest had been made to
            the French Government about its proposed nuclear tests. I went on to mention that
            Professor Titterton had suggested that Australia should acquire nuclear weapons.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        He contends that this represents the only adeqate defence for
            Australia. This morning, I also brought to the attention of the House the remarks of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Linus</inline>
                        Pauling who indicated that something
            like 500,000 children yet unborn would be adversely affected as a result of the proposed
            French nuclear test in the Pacific - this one test. It is alarming to know that the
            Government has done very little about protesting. It is also alarming to know that this
            Government has failed to protest effectively even against the Chinese test.
                    </para>
                    <para>I do not think that Professor Titterton has the answer at all. It is important to
            recall that this Government has not really given effect to the spirit of the Nuclear
            Test Ban Treaty. In 1961, when the Secretary General of the United Nations wrote to
            member countries asking them to indicate the terms on which they would agree not to
            acquire nuclear weapons from other countries, the Australian Government refused to
            indicate that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. That is the Government's present
            attitude. Again, when we remember that we have in Western Australia a United States base
            designed principally to control nuclear submarines capable of projecting nuclear
            missiles into other continents, we realise that here is another example of the
            Government's failure to give proper effect to the spirit of the Nuclear Test Ban
            Treaty.</para>

                            <para>- I am stating facts. It is not nonsense. If 11 million Australians claim the
                right to have nuclear weapons who can possibly deny nuclear weapons to 100 million
                Indonesians or 700 million Chinese? After all, one in every four people in the world
                is Chinese, and our only hope is to discourage nations from having nuclear weapons.
                Nuclear weapons would not mean survival for the people of Australia. In fact when we
                set out to provide defence against an aggressor by acquiring nuclear weapons we are
                creating a far greater threat than the aggressor himself represents.</para>

                    <para>The late President Kennedy made it very clear that, from the standpoint of the
            United States of America, it is not a good thing to have a series of national
            deterrents. In other words, the allied forces - if we are still using that old fashioned
            term - have no need to spread nuclear weapons all around the globe. Our powerful friends
            have nuclear weapons and this should be sufficient. I hope that no one on the Government
            side has been tempted to take Professor Titterton's recommendation seriously.</para>
                    <para>
                        Over the years, the Government has had a conglomeration of defence policies. I have
            before me an indication of how concerned the honorable member for Chisholm
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes)</inline>
                        is about the training of
            Indonesians in Australia. This to me represents a remarkable contradiction. I have never
            contended with any enthusiasm at all in this place that the Indonesians represent the
            kind of threat to Australia that the Government claims they represent, yet this
            Government has been providing facilities for training Indonesians alongside Australian
            Army personnel. Recently, the honorable member for Chisholm asked the Prime Minister
            whether the continued training of Indonesian officers in Australia meant that Australia
            was training them to plan bigger and better raids on Malaysia. He pointed out that there
            was a possibility of Malaysian and Australian soldiers being killed or wounded as a
            result. Here is evidence of the conglomeration of attitudes on the part of this
            Government which is supposed to be inspired by its concern about Indonesia.
                    </para>
                    <para>Let me now compare the defence expenditure in this country with that of other
            countries. The United States of America spends £112 per head per annum on defence.
            The United Kingdom spends £32 per head per annum, Canada spends £39 per head
            per annum and Australia spends only £13 9s. per head per annum. Again, the United
            States of America spends 11 per cent, of her gross national product on defence while the
            United Kingdom spends 7 per cent, and Australia only 3 per cent. Why, a greater
            percentage of our gross national product was spent on defence as far back as 1952 and
            1953. Certainly a greater amount of money is spent today, but that is only because of
            the decrease in the value of money owing to inflation. In terms of real expenditure we
            are slipping backwards and we compare very badly with a number of other countries.</para>
                    <para>
                        Before making a few comments about the Navy I should like to mention that there are
            many honorable members on this side of the House who are inspired to take a very great
            interest in defence. Almost every electorate north of the Tropic of Capricorn is
            represented by a member of the Australian Labour Party. It is for this reason that so
            many of my colleagues from the north have spoken en about defence in recent times. The
            honorable member for Kennedy
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),</inline>
                        a former
            Minister for the Navy, has expressed his concern. The honorable member for the Northern
            Territory
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson),</inline>
                        has spoken about defence,
            and the honorable member for Capricornia
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gray),</inline>
                        who is very well informed about armaments and matters of that kind, has also given some
            leadership in defence thinking for the benefit of the Government and this country. The
            honorable member for Leichhardt
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fulton),</inline>
                        who
            represents a great area, including the Cape York Peninsula, has spoken recently, and so
            has the honorable member for Herbert
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harding).</inline>
                        All of these men are ex-servicemen with experience. There is only one electorate above
            the 23rd parallel which is represented by a member other than a member of the
            Opposition. The great western coast of Australia is also represented by a member of the
            Labour Party. I refer to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collard).</inline>
                        Is it any wonder that they speak with some feeling about
            these matters when so much money has been poured into defence and we have so little to
            show for it after the length of time for which this Government has been in office?
                    </para>
                    <para>Not only has the north been neglected. No one on the other side of the House would
            dissent from my contention that it is very difficult to find a defence installation in
            the north at any place above the 23rd parallel. It is equally difficult to find any
            defence installation on the west coast, and it is also difficult to find one in the
            Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I have before me a cutting from the Sydney
            "Sun" of 23rd March 1964 which refers to the State Congress of the Territory
            Returned Servicemen's League which was held at Lae. The report said -</para>
                    <quote>

                    <para class="block">I have been to the Territory and I know the position pretty well. I
            know that the Government has come to think of the need to provide airstrips and
            accompanying facilities in the Territory. There is a need also to increase the size of
            the Pacific Islands Regiment, but this is a pretty slender reed on which to lean. After
            all, this is the regiment, unfortunately, which has indulged in riots in the past. I do
            not think I am unfair in saying that, because it is a fact. I think the principal
            prowess of members of this regiment for some years has been their capacity to form a
            band which plays Scottish music. I do not want to malign them in any way or reflect any
            discredit on them, but I want to reflect discredit on the Government, because it is the
            Government that says there is a need for adequate defences around the north of
            Australia. This is the area that is threatened, and this is the point that has been made
            constantly over the years by honorable members on the other side of the House. If I held
            a conviction and expressed it with the same fervour as Government members have expressed
            this kind of conviction I would want to see some practical manifestation of my concern.</para>

                        The Navy is involved in this legislation. I want to say a few things about the Navy,
            because that arm of the Services leaves a great deal to be desired. Its deficiencies
            were outlined in some detail in the recent debate on the "Voyager" tragedy. We
            all hoped that that shocking incident would have given rise to real concern on the part
            of the Government so that the apparent deficiencies might be overcome in the near
            future. The Leader of the Opposition

                        read a long list of major misdemeanours in which the Navy had been involved in recent
            years. As I glanced through some papers this afternoon I was able to recall a few of the
            unfortunate incidents that have occurred involving the Navy. We did have a wonderful
            Navy in Australia 20 years ago. The Australian Navy was then the most formidable in
            Asia. In terms of personnel and of numbers of ships it is probably now rated as fifth
            class. China, Japan, India and Indonesia all have bigger navies than we have.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Honorable members can recall some of the shocking shemozzles involving the Navy that
            have occurred over the years. Honorable members like the honorable member for Grayndler
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline>
                        will recall the scandal of the sale of
            the " Hobart " a few years ago, when huge amounts of money were poured down the
            drain. I remember the honorable member for Grayndler exposing the Government on this
            matter after he had asked a series of questions. An amount of £1.5 million was
            spent on refitting the "Hobart". No sooner was the refit completed than the
            Government decided to sell the ship for £200,000 to Mitsui and Co. (Aust.) Pty.
            Ltd., a Japanese scrap iron concern. This is the kind of thing that has been happening
            for a long time in connection with our Navy.
                    </para>
                    <para>Going through the list of vessels in the Royal Australian Navy, I find that 15 of
            them are at least 15 years old. One wonders what kind of defence effectiveness is
            represented by these vessels. We have, of course, an aircraft carrier, not carrying
            winged aircraft but carrying helicopters at the present time. Half of our fleet will
            probably be needed to protect this aircraft carrier. We have two Daring class destroyers
            which form a very important part of the fleet, and we have one Battle class destroyer
            which is getting on in years. We have four frigates and six minesweepers. Then we have
            the "Sydney", which used to be an aircraft carrier and now is a troop transport
            carrying 1,000 troops. The experts say that this vessel would be of no use in beach head
            operations in any case. In terms of personnel we have half an admiral for every ship in
            the Royal Australian Navy. That is, we have seven admirals for every 14 ships. We have
            one officer for every three other ranks. But more startling is the fact that we have a
            civilian force numbering about 8,500 people working for the Navy. This represents a
            tremendous overhead and it represents little in the way of a striking force or a
            striking capacity. This arrangement seems to be typical of the Australian Services.</para>
                    <para>Then there are some problems in connection with the Army. By means of the measure we
            are now discussing the Government hopes to entice a number of former servicemen back

              time as school cadets. " As an example, our unit is a special Centurion tank unit.
              We've got one rank, the rest are 1942 armoured cars which go when they feel like

              the C.M.F., but a situation such as I have outlined does not reflect credit on this
              Government. This afternoon there was som: controversy concerning the time it would
              take to get Centurion tanks from Puckapunyal to th; north. The honorable member for
              Capricornia had contended that it would t:kc some considerable time to move these
              tanks, which represent probably the most substantial and vital part of the Australian
              Army's striking force. In the event of strategic operational manoeuvres being
              necessary we would be relying to a considerable extent on these tanks. What is the
              position? Let me not speculate about this, because 1 do not even claim to be anything
              like an expert in these matters. But one who should know is the former Minister for

                            <para>- Not because of his Army experience - he was an air raid warden - but because
                he served as Minister for the Army. In answer to a question he said it would take 10
                to 15 days to move these tanks from Adelaide to Perth and 14 to 21 days to move them
                to Darwin. I do not know whether this is exactly as the honorable member for
                Capricornia put it, but I think it bears out the point that he was trying to make.
                These statements are denied by honorable members opposite, but they did not
                originate with the honorable member for Capricornia; they came from the former
                Minister for the Army. It is also important for us to realise how long it would take
                to move these tanks fully loaded from Melbourne to the places I now name. It would
                take 2 days 10 hours to move them to Sydney, 4 days 11 hours to Brisbane, 2 days 3
                hours to Adelaide, 12 days 21 hours to Darwin and 7 days 1 8 hours to Perth. This is
                the Government's express service of the transportation of Centurion tanks. Of
                course, if these tanks have to go by road, it has already been established thai they
                g;t bogged down on our bridges which are not wide enough to accommodate them, and
                all kinds of difficulties accrue. How much notice would this Government want from an
                enemy of its intentions to wage a war in Australia? Is it to be 15 days or 21 days
                notice? Why are not these tanks strategically placed around the Australian
                countryside and in the places where you would expect attacks to occur? Why are they
                not located in some of the Australian Territories where they might have to be used?
                These are questions which honorable members opposite might well be prepared to
                answer.</para>

                    <para>Another matter which I think should be looked at when you are talking about the
            incentives to people to join the Army is the allowance paid to Australian soldiers who
            leave the Australian mainland. If an Australian soldier goes to Borneo, he receives a
            zone allowance of £105 a year. If he goes to New Guinea, this allowance is
            £165 a year. In Darwin he receives £140 a year. If he is stationed at Woomera,
            he receives an allowance of £100 a year. This allowance, to my way of thinking,
            should be reviewed if the Government is looking for ways of boosting the morale of Army
            personnel.</para>

                about ammunition. It was a startling revelation a short time ago that half a million
                pounds worth of ammunition is produced each year in this country which is not
                serviceable. This information was obtained by one of my colleagues in another place.

                                Something is radically
                wrong here. This is just another one of the reasons why we are not getting value for
                our money. The Minister in charge of this particular matter would do well to provide
                some kind of explanation for this wastage of ammunition.

                    <para>The personnel of the Army is being increased. I understand from the figures made

            it had at the time of Federation in 1901. The official figure for Army membership at
            that time was 27,353. The Minister for the Army might be good enough to tell me the
            figure now and indicate the extent to which it exceeds the number we had in 1901. I am
            not one who has vigorously contended that the reaching of higher figures is necessary.
            The Government has done that. Having contended that, the Government has a much bigger

            concerning national service training. The Minister for the Army has been in favour of
            national service training for years and years. He did not deviate from that policy until
            he became Minister for the Army. The first speech he made after taking his seat on the

                support the Government. There is a great deal of vacillation and a great deal of
                uncertainty on this subject. If a selective training scheme is to be introduced, we
                would like to know just who are the limited number of people who will be selected.
                Will selections be made from the universities or trad: unions, or from the ranks of
                boilermakers and building apprentices, amongst others, who are so necessary and who
                are so greatly needed in Australia today? These are matters on which it seems there
                is need for Government members to be vocal.</para>

                        I have moved into an area which I did not propose to cover so extensively. But the
            general position is that after spending a figure in the vicinity of £3,000 million
            on defence over the 15 years it has been in office the Government finds that our
            defences have reached this very sorry state of affairs, and, on the eve of yet another
            election, there is to be a desperate, fairly dramatic, last minute effort to give the
            impression to the Australian people that the Government is really concerned with
            defence. As I have indicated in the short time available to me, there are these
            vulnerable issues about which this Government should give some account of itself. The
            north of Australia
                        <inline font-style="italic">h</inline>
                        still defenceless, and it does
            not seem to be likely that the provision before the House at the present time is going
            to reflect any more credit on the Government than the very unsatisfactory performance it
            has given over the last 15 years it has been in office.

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                            that
              during the course of this debate many constructive speeches have been made, and not
              all of them on this side of the House. I think that one would acknowledge some of the
              constructive criticism that has come from the Opposition side even though one would
              repudiate' and show some contempt for the left wing disruptive tactics of some
              honorable members on the opposite side.

                    <para>
                        I want to try to be constructive in this matter. The Bill before us is a step
            forward, but is it- a step straight forward or is it perhaps a little askew? I would
            like to examine this question. Perhaps it is not necessary to examine whether this Bill
            goes far enough, because the Government itself has said that the Bill does not go far
            enough and has itself proposed a later review of defence which the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline>
                        tells us will take place in
            the coming few days.
                    </para>
                    <para>It is necessary in these defence matters that we plan not only to meet the present
            situation, but also to meet the situation as best we can foresee it some years ahead.
            The plans which we undertake now, although they have to have some relevance to any
            possible emergency which could come almost out of the blue overnight, are nevertheless
            plans which must mature for a year or two, or perhaps even longer. We should be
            providing, not just against the present situation, but also against the situation as we
            foresee it might be, shall I say, in 1967 or 1968?</para>
                    <para>There are changed circumstances in our Australian area. They are circumstances
            which, unhappily, seem as though they are changing even faster. Four factors must be
            taken into consideration.</para>
                    <para>The first is the emergence of new powers with conventional weapons in our theatre of
            the world. It is not very long ago that we and our allies would have considered
            ourselves completely and beyond any doubt dominant in this theatre. Today we are
            probably still in a position of dominance. But it would be an optimist who would bank on
            this position of dominance continuing year after year. We are not in the same position
            as regards conventional weapons as we have been throughout our history.</para>
                    <para>Secondly, there is the Communist thrust coming southwards. Let us take what comfort
            we can, if any comfort is to be taken, from the alleged split between the Soviet and
            Chinese Communists. That split at this present moment seems to be in the process of
            healing. But even though we take from that split the maximum comfort, our Communist
            enemies are still driving south towards Australia. Australia is one of their targets.
            They are extending their political influence, unhappily throughout Indonesia, our
            nearest neighbour. They are extending their territorial influence in South East Asia.</para>
                    <para>The third factor of which we have to take account is that the newly elected British
            Government has announced that it proposes to liquidate Britain's nuclear deterrent.
            That means that in this area, instead of being protected by two nuclear umbrellas - the
            British and the American - we now have only one. It is a very sound umbrella, but it is
            not as good as two umbrellas. Furthermore, if the British Government carries out its
            election policy, it will find that, like King Lear, it has given away more than it
            thought it did and that it is unable to retain the authority, even in its own sphere,
            that it had previously. Unfortunately, we have to contend with a situation in which
            there will be an immensely weakened Great Britain, if the Labour Government carries out
            its announced plan.</para>
                    <para>The fourth changed factor is that China has taken the first step towards emergence
            as a nuclear power. China is not a nuclear power at the moment. The threat is years
            away. It may be argued how many years away the threat is, but it is still years away.
            Nevertheless, China, which is an aggressive power, has taken the first step along the
            road.</para>
                    <para>Here we have the four changed factors - the shift of conventional power, the
            Communist thrust, Great Britain's liquidation of its nuclear deterrent, and mainland
            Communist China's acquisition of nuclear power. Those factors pose many questions
            for us. But tonight I want to speak of only one of them; that is the influence that they
            might have upon Army manpower which, I suppose, is the main subject of the measures
            before us.</para>
                    <para>Why do we need a conventional Army, an Army conventionally armed? In these changed
            circumstances I can distinguish five needs for such an Army.</para>
                    <para>First, we may need it to help to engage in putting out some brush fire war in the
            lands to our north. For that purpose we may need only small forces, but we may need them
            quickly.</para>
                    <para>Secondly, we may need it as garrison for our holding position in the countries to
            our north. This is what we have in a minor way at the moment. We have troops stationed
            in Malaysia.</para>
                    <para>In the third place we may need a conventional Army in order to play our part in the
            conventional defence of this area and thus cement to us our one remaining powerful ally,
            the United States. Honorable members must remember that the reliance that hitherto we
            very rightly have been able to place upon Great Britain in this area is now immensely
            diminished, or will be immensely diminished if the British Labour Government carries out
            its election policy. In order to keep our alliances firm, we must be prepared to
            contribute our part to the purposes of the alliances. If we want American soldiers to
            fight a conventional war for the defence of our Australian frontier, we must be prepared
            to use Australian soldiers to help the United States to hold the more distant line which
            keeps conflict out of Australian territory.</para>
                    <para>In the fourth place, we may need conventional forces to defend our own Australian
            bases. Hitherto, with the very small exception of the months preceding the Battle of the
            Coral Sca, we have always considered our Australian bases secure and inviolable. We have
            to get out of that habit of thinking in the new and much worse world in which we arc now
            placed.</para>
                    <para>In the fifth place we may need our conventional forces for something even worse than
            the defence of our Australian bases; that is to preserve the structure and identity of
            the Australian people in time of attack. We have seen chaos develop in countries which
            did not have that kind of strength, a strength that we do not have now. We may need to
            be a people under arms if we are to survive. This is not a pretty picture. But any
            Government that fails to face it is failing in its duty to the Australian people. I am
            trying to analyse this matter as coldly and logically as I possibly can.</para>
                    <para>What do we need for these purposes, in the form of conventional forces? Tonight I am
            confining my remarks to this one aspect of defence. First, obviously, we need formations
            in being; that is, formations - perhaps not very numerous - which can be moved into
            action without delay, which do not need mobilisation.</para>
                    <para>Secondly, we need formations in reserve, obviously, we will not keep the whole of
            our manpower, our formations, actually in being. But we need in reserve not just trained
            men but formations which, with only a few weeks' delay, can be made mobile and moved
            into action.</para>
                    <para>In the third place we need a pool of trained men, not necessarily mobilised into
            formations, for reinforcement purposes. It is an unhappy fact that if formations are
            committed to war there will be casualties, and reinforcements are necessary to make them
            good. That requires a pool of trained manpower, although not necessarily in formations.</para>
                    <para>In the fourth place we may need the machinery for general mobilisation of the whole
            of our Australian manpower. These things cannot be achieved all at once. That is
            obvious. We must tackle this step by step. The first steps are not necessarily the same
            as the final drive that we need to create. We do not run our motor cars on the self
            starter, but sometimes we need to use the self starter to get the engine going. So the
            first steps that we take may not be entirely the same as the final situation that we
            want to achieve. But when we take these first steps we must be sure that they do not get
            in the way of succeeding steps that we will have to take towards the creation of the
            force which we will need and which we must create before many years pass.</para>
                    <para>
                        Obviously, the first thing that we have to do is create an instructional corps which
            at some future stage will be able to handle a big intake of men for training. There is
            no need for me to elaborate that point. I have only to refer to the speech made in
            Hobart recently by the Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr.
              Forbes).</inline>
                        He said then - I believe that he must have been speaking the truth -
            that we could not now take in men for training because that would disrupt our
            operational forces. This is how this speech was reported. He said that his advisors had
            spoken against bringing in large drafts now because that would impair the efficiency of
            our operational forces. The House must remember that we are now passing through a period
            where our semi-trained reserves are changing. Until fairly recently we had quite big
            reserves of manpower from the last war which would have been available to us. These men
            are now getting into the age group where they will not be of great use to us.
                    </para>
                    <para>We have to create immediately, without delay, an instructional corps to handle the
            new intake that is to come. As the Minister for the Army has said, we cannot handle this
            intake now. If we cannot handle it now, is it not obvious that unless we make great
            changes we could not handle it under the stress of war, when our present formations
            would be committed for operational purposes? This, surely, is obvious. Therefore,
            whatever else is done, without breaching the integrity of the operational forces an
            instructional corps must be created and this must be put in hand immediately. To some
            extent men for this corps could be got from volunteers and to some extent from over-age
            people who would not be available for operational duty. But whatever this corps entails,
            even if in the first stages - this thing must grow stage by stage - we have to start
            with a small core to train the instructional corps, we must put this in hand, even if it
            means some small diminution of our operational strength in the next few months. Every
            month's delay in the formation of this corps is a crime against Australia.</para>
                    <para>Next, we must expand the Australian Regular Army on a voluntary basis as fast as it
            is possible to do so. This can be done while the Australian Instructional Corps is going
            forward. Of course, we must encourage the Citizen Military Forces and the parallel
            concept of an emergency force which is proposed in the Bill before the House. That is a
            good and a valuable consonant.</para>
                    <para>Then, looking ahead at the people who will be available to us in 1968 and 1969 -
            they are young now - we should be expanding our system of school cadet corps as soon as
            possible. This can be done without interfering with the other operations of the Army.
            There is no excuse for the present position where schools that want to expand their
            cadet corps are not allowed to do so. This is a quite intolerable thing which I am sure
            the Minister is in the process of changing. It is something which is so clear that I do
            not want to stress it any further.</para>
                    <para>Those are the four steps that we must take immediately, here and now. Let me add to
            them perhaps a fifth step which is not quite co-ordinate. I refer to the preparation of
            the necessary register of manpower. I put this on one side because, although it is
            something that should be done and should be done immediately, it is not perhaps in the
            Minister's Department.</para>
                    <para>Once we get this sort of plan under way we must then proceed to the second stage. We
            will need to conscript manpower in the young age groups. I do not see that we should be
            satisfied with a draft of less than 20,000 a year - it may have to be moreand the length
            of service should not be less than two years. That means in point of fact that we would
            have a conscripted force of 40,000 - that is, two years' intake - and every year,
            starting from three or four years from now, we would have an outgoing of 20,000 trained
            men available for some kind of reserve.</para>
                    <para>There should be proper privileges for these men - heavy deferred pay, war service
            homes privileges, educational privileges, employment preferences and the other
            privileges which are given for the United States draft. I do not suggest for one moment
            that we should endeavour to penalise these people, but I do suggest that we must have
            them to build up A.R.A. numbers. Perhaps it will be said that we would not be able to
            deal with 20,000 in the first year. That may well be; but provided that the target is
            there and that the approach to it is as quick as is practicable, no complaint can be
            made. However, if the target is set too low or the progress towards it is too slow, then
            not only complaint but protest should be made in this House and elsewhere. The time has
            come to stop fiddling with this job.</para>
                    <para>I have dealt with the first step of the second stage. Another step of the second
            stage should be to strip down the C.M.F. to an operational role which means, of course,
            cutting out from it all those people who are over-age or would be in reserved
            occupations during a war. The people who came out of compulsory training, and of course
            they would be attested for overseas service, could, if they wanted to so volunteer, join
            the C.M.F. I am sure that they would provide a ready force of volunteers to keep up the
            C.M.F. strength. Or if they do not volunteer for the C.M.F. they could go on to the
            trained reserve. The C.M.F. should be stripped down and made into operational formations
            on a local and territorial basis, with particular emphasis on the possibility of
            establishing units in country centres. This is to be encouraged. I will not have time to
            go into detailed measures, but the C.M.F. must be made a vital part of the scheme and,
            together with the remnants of the emergency force which is now being created, it must be
            the reserve of officers. There is no reason why from the enlarged Australian Regular
            Army in those future years there could not be some small rotation through both the
            Instructional Corps and the C.M.F. so that, without breaching the integrity of the
            formation, we could make an army which could operate in a unified fashion.</para>
                    <para>Let me say that it might be a good thing if for training purposes, and more for
            training than for operational reasons, a number of these formations of the Regular Army
            were posted to northern stations. I think there is a great deal to be said for this. Of
            course, there is nothing to be said for dissipating our operational strength. Posting to
            northern stations would have to be done in accordance with a reasonable plan, lt is no
            good spreading the butter very thin over a lot of bread, but there is, I believe, a case
            to be made out of putting some of our operational regular forces north in the future,
            when we have built up our present Regular Army and have an additional 40,000 people
            undergoing compulsory training every two years. I see no reason why this force in the
            north should not be used for some useful works. There are plenty of roads to be built;
            there are aerodromes to be constructed; there are irrigation and other works to be put
            in hand; and there seems to be no reason why a force which it is necessary to hold as an
            operational force should have to waste all its manpower without doing some useful work.
            We must, however, put our defence plans into operation without delay. Time runs against
            us and we must save all the time we can. Action should start now - it should start
            tomorrow - on the Instructional Corps and the national register. I hope that both these
            projects will form part of the defence review which the Prime Minister has promised and
            which is to be undertaken, as I have said, within the next few days.</para>
                    <para>Some of the matters I have suggested are not pleasant, but our situation is not
            pleasant. We may as well look the reality in the face. I do not for one moment suggest
            that all we have to do is to carry out these reforms on the Army manpower side. I have
            tried tonight to concentrate in a constructive way on this feature of what we have to
            do. If there is to be world disarmament with sanctions, well and good; nobody would be
            more for it than I. But unilateral disarmament is suicide for a people and those who
            advocate it are not being loyal to their responsibilities in this Parliament. I thank
            the House for having listened to me.</para>

                            that Australia's
              state of defence does not present a very pretty picture. I wholeheartedly agree with
              him; it does not. The defence situation in Australia today presents a very tragic
              picture. It is a situation against which the people should protest in the most
              eloquent way possible, and on 5th December - not very long from now - they will have
              their opportunity to say what they think of the pitiful defence situation into which
              the Government has allowed the country to lapse after 15 solid years in office, with
              control of both Houses of the Parliament. There is no excuse for the situation in
              which we now find ourselves. The Government cannot offer one single reason for the
              existence of this situation, except its own apathy, indolence and refusal to face
              facts. It is good that the people will have the opportunity to weigh the views
              expressed by the honorable members for Mackellar, Chisholm

                                - Well, 6,000 lbs. That is 50 per cent, higher than the last official estimate
                that the Government gave of the carrying capacity of the Canberra bomber. This
                brings me to the point that we never know which Minister to believe, when we are
                given information about our defence preparedness. We do not know whether to believe
                the Minister for Air
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson),</inline>
                                who says that
                the Canberra bomber will carry 6,000 lbs., or his predecessor, who said it will
                carry only 4,000 lbs. If they cannot make up their minds about their equipment and
                if they do not know the performance figures for their equipment - in this instance,
                there is a difference of 50 per cent, between the estimates - is it any wonder that
                we are in such a hopeless and shocking defence position? But let us assume that the
                bomb load of the Canberra bomber is 6,000 lbs., or 50 per cent, more than the
                estimate of the previous Minister for Air. I want to compare the performance of the
                Canberra bomber with that of the Russian Badger bomber or TU16. The Badger has a
                range of 4,000 miles, compared with the range of 900 miles of the Canberra, and a
                bomb load of 7,000 lbs. compared with the bomb load of the Canberra of 4,000 lbs. or
                even 6,000 lbs., if we take the estimate given by the Minister Aor Air by way of
                interjection. The range of the Badger is more than four times greater than the range
                of the Canberra.

                    <para>The honorable member for Mackellar has told the Parliament that we really have only
            one thing to fear and that is Communism in Asia. I want him to reflect a little upon
            this subject of Communism, because before we deal with a complaint we ought to try to
            find out the cause of the complaint. It is far better to discover and eradicate the
            cause than to be content with merely tinkering with the effects. Communism in Asia does
            not come spontaneously to the Asian people. Communism in any Moslem country does not
            come easily to the Moslems. Communism in any country is a last resort grasped by a
            people desperate and determined to change the existing system. These people are so
            desperate that they say: " Anything would be better than the rotten, corrupt and
            unjust system that we now have. Anything would be better than the degradation and
            poverty that is our lot under the present government." If the honorable member for
            Mackellar and others like him really want to deal with Communism, let them grapple with
            the causes of Communism and, by removing the causes, so remove Communism for all time.</para>

                        I want to quote from a statement made in the House of Commons on 17th July of this

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denis</inline>
                        Healey. He is reputed to be a right wing member of the party, and I hope that this will
            please the honorable member for Mackellar and make him more receptive to the views of
            the right honorable gentleman.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denis</inline>
                        Healey said
            that those who justified Britain's military presence in foreign countries on the
            ground that it was necessary in order to combat the advance of international Communism
            were dishonest if they did not admit that many of the conflicts in Asia and Africa had
            nothing to do with international Communism. He said that the conflicts arise from the
            political instability which was the inevitable consequence of the changes now sweeping
            the continents of Asia, Africa and even Latin America. Many of these had nothing to do
            with Communism. He said that they arise in some cases out of the legacy of imperialism
            and in other cases out of local power politics. He went on to say that this was
            certainly true of the conflict between Algeria and Morocco and the conflict in Ruanda
            between the Hutu and the Watutsi. It was true also of the conflict between the
            communities on Cyprus, and of the conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. He
            said that Communism was not a major factor in any of these conflicts.

                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, it</inline>
                        is true that Communism always takes every
            opportunity to exploit instability in any country. It is our job to see that the
            instability on which Communism feeds and flourishes is removed. Until we remove the
            political, economic, social and other forms of instability and injustice in the Asian
            countries, we will never succeed in defeating Communism. Communism will continue to grow
            and flourish. We have to face the fact that imperialism, colonialism and exploitation of
            the Asian people by the European people are coming to an end, and the sooner we realise
            that, the quicker we might reach the stage when we can put forward an effective and
            permanent answer to the onrush of Communism in the Asian countries.
                    </para>
                    <para>There was no spontaneous liking for Communism by the Asian people. No-one can say
            that the 600 million illiterate Chinese coolies rallied to the banner of Mao Tse-tung in
            the years prior to the takeover of China by the Communists because they had any special
            liking for the concepts of dialectical materialism.</para>

                                otherwise I might have been
                prevented from quoting what was said in the House of Representatives, in another

                                an honorable and gallant
                member of this Parliament who has a magnificent record in war and who is the son of
                a gentleman who also had a magnificent record in war. When one gets two men, father
                and son, endowed with both brains and bravery, it is a combination worth quoting.
                Let me quote to the Parliament and to the people of Australia - and let the people
                remember this on 5th December - what one of the most qualified men on the Government
                side has said about the defence of this country. He criticised the then Minister for
                Defence
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Townley)</inline>
                                for seeing no difference
                in the defence situation in 1962 from the defence situation in 1959-60. He said that
                that Minister for Defence saw no difference in the situation in 1957. If the
                honorable member were making his speech tonight he could say that the present

                difference now from what he saw in 1962. On 25th October 1962, the honorable member
                for La Trobe said -

            not some Communist, not some ratbag whose views can be disregarded, but one of the most
            responsible members of the Government side. The statement appears on page 1956 of
            "Hansard" of 25th October 1962, almost two years ago to the day. Then the
            honorable member went on to say - and I want honorable members to note this, because
            this is what a member of the Government side said about the Government's defence
            effort -</para>

                    <para>Have we comparative superiority in manpower or equipment? The answer to both
            questions must be no. We have no heavy guns, no guided missiles.</para>

            the numbers of our servicemen are most emphatically too few.</para>
                    <para class="block">This, I say again, was a statement by the Liberal member for La Trobe.
            He could have said more about our Navy, more about our Air Force, and he could have said
            much more about our Army than he did. The fact is that most of our admirals spend the
            greater part of their time parading around in their dress uniforms at cocktail parties.
            They are fighting all their naval engagements at cocktail parties, and some of them wear
            strange ear whiskers - mutton chops. I think it is about time we cleaned out three
            quarters of the generals, admirals and air marshals in our defence forces and got a team
            of men who are less concerned with showing off to the ladies at cocktail parties and a
            little more concerned with getting this country's defences ready to protect us
            against a foreign invasion, should one come.</para>

                            <para>- Is it? I have not finished yet; I am only coming to the best part of it. We
                have in this country defences which this Government has built up over 1 5 long
                dreary years by spending at the rate of £200 million a year of the taxpayers*
                money. We have one radar unit. Radar is one of the most important means of defence
                which it is possible to have in a defence system, but we have only one radar system,
                and it works only eight hours a day. It does not work on public holidays. It does
                not work after 5 p.m. or after the pubs close. It does not start until 9 a.m. It
                works a 40 hour week on a roster system. It shuts down at night and on Saturdays and
                Sundays. Anyone would think that the enemy intends to give us 24 hours notice and
                that when it does attack it will not attack at night, on a Sunday, on a public
                holiday or, above all, after the pubs close. This is the concept - the thinking -
                that this Government exhibits on the question of defence.</para>

                    <para>Let me remind the Parliament of another incident, and this relates to the
            effectiveness of our Air Force. Who will ever forget the occasion when a Tiger Moth ran
            amok at the Sydney airport. The authorities could not get it down, and as they thought
            it might be a danger to civilian aircraft a call went out for the Royal Australian Air
            Force to shoot it down. The Tiger Moth was not manned. The Royal Australian Air Force,
            in all its full regalia and with all its dignity, took to the air and for almost an hour
            shot at this Tiger Moth. It did not get the Tiger Moth, which of it own accord fell into
            the sea when it ran out of petrol.</para>
                    <para>This is the defence system that this country has. This is not funny. Government
            members ought not to be laughing at this tragic situation. They have no reason to laugh,
            yet on the hustings on 5th December they will have the hide to go before the people and
            pretend that they have done everything they can for the defence of this country. How
            much longer are we going to put up with this shilly-shallying on the part of the
            Government - this wicked waste of money, this wicked waste of the taxpayers' money?</para>
                    <para>
                        Let us now have a look at the Army. We are told that we are going to build up one of
            the most magnificent armies the southern hemisphere has ever set eyes upon. Have a look
            at the record. I have taken from " Hansard " figures which were supplied by the
            Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes).</inline>
                        Does the
            Parliament realise that the intake into the Regular Army in July 1964 was less than half
            the intake into the regular Army in January 1964? The intake was 568 in January and 280
            in July. That is one side of the coin; let us turn the penny over and have a look at
            what is on the other side. It is all very well for the Minister for Territories
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline>
                        to laugh at the plight of the Service
            Ministers. I know that this takes his mind off his own pitiful administration in New
            Guinea.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Let us look at the wastage from the Army. In January 1964 the wastage was 188, but
            in July 1964 it was 273. So when the intake was less than half of what it was in January
            the wastage was more than it was in January. However, that is not all. The wastage in
            the Citizen Military Forces which in January was 366 had risen to no less than 1,174 in
            July. These are not figures that the Government can afford to laugh off,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. They</inline>
                        show that the country faces a tragic and
            terrible situation while this pathetic and indolent Government is allowed to continue in
            charge of the defence of Australia.

            £200 million annually for the last 14 years, but the purchasing power of that
            money, even if spent wisely - had I the time, I could prove that it has not been spent

                        I think it is now time for me to come back to some of the things that
            have to be done. I cannot agree with all that the honorable member for Mackellar said.
            He is not one who has had what we would regard as a very responsible record in the field
            of defence. I hate mentioning his record time after time, but I consider it necessary to
            do so. Since I came into this Parliament in 1949, about 150 members of this House and of
            the Senate have resigned, been defeated or passed away. So perhaps about 150 of the
            present members of the Parliament have not been privileged to hear remarks on this
            subject made by the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddie</inline>
                        Ward, who was the
            previous member for East Sydney and who knew the honorable member for Mackellar
            particularly well and was well versed in his record in World War II.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline>
                        told the Parliament something of the rather
            irresponsible behaviour of the honorable member for Mackellar in the difficult and
            dangerous period of that war. The honorable member was at that time in the defence
            forces. He did not lack bravery. Let nobody suggest that he lacked bravery and that he
            did not want to fight. He did want to fight, and it was not his fault that he was not in
            the most dangerous area of combat during the war. The reason why he was not there cannot
            be ascribed to a lack of bravery. There were other reasons, but I shall not go into them
            now. I propose only to discuss the incident that led finally to his dismissal from the
            Army.
                    </para>
                    <para>It has been said that the honorable member was cashiered out of the Army. I think he
            has rejected that suggestion on two or three occasions. He was at least dismissed from
            the Army. The reason was that, in order to show that the defences of Australia in war
            time were not as good as he believed they ought to be, he set out to kidnap
            Sir Thomas Blamey, who was then Commander-in-Chief of the
            Australian Military Forces. I see that honorable members are laughing. Everybody but the
            honorable member laughed, too, when he set out on this rather harebrained scheme. All
            the heads of the defence forces laughed when the honorable member set out to show that
            the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, then General
            Sir Thomas Blamey, but later a Field Marshal, could be
            kidnapped, taken to the Blue Mountains and kept on ice until the honorable member chose
            to release him.</para>
                    <para>In short, the honorable member set out to do what was regarded as being impossible.
            Although lie warned the heads of the defence force* and of the Department of Defence
            what he intended to do, the fact remains that he succeeded in his mission. I am informed
            that he dressed his commandos as tramway men. They proceeded to a place in Sydney where
            tram crews changed shifts. The military commanders, knowing that a raid was to be made,
            were in readiness. They were waiting for commandos to arrive headed by the honorable
            member. The military commanders, laughing about the idea, concluded, when nothing was
            seen of the raiders, that they were not coming. The military men saw the tramway workers
            change shifts. The next thing those military men knew was that they were looking down
            the barrels of the guns of the honorable member's commandos, who, as I have said,
            were dressed as tramway men. So the honorable member and his troops took the post. They
            succeeded in making the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces a prisoner
            and whisking him away to the Blue Mountains.</para>
                    <para>One must be envious of the genius of the honorable member for Mackellar as exhibited
            in this episode. But he was not content with this. He wanted to show that any foreign
            force could land on our shores and blow up roads, bridges and all kinds of
            establishments. He wanted to be quite practicable about this. Here I come to the real
            reason why he was kicked out of the Army. In order to prove the practicability of what
            he envisaged, the honorable member decided to demonstrate that an enemy could have blown
            up a bridge on the Cronulla railway line. He succeeeded in making the demonstration in
            the most practical manner by actually blowing up the bridge, which cost some thousands
            of pounds to replace. The honorable member said: "We are at war and we have to teach
            the armed forces a lesson by hook or by crook, regardless of the expense".</para>
                    <para>Whether one can take much notice of what the honorable member says about defence
            these days is a debatable point. He has a series of complaints about our defence. He
            says, first, that we need formations in being. We have not those formations. He says,
            secondly, that we need formations in reserve. We do not have them. He says, thirdly,
            that we need a pool of trained men for reinforcement purposes. We have not that pool of
            trained men for reinforcements. This is important, because the honorable member's
            plan will require a lot of reinforcements. He would begin by undertaking the simple task
            of denuclearising China. He will need quite a few reinforcements for that - probably at
            least one million men. The deaths in this and other countries if such a harebrained,
            crazy scheme were attempted would total tens of millions. He complains that we have not
            enough trained men to provide such reinforcements. He says fourthly, that we need the
            machinery for general mobilisation of the whole of our manpower. In this, he is perhaps
            getting closer to what the Government's future policy will be. He says, fifthly,
            that we need an instructional corps to handle the intake of recruits.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member says, sixthly, that if we cannot get the men voluntarily we
            have to envisage the use of conscription. I am glad to see that he apparently approves
            my stating his view on that matter. He says that we need to conscript into the Army no
            fewer than 10,000 young men each year and that they must serve for two years. So, after
            four years, we shall have trained 40,000 men in this way. That is all very well. The
            trouble with conscription is this: We all have our liberty and our freedom. We all have
            our love of democratic principles and of the British freedoms that we enjoy. But some
            have more than that. Some have enormous investments totalling millions of pounds. If the
            conscription proposed by the honorable member follows the pattern that his predecessrs
            have always implemented, we shall find that those who are conscripted into the forces
            will not be the sons of the rich and powerful members of this community. They will be
            the sons of working men who do not know members of Parliament to whom they can appeal
            for help in keeping their sons out of the forces or influential members in the
            government of the day who can pull strings to see that young men are kept out of the
            forces. We should not talk about conscription as though war is absolutely inevitable.
            The best defence experts are those who can evolve some method of preventing war, not
            those who think war is inevitable.</para>
                    <para>Nobody could question the bravery of the honorable member for Mackellar. He was
            probably the most disappointed man in Australia when he could not get behind a machine
            gun and shoot at somebody wearing a red beret. If he could have done that he would have
            been happy. His idea is that by hook or by crook we must get into a war before he is too
            old to enjoy it. He wants a war. He is dying to get into a war, and so are some of his
            colleagues. They are dying for a war, even though they have nothing with which to fight
            a war. Some honorable members opposite, who know they will not be personally involved in
            a war, are doing their level best to get Australia into another war, which could be the
            last war anybody will fight. They have nothing with which to protect this country or
            with which to fight a war, but they are doing their level best to get Australia
            entangled in a war.</para>

            due to the ineptitude of the Government, 121 per cent, of munitions ordered for the
            defence forces, as revealed in " Hansard " of 15th September this year-

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, for</inline>
                            the latitude you have shown in
              permitting honorable members to range beyond the ambit of the Bill because this has
              enabled honorable members from this side of the House to give the Australian people
              some idea of the irresponsibility of members of the alternative government. I was
              ashamed to be a member of a House in which one of the leading spokesmen for the
              Opposition could make a vindictive attack on the serving officers of the Australian
              armed forces. He alleged that they had nothing better to do than attend cocktail
              parties and enjoy the frivolities of life. I was one of the members of the Government
              Parties Defence Committee who attended the exercise " Long Shot". Taking part
              in the exercise were quite a number of men of whom any Australian could justifiably be
              proud. Many of the officers who served in theatres of war and who have served in the
              Services since the war ended would have been only too proud to have served with the
              men I saw taking part in exercise " Long Shot ". These are the men whom the
              honorable member for Hindmarsh has attacked tonight. These are the senior officers who
              determine the effectiveness of our armed forces. These are the men who very
              effectively displayed in exercise " Long Shot " something of the preparedness
              of the Australian Army, Navy and Air Force.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        I do not want to stray beyond the bounds of this Bill. I do not want to go into the
            ambit of political and strategic defence possibilities, because I, like many other
            honorable members, am looking forward to the defence review which I hope will be
            announced in the next fortnight. I think we should examine the legislation now before us
            to see to what extent it achieves modifications in our present state of preparedness.
            First I would like to mention the gratuity payments that are to be made to members of
            the Emergency Reserve. In his second-reading speech in another place the Minister for
            Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline>
                        said that members of the
            Emergency Reserve would be paid a special bounty of £100 for the first year of
            service, rising by £25 each year to £175 in the fourth and subsequent years. I
            think a similar gratuity could well be paid to members of the Citizen Military Forces. I
            know that members of the C.M.F. are not taxed on their pay and that they enjoy other
            incentives, but they still give of their valued time. They still sacrifice time that
            would otherwise be spent in leisure activities or in work. I think we should give them
            further incentives to spend their time in training. One such incentive is a financial
            incentive. I understand that it costs about £100 to equip a member of the
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">C.M.F. If it costs so much surely it it worth while encouraging some
            stability within the C.M.F. We know of the rate of turnover in the C.M.F. and if we
            could get men to stay longer in the force any incentive given to them would be more than
            compensated for by not having continually to re-equip newly enrolled personnel.</para>
                    <para>
                        I come now to the provisions in the legislation relating to re-employment of men.
            One of the problems as far as the C.M.F. personnel and members of the Emergency Reserve
            are concerned is that these people must leave their employers* businesses. The honorable
            member for Calare
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. England)</inline>
                        referred to this
            matter and said that he was concerned that small shopkeepers, farmers and other
            employers might be unduly penalised if their employees joined the force. The legislation
            provides for penalities to be imposed on employers who do not re-employ former employees
            who have served in the Emergency Reserve for a period, but the penalties are not very
            severe. One of the problems associated with this matter is that we are providing a
            penalty; we are not providing an incentive. Employers should be offered something to
            induce them to encourage their employees to join the Emergency Reserve. You do not
            induce employers to encourage their employees to join the armed forces by threatening
            them with penalties, as you are in this instance. I think there is a case here for
            giving employers some tax incentive to induce them to encourage their employees to join
            the Reserve. If this were done the employer may feel that any loss of production that he
            suffers is offset to some extent by his taxation concession. I know that it would be
            hard to assess a reasonable tax concession, but having regard to the loss of production
            suffered by an employer as a result of his employee leaving him, I think some
            proportionate concession could be worked out to encourage employers to allow their men
            to go away.
                    </para>
                    <para>I should like to refer now to the provisions relating to superannuation of men who
            join the Emergency Reserve. Proposed new section 132 (7.) provides that if a man is
            absent in the Emergency Reserve for a period of time and is re-employed later by his
            employer, provided that within one month of the expiration of the period of absence on
            defence service he makes to his superannuation fund or its equivalent, the contribution
            he would have been required to make if he had not been absent during that period, he is
            entitled to continue within the ambit of the fund. I think this is a very fair
            provision, but one aspect of it which concerns is the wording " within one month pf
            the expiration of the period of absence ". It seems to me that it would be more
            rational to make it within one month of his re-employment. No doubt, if a man has been
            serving overseas, as it is envisaged he could well do during his period of defence
            service, then, when he comes back home he is quite likely to want to spend a week or a
            month with his family. He might want to go to the beach or anywhere else before
            returning to employment. Therefore, I think that there is a case for some variation of
            this provision. I should like the Minister to look at this point and see whether it is
            possible to amend the bill to the wording that I have suggested.</para>
                    <para>
                        Another aspect that concerns me is the fact that there is no mention of any payment
            into the superannuation fund on behalf of the employer. As honorable members will know
            from the debate on the measure that passed through the House yesterday, most
            superannuation schemes provide for payment not only by the employee but also by the
            employer. These moneys are contributed to a fund which earns interest, and out of which
            superannuation benefits are paid. If a man has been away on emergency service, provision
            is made for the payment of his contributions, but there is no provision for the payment
            of the employer's contribution. I suggest that this might well be paid by the
            Commonwealth Government. I do not see that there is any cause to penalise the employer
            but no more do I see that there is a cause to prejudice the benefits to which the
            employee might otherwise be entitled if the superannuation contributions had run their
            normal course. For that reason I think there is a case for some reconsideration by the
            Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes).</inline>
                        Perhaps when he
            is gazetting the regulations providing for the special bounties he could include
            provision for superannuation payments by the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the
            employer upon the return of the employee from emergency service.

                        There are many things related to the Emergency Reserve and the Citizen Military
            Force that should be considered, and I was very glad indeed to hear the honorable member
            for Indi
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holten)</inline>
                        refer this afternoon to the
            payment of a subsidy on rifle ammunition. I know that, unfortunately, with the
            re-equipment of our armed forces, this is something which is going out of date, but I
            feel that from the men in the bush who in the past have belonged to rifle associations,
            we have had some of the most valuable recruits into the armed forces in times of
            national emergency. I think that a tremendous amount can be achieved in the future
            through rifle clubs in training men adequately, sufficiently, wisely and efficiently to
            use arms. I suggest there is a very sound case for continued contributions by the
            Commonwealth Government towards the provision of .303 ammunition so that rifle clubs may
            continue to play a very effective part in providing these men for possible future
            recruitment into the armed forces of this country.

                        There are many aspects of defence that one could cover. I do not wish to canvass
            them all. I hope that they will be covered in the defence review which will be
            submitted, I hope, in the near future. The honorable member for Mackellar

                        has made a very accurate assessment of the
            tactical situation in the north. I cannot accept the opinion of the honorable member for
            Hindmarsh
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline>
                        who, as I understand
            his argument, sees in the instability of South East Asia, no reason to fear the
            expansion of Communism. As I understand his argument, he sees no problems for the future
            safety of Australia arising from the inroads being made into South East Asia by
            Communism. He quoted
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denis</inline>
                        Healey as having said
            that political instability resulting from the exercise of power politics creates
            conditions in which Communism thrives. Surely the honorable member does not deny that
            these conditions exist in our near north today. Surely he does not deny that this is the
            situation which necessitates the review that is presently being made of our armed
            forces. I feel that this assessment has been rightly seen by the honorable member for
            Mackellar as being related mainly to the spread of militant Communism in our near north.
            As I understand the argument, this was the point of difference between the honorable
            member for Hindmarsh and the honorable member for Mackellar. It is this problem of the
            spread of militant Communism that constitutes our biggest hurdle in the future. As the
            Prime Minister rightly said -

                Clyde Cameron),</inline>
                            as usual, reduced what had been, generally speaking, a most
              constructive and useful debate, to a farce. The honorable member for New England

                            restored it to its former level.
              The debate has ranged over a wide field. My colleagues, the other Service Ministers
              and I, have found many of the contributions in the wider field most valuable; but, in
              closing the debate, I do not intend to canvass those wider considerations. I would,
              however, like to mention one or two things which were raised specifically in relation
              to the Bill by honorable members.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In general terms, it has been said by many honorable members, helpfully on this side
            of the House but destructively on the other side of the House, that the measures which
            are to be implemented as a result of this Bill are not a complete answer to what they
            see our defence problems to be. My reply to that is that they are not intended to be the
            complete answer. They were never intended to be the complete answer. It was never
            intended that this Bill would in any way represent the Government's answer to the
            current assessment of defence problems. Nor is it intended to be a substitute for other
            measures which may emerge from the defence review. But the major provisions contained in
            this legislation are important in their own right; they are measures which needed to be
            undertaken and which should be undertaken irrespective of anything else that we may do.
            In effect, they are measures which increase our capacity to respond to a situation that
            we may face. They increase our overall defence potential.</para>
                    <para>However big a Regular Army we have, we will still have need for something like the
            Regular Army Emergency Reserve. There are always gaps to be filled in the Army. There is
            always a requirement for more reinforcements. There is always a need, particularly in a
            country like this, to make the most economical use of whatever manpower is available. To
            take regular soldiers who have been trained, who have served for a period and become
            experienced, and re-use their services in a time in which we require manpower quickly,
            seems to me the most effective way of using Australia's scarcest resources -
            manpower.</para>
                    <para>No matter how big the Regular army becomes we will always need the Citizen Military
            Forces or something like them. As I have said before, the Army does not consist simply
            of the Australian Regular Army. In a great deal of the discussion one hears on this
            subject it appears to be assumed that our Army consists only of the Regular Army. We
            have one Army, which comprises a relatively small and readily available section, which
            is the Regular Army, and comprises also the Citizen Military Forces. The two together
            make up the Australian Army, and we refer to the two combined as the Australian Army.
            The role of the A.R.A. is to provide a readily available force. The role of the C.M.F.
            is to provide follow-up units. The advantage of this concept of the C.M.F. being
            available in times of defence emergency is that it gives the concept of one army
            consisting of a readily available section and follow-up units real meaning in
            today's situation, in this period when the situation to our north appears almost
            uniformly grey instead of in sharply defined blacks and whites. This concept is
            important, therefore, irrespective of the effect on the C.M.F. in terms of manpower.</para>

              Cairns)</inline>
                        tried to suggest earlier that the only criterion one can adopt in
            judging this measure is the effect it may have on the size of the C.M.F. The measure is
            important irrespective of this consideration because it gives the concept of the C.M.F.
            as a follow-up force in this one army real meaning in today's situation. We are
            optimistic, however, and we hope that by giving the C.M.F. a real sense of purpose,
            unlike anything it has ever had before, we will succeed not only in increasing the
            numbers of the C.M.F. but also in inducing people in the C.M.F. to serve for longer
            periods.

                        The honorable member for Batman
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Benson)</inline>
                        raised a number of questions concerning service in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve
            and the C.M.F. He asked me whether 1 would do my best to provide a satisfactory answer
            to the questions he asked. He wanted to know the situation regarding medical and dental
            treatment for members of the Emergency Reserve and the C.M.F. The answer is that
            provisions relating to pay, medical and dental treatment and hospitalisation will be
            found in the regulations that will be made under the Act. But, in brief, members of the
            Regular Army Emergency Reserve, the Regular Army Reserve and the C.M.F. when called out
            for full time service will be treated in exactly the same way as members of the A.R.A.
            If members of the Emergency Reserve or the Regular Army Reserve or the C.M.F. serve
            overseas they will have exactly the same cover under the Repatriation Act as members of
            the Australian Regular Army.
                    </para>
                    <para>To deal with another point raised by the honorable gentleman: If members of these
            bodies on full time duty are killed or injured in Australia they will be covered under
            the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act in the same way as members of the
            A.R.A. Any member who is absent from duty due to illness or injury can remain
            hospitalised - this was the point raised by the honorable member for Batman - for six
            months on full pay. But where the injury or illness is attributable to service the
            period is 12 months. In special cases, such as those in which skin or bone grafts are
            involved, the period may be extended for a further six months.</para>
                    <para>The last point raised by the honorable member concerned widows of members of the
            Emergency Reserve, the Regular Army Reserve or the C.M.F. on full time service. They
            will have the same benefits as widows of members of the Australian Regular Army. The
            only difference between them and widows of members of the A.R.A. is that the latter
            widows will have the additional benefits provided under the Defence Forces Retirement
            Benefits Act for which members of the A.R.A. contribute and members of the other three
            bodies do not.</para>

                        The honorable member for La Trobe
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jess)</inline>
                        raised the question of officers' resignations. He said that he had studied the terms
            of section 17 as it is proposed to be amended and he found that there did not appear to
            be very much difference between the situation that had existed previously and the
            situation that will exist. As I said in my second reading speech, I believe that there
            will be a considerable difference. Although an officer will not be given an absolute
            right to resign at will - and obviously this right cannot be granted having regard to
            the nature of service in the forces - the new provisions will give a great deal more
            certainty to officers in the Regular Army in particular. I am led to that conclusion by
            the terms of the Military Board instruction that it is proposed to issue following the
            enactment of this legislation. This instruction will give an interpretation of the new
            section 17 to the officer corps in the Army. For the benefit of the honorable member and
            the House I would like to read a section of this proposed instruction. It reads -

            its decision, as appropriate, the Military Board will be guided by the expectation that
            officers appointed to permanent commissions will have sought such commissions with the
            intention of making the Army their career and that short service commissioned officers
            will normally complete the period of their engagement.</para>
                    <para class="block">Then follows the important part - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is not the desire of the Military Board to hold officers unwillingly in the
              Service, and every application to resign will receive sympathetic consideration on its
              merits. The Board has the duty however to maintain the Army at a high level of
              efficiency having regard to its operational needs which must be paramount. In such
              circumstances that operational needs would be seriously prejudiced the Board will not
              recommend acceptance of resignations until the services of the officers concerned can
              be spared.</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I emphasise the words " can be spared ". It has been suggested
            that one of the effects of the current resignation policy of the Board is that officers
            are committed to a period of servitude for life. This has never been so and it is quite
            obviously not so under this Military Board interpretation of the new section 1 7 of the
            Act.</para>

                        The honorable member for Calare
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. England)</inline>
                        raised the matter of administrative problems which could be caused by the multiplication
            of forces in the Army. One can admit that this is a problem, but I think that if the
            honorable member looks at proposed section 49 he will find that the provision that
            members of the Reserve forces will in most cases be to all intents and purposes regarded
            as members of the Regular Army Supplement when called up for full time service will
            clear away many of the difficulties that he envisages through the multiplication of
            these forces.
                    </para>
                    <para>The honorable member also asked what was the Regular Army Supplement and whether it
            was a new thing. The Regular Army Supplement is a new name for a body that has existed
            since 1948 and which until now has been known as the Australian Regular Special Reserve.
            This never was a reserve in the true sense of the word because all members of this body
            served during their period on the Regular Army Special Reserve as full time members of
            the Army. With the possibility of confusion with the new Regular Army Emergency Reserve,
            the opportunity was taken quite recently to change its name to a more appropriate one,
            the Regular Army Supplement which, briefly, is divided into a number of parts. One part
            comprises soldiers ineligible for service in the Australian Regular Army because of age
            and\/or a temporary medical classification. Another part is comprised of soldiers
            enlisted for a special task of unknown duration. By far the largest part of this
            Supplement is comprised of soldiers in all respects elegible for enlistment in the
            A.R.A. but initially for three years only. The honorable member also asked whether
            present members of the C.M.F. have all given an undertaking for overseas service. The
            answer to that question is " Yes ".</para>
                    <para>
                        A specific question raised by honorable members in relation to this particular Bill
            was mentioned by the honorable member for Hughes
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R.
              Johnson).</inline>
                        Before answering the point he made, I would like to say how much I
            deprecate the gratuitous insults he levelled at one of the finest body of troops in the
            world, the Pacific Islands Regiment. All I hope is that some day that regiment finds the
            honorable member on a dark night. The honorable member for Hughes in a very constructive
            and responsible moment asked why could not we enlist less experienced men into the
            Regular Army Emergency Reserve at this stage. I think that the answer to this question
            lies in the purpose of the Reserve. We must have people with a considerable body of
            training behind them. In his remarks, the honorable member for Hughes almost gave the
            impression that the people who are to be enlisted in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve
            are people who served in the Second World War. This is not so. The people who enlist in
            the Regular Army Emergency Reserve could be quite young soldiers. A soldier who, for
            instance, enlisted at the age of 17 and left the Army at the end of his first six years
            engagement at which time he would be 23, would be a well trained and experienced
            soldier. In order to fulfil the intentions for which the Emergency Reserve is designed,
            the person enlisting must be an experienced soldier. The Emergency Reserve is not a body
            to take in inexperienced people and to train them. Finally, the honorable member for New
            England raised the question of the employers' contributions. I would like to inform
            the honorable member that this matter was carefully considered by the Government and a
            deliberate decision was made to include the clause in the Bill as it is actually
            included.

              " ' (2.) A delegation under this section may be made applicable to
              appointments or promotions of officers to specified ranks or to ranks of a specified
              kind and either in the Military Forces generally or in a specified part of the

                    <para class="block">This is a simple amendment designed to clarify the intention of the
            proposed section 10c. Strictly interpreted, it appears that sub-section (2.) of the
            proposed section 10c would enable the Governor-General to delegate power to make
            appointments or promotions of the nature indicated by paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or
            paragraph (c), but would not, as originally drafted, enable the delegation of power to
            make appointments or promotions of a nature indicated by more than one of those
            paragraphs in combination. For example, under proposed section 10c as it appears in the
            Bill, the Governor-General would not have been enabled to delegate his power to make
            appointment, say, to the rank of lieutenant in the Regular Army Supplement - that is, to
            a specified rank in a specified part of the Military Forces. Again, the power to promote
            might be delegated but the delegation would have been restricted to the power to promote
            to, say, the ranks of lieutenant and temporary captain in the Citizen Military Forces.
            It was the intention that authority be given for the making of delegations of this
            nature and, accordingly, the sub-section has been refrained to make the intention quite
            clear.</para>

                        <para>.- I would like the Minister for the Army to explain a little more clearly, if
              possible, the amendment which he has just introduced. As the Minister knows, members
              of the Citizen Military Forces are paid only what is called the "on promotion"
              rate. That is the minimum rate for the particular rank held, no matter how long the
              rank has been held. Is it proposed to adopt the same policy for the Regular Army
              Emergency Reserve, or is it intended to encourage suitably qualified members of the
              Citizen Military Forces to join the Regular Army Emergency Reserve by allowing them
              seniority in the Reserve equivalent to the seniority that they held in the C.M.F.? I
              think the Minister understands that an officer in the Naval Reserve or the Citizen
              Military Forces could have been a lieutenant-commander in the Navy or a captain in the
              Army, respectively, for X number of years and would not receive seniority pay as
              permanent officers do. I would suggest that the Minister look into this matter.</para>

                                - The Minister knows what I mean. These persons receive seniority pay. In the
                C.M.F., that does not apply. I think this matter is something which is worthwhile
                looking into because, as I understand it, the main idea of this Bill is to put this
                Regular Army Emergency Reserve on a smilar footing to that of the permanent forces.
                If this is the case, I think the Minister willreadily understand the point I have
                made and bring these conditions into line with those that apply in the permanent
                forces. The Minister for Defence

                            a question about the obligations of employers to men in these
              forces. Sums of money are paid by Commonwealth public servants as superannuation
              contributions. Does the Commonwealth intend to pay the contributions for public
              servants who join the Emergency Reserves and are called up for full time service?

            so that it is clearly known that he is accepting an obligation or a commitment which we
            believe is important for him and for the country. The proposal that within 30 days after
            the commencement of the Act he has to send in a letter, stating that he will not serve
            overseas, does not appear to us to be the optimum procedure. We have not drafted an
            amendment to cover the position. We believe that that should be the function of the

                        <para>. - The Government cannot accept this amendment, principally because we believe it
              to be completely unnecessary. I point out that the reason for the clause is not that
              previously there was some doubt about members of the Citizen Military Forces
              volunteering for overseas service. That was the least of the considerations. The
              reason why we specifically included in the bill the opportunity to contract out is
              that previously members of the C.M.F. were committed to serve overseas only in time of
              war. Their conditions will be changed considerably now in respect of a time of defence
              emergency. That is why we believe it is important that they be given this
              consideration.</para>

                    <para>
                        I point out from a practical point of view that the Minister for Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline>
                        gave notice of the proposed changes in
            the conditions governing service in the C.M.F. in June last, and that the Government is
            not aware of any protests from members of the C.M.F. concerning these changes. Indeed,
            the changes appear to have met with universal approval. Members of the C.M.F. are all
            active members of units and, therefore, are in constant touch with their units. That is
            one thing that we can say with certainty under these conditions. It is possible,
            therefore, to undertake that the changed conditions of service will be brought to the
            notice of each serving member of the C.M.F.
                    </para>
                    <para>The position under the Bill as it stands is that members of the C.M.F. can opt out
            within 30 days of the Bill becoming law, and that except in time of war or defence
            emergency they can claim their discharge under clause 20 of the Bill by giving three
            months' notice. As anybody who has been associated with the C.M.F. will know,
            members are seldom required to serve for those three months. In most circumstances they
            can be discharged on application. So the two year engagement of a member of the C.M.F.
            means very little. If any member of the C.M.F., through ignorance, fails to exercise his
            right to opt out, his case can be dealt with on its merits. There is little doubt that,
            if a member failed to exercise his option, he could take his discharge almost
            immediately. In any event, members are engaged for periods of two years at a time.
            Therefore, at the end of that term they are discharged unless at that time or earlier
            they elect to re-engage.</para>
                    <para>Summarising the position, I say that soldiers are given the right to opt out; but,
            in any event, they have, in effect, the right to re-enlist by electing to re-engage at
            the end of their terms. That .being the position, it is quite unrealistic to require
            each member of the C.M.F. to sign a piece of paper indicating that he is willing to
            serve under the changed conditions. That would involve the processing of about 27,630
            pieces of paper and would create an unnecessary and unacceptable administrative burden.</para>
                    <para>In case any honorable members are worried about this matter, I would add that
            directions already have been issued from Army Headquarters to the commands - to come
            into effect from the date on which this Bill receives the royal assent - requiring
            commanding officers to arrange for the personal notification of the changes to each
            member of their units. A record is to be kept of compliance with this direction. Because
            of variations in local circumstances, a common procedure cannot be adopted for all
            units, but each member of the C.M.F. will be contacted personally and notified within
            the 30 days laid down in the legislation.</para>

                incurred on service in Australia. The C.M.F. is a fully attested and committed force
                for all military purposes. We ask whether it would be in order to move, on this
                Bill, that the repatriation benefits be extended.

                            .- The purpose of the Bill, as stated by the Minister for Housing
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury)</inline>
                            when he delivered his second reading speech,
              is to extend the operation of the Copper and Brass Strip Bounty Act 1962 for a further
              maximum period of six months to 31st March 1965. The existing bounty provision expired
              on 30th September 1964. The Minister said that the reason for the extension of the
              bounty provisions, which I think have been running for about two years, is that the
              Tariff Board, which has before it a reference in respect of the copper and brass strip
              industry, has not had sufficient time to complete its investigations. We have been
              informed that unforeseen complications, largely due to fluctuations in the price of
              copper on world markets, have necessarily delayed the Tariff Board in its
              investigation into whether the bounty should be extended for a substantial period.
              This Bill, if enacted, will extend the existing bounty provisions for a period of six
              months until 31st March 1965, unless for some reason it is found that the bounty can
              be terminated at an earlier date. The termination can be implemented by a proclamation
              issued under the Act.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The copper and brass strip industry is of substantial importance to Australia. I
            understand that, in the main, copper and brass, in sheet, strip and foil forms, are used
            in internal combustion engines or in association with other types of power plant. In his
            second reading speech, the Minister for Housing said that copper and brass strip is used
            in heat exchanger units of the types used with internal combustion engines. I have some
            idea of what such a heat exchanger unit is, but I am not sure that my idea is correct. I
            think the Parliament should be given a more explicit and more easily understood
            description in a second reading speech. Possibly, if we read the report of the Tariff
            Board we will find a clearer description of a heat exchanger unit of the type used with
            interna] combustion engines. I ask the Minister to give a simple explanation of a
            heat exchanger unit.</para>

                                - Yes. I was coming to that. I inquired why the simple word "
                difference" could not be used. I am sure members of the Parliament and members
                of the public who read " Hansard " do not like long-winded explanations.
                They are entitled to better explanations than they are given, particularly in cases
                such as this. A member of the public seeing this expression would wonder what it
                meant. An engineer would know. A farmer with the practical knowledge and studious
                habits of the honorable member for Wakefield
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                  Kelly)</inline>
                                would know almost instantly or would reach a fairly shrewd
                conclusion. In passing, I express the hope that somebody, somewhere, at some time,
                will take note of what I have said. It is quite true that we get remarkably good
                reports from the Tariff Board from time to time, but these reports seldom reach the
                general public. They are seen only by people who are immediately associated with the
                industry concerned. The general public should be told and should have included in
                "Hansard " some concise explanation of these technical expressions. Let me
                give another illustration. In Tariff Board reports and indeed in the second reading
                speeches of Ministers, long chemical terms are used. The ordinary members of the
                public have not the slightest clue as to what they mean. I make a plea for some
                elaboration in future, without the elaboration being unduly tedious.

                    <para>The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. We supported the original Act in 1962. We
            are inclined to favour bounties rather than tariff protection, whenever a bounty can be
            used. A tariff tends to increase the price to the consumer, but with a bounty the cost
            of the protection to the industry more is justly spread over the taxpayers and the
            public generally. However, pending the report that is to come along in six months, or
            perhaps a shorter period, the Opposition offers its support for this Bill. I think the
            industry should be protected, provided the bounty is not used to bolster up the industry
            and ultimately create excessive profits. We know that bills that provide bounties
            invariably include a limit of 10 per cent., after which the bounty does not apply. That
            is appropriate and, I think, essential. Copper prices have shot up through the roof and
            perhaps the Commonwealth will not have to pay any bounty at all in this instance. I hope
            that will he so. The limit set in the principal Act is £190,000. If the maximum
            amount is drawn, the cost to the Commonwealth for the additional six months will be
            95,000. We give our support to the Bill. I hope the Minister will heed my plea for a
            simplification of terms which are quite clear to technical officers but are sometimes
            quite difficult to people like me.</para>

                            We probably have this in
              common, although as a politician he may be older and much trickier than I am. He has
              asked for an explanation of the expression " heat exchanger units of the types
              used with internal combustion engines ". I must admit that I speak subject to
              correction by greater authority but I understand that this expression means a
              radiator. As I understand the process, in most cases the heat of an internal
              combustion engine is transferred to water, which it then passes through the radiator.
              Copper being an extremely good conductor, the heat of the water is exchanged with the
              coolness of the air. The intervention of copper is necessary, because it is not easy
              to exchange the cool of the air with the heat of the water unless the water is
              suitably contained. The water, having been cooled in that process, goes back to the
              internal combustion engine where it takes on further heat, a further exchange ensues
              and the process continues. I hope that this will prove to be a satisfactory
              explanation.

              the Boeing 727 aircraft which have recently arrived in Australia from America, one for
              Trans-Australia Airlines and the other for Ansett-A.N.A. On Tuesday of this week a
              question was asked by the Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Calwell)</inline>
                            of the Prime Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert
                Menzies)</inline>
                            about the customs duty to be paid on these aircraft. The Prime
              Minister replied that he did not know anything about the matter but that he would
              probably look into it. Last Thursday, 21st October, in the Senate,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline>
                            also asked a question of the
              Minister for Civil Aviation
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty)</inline>
                            about
              the customs duty.

                                - Very good,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline>
                                The cost of these
                aircraft to Ansett and T.A.A. was about £3 million each. Customs duty which
                should have been paid on the aircraft, at71/2 per cent, would amount to
                £225,000. Up to the present time this duty has not been paid. The Minister in
                another place stated that this matter was being considered. May I ask what is to be
                considered? If customs duty is due on these aircraft it should be paid irrespective
                of who is involved. I now say that Ansett has refused to pay this customs duty on
                his plane and has informed the Government that he has no intention of paying it. He
                let the Government know that if his aircraft did not fly in Australia then, under
                the Airlines Agreement Act T.A.A. could not fly its aircraft, and consequently both
                aircraft would have to stay on the tarmac.
                            </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>T.A.A. had forwarded a cheque to the Department of Customs and Excise for the duty
            on its aircraft. When Ansett told the Government that he was not going to pay the
            customs duty, the Department refunded the cheque to T.A.A. Why should preference once
            again be given to Ansett? If his company is permitted, without challenge, not to pay,
            why should not other industries such as General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd., Broken
            Hill Pty. Co. Ltd., Blue Metal Industries, W. D. &amp; H. O. Wills (Aust.) Ltd., and
            small enterprises have the same concession? Why should this Government be the fairy
            godmother to Ansett? At the present time subsidies worth about £300,000 annually
            are paid to his organisation. The customs duty that has been waived amounts to
            £225,000. Another Boeing 727 for Ansett is due in about a week or so, and before
            June of next year a third Boeing 727 will be landed here for him. The nonpayment of
            customs duty will mean that in this financial year almost £750,000 will have been
            returned to Ansett-A.N.A., making the total subsidy for the financial year over £1
            million.</para><para>If the Government allows this to go on it will be a public scandal which should be
            stopped. People in the streets are talking. They are asking questions. They want to know
            what hold the Ansett organisation has over the Government. Recently, after an adverse
            ruling of the High Court, Ansett waved his wand and' this Government introduced
            airline regulations to take over intrastate air routes against the wishes of State
            Governments and against the will of the people who had expressed their rejection of the
            principle at a referendum. When a government does this for one industry, or for the
            faceless financiers who support this</para><para class="block">Government, it is natural that people will exchange innuendoes. </para><para>
                        Recently, when R. W. Miller and Co. Pty. Ltd. was attempting to enter the oil tanker
            trade on the Australian coast and to give employment to Australian seamen under
            Australian conditions in opposition to the oil cartels, all manner of obstacles were
            thrown in its path. By whom? We do not know; only the Government, its supporters or
            someone instructing the Government knows. Miller was not allowed to import tankers free
            of duty. He was made to put up huge financial bonds as an earnest that he would build
            tankers in Australia. I wonder what would have happened if the "golden colt" had
            thought of importing tankers. Would he have had the same barriers to overcome? Earlier
            this year T.A.A. wanted to operate three special Viscount aircraft between Adelaide and
            Perth.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline>
                        objected to TA.A.'s proposal
            and on 4th July he sent a telegram objecting to the flights. The result was another
            victory to Ansett; no flights. Honorable members should note that here we have a private
            enterprise company objecting to a Government enterprise expanding a service which would
            benefit the country. In Australia today civil aviation is not controlled by the
            Government but by one man, Reg Ansett, who has been favorably treated by this Government
            for many years by means of its financial support. He controls not only his own company,
            but under the Airlines Agreement Act, he has a large say about what T.A.A. can do. If
            T.A.A. wanted to change the cream in its coffee and Ansett objected there would be no
            change.
                    </para><para>The Interstate Parcel Express Co. Ltd. is another Australian company running in
            competition with Ansett Industries. It has made representations to the Government for
            permission to transport goods by air between States, but up to the present time its
            request has been rejected. Why? Because the Government does not like to see Ansett
            facing any competition. I feel that it is up to this Government to do something to
            assist other industries without giving the major share of its support to one industry.</para><para>The financial documents of the Ansett interests should be produced in this
            Parliament and should be laid on the table of the House for members to peruse so that
            they can see whether the subsidies which are paid to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd.
            are warranted. There ought also to be a royal commission into favours which are being
            channelled through Ansett to great companies which return favours by way of large
            contributions to the funds of the Liberal Party.</para></speech>

              have shown I have not complained about anything that may be said about me by any
              honorable member opposite, and I do not want to disturb that reputation in any way.
              However, I want to refer to two speeches that were made in this House last night, one
              coming from the honorable member for Oxley

                            and the other, which I heard, coming from the honorable member for
              Yarra
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns).</inline>
                            I promptly describe both
              speeches as representing a conspicuous combination of humbug, wicked falsehood and
              character daubing.

                            <para>- That is so. For the benefit of one of the new young pretenders who rose last
                night, I described what had been said as character daubing. In all these three
                fields - humbug, falsehood and character daubing - both the honorable member for
                Oxley and the honorable member for Yarra are skilled and experienced practitioners.
                It is not concern for the survival of my own character that prompts me to speak this
                evening. I am so bold as to say that, in any company in this country, I will put my
                character against that of the honorable member for Yarra and that of the honorable
                member for Oxley.</para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>The gravamen of the charge trade by these two individuals last evening was that I
            had had some unwholesome association with an organisation known as the Australian League
            of Rights and its Director,</para><para class="block">
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>
                        D. Butler. I want to make three points quite
            clearly so that even the petrified minds of these two honorable members may be able to
            comprehend them. First, I have never been a member of this organisation. Secondly, I am
            not a member of it. Thirdly, this much vaunted association that both of them so
            trenchantly purported to describe to the House last evening can be spelt out by
            activities in three fields. I have given papers to two public seminars organised by the
            Australian League of Rights. One related to Communism. I venture to say that I would
            present similar papers before any audience arranged by the honorable member for Yarra.
            But I think that some controversy would be aroused if I presented such papers before any
            audience gathered by him. The second way in which I was associated with the League of
            Rights was in the presentation of a paper about the Commonwealth of Nations. The third
            field of activity related to a public subscription that was opened to enable me to go to
            England to undertake a lecture campaign. That is the full extent of my association with
            the League. I hope that the two honorable members, even with the sense of their extreme
            limitations, can understand that.
                    </para><para>
                        The more substantial charge that was levelled at me so recklessly and so infamously
            by these two honorable gentlemen was that I had been associated with antiSemitic
            activities. I repudiate this charge in the plainest of language,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline>
                        say to all in this House and outside it that I
            dissociate myself completely from any thought of engaging in anti-Semitic activities.
            Let us look at the curious methods that were employed by these two ex-policemen opposite
            - poor samples of police forces, I am bound to say. For my part, rather than submit to
            their methods, I would submit happily to the charming of a voluntary confession out of
            me by the honorable member for Hunter
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline>
                        Let us look at an example of the statements made last night by the honorable member for
            Oxley. Referring to me, he said -
                    </para><list type="lowerroman-dotted">
                        <item label=".">
                            <para>. one statement that he made in connection with the partition of Israel, and
                which strongly supported the views of these anti-Semitic people . . .</para>
                        </item>
                    </list><para>This is the sort of thing that is done under the general kind of umbrella statement:
            " You were there ". I want to make just one commentary on that by reading a
            short passage. It is this - . . despite the interesting speech by the honorable member
            for Moreton, I hope that there will be no alteration of boundaries introduced into the
            problem. Apart from that aspect I was very impressed with the honorable member's
            speech.</para><para class="block">
                        Who said that? It was said by the former Leader of Her Majesty's
            Opposition in this Parliament, the Rt.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Dr. H.</inline>
                        V. Evatt. Will the honorable member for Oxley now say that the former right honorable
            member for Barton had anti-Semitic views? The honorable member exhibits a curious logic.
                    </para><para>Let us now move to the European Common Market issue, which was the second matter
            raised by the honorable gentleman. He has concluded that, because I happened to agree
            with the views of an organisation concerning the Common Market, I agree with all its
            views. May I remind him that, one evening, in this chamber, the honorable member for
            Yarra walked across the floor, in the full gaze of every member present, and
            congratulated me on my statement of my views on the Common Market. May the Lord protect
            me should the day ever come when I agree with all the views of the honorable member for
            Yarra. But let me take the honorable member for Oxley a little further and tell him that
            two Labour Ministers in the new United Kingdom Government, the Rt. Hon. Barbara Castle
            and the Rt. Hon. Douglas Jay, shared platforms with me.</para><para>

            clown, the honorable member for Hindmarsh

                            <para>- I have here three photographs showing the honorable member for Oxley in
                company with odd and peculiar individuals taking part in a peace march in
                Queensland, but I would not deduce from this that he is necessarily deeply involved.</para>

              Speaker.</inline>
                        I simply say that the statements that he made last evening
            overwhelmingly force me to conclude that his mind is completely ingrown. He has a sense
            of justice similar to that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam),</inline>
                        which I shall reveal. I shall do so
            hurriedly, because time is short. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was in
            Brisbane a few weeks ago, he described me as being on the extreme right wing of the
            Liberal Party of Australia. When he was asked about the honorable member for Yarra, he
            said: " He is not on the left wing of the Australian Labour Party. I dislike the
            terms ' left wing ' and right wing ' when it comes to the Labour Party.
            " The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, of course, suffers from the delusion that he
            thinks he is part of the fauna of Australia. I am not prepared to concede that he is,
            but I am prepared to concede that I believe he is one of Australia's most
            accomplished bower birds. With deference to Macaulay and to Horatius and his band, let
            me simply say of my friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -

                            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                            I hope that before the House
              adjourns this evening one of the Ministers present will answer the very serious charge
              made by the honorable member for East Sydney
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Devine).</inline>
                            I think everybody will recognise that it is a most serious charge
              which amounts to saying that the Commonwealth is prepared to forgo in the interests of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline>
                            what should be just taxation on
              behalf of the Australian people. I wish to discuss this evening a quite serious matter
              that has been brought to my notice. In a few days we shall be considering legislation
              designed to prevent tax evasion. I wish to raise tonight another form of evasion
              relating to customs duty which has been brought to my notice. It takes two particular
              forms.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>First, in respect of goods imported into Australia an activity is going on whereby
            invoices are made out for a lower cost than that actually charged'. Evidence has
            been provided to me indicating that this has happened. In that case ad valorem duty is
            being forfeited because the Department of Customs and Excise is not able to trace this
            kind of evasion. I have seen the invoices. One goes to the Customs authorities and the
            other goes to the importing firm. In each of the cases presented to me the goods coming
            from the suppliers overseas through an overseas agent have been quoted at a particular
            price - say £129 a ton for paper - but when the invoice goes through the Australian
            Customs the goods are quoted at about £100 a ton. In this way the goods attract a
            lesser amount of duty than should be charged.</para>
                    <para>The second kind of evasion is in respect of dumping duty. In this case the reverse
            procedure takes place. The invoice coming through the Customs authorities shows the
            price to be higher than the price actually charged by the overseas suppliers. Our
            dumping laws provide that if a price is charged below a certain figure, the item will
            attract dumping duty. For instance, if the normal price is quoted as £100 a ton for
            the supply of paper - this is the commodity about which I have been told - and a price
            lower than £100 a ton is charged, the goods attract dumping duty. But this is what
            happens. Privately the price quoted to the firm is £90 a ton but £100 a ton is
            the price shown on the invoice that is presented to the Customs authorities.</para>
                    <para>All merchandise imported into Australia must be accompanied by an invoice to which
            is attached a declaration in these terms -</para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I declare that no different invoice of the goods mentioned in the said invoice has
              been or will be furnished to anyone; and that no arrangement or understanding
              affecting the purchase price of the said goods has been or will be made or entered
              into between the said exporter and purchaser, or by anyone on behalf of either of
              them, either by way of discount, rebate, compensation or in any manner whatever other
              than as fully shown on this invoice.</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The practice going on in the first case avoids ad valorem duty by
            quoting less than the actual price charged. In the second case the price shown on the
            official invoice is higher than the price actually charged, simply because the actual
            price charged would attract dumping duty. I hope that the Customs authorities will be
            able to look into this matter and that it will attract the attention of the Government.</para>
                    <para>I am told by informed people in the sphere of activity about which I am speaking
            that it would not be particularly difficult for the Customs authorities to check up on
            the costing done within the importing firms. It is suggested to me that a proper check
            on the buyer's costing calculations will immediately show such irregularities. Where
            a buyer has been charged a higher price it will appear that he sells at cost or at a
            loss. Where a lower price occurs his theoretical profit is much higher than the actual
            profit on which his costing is based. It must be kept in mind that the practice of
            falsifying Customs invoices can be effective only if the supplier is prepared to declare
            the wrong prices. I am told that overseas manufacturers generally will not do this. The
            overseas manufacturers will not participate in this nefarious device, but on the other
            hand many overseas merchandising offices, sometimes agents of the particular importing
            firm in Australia, collaborate in this task of defrauding Australia of customs duty.</para>
                    <para>Another device in this field is to describe the article in an inaccurate way. The
            particular case I have in mind concerns paper imported from China. The original invoice
            made out in China shows that the weight of the paper is 28 grammes per square metre. The
            invoice made out in Amsterdam, in this case for the agent handling the importation, for
            exactly the same paper of the identical order shows a weight of 32 grammes per square
            metre. I know that this matter is a little technical but the point is that there is a
            simple reason for this discrepancy. Chinese greaseproof paper below 32 grammes per
            square metre weight is subject to a dumping duty calculated on the normal value of
            £A154 8s. a ton. The dumping duty works out at about £A25 a ton to be paid in
            addition to the ordinary ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. However, if you invoice the
            paper as 32 grammes, which is not, instead of at some lower weight, you do not pay any
            dumping duty at all.</para>
                    <para>The duplicate invoices for this paper are in my possession but I cannot make their
            details public. On one invoice the paper is shown as weighing 32 grammes per square
            metre. The other invoice describes the paper as weighing 28 grammes per square metre. I
            am told that the paper is subsequently sold, after importation, as paper having a weight
            of 28 grammes per square metre.</para>
                    <para>This whole situation is loaded. I am told by the people who should know that this
            practice is defrauding the Australian Customs of thousands of pounds a year. I was
            attracted to this situation first by a Tariff Board report dealing with aluminium
            ingots. The report is dated 3rd April 1964 and states -</para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The local industry claimed, in support of its request for the imposition of
              quantitative restrictions -</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Quantitative restrictions would get over this problem - that overseas
            aluminium producers were prepared to accept a lower return for aluminium than that
            indicated by the published prices. This, it was stated, could be achieved by the
            overseas producer using various devices, such as payment of agent's commission and
            customs duty (if any). The applicants -</para>
                    <para class="block">That is, the applicants before the Board - were, however, unable to
            supply evidence of any specific instance where this had been dune in respect of imports
            into Australia.</para>
                    <para class="block">I know that it is difficult to obtain this kind of evidence. However,
            having brought this matter to the notice of the Government I hope that it will arouse
            the Customs authorities and that in respect of the paper industry they might make more
            searching inquiries into the devices I have referred to, which amount to downright
            evasion of customs duties. Also, the evasion of dumping duty is undermining the
            Australian tariff policy.</para>

                            .- I think the record should be put straight in respect of the statement by the
              honorable member for East Sydney
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Devine)</inline>
                            in
              relation to the importation of aircraft. He was correct when he said that additional
              duty of
                            <inline font-style="italic">Ti</inline>
                            per cent, has to be paid under the
              Australia-United Kingdom Trade Agreement if aircraft similar to those being imported
              from countries other than the United Kingdom are obtainable from the United Kingdom.
              The honorable member said that Trans-Australia Airlines had paid the additional duty
              of
                            <inline font-style="italic">Ti</inline>
                            per cent, but that Ansett-A.N.A. had
              refused to pay it. That allegation is incorrect. The only way in which these companies
              can obtain a refund of any duty which may be payable is the way prescribed by clause
              449 (a) (ii) of the Agreement. I want to make it quite clear that both Ansett-A.N.A.
              and TransAustralia Airlines would be called upon to pay the same amount of duty. Both
              companies have lodged security to the satisfaction of the Collector of Customs for the
              payment of duty on these aircraft if that should be required. It is quite erroneous to
              say that Ansett-A.N.A. has refused to pay the duty. There has been no question of
              having to pay it. No money has passed between Ansett-A.N.A. or Trans-Australia
              Airlines and the Collector of Customs. Both companies have entered into the usual form
              of security agreement and if duty is payable the Collector of Customs will have
              authority to call the money up.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        This is just the normal procedure. There is no question whatever of favoritism
            towards one airline as against another. Repeatedly we see attempts made in this House to
            decry the private enterprise airline, Ansett-A.N.A. My comments with relation to those
            attempts went on record only a week or two ago. For the edification of the honorable
            member for East Sydney
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Devine),</inline>
                        who is
            interjecting, I shall repeat what I said earlier, because apparently he did not
            understand it. No money whatsoever has to be paid at this stage. Security arrangements
            have been entered into with the Collector of Customs by both companies.

                longer. I merely wanted to put the matter straight because of this constant campaign
                on the part of many honorable members opposite who wish to malign Ansett-A.N.A. As I
                have said before, their Socialistic programme is opposed to any private enterprise,
                especially in the transport field. Their aim is to foster T.A.A. I have noticed that
                in his comments about other air routes, the honorable member for East Sydney, also
                has used fallacious arguments about preference being given to Ansett-A.N.A. I do not
                want to go into these matters now.</para>

                    <para>I hope that I have been able to explain to the honorable member for East Sydney and
            other honorable members that it is completely false to argue that preference is shown
            towards one airline as against another in relation to duty on aircraft coming into this
            country. The only reason why a decision has not been given as to whether duty is payable
            or not in this case is because the planes arrived here sooner than expected.
            Negotiations are still being carried on between the Collector of Customs here and the
            United Kingdom Government. There is no question of money being paid at this stage, and
            both companies have entered into security arrangements with the Collector of Customs.</para>

                    <para class="block">I think I have been misled by the answer given to me by the Minister.
          Evidently this matter is under consideration by the Government, and it seems strange that
          after my question was asked - in fact, on the day before an answer to it was given - that
          rather extensive statement was made in respect of the proposed increases in the payments
          to be made by subscribers to medical benefit funds. The dogs have been barking some
          considerable time now that this matter was under consideration by the Government, that the
          funds were seeking an increase and that approval would surely be given.</para>
                    <para>I now ask the Minister .representing the Minister for Health: What is the actual
          position? Is the answer I received a misleading answer given to indicate that there was
          nothing doing at all in Government circles? If the answer was given for that purpose it is
          completely destroyed by the article that appeared in the Sydney " Sun " of 21st
          October 1964, which clearly states that an increase in subscriptions is under
          consideration by the Government. Is the public to be asked to pay more? If so, what extra
          benefits, if any, are to be granted, or are people to be insured only to cover the present
          benefits?</para>
                    <para>When all is said and done, as is stated in this article, there are more than 80 of
          these funds. In this Parliament from time to time honorable members on this side have
          indicated the tremendous overlap in the functions of the funds, and the great costs of
          administration as compared with more efficient organisations. Furthermore, they have
          indicated that people are lucky to get £70 out of £100 charged for a big
          operation, and that they are paying approximately 33i per cent, of their medical costs
          despite the contributions they make. I ask the Minister tonight to say clearly whether or
          not subscribers will have to pay more, what benefits are to be given, and above all else,
          why an answer was given to me indicating that the matter was not under consideration when
          it is quite certain from the article that I have read that it is at this very moment being
          discussed, and that an increase has probably already been approved.</para>
                    <para>I suggest that the Government is delaying and answer on this matter until after the
          forthcoming Senate election, and I suggest that for political reasons the Government is
          not making public the fact that as soon as the Senate election is over people will be
          called upon to pay increased contributions for whatever medical benefits are available. If
          it were not for the Senate election this imposition would probably have already been made.
          I ask the Minister, therefore, what the actual position is in respect of this matter which
          is of so much importance to many Australians today. I cannot see any justification at all
          for any rise in subscription. I think that medical funds should give a complete coverage
          of medical expenses as is done by hospital funds in the case of hospitalisation. I cannot
          see any justification at all for any increase being made in contributions, particularly at
          a time when the benefits being paid are not by any means what should be granted to meet
          the costs of medical attention. I suggest also that it is very strange that public
          announcements of these matters should be delayed simply because a Senate election is
          pending. I think the people are entitled to know just what is happening in the Department
          of Health in respect of applications that have been lodged. It can never be said that the
          Hospitals Contribution Fund has not made application for the payment of certain additional
          benefits to people, because that happened some months ago and it is public property that
          the Government held the matter up. So at least to that extent the answer given to me has
          not been accurate. I would like the Minister representing the Minister for Health to clear
          the position up tonight and let the people know whether there is to be another imposition.
          I suggest it is not fair, reasonable or just to delay making announcements on this
          important subject simply because a Senate election is pending. I suggest also that the
          Minister look again at the answer that was given to me, which appeared to be misleading in
          the extreme and not in accordance with the facts.</para>

                                has referred to an answer that I gave to him recently to a question
              on notice. The information provided in that answer is quite correct. It was correct at
              the time and is still correct. The honorable member was probably in the House
              yesterday when a question without notice was asked of me by the honorable member for
              McMillan
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Buchanan)</inline>
                                on the same subject. I
              said in reply at that time that the question whether there will be any consideration
              by the Government of increased benefits or increased rates will come up for
              consideration after a report has been submitted to me, as Acting Minister, by the
              Commonwealth Health Insurance Council. I said at the time that the Council met only a
              few days ago and that it considered certain matters. It will now consolidate its
              thoughts and submit a report, in this case to the Acting Minister. From that point the
              Acting Minister will consider the Council's submissions and later discuss them
              with the Government. That is the procedure that has always been followed and will be
              followed in the future. It will be followed in these circumstances. There is no other
              information I can provide at this stage, except that no submission has yet been made
              to the Government. When it is received it will be considered.

                                to write another ballad in honour of

              motion, as he did when he composed his first ballad on this subject in May 1962. The
              honorable member for Moreton apparently did me this honour because a week ago tonight
              I referred to the antiSemitic overtones of the question he asked about

              the public for his spirited anti-Communism. Less publicity has been directed towards
              his close and persistent ties with Australia'^ leading anti-Semitic organisation,
              Eric D. Butler's Australian League of Rights. Butler himself has written that
              Killen 'was a friend of mine long before he entered Federal politics" (Eric D.

              the two journals controlled by Butler - the League of Rights* monthly Intelligence
              Survey (IS) and the social credit fortnightly New Times (NT). His maiden speech
              attacking peaceful co-existence was described as "one of the most realistic yet
              heard in Canberra" (IS, Feb. 1956). Subsequently, these two papers have
              republished scores of Killen's "brilliant" and "courageous"
              speeches, most of them originally delivered in the House of Representatives.

              in the House of Representatives on August 6, 1958. Asserting that the Arab States were
              terrified of "Zionist aggression", he recommended a multilateral agreement
              among the USA, the UK, Israel and the Arab countries " to ensure that there will
              be no manifestation of the Messianic movement of Zionism". He continued: "I
              believe that the creation of Israel was a folly". On the following day he went
              further and said Israel was to blame for "The whole of the trouble in the Middle
              East". Near the beginning of the speech ha remarked: " I would be disturbed if
              anyone levelled at me the charge of anti-Semitism ". Butler reserved high praise
              for Killen's "courageous address" (NT, 29/8/58).</para>

                            <para>Some time later Butler admitted in a confidential "Personal Letter" to his
              supporters: "Possibly our greatest success in the field of special campaigning
              over the last twelve months, was our work on the Middle East crisis. We demonstrated
              here once again that a small body of dedicated men, who know what to do and how to do
              it, can have a decisive impact in a crisis . . . Jim Killen was in direct touch with
              me on this issue and his address in the Federal Parliament resulted in the switchboard
              of the A.B.C. in Sydney and Melbourne being jammed with callers wanting to contact
              him. One Federal Cabinet Minister was also in touch with me on the issue and our
              material reached the Cabinet room. We gained a number of new and influential allies
              from this campaign. I can report that the local Zionists were most concerned and
              endeavoured to try and counteract it."</para>

                                During the previous year Killen had come out as an open Butlerite, although he has
              never formally belonged to the League of Rights. He had intended to be present at the
              11th New Times Annual Dinner in Melbourne during September 1957, but illness
              intervened. On this occasion, following the recital of messages from such
              internationally famous anti-Semites as Britain's A. K. Chesterton
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Oswald Mosley's lieutenant in the 1930's)</inline>
                                and Canada's Ron Gostick the following telegram from Killen was read: " I
              would like you to know you have my very best wishes . . . Your kindness has given a
              little more determination to a very young man " (NT, 4.10.57). Killen was also
              unable to attend the Annual Dinner in the following year and again had to content
              himself with a telegram: " Your encouragement to me greatly appreciated. Possibly
              never in history has there been such a need for the qualities of integrity and loyalty
              to basic principles to be upheld" (NT, 26.9.58). Two months later, Butler greeted
              Killen's re-election at the Federal Elections: " We confidently expect that
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Killen's</inline>
                                standing and influence will be
              substantially greater in the new Parliament " (NT, 5.12.58).

              Credit Seminar in 1959, where he presented the main discussion paper. Butler
              introduced him to the audience as "a man of integrity and courage ... a militant
              Christian (who) is playing a major role in the struggle against totalitarianism both
              at home and abroad" (NT, 2.10.59). The seminar paper was published by the League
              of Rights in 1960 under the impressive title, This is the Challenge! An Examination of
              the Theory, Strategy, Tactics and Propaganda of International Communism.</para>

              addressed a number of League of Rights meetings on this subject (IS, July 61; NT,
              11/8/61). In reply to Arthur Calwell's charge that he was associating with a
              "semi-fascist" group, Killen stated: "The Australian League of Rights aims
              at preserving British integrity and sovereignty " (Canberra Times, 14/6/62). The

                        <para>The only class of person who had entered Australia illegally and from whom it has
              been the policy subsequently to receive for consideration an application to remain
              with permanent residence status was, prior to the policy in this respect being amended
              on 1st June 1964, a seaman deserter.</para>
                        <para>Prior to 1st June 1964, the policy was to consider an application for permanent
              residence status from a seaman deserter in those cases where the applicant was able to
              satisfy the normal requirements for entry as a migrant, and subject to his having had
              a clear record following his entry into Australia.</para>
                        <para>It has not been the practice to record separately statistical detail of seaman
              deserters who apply for permanent residence status, and the results of such
              applications. Action has been taken to record such detail in future.</para>
                        <para>Since 1st June 1964, the policy with respect to seaman deserters, who comprise the
              bulk of illegal entrants, has been that seamen who enter illegally in this way should,
              as a matter of general practice, be deported.</para>
                        <para>There would have been isolated instances in which persons who have entered
              illegally in other ways (for example as stowaways) have been permitted to remain,
              subject to their meeting normal migrant requirements, but these have been very few.</para>
