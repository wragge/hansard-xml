If not, when can the South Australian Premier anticipate receiving a reply to those submissions?

            <para>- If there is any correspondence from the city of Whyalla I shall certainly examine it, look at the records and provide an answer forthwith. As far as the South Australian Premier is concerned, basically we have been looking to see what came out of the negotiations with New South Wales and with the New South Wales Premier because there we were dealing with a government which had direct responsibility for its State dockyard. We have certainly made no deal or arrangement with Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd in relation to Whyalla, although I have been told that BHP believes that even under existing arrangements it will continue to employ its present employees, not. necessarily in shipbuilding but in some parts of the BHP activity. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As far as the Government's general proposition in relation to this matter is concerned, we believe that if the taxpayers were to be asked to provide substantial additional sums, which the Minister for Transport advises me would have equalled about $20,000 per man for each of the 2 Australian National Line ships, then in return there should be a proper industrial relations contract which would make sure that those ships were built as cheaply as possible. I think the honourable gentleman will agree that an additional subsidy of $20,000 a man for the building of those ships compared with the cost overseas is a pretty heavy additional burden on Australian taxpayers. </para>
          <para>Because of our concern for the centre- in this case Newcastle- and because of our concern for the men and their families the Government was and is prepared to entertain that situation in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that the industrial relations contract would stipulate that there would be no changes as to wages and conditions beyond those that applied through the normal wage tribunals, that there would be a guarantee that no strikes or demarcation disputes would occur during the period of construction of the vessels, and that there would be an indemnity if delays were caused by strikes and bans. We have pointed but that such a contract is not unusual overseas. We have also pointed out in response to those who have said that the indemnity was harsh that it is entirely in the hands of the trade unions concerned whether that indemnity clause would be invoked. There were dispute settling procedures which, as I understand it, were agreeable to the unions and to the Government. If there are reasonable dispute settling procedures by which both sides can abide, then there ought not to be the necessity for strikes or demarcation disputes and matters of that kind. </para>
          <para>I want to put safety issues and health issues to one side because they are always in a special category requiring special treatment. I am talking about industrial disputes of different kinds, not of the safety kind. If the indemnity clause were invoked it would be invoked only in circumstances in which a commitment not to strike had in fact been broken. We believe that the Commonwealth could ask nothing less if there were to be a contract for these ships to be built at Newcastle. So far there has not been a response from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran.</inline> The Government is waiting for that response because the ball is in his court. One of the things that I regret very greatly is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran-</inline> I am not sure whether it was out the front door or out the back door- and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Hawke, through one of his hats- I am never quite sure which one- condemned the contract before the men at Newcastle had an opportunity to cast their judgment upon it. The understanding I had come to with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> in the discussions about these particular matters is that there would be no discussion or dispute in public about the contract until the men concerned had had an opportunity to discuss it and look at it in a calm atmosphere. The Government believed that if there were political dispute over the nature of the contract it would lead to an inevitable conclusion. It is to my very great regret, therefore, that once <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> issued the contract to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and to the trade unions, it immediately became a matter for discussion and dispute. Really, the decision of the men at Newcastle was pre-empted before they had an opportunity to make a decision. I believe this is a classic example of trade union leaders pre-empting the decision of members of trade unions. If the contract had been put to their own people in a calm and quiet manner, they might well have accepted an arrangement that was fair. </para>

            <para>-I am able to confirm that the Government has taken a decision and has advised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tyler</inline> of Broken Hill South that it is desirous of supporting his company in getting the Duchess rock phosphate into the Australian phosphate system. The Duchess rock phosphate find is of enormous magnitude and of great importance to Australia, having regard to the decline of reserves of phosphate in other parts of the world. I have informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tyler</inline> by letter that the Government supports the introduction of as much as 250 000 tonnes of Duchess rock phosphate into the system this year and 500 000 tonnes next year. It is quite apparent and would be apparent to the honourable member for Moore that the larger the quantity of phosphate that can be placed in use, the lower will be the costs that ensue. As to the final terms and negotiations that the Broken Hill South Company has entered into with the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission, I am unable to comment on that matter other than to say that negotiations are ensuing at the moment. It is the Australian Government's wish that the final price to the Australian farmer be maintained at as low a rate as possible. </para>

            <para>- I do not know whether the honourable gentleman is expressing any serious concern about the function of manufacturing industry. Certainly the decision to devalue has been welcomed by manufacturing industry throughout the country. It has been welcomed because it will provide a lift, particularly in the employment area. So far as import tariffs are concerned, I simply say that the Government will be looking at areas where the enhanced competitive position of Australian industry will not be prejudiced. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Prime Minister. How can the Government prevent the advantages that devaluation brings to the Australian economy being dissipated, particularly with regard to wages policy, control of the money supply and possible short term profiteering by those Australian companies now enjoying higher rates of protection? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman has raised matters that very obviously were in the Government's mind when it made the decision concerning devaluation. At the same time as announcing devaluation the Treasurer announced action in 3 other areas of policy. One concerned the deferment of certain Commonwealth expenditures throughout the rest of this year into next year. Another concerned action in relation to the money supply- honourable members will agree, with regret, that this is necessary in inflationary circumstances- which involves some increase in interest rates. I think that by the end of this week necessary action will be taken so that people can judge the extent and the impact of it. When they do judge it, I believe that no one will be able to give any credit to the somewhat wilder allegations that have been made over the last day or so in relation to action in that area. The action which was proposed to the Government and which has been accepted is reasonable and moderate, and it will be judged to be reasonable and moderate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition, the Government will be reaffirming the view that it has taken on the wages front. We have said on a number of occasions that we regret that there has not been a greater opportunity to test the general common sense of the average Australian rather than paying too much credence to the views of some leaders in this area who I believe do not exemplify the views of the great majority of the people whom they purport to represent. There are other areas also which I believe people have not looked at adequately. One of the reasons why costs in Australian industry are high is that many industries are operating at 60 per cent or 70 per cent of capacity. As we get the inevitable transfer from imported goods to Australian produced goods under the circumstances of devaluation, production runs in Australia should increase. That in itself should give manufacturers an opportunity to contain costs. Any manufacturer with a sense of responsibility certainly ought to do his utmost to do just that. Indeed, one major manufacturer which believes that its production will be able to increase very greatly, not only for domestic markets but also through renewed and greater access to export markets, has indicated that the price of its products should be held now for a considerable period. It makes a particular product that should have flow through effects into many different industries. </para>

              <para>- I have no intention of naming particular manufacturers in this House. The effects should flow through into a number of different industries. One of the things that people need to understand is that, while there will be some people, as there always are, who will take advantage of an opportunity that is given to them to act in a selfish way rather than in the national interest, I believe that they will be in the minority. I would believe that at this time we are coming to a stage where a great majority of Australians are recognising that there is a national task that involves all Australians whether they are management or labour- no matter where they come from. In defence of some people who might be accused of speculating, let me point out to the House that there are people who have imported goods from overseas, who have bought on traders' credit and who will be paying in 6 to 8 weeks time at the different rate of" currency. People who have bought goods from overseas on that basis obviously have strong grounds for changing a particular price but people who paid on the old oasis obviously have not and should clear their stocks at the old price. If they have any sense of national responsibility that is precisely what they will do. In other words, there are many things that the Government can do in this particular matter but there are also many things which involve a cooperative effort by people right around Australia in many different activities. The Government, for its part, will continue to explore every avenue open to it so as to be successful in the objectives that it has set itself. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Treasurer. Is it a fact that many resource rich but capital poor countries such as Venezuela, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mexico, the Philippines and Spain have in the last year borrowed amounts in excess of $1 billion not by going into hock with the International Monetary Fund or letting profiteers take them to the cleaners but by borrowing from merchant banks at modest interest rates for periods of 5 to 7 years, or, in the case of the Philippines, from 5 to 8 years? Why did not the Government take this option of borrowing a further billion dollars to solve Australia's short term economic problems rather than the devaluation option which, to quote his own recent statement, 'would increase unemployment, would have inflationary effects and would certainly be generally unhelpful '? </para>

            <para>- If there is one thing that the Leader of the Opposition consistently represents in this place and outside, it is the Khemlani mentality. I would like to say more about that but because of a matter being dealt with outside this Parliament it is not appropriate for me to say any more about it. Hopefully, the time may arise when one is able to say more about that. I can well imagine the Leader of the Opposition seeking to borrow himself out of trouble to the extent of $1 billion or $4 billion. It so happens that so far as this Administration is concerned responsibly we recognised that any option which presented itself to the dimension of $ 1 billion would, of course, have been an option which would not have created confidence; it would have created a sense of continuing uncertainty. The decision to devalue has completely dissipated that uncertainty, much to the chagrin of the honourable gentleman. I say to him, notwithstanding the reference to Venezuela and other countries, that we do not see that as our example. Rather, we responded to a situation which had been developing with the assistance of some people very close to the honourable gentleman during recent months. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That decision having come to a point of inevitability we looked, of course, at the possibility of borrowing in excess of $ 1 billion. But certainty, no; uncertainty created, yes. If the honourable gentleman knew anything about international financing he would be aware of a term called conditionality'. This Government was not prepared to put itself into hock to that extent. Beyond that, of course, with the absence of any certainty about the question of devaluation on the basis of a decision to borrow $1 billion, we recognised that we were not prepared to afford the losses which that sum would have had in itself. I say to the honourable gentleman that no doubt he still conceives of Khemlani. I leave that conception in his mind and his mind alone. </para>

I would not like perspective in this matter to be in any way distorted.

That assurance was also given by my right honourable friend, the Prime Minister. The allegation which is made in this week's <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> among other things relates to the research facility at Pine Gap.

            <para>- The honourable gentleman has directed his question to 3 specific areas. The first is with respect to the United States of America. The difficulties in relation to beef access to the United States market in 1977 are concerned with the necessity for negotiations to be concluded with the Ford Administration which, I understand, remains in control of the White House and the United States Administration until 20 January 1977, yet the period within which beef will be admitted to the United States will be largely in the term of President-elect Carter. The discussions on 6 December and thereafter to which the first part of the honourable gentleman's question was directed therefore are most important. Australia will be represented at an appropriate level. We regard the negotiation as most significant as it presents the opportunity for selling beef to what is still Australia's principal beef export market, which is of tremendous importance for the revival of the Australian cattle industry. I should perhaps mention 2 aspects in relation to the American market which have caused much comment. One is the extent to which the free trade zones were used by Australia allegedly to by-pass the quota restraints. This is not true as the whole question of the inclusion of the free trade zones was discussed first with the United States Administration at the time when negotiations for the 1976 voluntary restraints were first initiated. Indeed, prior to the signature of the correspondence which set levels of voluntary restraint, the United States had given the Australian Government to understand that it did not wish the free trade zones to be included. It was as a result of that negotiation that they were excluded. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other aspect of American trade that is of concern to Australia is the suggestion that in some way there was a significant shipment of meat through Canada into the United States and that thereby Australia also avoided the implications of voluntary restraints. We reject that allegation also. There is no doubt that individual Canadian importers were in a position to ship their product where they wished. But the United States has not raised the question of Australian beef being shipped in that way. Our principal concern is that we get a sufficient price for the product sold to Canada, and that, following the determination arranged with the United States, access to Canada also be opened up for the 1977 year. </para>
          <para>With respect to the other 2 markets which were mentioned in the honourable gentleman's question, I will deal first with Japan. The Japanese Government has now advised us that the 20 000 tonnes which were allocated in a recent announcement for the first half of 1977 are to apply only to the first 3 months and, therefore, there will be an expectation in January for a further allocation which we would hope would bring us up to at least approximately the quota allocation for the final 6 months of this year. With respect to Europe, it is true that the safeguard restrictions on beef imports are said to be lifted on 1 April 1977. However, a new import regime is still to be concluded by the European community. Australia is pursuing every possible diplomatic initiative to try to ensure that we do again obtain reasonable access to the Community for Australian exports. This year, in spite of restrictions, we have exported a not insignificant quantity of beef to the Community. The general projection is that demand will increase there next year. In all, in each one of these markets - </para>

              <para>- The prospects of the cattle industry, I know, do not interest the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition one whit. Unfortunately, there are a good many men, women and children in this industry in Australia who are probably as impoverished as any other sector of the Australian community. The failure of the Labor Party to recognise the plight in which these people are currently suffering is a great indictment of it. In all, the markets for Australian beef I see opening up during 1977. Certainly, we are pursuing every possible initiative to ensure maximum possible access for Australian beef to those markets. </para>

            <para>- I shall give the honourable member a brief answer. The fact is that the Press statement and the statement made yesterday made it perfectly clear that of course there will be an inflationary impact. I remind the honourable gentleman, whose memory of these matters is far too short, that when the Labor Government devalued in September 1974 it took no offsetting action to stop the inflationary impact of that devaluation at that time. I also remind the House that in that month the then Government had 4.8 months cover in reserves of $2,965.3m. Clearly, without offsetting action at that stage that devaluation was grossly inappropriate and grossly inflationary. This Government has made it perfectly clear that, recognising the inflationary consequences of a decision to devalue, inevitable as it was, there was a need for consequential action in firming and strengthening the 3 remaining arms of policy. I remind the honourable gentleman of the action I have foreshadowed as far as fiscal policy is concerned. I remind him also of the action which is proposed on the monetary front, as well as of the Government's position in forthcoming cases before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Government has made it perfectly clear that it will do everything possible to offset the inflationary consequences of the decision- a decision which, at the same time, in the jurisdiction of the honourable gentlemen on the Opposition benches, will provide a very real lift to the mining sector. He must recall the number of mines which have closed recently and the lack of confidence which emanated there. This decision is of direct assistance to the mining industry; it will seek to restore the competitive position of Australian manufacturing industry; it will assist rural industry; and it will assist import competitive industries. I believe that the beneficial results have been completely overlooked by the honourable gentleman. </para>

            <para>- This decision, coupled with other decisions which the Government made in relation to Tasmania, should be of enormous advantage to the State of Tasmania and to all industries in that State. The honourable gentleman will be aware that a few days ago the other half of the freight equalisation scheme for Tasmania was announced. That scheme is now operating both ways. The later announcement applied retrospectively to 1 July so that Australian industries would get the full benefit of the Government's commitment in this area. The decision in relation to devaluation will clearly be of great assistance to industries in Tasmania and in other States. It will be of great assistance to farmers in Tasmania who have been very hard hit, for a variety of reasons. I believe that our decisions would do very much more for employment in Tasmania than the famous and much heralded 24-point plan of the Labor Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson.</inline> I believe that our decisions will be of great advantage to the industries. I do not think the 24-point plan was going to do a great deal. If I could make one comment about one part of the 24-point plan to gain a benefit under a provision for a rebate of payroll tax one had first to sack a person and then to reappoint him. If one did that one would get the rebate from the State Government. It seemed a very odd way of going about business. </para>

          <para>I hope that companies such as the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited, which has been in difficulty because of the price of copper, will review their decisions. It had become quite clear from conversations that the company had been prepared to carry through its programs in the expectation that the world price of copper would rise. It was prepared to run with a difficult circumstance in the intervening period. Now, with the increased prices that will accrue as a result of the decision to devalue, the company could be in a position equivalent to that which it had expected for the next several months and could still employ, I believe, a considerable number of those people whom it said it would retrench. The total position of the company financially would be the same as the company expected. Therefore, I believe the company has an obligation to review its position and its decision in relation to its employees especially since, as I well know, the company understands that it is in a remote area. It is not just a question of the company and the employees, it is a question of a community which is utterly dependent upon this operation. </para>
          <para>Overall, I expect the decision to devalue to be of great advantage to Tasmania, as it will be of great advantage to the whole of Australia. I am delighted to know that responsible members of the trade union movement in Tasmania have heralded it as good news for Tasmania. While I can be thankful that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> has also welcomed it as good news for Tasmania, I cannot altogether wish him well when his election day comes because I believe the State could be much better governed by a different administration. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications a question. Three weeks ago he told me that he had asked his Department to consider the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Waller on Radio Australia, in consultation with other departments, and that he hoped to bring something to the Parliament in the near future. I now ask: Is it a fact that his Department and the Treasury have now recommended that Radio Australia be closed? Since he has tabled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Green's</inline> recommendation on Radio Australia, why is the Government so dilatory in, or reluctant to, table <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Waller's recommendations? Can the Minister announce the Government's decision before the Christmas recess? </para>

            <para>- The suggestion that my Department and Treasury have recommended that Radio Australia be closed is incorrect. Such is not the case. As I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition earlier, I believe that very shortly I will be able to make to the Government and to the Parliament some recommendations. It is very close. I will look to see whether it is possible to do so prior to the recess. </para>

              <para>- Honourable members opposite seem to be most reluctant to hear what I have to say. Honourable members will recall that on 5 October last I tabled the text of an arrangement between the United States Department of Justice and the Australian Attorney-General's Department dated 13 September 1976 entitled 'Procedures for Mutual Assistance in Administration of Justice in Connection with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation Matter'. Pursuant to that arrangement documents were supplied by the United States Department of Justice. I understand that these documents were provided to the United States Department of Justice by the United States Senate Sub-Committee on Multinational Corporations. The documents have since been studied by me. In view of previous publicity given to this matter I wish to inform the House that I find nothing in the documents which suggests any breach of law or any other impropriety on the part of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> or any other person. The Solicitor-General and the senior officer of my Department have also studied the documents and they share the view which I have formed. Does the Opposition want the document from which I have read? </para>

The honourable gentleman should be very much aware of that. As I said in earlier response to him, the suggestion of a tax upon capital flows which he asserts might have gone to one part of the world or another, for a particular reason well known to him but not to the authorities, is in essence a nonsense. As to the question about the amount relating to the Reserve Bank of Australia, I shall give consideration to it. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is supplementary to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to speculation that his Department will assume control of the operations of Radio Australia? Will the Minister inform the House whether the speculation has any substance? </para>

            <para>-My attention has been drawn to that speculation. As the honourable member stated that his question was supplementary to that asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I shall refer to a matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I simply say with the support of the Prime Minister and, I am sure, with the support of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that if any officials want to put a recommendation to us that Radio Australia be abolished, then that recommendation will fall on deaf ears. Radio Australia will remain strong and independent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That leads me to the question raised by the honourable member. I said previously in an interview on radio with the Australian Broadcasting Commission that I considered the reputation of Radio Australia to be excellent, and much of that reputation was derived from its very independence. I consider it extremely desirable for Australia to have a clear and strong overseas voice, capable of bringing reliable, unbiased information to neighbouring areas of particular significance to this country. Radio Australia has an excellent reputation in that regard, especially in Asia and the Pacific. The service by Radio Australia is a most important part of Australia's equipment in the representation of Australia internationally and also for people to be able to assess for themselves in an unbiased way the viewpoints broadcast by the network through Radio Australia. The Government does not accept the view that Radio Australia should be under the control of my Department. As I said before, Radio Australia will remain strong. It will remain independent and will not come under the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-style="italic">Mi</inline>HAYDEN (Oxley) (3.13)-The Government's health insurance arrangements are responsible for undesirable economic consequences. They are responsible for those undesirable economic consequences at a time of considerable difficulty in managing the economic affairs of the nation. They have added greatly to the problems of economic management. They are ill-advised. There are 3 main thrusts to this argument Firstly, at a time when consumer demand ought to be stimulated and not cut back, least of all cut back severely, the proposals for the imposition of compulsory charges for all wage-earners- with few relatively minor exceptions result in a reduction in spending power in the community and, accordingly, a reduction in consumer demand. Secondly, the imposition of charges, whether they be the Medibank levy or compulsory subscriptions to private health insurance funds, results in a reduction in personal incomes and in living standards. Thirdly, as as result of these combined factors the arrangements will result in industrial unrest which in turn will lead to costs which will have to be borne by the community at a time when this sort of unrest ought to be avoided as much as. possible. </para>
          <para>I will deal with the first of these points, the proposition that the arrangements have been responsible for a substantial reduction in the capacity of consumers to demand goods and services in the market place. In the course of a full year the cost of the Government's proposals, in terms of charges that have to be met by the community, reaches something like $900m. The community will not receive for that additional outlay anything more than it was receiving before. That is to say, the new Medibank arrangements do not provide more medical services or more hospital services and they do not provide more money for the States for their public hospital services than would have been the case under the original Medibank arrangements. So the community is paying near enough to $900m more for something which it was receiving already. Accordingly, its capacity to demand goods and services in the community is reduced by that amount, and the cost of living will rise as a result of this action. </para>
          <para>Incidentally, it is not without its irony that a government declaiming its opposition to compulsion in the community should be responsible, by its stated intention, for conscripting half of the community into private health insurance funds, into commercial organisations, just as it conscripted youth into Vietnam. I always find it remarkable that the conservative coalition parties can always declaim that they are opposed to compulsion and that they want freedom of choice in the community; yet they resort so frequently to the imposition of compulsion. I find it even more remarkable that the media scarcely find it worth commenting on. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the effects of a reduction of $900m in consumer spending in the course of a full year. It is the equivalent of something like 24 000 houses costing $35,000 each. That represents between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the worth of new houses in a year. That is the sort of cutback that is imposed on the economy as a result of this decision. It is the equivalent of about 170 000 motor cars valued at about $5,000 each. That is about half a year's production in this country. It is the equivalent of about 1 700 000 refrigerators costing $500 each. The production in this country in a year is about 300 000 refrigerators. It is the equivalent of about 17 million women's frocks costing $50 each. Clearly I am not suggesting that any one of those in the totality I have quoted will be the sort of reduction suffered in that particular industry. I have given those comparisons to illustrate the severe cutback on consumer demand which will arise as a result of a reduction in consumer spending by the private health insurance arrangements of the Government. </para>
          <para>It might be suggested that this decision reduces the deficit. The situation with which we have been confronted is that there has been too much ill-informed preoccupation with the deficit. The Government, which claimed that its first objective was to get a recovery under way in the economy, proceeded to implement economic policies which would be directly responsible for a further accentuation of the recession in the country and which would be responsible for a cutback in activity in the business sector, the private sector. We hear so much about the private sector that it has become almost part of the mythology of our community, almost a spiritual incantation, as though it is quite improper to criticise anything about the private sector where the conservative coalition Government is concerned. If that is so, why has the Government decided to cut back consumer spending by nearly $900m a year? That really erodes the position of the private sector of the economy and activity generally within the community. We need consumer spending now, if there is any genuineness, any grain of sincerity, in the Government's claims that it wants to support the private sector and to stimulate a recovery. </para>
          <para>Let me take up the second point that I mentioned, namely, the undesirable consequences which will arise from these health insurance arrangements and the effects on personal living standards and on incomes of people. Let me take the case of a person on average weekly earnings. The compulsory subscription to Medibank will be about $4.50 a week. That represents a 17.6 per cent increase on tax to be paid this year. Just imagine if the Government bad been honest for a change, if the Government had been faithful to its objectives contained in its statements about its purpose at the last election, if it had said that it was its intention to increase taxes by 17.6 per cent instead of claiming to reduce taxes, or if it had said that it was its intention to dismantle Medibank on a massive scale instead of pledging to retain the integrity of the Medibank program. </para>
          <para>People's living standards will be reduced as a result of the compulsory charges that have to be met. It is true that we proposed that there be charges to fund the original Medibank proposals. That was opposed by the conservative coalition when in Opposition. The opposition was based on a matter of great principle, as articulated by members of the then Opposition: They were opposed to the compulsory contributions implicit in that scheme. The situation in which the present Government introduced the </para>
          <para>Medibank levy and imposed the compulsory membership of private health insurance funds on those who decided not to belong to the basic Medibank scheme represented a totally different set of economic circumstances from those which applied when we were in government. It was quite inappropriate for the Government in the situation in the course of this year to introduce those charges because, as I repeat, all they serve to do is to reduce, in the course of this year and next year when economic circumstances will be quite difficult, the capacity of people to demand goods and services in the community. That must be one of the most important objectives if the Government is sincere when it says that it wants to see a recovery in the economy. </para>
          <para>It is remarkable, and it ought to go on record, that this Government, which campaigned on the promise to reduce taxes and which asserted its opposition to high taxes, is in fact the highest taxing government in the history of this country. The Government has been responsible for a record increase in taxation this year- a 25 per cent increase in personal income tax, an increase of $ 1,755m, a record increase to a record level of $8, 775m. Of course, in the case of the Medibank levy it is seeking to bypass its responsibilities to the community in the form of tax indexation. By introducing a special earmarked charge- the Medibank levy- the Government has sought to increase its total tax take to considerably above what would have been justified with the introduction of tax indexation, except if the Government cared to come clean, which obviously it does not, and state to the public that it is a high tax government and that in its recent Budget its purpose was to increase taxes substantially. It increased taxes by a far greater proportion than they have ever been increased. It increased personal taxes in the community to a level unparalleled in the history of the nation. Those are the hard facts. </para>
          <para>The unfortunate consequence of this direct assault on people 's personal pay packets is that it will provoke union demands for offsetting wage increases or offsetting benefits to cover the costs which workers now have to meet, as a result of the charges which the Government has implemented. This is turn will lead to industrial disruption of one form or another. That again will contribute in its own way to inflation and to the cost of maintaining the Australian economy. It is all so unnecessary, because it is quite undesirable for the Government to adopt those policies in the given economic circumstances with which the nation is confronted at the moment. I put it to the Government that it has been quite dishonest in its dealings with the trade union movement in Australia on the issue of the costs of Medibank and how they will be treated when they feed into the consumer price index. The  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> went away from Canberra several months ago after consultation with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on the issue- I rely on my recollection of newspaper reports at the time- convinced that the Government would ensure that the increases in the cost of living arising from the Medibank levy and from compulsory private health insurance would be fed into the consumer price index and would be fully applied in the wage indexation process before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
          <para>What has become increasingly clear is that the Government, by devious measures, has sought to avoid all of that increase going into the consumer price index. It is quite clear from figures which were submitted to the Commission- projections of quarterly movements in the consumer price index for all of this financial year- that the level of the consumer price index anticipated by the Government for the December quarter of about 4V4 per cent is well below the level which one would reasonably expect, on an informed basis, in that quarter following the full effects of the changes to the health insurance arrangements. Informed economists were predicting rates between 6 and 7 per cent and some suggested rates even higher than that. Of course, what has happened is- it dawned on me only a fortnight ago when I was again going through the Budget papers on revenue sources- that the Government will treat the Medibank levy, the compulsory levy, as a tax. As a personal income tax it will not feed into the consumer price index. </para>
          <para>The Government deceitfully has done this and, in doing so, has not come clean with the trade union movement. It has led the trade union movement to believe that the full effects of the Medibank charges will feed into the consumer price index when only about half will feed into the consumer price index. This is quite dishonest and incompatible with past practices and practices which are pursued today. It is unusual for charges by government instrumentalities to be treated as taxes. We do not treat the charges of Trans-Australiann Airlines, the Commonwealth Railways, public hospitals or government departments for services rendered to the public as increases in personal taxes. The only reason the Government has done so on this occasion is to try to whittle down the rate of increases in wages through the wage indexation system which would otherwise have applied, and justifiably applied, if the Government were to honour its obligations and the commitments that it had given to the trade unions. </para>

            <para>-One might well ask what the Opposition is about in this motion. What it is about is this: It wants a return to so-called 'free' medical care. Does it really think that medical care and medical insurance can really be free? There is no such thing as a free meal and it is high time that the Opposition woke up to it. When in fact we assumed office, it was clear that the costs of Medibank without a change in arrangements during 1976-77 would soar to $2,000m of taxpayers' money. That is the situation which confronted this Government and I will return to it in a moment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Before I do so, I want to take up one of the last points that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> was making. He tries to have it both ways. Earlier in his speech he castigated the Government for what he alleged is a record increase in income tax. He referred to the figure of 25 per cent. There is a figure in the Budget papers which shows an increase of 22.6 per cent. Let me make it clear that in point of fact even that lower percentage gives a wrong impression of the increase m direct taxes this year. There is an apparent increase of about $2,000m but $540m of that or about 6 percentage points of the increase on the previous year represents the loss of rebates to taxpayers for children. However, at the same time, those taxpayers have received the equivalent sum- all but a few dollars either way- in additional, family allowances as a straight transfer from tax to family allowances. So in any reasonable assessment of what has happened to direct taxes this year, that has to be allowed for that $540m which is a straight transfer from tax to child family allowances. That is at least 6 percentage points of the increase about which the honourable member for Oxley spoke. </para>
          <para>Then indeed, there is the Medibank levy. It is estimated in the 9 months of this financial year to be about $250m or another 3 percentage points of the increase. There we have 9 percentage points of this alleged 22.6 per cent increase, leaving an effective increase of 14 per cent in direct taxes. That, of course, reflects the Government's move to index taxes. With earnings anticipated to go up about 12 per cent and an increase of 2 per cent in employment we expect tax receipts to go up 14 per cent and that is the result. If it had not been for the Government's indexing of taxes, that increase would have been much larger. In fact, it would have been of the order of $ 1,000m larger. The taxpayers of Australia need to appreciate that this Government by indexing taxes, in other words by adjusting tax scales to take account of the impact of continuing inflation, has reduced its take of taxation by in excess of $ 1,000m. The honourable member, having criticised the Government for this increase in taxation, then went ahead and castigated, presumably, the Commonwealth Statistician- it is not this Government's task to construct the consumer price index- for the intention, which he alleges, of treating the levy as taxation- something which he himself was doing 5 minutes ago. </para>
          <para>But I lose time on the substantive issue, which is the allegation by the Opposition that there are undesirable economic and, in particular, inflationary consequences in the changes that we have made to medical insurance. I remind the House that this Government has a strategy which is to ensure lasting economic recovery, a resumption of growth and thrust in the economy, and full employment. The major prong of that strategy is to combat inflation. </para>
          <para>I take this opportunity to reassert that. Because inflation itself is a main if not the principal cause of unemployment, therefore, if we want to combat unemployment and restore thrust and growth to the economy we have to beat inflation, ur policy against inflation has several major prongs. One of them, of course, is to get hold of public spending and the deficit in the public accounts which had soared out of all proportion under the previous Government. Accordingly it is a major part of our policy to get hold of public spending. Along with that of course goes our objective of minimising taxation. Far from being a government that is a high taxer, as the honourable member for Oxley suggested, this Government has, as I have said, implemented legislation to index taxes which means keeping them down in an inflationary context. We want to go further than that. We do not want to stop just at indexing, which limits the increase; we want to achieve actual reductions in the total of taxation and accordingly in the total of public revenue available. </para>
          <para>In these circumstances the whole thrust and principle of our approach in the health insurance field can be set out. It is this: Where we have this thrust to contain rising taxation and indeed to reduce it so that there is limited public revenue, it is important that that limited revenue be used to the maximum advantage. So the thrust of our health care proposals has been that those who can afford to pay for their health insurance should do so. After all health care is as fundamental as food, clothing, motor cars or anything else. So those who can alford to pay for their health insurance should do so thereby making available the maximum of the limited public funds that are available- we are trying to cut down on the total of taxation- to help those who cannot afford their own insurance, to help those in need. Consequently we designed these arrangements to ensure that those who can afford to do so pay the full cost or near the full cost of their health insurance. </para>
          <para>Who can afford to pay is a question that is open to judgment. But we found on looking at the matter that the full cost of this health insurance was of the order of $300 a year. We judged that that is something that a person on $12,000 a year ought to be able to afford-$300 of $ 12,000 is 2 te per cent. So we said: 'OK. Those people on incomes of $12,000 a year and upwards will pay the full or substantially the full cost of their health care'. They were offered a family Medibank package of $300. Those who receive incomes below $12,000 pay <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent, that is, less than $300. Those on very low incomes pay nothing at all. That was the thinking. The effect of course is that those Australians receiving $12,000 a year and upwards in effect pay substantially the full cost of their health care. Below that level the Government picks up a substantial share of the tab. In fact over much of that range the position is that the income earner is paying about 20 per cent of the cost of his health care; in the upper income levels the figure is in excess of 80 per cent. That is how we believe it should be. In this way it is possible to minimise the cost of this on the public funds. So as a result of these proposals that we have implemented the cost to the taxpayer of the general scheme has been reduced by something in excess of $800m. </para>
          <para>Let me stress that from general tax revenue something of the order of $ 1,000m is still contributed to the cost of health insurance. But the cost to the general revenue is reduced by in excess of $800m. I draw attention to the fact that even with this arrangement the deficit that we have budgeted for is of the order of $2,600m. There are continuous difficulties in effectively financing that in a non-inflationary way, and it is a very significant result that the cost in this regard could be reduced by the order I have suggested. I repeat that the arrangements as we have drawn them up result in the fact that those in need and those who cannot afford to pay are substantially assisted from the public purse. Meanwhile it is worth noting that albeit there is this payment from private income- it was expressed in various emotive ways by the honourable member for Oxley as being equivalent to this or equivalent to that- it is not a significant amount in the total of private personal consumption spending which is in excess of $40,000m. It is not the payment for health care, but the lack of confidence as a result of the inflation and unemployment that were bequeathed to this Government from the previous administra.tion that has held back consumption expenditure. As this Government succeeds in getting the situation under control consumption spending will go ahead. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Edwards)</inline> commented earlier in his contribution that there is no such thing as a free meal. I agree. Of course there is not. He spent a lot of his time then trying somehow to prove in some devious way that there might be such a thing. He made the point, I thought that the whole thrust of the Government's plan was to decrease the cost on public funds and hence reduce the cost to taxpayers. Bully for the Government. That is perfectly correct except for one problem: Taxpayers unfortunately in this country happen to be people. People get sick. People still have to pay their medical bills. Theoretically it is the Government's claim that taxpayers may not pay so much now, but I will dispute that in a moment. What the people do not pay via their taxation they still must pay out of their pockets when they are sick. I agree that there is no such thing as a free meal. The honourable member has juggled the figures. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us examine the total cost. It does not matter a damn to the average citizen really whether he pays via his taxation or out of his own pocket. If die sum total he pays for health services is more now than what he was paying when we organised the scheme he is losing. The Government has imposed a levy. It was claimed that the Government did not believe in increasing taxes, that it wanted to reduce the cost to the taxpayers and so on. So the Government imposed a levy. That is not a tax, but no one can escape it. Everyone has to pay it. Whether it is called a tax or not is irrelevant; it is a tax. The levy was the clever way adopted by the present Government to increase taxes. It did that without saying that it was its intention to increase taxes. The rub is that the levy is less socially equitable than the direct taxation system that was used by the Labor Government to raise a similar sum of money. This Government has imposed a levy on taxable income. I will not go into it here. Honourable members may work it out with a pencil and paper. The figures will not show - </para>

If we take these aspects together, given that a set sum of money must be found- we are not arguing about that factor at the moment- whatever that sum is, this Government's system ensures that more of that money required for the scheme comes from the poorer section of the community than from the richer section of the community. That is not social equity; that is not helping this Government out of its present economic mess. It is making the situation worse. Let us come to the crucial question - </para>

              <para>-The Labor Government helped the needy. Those who were needy were covered by us. Everybody was covered by Medibank. Do not come up with that nonsense. The Government has simply made the situation worse for those who are a bit above the needy line but well below the rich line. The actions of this Government have made the burden much more difficult for those people. Let us look in real terms at the total cost to the community of this Government's health scheme. Let us look at taxation charges, benefits payments to the private funds and what a person must pay from his or her pocket. Let us sum all of these payments together. What then is the effect of the intervention by this Government? I suggest that it is disastrous. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I make that claim, first, in terms of business efficiency. The Medibank computer was able to handle, at 4 per cent administrative cost, all of the claims for medical benefits and hospital benefits that came to it. Some hospitals benefits claims still went through the private funds. So, in that period when Medibank was doing much of the job of the private funds, the administrative costs of those private funds were still at approximately IS per cent while Medibank 's administrative costs were approximately 4 per cent. That does not smell like inefficient government service. Despite that fact, this Government is now forcing a large proportion of the community out of Medibank, away from the organisation with overhead administrative costs of 4 per cent into the arms of private organisations with overhead administrative costs of IS per cent. How, may I ask, does that save money, given that the doctor or the hospital concerned still has to receive the same amount of money in the end? In other words, the taxpayer or citizen must find 10 per cent more to pay the same bills under this Government's system. </para>
          <para>I turn next to the bulk billing arrangements. Under Medibank, our Government provided bulk billing arrangements so that, for the poor that is, those who could not afford the payments -or for those doctors who were prepared to bulk bill and were not bothered to charge any moiety, which is the beautiful term used and which means a mark-up for the doctors, there was a facility by which charges could be levied directly on Medibank. A great deal of administrative nonsense was saved. A doctor who bulk billed did not need to send accounts to patients. There was no necessity for claims to be made for rebates. All of this was done simply by a doctor sending an account to Medibank from which he received a cheque in payment. This Government has changed that system. Medibank is still in existence. But this Government now permits those doctors who bulk bill also to charge their patients the balance, that is, the difference between the bulk billing payment and the doctor's fee. Under our scheme, a doctor who bulk billed was not able to charge that balance. This Government allows that practice. One does not need to be terribly clever to know what will happen. Most doctors will use the bulk billing facility when they think it suits them and it pays them. In addition, they will charge the patients the extra portion of the bill. So, most doctors in my view will charge the difference, which is 15 per cent, allowing for the fact that there is an 85 per cent rebate on the common fee - </para>

              <para>-They will charge the gap, or $5, whichever it may be- that was the figure under the Labor Government also- with the result that whatever was the saving that we achieved under our scheme, represented by the difference between what a doctor received by bulk billing and what was the common fee at that time, will be an additional charge imposed upon doctor's patients. I repeat that this will arise because in my view- and I am sure practice has shown this to be the case- most doctors will charge the gap. What is worse, some doctors are even charging pensioners in this way. Fortunately, not all of them are doing this. I do not believe that most doctors are in that category. But there are some unpleasant members of the medical professions who are using this loophole which this Government has provided them. They are now charging pensioners who must find whatever money is needed to meet the gap. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I move from that aspect to consider what seems to be the whole point of this exercise, that is, to enshrine and to boost the whole concept of fee for service medical practice, and to guarantee its survival. In his second reading speech on the relevant legislation, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> when dealing with this aspect said that the Government was taking this action to ensure that private medical practice would survive and in the ope that the Government's action would encourage the doctors therefore to provide the equivalent of what were once honorary services to hospitals. This is not happening. The doctors are not taking the bait. The doctors are demanding payment. In more and more cases, they are demanding fee for service payment in hospitals. They are greedily grabbing at all of the fee for service facilities that have been provided by this Government's distorted Medibank plan. I have claimed, and often claimed, that that is what bumps up medical costs. </para>
          <para>In this respect, let me quote a survey to demonstrate my claim. I know that we are not Americans but we are people. I do not believe that doctors in Australia are fundamentally different from doctors in America. I do not believe that people in Australia are fundamentally much different from people in America. A study was carried out recently on contrasts in health maintenance organisations and fee for service performance. A whole group of these organisations were analysed in this study which was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Social Security Bulletin</inline> of May 1976. </para>
          <para>In essence, first of all a check was made on the claim that all healthy people belonged to health maintenance organisations. The study found that there was no significant difference between patients belonging to health maintenance organisations and the general community. The same number of chronically ill patients were found in both areas. The study checked on whether people who contributed to health maintenance organisations were more health conscious. The study found that this was not so. The levels in either group seemed the same. What were the differences? Hospital care is the area where all the operations are done and to which the large bills are attached. Hospital use was two-and-a-half times lower in group practice plans where doctors were on a salary compared with hospital use by doctors working on a fee for service basis. There is the answer to the problem. The surgical rate of group practices and salaried doctors was half the rate where doctors wanted fee for service. Anywhere one looks, at whatever time one tries to analyse the figures, the claim that if people have something seemingly for nothing and therefore the sky is the limit is found to be nonsense. A patient cannot operate on himself; he cannot write his own prescription. The patient depends on his doctor for these things. The only freedom that the patient has is to visit his doctor. If there is too much medical care, too many drugs prescribed, or too many operations undertaken, that is the direct responsibility of the doctor, encouraged by the fee for service technique. That is what this Government is encouraging. I assure the Minister that costs will soar enormously. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>before I go on to develop my argument in support of the changes that this Government has made, I wish to answer two or three of the points that have been made in this debate. The honourable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> said that everyone pays the levy. That is not correct. This may have been a sweeping statement that he made generally. But 75 per cent of our pensioners who have health benefit cards do not pay the levy. Those people on the lowest incomes do not pay the levy, so the ceiling is not a burden on the poor, because the poor do not pay the levy. Without a ceiling what would be the position? The Government looked at the possibility of applying a levy without a ceiling. We found that this would be most severe on 2-income families. Sixty per cent of Australian families would be worse off under the plan submitted by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which proposed a 1.6 per cent levy without a ceiling. So let us not assume that the without-ceiling concept provides a more equitable system to a greater number of people. I do not believe that it does. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With respect to the increasing charges to which the honourable member has referred, I point out that even under his former Medibank scheme 70 per cent of Australians remained privately insured for hospital cover, so there was a cost in respect of the operations of those insurance schemes operated by the private health insurance funds. But one fact is certain: Now that we have a competitor in the market- I refer to Medibank Private with all its efficiency in the field- competition will be provided amongst all of the private health insurance funds. Perhaps we shall see more efficiency in the area of the administration of private health insurance. </para>
          <para>I think the Opposition believes in the old adage that memories are short. It is rather hypocritical for the Opposition to launch a campaign against the Government on the grounds of its bad economic management. Early in January this year we began an in-depth survey of the economic prospects in this country and it became abundantly clear that we had a very grim scene in front of us. We had inherited a monumental mess. The honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> who proposed this matter for discussion, was the third Treasurer in 6 months. I think he was unfortunate as a Treasurer because he too inherited a monumental mess and one of the greatest examples of economic mismanagement in our time. It soon became clear that if the expenditure rate had continued we would have had a Budget deficit of no less than $5,000m in that financial year, and the forward estimates for this financial year would have been even greater. Therefore, consistent with the Government's objective, we decided that inflation had to be checked and government expenditure reined in where possible. This required some urgent, hard and, to some extent, unpopular decisions. There was no other responsible way out. </para>
          <para>We inherited an inflation rate of about 15 per cent and the worst unemployment since the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the business and industrial sector had been drained of confidence. In attacking the budgetary situation, which one has to attack if one is serious about trying to overcome the inflationary situation, we found that there were 4 ways of reducing the overall Budget deficit. The first was to increase taxation, but we decided that we did not want to do that. The second was to print more money. A former Treasurer tried to do that, but was not successful. The third was to reduce the rate of increase in government spending, and we chose that course. The fourth was to borrow money to try to overcome the problem. We chose the third option which meant that we would prune back the overgrown bushes of public expenditure, hoping for some self-sustained spring growth. Against the general background of economic disorder, we looked at the exploding health treatment costs and the efficiency of universal health insurance in its existing form. We set up a Medibank Review Committee which went to work in January this year. It had very wide ranging terms of reference against 3 important criteria: Medibank and universal health insurance were to be retained and there was to be no means test at the point of service to the patient. We were mindful of what such schemes had done to the economies of the United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere where there was no restraint on costs. We wanted to ensure that Medibank did not consume the social dollar. Quite clearly, it had an appetite to do so. </para>
          <para>As part of our overall economic appraisal we turned to health care costs in a substantial way and we found that health care costs in Australia were exploding at an even faster rate than the record inflation. Without our changes the total government and private health treatment and health care costs for this financial year were estimated to be $5,400m. That is an enormous sum when compared with the value of iron, wool, coal, wheat and meat exports, which were valued at $4,500m for the previous financial year. Hospital and medical costs were estimated to be $3,320m this year. We estimated that the cost of Medibank itself would reach the order of $2,000m which would be a direct burden upon Consolidated Revenue. We also found that over a period of 1 1 years the Commonwealth share of health costs had increased by 10 times, from $260m in 1963-64 to $2,500m in 1975-76. There were allegations of rip-offs, overuse and abuse. Some doctors were even complaining that they had doubled their incomes in the first 12 months of the operation of Medibank. We had the open ended hospital cost sharing agreements with the States, with no opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to have any say in the Budgets or the variations thereto. </para>
          <para>So Medibank Mark 1 had achieved universal health coverage, but in the characteristic style of the former Government it was at the expense of disregarding economy and efficiency. It provided few incentives to economy by individuals or the medical profession. It placed on the State and Federal governments virtually the whole burden of basic medical and hospital financing, not just for those needing assistance but also for those who could afford to make a greater contribution. </para>
          <para>It threatened the continuance of private medical practice in hospitals. About 70 per cent of the population continued to privately insure, indicating that this was a trend that the Australian people were anxious to preserve. Public hospital charges were uneconomic and unrealistic. </para>
          <para>After a full inquiry 2 things became clear. The first was that changes needed to be made to constrain costs, to give incentives to keep costs down, to encourage efficiency in the State hospitals and to push ahead with preventive medicine and health and community programs. The latter is something to which I hope the Government will be turning more attention in the future. Secondly, it became clear that financing other than just out of the general tax pool was absolutely necessary. I think the Government, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions were agreed on that principle. The point at issue was the way in which we applied the levy. We decided on an optional system because we believed that we would be able to create a competitive situation, particularly with respect to private medical practitioners. We believe that, in restructuring Medibank and universal insurance in the way we have, we have not been inequitable to the lower income people. At the same time we have given an incentive to the private practitioners of this country to be careful ow they raise their fees, because if their fees rise faster than average weekly earnings quite clearly the premiums will go up and people will leave their private insurance funds and stay with Medibank Standard which will be the lowest cost, quality health care insurance. </para>

          <para class="block">The major purpose of this and associated Bills I shall shortly introduce is to give effect to the Government's income tax initiatives announced in my Budget Speech. The Bill also contains provisions relating to other aspects of the income tax law. One of the Budget proposals dealt with in this Bill, and in two of the associated Bills, is the scheme of income equalisation deposits being established for the benefit of primary producers. The scheme will provide valuable assistance to companies and individuals who carry on business as primary producers and whose incomes can, because of seasonal and market conditions, vary considerably from one year to the next. The income equalisation deposits scheme will encourage primary producers to make deposits in years in which their incomes are high and thus provide funds to draw on when incomes fall. In this way the scheme will have a stabilising effect on the levels of rural incomes and expenditures. Provisions governing the financial aspects of the scheme are embodied in an associated Bill entitled the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Bill 1976. As those provisions, together with the amendments being made by this Bill to the Income Tax Assessment Act, are explained in detail in a memorandum I have arranged to be circulated, I think I need do no more for the present than refer to some general features of the scheme. </para>
          <para>The incentive for primary producers to make financial provision under the scheme is to be found mainly in the income tax deductions that will be allowable for moneys deposited. Conversely, proceeds received on the withdrawal of deposits for which tax deductions have been allowed are to be treated as assessable income for taxation purposes. The scheme will be available for companies and individuals who, in income tax parlance, are engaged in a business of primary production. This includes farming, grazing and other rural activities and the carrying on of fishing or forest operations. Moneys deposited under the scheme will be borrowings by the Commonwealth and Loan Council approval has been obtained for this. Deposits will be accepted by the Commissioner of Taxation, to whom applications to withdraw moneys are also to be made. Interest, initially at the rate of S per cent per annum, will be payable on deposits. The interest rate will be variable by regulation. </para>
          <para>Following enactment of this legislation, deposits that are lodged with the Commissioner not later than 3 1 January 1977 will, within the limits provided in the legislation, be allowable as tax deductions against income of the 197S-76 income year. Deposits lodged after 31 January 1977 and not later than 31 August 1977 will be deductible in respect of income of the year ending 30 June 1977. Thereafter, deposits made in the period of 12 months ending 31 August of each year will be deductible against income of the year ending on the preceding 30 June. For a taxpayer whose accounting period for income tax purposes ends on a date other than 30 June, the 12 months period will end 2 months after the close of the particular accounting period. </para>
          <para>Deposits may be made by any individual or company but income tax deductions will be available only to depositors who carry on a business of primary production in Australia, or are partners or beneficiaries entitled to share in income from such a business carried on by a partnership or trust estate. An infant beneficiary who is presently entitled to a share in primary production income of a deceased estate may qualify for deductions for deposits made by the trustee of the estate out of the beneficiary's share of the estate 's income. </para>
          <para>Deposits relating to any particular income year will be allowable as tax deductions up to an amount equal to 40 per cent of the depositor's gross income receipts for the year from primary production activities. The deduction allowable in any assessment, however, will be no greater than the depositor's taxable income from sources other than property. The total accumulated deductions at any one time, allowable to a depositor in respect of amounts lodged under the scheme or as drought bonds, will be subject to an upper limit of $ 100,000. </para>
          <para>As a general rule an amount for which a tax deduction is allowable under the scheme must remain on deposit for at least 12 months. A deposit may, however, be withdrawn within 12 months if the taxpayer is experiencing serious financial difficulties caused by circumstances not in existence when the deposit was made. A depositor seeking to withdraw an amount within 12 months of lodgment will be required to satisfy the Commissioner of the grounds on which the application is based. If the Commissioner is not satisfied, the matter is, on the taxpayer's request, to be referred to a Taxation Board of Review for consideration. </para>
          <para>Amounts deposited in respect of the 1975-76 income year, that is, not later than 3 1 January 1977, can be withdrawn at any time if the taxpayer is experiencing serious financial difficulties, whether or not the difficulties are due to conditions that existed at the time that the deposits were made. These special arrangements recognise that drought conditions may have been experienced by primary producers since 31 August 1976, which would have been the last day for making deposits in respect of the 1975-76 income year if the scheme had then been in operation. </para>
          <para>An amount deposited and withdrawn by a primary producer before the end of the period in which a deposit may be made in respect of a particular year will not be allowable as a tax deduction. So, for example, if a primary producer places an amount on deposit on 5 January 1977 and, on or before 31 January 1977, lodges an application to withdraw it on grounds of serious financial difficulty, a deduction will not be allowable against 1975-76 income if the deposit is returned. </para>
          <para>Where an application to withdraw deposits is lodged, or where a depositor dies, becomes bankrupt or, being a company, begins to be wound up, the relevant amounts- to the extent of the income tax deductions that have been allowed- are to be included as assessable income. Generally speaking, the amounts will be treated as income derived in the year in which the application to withdraw is lodged. In cases involving death, bankruptcy or winding up proceedings, however, the amounts will be treated as assessable income of the tax period ending on the date of the relevant event. Amounts allowable as deductions in respect of deposits, or amounts included in assessable income as a consequence of withdrawals, will not be taken into account in ascertaining provisional tax payable. </para>
          <para>Primary producers will, of course, continue to be able to apply for recalculation of provisional tax on the basis of estimated taxable income. With the introduction of the new income equalisation deposits scheme, there will be no need to continue the earlier drought bond scheme and it is to be wound up. Present holders of drought bonds for which tax deductions have been allowed will be permitted to convert their holdings to income equalisation deposits, without any immediate tax consequences. </para>
          <para>I turn now to other extensive provisions of the Bill which propose to change very significantly the basis on which deductions are allowable for the major capital expenditures of general mining and petroleum mining enterprises. I indicated in my Budget Speech that the Government intends to promote a healthy and efficient minerals sector and at the same time ensure that a fair balance is struck between the levels of income tax payable by the mining industry and by other industries. In reaching the decisions affecting mining enterprises that are to be implemented by the Bill, the Government gave close consideration to the report of the Industries Assistance Commission that dealt with the income tax arrangements for the mining industry. Deductions available for capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oil field, on the provision of community facilities adjacent to a mine or field, or on the purchase of mining rights or information, that currently are allowable over the estimated life of the mine or field will, for new expenditures, be allowable on reducing balances, by reference to a maximum life of 5 years instead of 25 years. This will increase the minimum annual rate of deduction from 4 per cent to 20 per cent. </para>
          <para>New exploration and prospecting expenditure incurred in searching for petroleum, and the life of field deductions for allowable capital expenditure on the development of a petroleum field, will henceforth be deductible against assessable income derived from any source by the person incurring the expenditure. New capital expenditures on facilities for the transport of minerals, including oil and natural gas, that are now deductible over 20 years will, at the option of the taxpayer, be deductible over either 10 years or 20 years. In addition, the classes of eligible expenditure on transport facilities for this purpose will be expanded to include certain capital expenditures of a non-plant character that are incurred in providing port facilities in relation to the transport of minerals, including petroleum. Each of the amendments proposed m relation to the taxation of the mining sector is to apply in respect of new expenditures incurred after Budget day- 1 7 August 1 976. </para>
          <para>The Bill also gives effect to 2 Budget proposals relating to the dividend distribution requirements of the income tax law. With the needs of small businesses particularly in mind, it is proposed to lower the minimum distribution required to be made by private companies to avoid tax on undistributed income, by increasing- from 50 per cent to 60 per cent- the proportion of after-tax business income that a company may retain. It is not proposed to vary the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to provide a retention allowance for dividends that one private company receives from another. Private companies will benefit from the increased retention allowance in their undistributed income tax assessments in respect of income of the 1975-76 income year. </para>
          <para>The Bill also proposes to terminate the excess distribution provisions that enable a private company that has paid more in dividends than the undistributed income tax formula requires for an income year to take credit for the excess in calculating the minimum distribution that it is required to make in respect of its income of a later year. The Government has received representations urging that, on one view or another, it should not proceed with this proposal, but after careful consideration we remain of the view that the case for terminating the excess distribution provisions is a compelling one. To a substantial degree, the dividend policies of private companies are in conformity with the dividend distribution requirements of the income tax law so that no more is paid in dividends than is needed to avoid a liability for undistributed income tax. Most of the existing excess distributions are the products of various kinds of tax minimisation arrangements and the continued availability of the amounts would benefit relatively few private companies not associated with arrangements made to exploit the distribution provisions. </para>
          <para>Sophisticated arrangements of shareholdings within private company groups have been devised to circumvent the very complex measures that have been enacted to reduce tax avoidance by private company interests. There can be no certainty that further changes in the excess distribution provisions would, given the nature of the situations to be dealt with and the quite bewildering complexity of this area of the law, hold out any greater assurance of success than the amendments made as recently as 1973. But in any event, the situation created by the increase now proposed in the retention allowance- when considered in conjunction with the effects of other income tax initiatives that have been taken by the Government or are proposed- provides a strong case for terminating the excess distribution provisions. </para>
          <para>With the retention allowance for business income raised to 60 per cent, a level of 40 per cent of taxable income less tax is about the limit to which a private company's sufficient distribution could be reduced without adversely affecting the role of the provisions of the tax law designed to ensure that private companies distribute some reasonable amount of after-tax profits as dividends to shareholders. Continued availability of excess distribution credits would adversely affect revenue in the same way as an increase in private company retention allowance levels, but with the benefits accruing almost exclusively to persons who had devised ways of circumventing basic distribution requirements of the law. </para>
          <para>Being satisfied that the need for the excess distribution concepts no longer exists, the Government is taking the only practical course open to it. The provisions are, accordingly, to be terminated so that excess distributions will not be available in determining whether private companies have paid sufficient amounts by way of dividends in respect of income derived during the income year ending 30 June 1977. For a company which ends its financial year on 30 June, the effect of the termination arrangement will be to permit any available excess distribution to be taken into account in measuring the sufficient distribution required to be made by 30 April 1977. No excess distribution will, however, be reflected in the calculation of the distribution required to be made during the 12 months period ending 30 April 1978, or in any subsequent distribution period. </para>
          <para>Another provision of the Bill will give effect to the announcement I made last month of the Government's decision to exempt from tax the income derived by the Thalidomide Foundation as trustee for thalidomide afflicted children. As a consequence of the exemption each of the children will be exempt from tax on his or her share in the income of the Foundation. </para>
          <para>Mineral exploration expenditure in Papua New Guinea is another subject dealt with by the Bill. Subject to some transitional rules, the right to deduct such expenditure was withdrawn in 197S when that country became independent. We have since agreed, as had the previous Government, to a request by Papua New Guinea that the life of the transitional provisions be extended. The extension will permit deductions for exploration expenditure incurred up to 30 June 1978 in pursuance of exploration rights held at the time of Papua New Guinea 's independence. </para>
          <para>A technical amendment is also being made to the definition of 'Resident of Australia' for income tax purposes. One part of this definition has long treated as an Australian resident a person who is, or is a designated dependant of, a contributor to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. Because the recent change in superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth officers had led to the constitution of a new fund, it is necessary to bring up to date the references in the definition to people who are contributors to the Superannuation Fund. </para>
          <para>Another measure in the Bill terminates as from 1 July last the residual application of the tax concessions for visiting industrial experts that, subject to some phasing-out rules, had been withdrawn in 1973. This final termination was announced in June and follows the decision to abolish a grants scheme that had in 1973 been substituted for the former tax concessions. As mentioned earlier, an explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill is available to honourable members providing detailed explanations of the provisions of this and 3 related Bills and makes it unnecessary for me to dwell on the provisions at the present time. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This is the second of 3 Bills designed to give legislative effect to the Government's decision to establish a scheme of income equalisation deposits for the benefit of primary producers. As I have already explained features of the deposit scheme in speaking to the Bill that has just been introduced, I need refer only briefly to the purposes of this measure. </para>
          <para>The provisions of the Bill are basically in line with other loan raising laws although there are some differences because of the particular nature of the deposits. First, the proceeds of income equalisation deposits are to be transferred to a new trust account established by the Bill. Secondly, because the Commonwealth, in accepting deposits does not issue securities, the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act will not apply. Thirdly, because of income tax implications, the deposits will not be transferable from one person to another. </para>
          <para>The Bill appoints the Commissioner of Taxation as the person authorised to determine requests for withdrawal of deposits and authorises him to declare, in certain prescribed circumstances, that deposits have become repayable. Depositors are given a right to have a request for withdrawal referred to a board of review if it is refused by the Commissioner. Honourable members will have detailed explanations of the Bill's provisions in the memorandum circulated on this and associated measures. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill will impose income tax for the 1976-77 financial year, at the rates declared in the Bill, on the 1975-76 incomes of companies and the 1976-77 incomes of superannuation funds. The rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees for the 1976-77 financial year were, of course, enacted earlier this year when personal income tax indexation was introduced. The rates of tax declared by this Bill do not vary from those declared for the 1975-76 financial year. </para>
          <para>For companies, and for superannuation funds that are taxable only because of a failure to observe the 30-20 investment rules, the rate is again 42.5 per cent. For superannuation funds that fail to comply with other exemption requirements, the rate is again 50 per cent. So too is the rate of additional tax payable by private companies that do not make a sufficient distribution of profits. Notes on the Bill are included in an explanatory memorandum being made available to honourable members and I do not think that there is any need for me to go into further detail at this introductory stage. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">In response to a question from the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> on 4 November 1976 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> agreed to consider establishing a select committee of the House to look into tourism. Honourable members will be aware that some segments of the tourist industry have been experiencing difficult trading conditions. It is an industry which is particularly susceptible to fluctuations in levels of economic activity. The problems of the industry are exacerbated by the increasing number of Australians travelling overseas. The latest figures available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that during 1975-76 Australians spent $5 19m travelling overseas while overseas visitors spent $255m in Australia. The Government's decision to devalue will, of course, assist in narrowing the gap between travel debits and credits. </para>
          <para>The tourist industry is an important industry. It is a significant employer of labour, employing up to 5 per cent of the work force. It is important to State economies, particularly Tasmania and Queensland. It is the life blood of some regions. The Gold Coast and the Snowy Mountains are but 2 examples of this. Tourism has important social implications. It is a means by which Australians as well as overseas visitors can learn more about our country and our heritage. It is a worthwhile means of using increasing hours of leisure. In short, the many facets of this important and growing industry contribute to the Australian economy through: Urban and rural development; decentralisation; new and expanded employment outlets; contribution to foreign exchange earnings; avenues for profitable short and long term investment; a contribution to education; new avenues for improving community health and welfare, both physical and mental; a deeper understanding of different cultural standards and community attitudes; and a wider base for international understanding and goodwill. It is against this background that the Government has decided to establish a select committee to inquire into the industry. Acting on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> I have put down the terms of reference. </para>
          <para>The terms of reference are broad and the task is of some magnitude. It is difficult therefore to set a firm deadline for the committee to complete its inquiries and prepare a report. However, I am sure we can rely on the enthusiasm of the members of the committee to complete their task as quickly as possible. Because of the involvement of Commonwealth, State and local governments in tourism, specific mention has been made in the terms of reference of the responsibilities of the 3 levels of government. Honourable members may know that last September the Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed a Government Members Committee on Tourism under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> This Committee has been working most diligently and has received many submissions. Its report is due to be completed before the end of the year. I feel sure that its findings will be of interest and of considerable use to the select committee. I commend the motion to the House. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The Opposition welcomes the move by the Government to establish this select committee on tourism. We welcome the recognition by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> that it was moves from this side of the House which brought this committee into being. It has been because of the active participation in this House by the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> and the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> that we see some glimmer of hope for the tourist industry. I also pay due respect to the unwanted member of the Cabinet- as he was after the election last yearSenator Peter Rae because of the work he has contributed to the tourist industry of Australia. Nevertheless a number of things regarding the tourist industry have been ignored. We have ignored them for so long that perhaps this select committee can come up with some of the answers. I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House because following me will be honourable members to whose superior knowledge I bow- for example, the former Minister for Tourism and Recreation. It is the intention of the Opposition to move an amendment to paragraph 16 of the motion. In that paragraph the Government proposes that the committee should report as soon as possible. We on this side of the House believe that the date on which the committee should conclude its work should be stipulated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>No shortage of information is available to people interested in the tourist industry. I understand that the honourable member for Lang will go through, item by item, the sorts of documents which have been made available or which were tabled during the period of the Whitlam Government. The recommendations and information made available to the people of Australia and to parliamentarians only need condensing for this committee to bring back a very swift report. A number of difficulties are associated with the tourist industry, and devaluation will not overcome all of them. The tourist industry is still finding it difficult, as are many other industries which depend upon such a large content of female labour, because of the decision taken by our industrial tribunals in relation to equal pay. About 62 per cent of the employees in the tourist industry are females. Obviously, because of the impact of that decision the tourist industry is taking some time to adjust. </para>
          <para>Also in Australia we have the unique position where our major international airline is spending its complete budget convincing people why they ought to leave Australia. Perhaps we should look at a combination of the roles of our airlines in the field of advertising. We should look at the roles of Trans-Australiann Airlines, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Qantas Airways Ltd. It seems rather ridiculous and a contradiction in terms for us to be looking at the tourist industry while we are contributing so much of the taxpayers' money to convincing those taxpayers that they would have a better time and that their money would be better spent outside this country. Obviously, that sort of thing would lend itself to very close investigation by this committee. I do not think that anybody in this Parliament would commence these hearings believing that any select committee of this Parliament will be successful in persuading all those Australians who might want to travel outside the country that it would be a good thing not to do so. What we need to do is to balance what has been occurring over the last three or four years in order that we can persuade a lot of Australian people who are going overseas on their holidays not for the first time but perhaps for the fifth or sixth time that it may be worth while to have some interest in parts of Australia which are unique by international standards and which would be very worth while seeing. </para>
          <para>I believe that a concentration on the importance of tourism inside Australia could bring this about. As I said earlier, there is a multiplicity of reports concerning this matter. There have been reports by the Industries Assistance Commission, the Temporary Assistance Authority and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Investigations have also been undertaken by interdepartmental committees. We are able to obtain all the information concerning this matter quickly. I believe that it would be in the interests of the tourist industry, which has suffered so much recently, for us to be able to stipulate a time when this Parliament would receive a report. It is for that purpose that I move: </para>

        <para class="block">Honourable members will recall the discussion initiated by the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> in this House on 3 November as a matter of public importance that the Government make a commitment to eliminate certain diseases from Aboriginal communities and establish a select committee of the House to this end. In the course of the ensuing debate my colleague, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> expressed the Government's concern at the health problems of Aborigines, particularly such diseases as trachoma and its incidence in central and northern Australia amongst the remote communities. The Minister spoke also of the readiness of the Government to consider the establishment of an appropriate committee to investigate this matter. </para>
        <para>The Government's total funding for health services to Aborigines for 1976-77 is $ 15.9m. In addition to this, special funds of $600,000 have been provided by the Department of Health and my Department for a task force to conduct a pilot study to deal with trachoma and eye health amongst Aboriginal communities in central Australia. In the light of the earlier debate and the Government's own desire to seek a closer study of problems associated with eliminating diseases in Aboriginal communities, the Government has now decided that these problems of Aboriginal health should be referred to the Standing Committee of this House on Aboriginal Affairs for examination and to report its recommendations progressively to the Government. The Standing Committee already has in hand a study of alcohol problems amongst Aborigines in the course of which evidence on health factors has been given. It seems more appropriate therefore to build on the present work and developing expertise of the Standing Committee than to establish a new and separate committee to deal with incidences of particular diseases amongst Aboriginals. </para>
        <para>I note that in the third main report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty presented by the Reverend George S. Martin, attention has been drawn to some specific problems in Aboriginal health which require investigation. I expect that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs will therefore find that report of value as well as the Senate Committee's report on environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders which make some specific recommendations on Aboriginal health. Those recommendations are already under study by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition very much welcomes the motion that has been advanced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> and notes that the terms of reference are not limited to the Northern Territory. I take it that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs will be free to investigate Aboriginal health everywhere in Australia- the Kimberleys and elsewhere. This is very important and I hope that the Committee does receive the co-operation of the State authorities which are charged with some aspects of health in their own areas. We are particularly gratified at the wide terms of reference that have been given to the Committee. There is no doubt that there are many diseases which are almost entirely confined to the Aboriginal community. I speak of tuberculosis, yaws, leprosy, hookworm and trachoma. The numbers of people of European background who suffer from any of those diseases would be very few. The number of Aborigines who suffer from them, I understand, is quite large. I agree with the Minister that the latest report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty does give some important leads. I think that paragraph 2 (b) of the Minister's motion is very important. It states: </para>

          <para>Aborigines including traditional healers can participate in the development and delivery of health care services to their own communities, and in any modification of existing services. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I hope that the recommendations will be sensitive to the status of traditional Aboriginal healers. We will have to be careful that we do not intervene in such a way that the health policies of Europeans will reduce the Aboriginal traditional healers to a menial status. The Aborigines have a great respect for their traditional healers. It is very interesting also to note that they have a great respect for older European doctors. I understand that a New Zealander, a senior doctor, who was employed by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress or under its auspices and who is shortly to leave the area, was greatly respected because of his age and also because of his personal qualities. </para>
        <para>The investigation that is suggested here is overdue. We have tended to believe in the past that if we set up facilities for the whole community in the Northern Territory or elsewhere then they were accessible to Aborigines. I understand that the medical service of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress has on its clinic books some 8600 Aborigines which shows that the Aborigines have confidence in the form of medicine which goes to them, and they are more diffident about approaching organisations like hospitals and so on at Alice Springs. Investigation as to how effectively to deliver health care to them, having regard to their traditions and their location, is a matter which I think is overdue. I should like to congratulate the Minister on the motion which he has put before the House. I should like also to express the Opposition's support for and interest in the motion. I am sure that the Opposition members of this Committee will regard it as a tremendous opportunity to serve the Aboriginal people. It will also enable the Aboriginal people to defend their health standards. I hope in the forms of health care that are set up and in the action taken that we will win their cooperation </para>
        <para>The last point I want to make is that I understand that under the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress the Aboriginal people themselves have very much wanted instruction for women and for men in health care. I believe that a <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Helen</inline> Thorn is doing work in this regard as far as the health education of Aboriginal women is concerned. I believe there is now a need for a male doctor to help the men in health education. This is allowed for in the terms of reference and it is one gratifying feature of the Minister's motion. I am quite sure that the motion has the support of this side of the House. </para>

          <para>- I should like to say briefly that the Opposition is happy to see the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> tidy up this legislation because only recently 48 amendments were introduced by the Government. It would have been extremely difficult to deal with the Bill with those amendments as well as the amendments of the Opposition. I should like to add that the Parliament has been disadvantaged further in this matter due to the fact that the consolidated Bill only recently has come into the hands of honourable members. Two copies of the Bill were available to the Opposition last Friday. If there is some difficulty in navigating the progress in the Committee stage of this debate it will be in consequence of the matter I have raised. </para>

          <para>-In supporting my colleague the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> I would like to say first that I think it is sound procedure that the Bill be reprinted in this way. There seems to be a continuing series of muddles when this Government handles legislation of any complicated nature. This is in the almost continuing theme of the Medibank situation. This operation was commenced last year while we were in government. The legislation after being before the House was taken away, redrafted, then amended, then redrafted and then more amendments were made. One of the quaint things about Australian politics is the way this Government managed before it came into power to make it look as though it were a model of efficiency. All I can say is that it is a model for muddling. </para>

          <para>Omit the clause, substitute the following clause: "2. This Act shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation.". </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The reason for adopting this course is that whereas the Act is to come into operation on a date fixed by proclamation, as is mentioned in clause 2, clause 70 is to operate subsequently; not concurrently, but on a later date which is to be fixed for the purpose of sub-clause 1. Clause 70 relates to entry onto Aboriginal lands. This matter gives great concern to the Opposition and to Aboriginal communities all over Australia. Substantially it provides that a person shall not enter or remain on Aboriginal land except in accordance with the law of the Northern Territory. That is the essence of clause 70. When will the regulation be introduced in the Northern Territory? The position that will follow the passing of legislation is that Aboriginal people themselves will not be able to determine the question of entry onto Aboriginal land but at some time in the future the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly will be determining it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward made recommendations on this matter. In paragraph 109 of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, under the heading 'Control of access to Aboriginal land', he stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>One of the most important proofs of genuine Aboriginal ownership of land will be the right to exclude from it those who are not welcome. The Land Councils believe that this principle should be supported by a permit system and I agree with them. I accept the Northern Land Council's view that the system should be administered by the officers of the Land Councils, who would, where necessary, consult with the local community and clan leaders before issuing a permit. </para>

In fact in the debate that occurred in November 1975 after the introduction by the Labor Government of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill the then spokesman for Aboriginal affairs, the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> had quite a bit to say on this matter. He said, as reported on page 2752 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard of</inline> 4 November 1975:  . . Aboriginal groups to which I spoke . . . were emphatic that they wanted to say who came on to their land. They did not want a remote land council telling them what to do and who was to enter their land. As far as I can understand the matter, they also wanted the right to say whether a person should come on, whether that person was an Aboriginal or not. </para>
        <para class="block">Here we have a situation embellished by the support of  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward and the former spokesman on Aboriginal affairs for the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. Yet in this legislation there has been a departure from that concept. Although it was intended that the function be administered by land councils and through them delegated to community councils, we will be substituting a situation which will have the effect that instead of the remote land councils making decisions, remote Darwin-based bureaucrats will be making them. </para>
        <para>We regard this matter with very grave concern. I know that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> in his second reading speech indicated that guidelines are to be provided for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in respect to the laws it is to make on Aboriginal lands. In his statement on 17 November 1976 he said that traditional Aboriginal rights to enter Aboriginal lands must be provided for. He then went on to say: </para>

          <para>The leader of the Legislative Assembly and the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> have assured me that the Territory legislation will be worked out in consultation with Aboriginals and with my involvement and agreement. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It seems to me that to hoist the whole future of entry into Aboriginal land on such a vague assurance is a most unsatisfactory and even contemptuous way of treating this Parliament and this issue. One would go so far as to say that it represents an abrogation of responsibility on the part of this Government and the Parliament as well. </para>
        <para>Perhaps there will be no law at all. The possibility is that the Legislative Assembly might initiate some action about this matter. On the other hand, there is a possibility that no action at all will be instituted. The situation perhaps will be that anyone will be able to enter Aboriginal land. That situation could easily eventuate if the Assembly failed to take action. In terms of the referendum decision that was taken and which clothed this Parliament with power on this subject it is not good enough to bail out on a matter so important for Aboriginal people. As the former Opposition spokesman, the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott),</inline> has said, wherever he sat people felt very strongly about this matter. Those members of the Parliament who are active in Aboriginal affairs would take an identical view. So it seems to me that this is an indication of the Government's intention to hand over the prerogative in this matter to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. If that does not represent white paternalism- in fact, if the whole proposition is for white people to determine who goes on Aboriginal land and if that also does not represent white paternalism- I doubt whether there is a meaningful definition of that phrase. For those reasons, the Opposition has moved its amendment. </para>

          <para>- I wish to discuss the amendment moved by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> As indicated by his speech, there seems to be some misunderstanding throughout the country and certainly within the Australian Labor Party about the role of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in the past and in the future. The honourable member expressed concern that the Legislative Assembly might legislate in some way to deprive Aborigines of the right of access to their own land. He claimed that Aborigines had said that they did not want a remote land council deciding who went onto their land. That is dead right. The Aboriginal people do not want a remote land council- either a central or northern land council- deciding who goes on to their land. As they have stated continually, they would prefer such a decision to be made by their own clan councils. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The honourable member for Hughes went on to say that, by the same token, Aborigines would not welcome decisions being made on this matter by remote Darwin-based bureaucrats. In this regard, he cited the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. He would know that in the course of the last 3 elections for the Legislative Assembly and its predecessor, the Northern Territory Legislative Council, one of the platforms on which the Country-Liberal Party stood related to the Aboriginal control of entry on to their land, that is, reserves. The policy of the Australian Labor Party at that time in the Northern Territory was to do away with the entry permit system. He and the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant),</inline> as former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, would know that that was the case. In elections for the former Legislative Council, that proposition from the Labor Party was defeated. The Labor members of the Council were not successful. In the election following the creation of the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory, no Labor candidates were returned to that body. It was the Country-Liberal Party in the Northern Territory which defended the right of Aborigines to decide who went on to their land. It was not the Legislative Assembly or the bureaucrats who decided that matter. </para>
        <para>The system was that a person seeking entry on to Aboriginal land would send a telegram to the council concerned. The telegram did not go to the northern land council, but to the local Aboriginal council, which would be, for example, the Goulburn Island Council, the Oenpelli Council or the Millingimbie Council. A telegram or note was sent to the appropriate council saying that the sender wished to go on to that council 's land. The council communicated its response through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I want this matter to be put straight. Again and again I have heard in this Parliament and have read in newspapers that it is the Northern Territory </para>
        <para class="block">Legislative Assembly which decides who goes on to Aboriginal land. Members of that Assembly fought for the entry permit system to remain in the hands of the traditional owners through the local councils. I take this opportunity to put the record straight. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Chairman,</inline>I cannot understand why the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> wants to hold up passage of clause 70. This clause has to do with entry on to land. The honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> has said that everybody is in agreement that this land ought to be under control of the Aboriginal people. Yet we find that the Government proposes to suspend clause 70 so that the proclamation enacting this legislation may go forward. I think that, in a way, this action will emasculate the Bill. Why is it that we must wait now after 13 years or more since the first shots were fired on land rights in this Parliament? The honourable member for the Northern Territory will forgive us if, on this side of the Committee, we have a reasonable suspicion that the National Country Party is not all that dedicated to the principle of land rights for Aboriginal people. The honourable member may forgive us, then, if we think that the Legislative of the Northern Territory is not a reliable protector of those interests. </para>

            <para>-One of the reasons why I say that emphatically is the behaviour in the past of people like the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> on these matters. He has always acted as though the land rights of Aboriginal people could be transcended, for instance, by miners. I think the real issue here is the timing of the legislation. What is the point of legislation being brought forward here in relation to matters which have been under consideration for so long and which have been before the Parliament for so long, when the proposal now is to leave out what is an important part of that legislation? Even if for the time being there is to be no consideration of malfeasance- if that is the appropriate word- on the part of the Minister and his minions in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, that does not do the legislation any good. I wish to see the Opposition 's amendment agreed to and written into the Act so that this legislation will be proclaimed as a whole. If that happens, we will be able to get on with the job. </para>

        <para>A further point arises. The responsibility for the carriage and implementation of this legislation lies fairly and squarely on this Parliament. </para>
        <para class="block">This is a national question to be resolved by the national Parliament. I believe that the entry of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory into this arena is an aberration of some magnitude. I hope that the Minister will take the bit between his teeth and ensure that all of the contents of the Bill are proclaimed as an Act at the same time. </para>

          <para>-The situation as I understand it from reading this clause if that there is a very necessary time lag between the proclamation of the Bill generally and the establishment of land councils as proposed in this Bill. The establishment of those councils will enable the provisions of clause 70 to be put into effect, to operate and to achieve its purpose. There are already certain limitations upon the right of entry on to Aboriginal land which are administered through the Social Welfare Ordinance of the Northern Territory. So, for the time being, the rights of individuals to go on to Aboriginal land are already restricted and the exercise of those rights is capable of being restricted by the operation of that ordinance. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Until this Bill becomes law following its proclamation and until the councils are established this involves a time lag- and are able to accept the responsibility to administer the entry of persons on to Aboriginal land, there will not be a situation in which the provisions of this legislation including clause 70 can be enacted and brought into operation at the one time. If, as has been suggested, the Government lacks <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> with respect to this issue, I daresay the Government could seek simply not to bring the legislation on- that has not been the case- or simply fail to proclaim it anyway. Who could be heard to complain about that? There is no question of lack <inline font-style="italic">of bona fides.</inline> There are quite proper reasons for what is proposed. If honourable members opposite had sought an explanation, I am sure that their queries could have been adequately answered to their satisfaction. </para>

It is clearly indicated in the statements I have made that the laws relating to entry will operate through land councils and with respect to the wishes of the clan or community councils, many of which are already established in the Northern Territory and which also will be capable of incorporation under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill previously passed by the House. </para>

            <para>-The customary definition of Aboriginal used in the Department was originally drawn, I think, by Professor Rowley, amended by myself when I was Minister and put out by myself when I was Minister. It is to this effect: An Aboriginal is a person of full or partial Aboriginal descent who himself claims to be an Aboriginal and is accepted as such by the community with which he is associating. That gave some protection. This definition gives no protection at all. A person who is one sixty-fourth Aboriginal, who is not living as an Aboriginal and who has nothing to do with Aborigines, could claim the benefits of this Bill. This is not good enough. </para>

Its title speaks of traditional Aboriginal land. The people entitled to this land are traditional Aborigines. I am worried always that people who have only a slight mixture of Aboriginal blood, because they are perhaps better educated in our European sense or because they are slicker, might go to the Territory and impose upon the true and traditional Aborigines to whom this Bill refers. I feel very deeply about this. I believe that this Bill betrays the traditional Aborigines who could be overwhelmed or taken to the cleaners by the part-Aborigines who could come up from the south and who are without traditional ties. I would almost call them carpetbaggers. They could come up from the south and take charge of land councils and land trusts. They could establish their residence in the area of a land council in the Northern Territory. There is nothing difficult about that. Having done that, they have been able to use their superior European- I emphasise the word 'European'- education. This is a Bill to protect traditional people within a European framework. They will be able to manipulate these people, to take charge of them and, in point of fact, to take away from them their inheritance in their traditional land. I have seen this happening with my own eyes in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. I know exactly what can happen under this Bill. I feel very deeply on this point because I do not believe that we are doing what we set out to do. </para><para>The title of this Bill relates to traditional Aboriginal land. The people who are entitled to those lands are the traditional Aborigines, not blowing from the south or blowing from another area, whether they be full-blood or part-blood. The people who are entitled to that land are the people who have the traditional links with it. We have been talking perhaps with our tongues in our cheeks. But I hope at any rate that I have been talking sincerely about the spiritual ties of Aborigines with their land. These are traditional ties. There is no tie between an Aboriginal and some part of the land of which he is not the traditional owner. </para><para>To my way of thinking this matter is compounded by our misapplication of councils and trusts. The council is the big central body. The trust is without function; it is a purely passive creation which the land council will control. The situation is made worse by what I believe to be an untraditional alignment in land councils and trusts. We are setting up here an organisation under which Aboriginals will be defrauded of their birthright. Of course, this will not happen overnight. But inevitably it will happen if we allow the part-bloods and those full-bloods who have no traditional ties but who may be a little on the smart side to come in and usurp by their superior skills in committees, by their superior command of the European language, and by their superior knowledge of European law, or whatever it may be, the real rights of the traditional Aboriginals. If we mean anything, if we are in any way sincere when we speak about the spiritual tie between an Aboriginal and his land- it is there- we will maintain that position by allowing only traditional Aborigines to be concerned in the administration of their traditional land. </para></speech>

I have had discussions on this matter with the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> It is felt that the 4 amendments could be moved together, in which case it would mean that the honourable member would have 2 opportunities, if he required them, of speaking to the clause. Of course, if he can overcome the wrath of his colleagues he can always get the leave of the Committee to speak on a third occasion. But such a matter is not within the province of the Chair. </para>

            <para>-I am in full sympathy with the honourable member for Mackellar in respect of the general need to get the definition right. But I think that by trying to define the word 'Aboriginal' in a more narrow way we could end up in more trouble. It is just one of the inevitable problems that confront people wherever they try to define race or ethnic groups or anything of this nature. It is found that such a task is almost impossible to accomplish inside the ordinary terms of language. Therefore we have to rely upon registration of some sort. I believe that this requirement is adequately covered in clause 24.I would not vote for the amendment, or perhaps against it. </para>

          <para>- This Bill concerns traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. One would imagine that it would concern traditional Aborigines in the Northern Territory. Yet the definition of 'Aboriginal ' in this Bill is the definition that was included in the Bill in 1975 which the Australian Labor Party introduced. Some of us objected to the definition then, and not without reason. I objected to the definition because I am endeavouring to see that the traditional land owners in the Northern Territory get control of their own land. Because of the way in which the definition is worded- the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> put the case very well- people other than traditional owners will be able to work themselves into the land councils and land trusts. So I think it is imperative that the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Government takes note of the definition put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar. If we cannot get that definition accepted this time perhaps it could be looked at by the proposed committee which will oversee the implementation of this legislation in respect of the rights of the traditional owners. This is what I and various other people in the Northern Territory are concerned about. I refer to people such as Pastor Albrecht who has been backed up by Strehlow, De Graf, Pfitzner, St olle and the learned <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Gavranic</inline> who gave evidence yesterday on the subject of alcoholism to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. This man had spent 5 years in the Northern Territory and a great deal of that period in the Arnhem Land area. He supports the same kind of concept that we Territories support. We are endeavouring to ensure that the traditional owners have control of their land. The very broad definition of 'Aboriginal' in the Bill will tend to take away that control from those people. </para>
        <para>We have heard much of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Peterson.</inline> In fact I am led to believe that he was an adviser to Professor Woodward who is quoted as the be-all and end-all of the knowledge of what happens to Aboriginal land. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Peterson</inline> gave us a definition of 'Aboriginal' which is not the same as the definition in the Bill. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Peterson</inline> has played such a part in this matter and, as an anthropologist, is a man who claims to have an extensive experience and knowledge of Aborigines, I think that we should at least look at his definition.  His  definition is: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Someone of Aboriginal descent who is accepted as an Aborigine by Aborigines in the community in which he lives. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That virtually is what the honourable member for Mac keller is talking about in his amendment. I think the Government should take note of that because it has followed the Woodward report and the advice of these men constantly bearing in mind that this is traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory and that these are the people for whom we are battling so that they will have the final control over their land, and nobody else, I suggest very seriously that that definition or some similar definition should be looked at very seriously. </para>

            <para>- It is for general purposes within the terms of the Bill. The land councils are there as a bridge between 2 different communities, 2 different societies. We need a general definition to cover the people who will serve on those councils. The traditional Aboriginal owner is denned much more narrowly and quite separately within the same clause. The definition of a traditional Aboriginal owner will overcome the objections which have been made, save that one that nontraditional Aborigines may find their way onto the land councils. That is true. But there is a need for non-traditional Aborigines on those councils. </para>

          <para>-The Government cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> I think it is most unfortunate that the honourable member for Mackellar should use such exaggerated language in his debating of this Bill. He used a similar kind of language when debating the second reading speech, and here he is again using the same words, such as betrayal and defrauding of the traditional birthright of Aborigines. I think, with the greatest of respect to the honourable member, that it does not do his intellect any justice to hear the arguments which he has put forward.  His  amendment would limit the operation of the Bill to those Aborigines who are traditional owners. The arguments of the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> would do the same. What neither honourable gentleman knows or acknowledges is that many Aborigines are not traditional owners but they have a traditional interest in the land. Traditional owners form a special and very small class of Aborigines within the clan group and who by reason of Aboriginal law and by Aboriginal custom, one might say by inheritance or by choice according to Aboriginal law or custom, are the owners of the land. They are not the owners for themselves with a proprietary interest such as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock,</inline> and I have in our land. They are the owners for all Aborigines who, by reason of their clan grouping, have a traditional interest of one kind or another in that land, to live on it, to use it, to pass through it or to attend ceremonies upon it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I should have thought that the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member for the Northern Territory would either have known or have acknowledged the distinction it is a fundamental distinction- between the traditional owner and the Aboriginal who has a traditional interest. Therefore, if the amendment of the honourable gentleman were accepted he would exclude from the protection and the benefit of this Bill all those Aborigines who have traditional interests in the land. </para>
        <para>The particular definition is adopted on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel as being the definition which conforms with the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to make special laws with respect to people of any race. Hence, the definition of an Aboriginal is a person of the Aboriginal race. Some might say that that is tautological. If the matter were ever in dispute it would be a question of law and fact to be determined by the courts. The honourable member for the Northern Territory mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peterson</inline> and spoke of a definition put forward by him. I direct the attention of the honourable gentleman to the definition of Aboriginal provided in the draft Bill annexed to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. The definition is that an Aboriginal means a descendant of an indigenous inhabitant of Australia. I should have thought that that meant the same as the definition which we have in the Bill. I direct attention to the limitations on membership of certain organisations which are established under the Bill, particularly land trusts and land councils. I refer to clauses 4, 7, 21 and 23. Through the mechanism of those limitations the kinds of fears which the honourable member for Mackellar has asserted are not only diminished but are obliterated. </para>

          <para>-I want to deal very briefly with points raised by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant),</inline> the honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hyde)</inline> and the Minister. First, the honourable member for Wills, when he said that the item could be circular because non-traditional Aboriginals get on to the register, omitted one very fundamental point. Aboriginals can be persuaded of many things and they will on occasions falsify many things but they will never, to my way of thinking, falsify lines of descent. These are sacred to Aborigines and they consider them in quite a different category from any other category. So the register would be, to all intents and purposes, watertight. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Second, the honourable member for Moore mentioned that there were other protections in the Bill. Clause 7 of the Bill states that the Land Trust shall be appointed by the Minister from nominations received. However, nominations are confined to people who live within the area of the relevant land council. This also applies in regard to the qualifications for membership of land councils. So the same watertight provisions do not apply in practice. Anybody who really knows how Aborigines think and behave and what they believe to be really sacrosanct will, I think, agree with my contention. The Minister said that my amendment was too restrictive in that it would- I think this was what he implied confine the definition of Aborigines to owners. If the Minister reads what I have suggested, he will see that they are people who are registered as owners or have been nominated by a person so registered as a member of his land-owning clan or group. This is something which Aborigines will follow absolutely meticulously, absolutely honestly and without question. It enables anybody who is recognised by the Aborigines, in accordance with their own strict laws which they preserve quite meticulously, in a clan relationship or group relationship, to be registered. As somebody who has had some experience in the field, I can say that he will be registered as such. </para>
        <para>These are objections which have been raised to the proposition which I have put forward. They seem to me to be objections which have no substance in them. So far as I know there have been no substantial and correct arguments introduced in this chamber today against the proposition that I am putting forward. In view of its importance for maintaining for traditional Aborigines the traditional land and traditional rights which this Bill describes in its title, I ask that the amendment be seriously considered, if not here at least in another place. </para>

        <para>I hope that I will have the opportunity to make some brief comment on amendments 2, 3 and 4 and possibly to speak at a later stage in respect of amendment 5. In relation to amendments 2, 3 and 4, the Opposition is very concerned that the intentions of  His  Honour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, to include Aborigines who live in towns as being capable of having land granted to them have been circumvented by the provisions of this legislation. </para>
        <para>The Opposition believes that it should be possible to make grants of land available in towns for Aboriginal people. When all is said and done, can a town be proclaimed in respect of a group of Aboriginal people? Can a town be proclaimed over a community to exclude it from the definition and the provisions of this Bill so as to prevent people in the community from obtaining a grant of Aboriginal land? That is the issue which is at stake in respect of these matters. Can a community be designated under the laws of the Northern Territory as a town and so be excluded from the benefits of this legislation? In short, the purpose of these amendments is to give effect to the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward that the Aboriginal Land Commissioners have jurisdiction to make recommendations relating to grants of land for Aboriginals within towns. </para>
        <para>In his recommendations <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward stated in paragraph 328 that planning for Aboriginals in towns must involve consulting them and determining their preferences. He recommended specifically in sub-paragraphs (v) and (vi) that Land Councils should make submissions to town planners and the Land Commissioners who, after investigation, should report to the Government on acquisition of necessary land for Aborigines in towns. Without these amendments a large number of Aboriginal families and communities will be excluded from the operation of this legislation and will be forced to go once again cap in hand to the Department of the Northern Territory which has led the opposition to the granting of land in towns and to the claims heard already by the interim Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. </para>
        <para>An example of this can be seen from the Alice Springs land claims where the Commissioner was ordered to stop his investigation of claims in which, in a preliminary report, he had rejected the arguments of the Department of the Northern Territory. In addition to holding this inquiry the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> announced that due to the economic situation no funds would be available for any site development for at least 12 months. In his report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward stated that most of the fringe dwellers of cities and towns have suffered more from the coming of white settlement than have those still living on reserves. He quoted from submissions from both the central and northern Land Councils to support his proposition. A large number of Aboriginal people living in towns will be deprived of the opportunity to obtain land under the provisions of this Bill unless the amendment is carried. </para>
        <para>In his report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward referred to the census conducted in 1971. In the greater Darwin area there were 2374 Aboriginal people living in towns. In Alice Springs the number was 1269. In Katherine it was 174 and in Tennant Creek 1 19. Just in those places there is an aggregation of some 4000 Aboriginal people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward said, in effect, of these people- I will not quote all the provisions because I do not have time- that their problems were urgent and important and that they related to social welfare and urban development issues. He pointed out that they were the dispossessed victims who had lost traditional land and he said they had suffered more from white settlement than those on reserves or cattle stations. They were now squatters. They became attached to their land. They wanted to live on the land where they were now living. They may have been part of a traditional area or formerly been part of some other area, but they have now left that area and have come to have an association with a new area. </para>
        <para>He pointed out that there should be due regard for tribal differences, to avoid dissention. He pointed out that consideration should be given to their special needs in town, such as then need to have access to a hospital and matters of that kind. He recommended that the Land Council field officers should identify their needs in respect of such matters as camping areas, community housing areas, hostels, single family housing and the like, and that their views should be put to the town planners and the land commissioners. He said that the aim should be that within a reasonable time all Aboriginal groups should be living or camping on land in which they have an interest. His Honour went on to express the hope that by 1 976 there would be no Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory living in sufferance on Crown lands. A number of honourable members in the chamber at the present time would know a good deal about the town people in places such as Darwin, the Kulak people and the people at Railway Dam out of Darwin-people who occupy areas which were once the traditional transitional grounds over which those people passed and who now live there permanently in smaller numbers than in bygone times. </para>
        <para>It is the hope of the Opposition that these amendments will be carried so that it will be possible to make grants to Aboriginal people living in the town situation and apart from the places of which they have been dispossessed. This is an extremely significant matter. The Opposition would like to call for a division on this question, but in consideration of the time involved we probably will avoid a division. But, in our avoiding a division, I would not like the impression to be given that we do not attribute the utmost significance to this situation. It is a departure from the Woodward recommendations, a departure from every attitude that any group of Aboriginal people has ever expressed about this matter, and a departure from the 1975 legislation introduced by the Australian Labor Party. If there is to be any give and take at all, if there is to be one derrick of compromise at all in respect of the matters which the Opposition is earnestly putting to the Minister, this is an issue with such characteristics and with high objectivity. </para>

          <para>- I speak to the fourth amendment of the battery of amendments moved by the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> It refers to subclause (4) of clause 3. This is an interesting clause. The Government proposes in this Bill, which is an amending Bill, to amend the clause in the original Bill. I believe that the Government's amendment is correct and that the Opposition's proposed amendment is incorrect. It is incorrect for some very viable and very worthy reasons. The sub-clause in the original Bill read as follows: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>A reference in this Act to the granting of a mining interest in respect of Aboriginal land shall be read as not including a reference to the renewal of a mining interest that was in existence when the land became Aboriginal land. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It appears to me that in that clause the Government was trying to guarantee that a mining interest was not capable of being intercepted when there had to be a renewal of the mining interest. That is a very legitimate requirement, but the sense of the clause left a great doubt. It could be interpreted that the mining interest was capable of being intercepted at any time and there was no right of renewal. So the Government quite correctly introduced some new words. The proposed sub-clause now reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A reference in this Act to the granting of a mining interest in respect of Aboriginal land shall be read as not including a reference to the renewal, in accordance with an option or other right conferred before the land became Aboriginal land, of a mining interest that was in existence when the land became Aboriginal land. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That gave some guarantee that when an interest was to be renewed- many of them are for 21 years; they have to be renewed progressively- it could not just be cut off or intercepted at the time of renewal. The effect of the Opposition's amendment is to put any renewal in a position of risk which ultimately could guarantee that the mining interest or development would not proceed. I know that it is fashionable in this place to bash mining interests, to say that mining is not a satisfactory activity and to say that mining is always a disruptive activity. I am not one who holds to that proposition. It is quite clear that in other clauses of this BUI there are many guarantees as to the negotiating rights of Aborigines through the land councils and the deed-holding body, the Land Trust, in respect of the mining interests. As it is proposed by the honourable member for Hughes on behalf of the Opposition, the whole show is put at risk - </para>

            <para>- The honourable member would not put his own interests at risk. I am just looking at the words of the Opposition's amendment. The meaning of those words is quite clear. They would react ultimately to the very great detriment of the Aborigines. They would not even allow the rights of Aborigines with respect to mining interests to be protected because there would be none being renewed from which Aborigines would need to be protected or from which they could obtain payment in terms of negotiated settlements and so on. So I hope that the enormity of the proposition that is being put by the Opposition is realised in this chamber. It is for that reason that I welcome the Government's amendment to the original Bill. It clarifies sub-clause (4) of clause 3. That sub-clause has caused a lot of concern and a lot of uncertainty. No matter how it is read, it certainly does not mean what was intended by the original subclause. The Opposition's amendment runs completely contrary to what I thought was the first intended meaning and, as a matter of common sense, I believe that it ought to be rejected. I believe that the Government's proposed amendment is one of sound common sense, knowing what is involved in terms of those interests which are essentially long term interests and not short term interests. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member should listen to what I have to say. I listened with great courtesy to him, even though I thought he was preaching some materialist nonsense, as he might define it, which offended me greatly. The situation is that under this legislation we are transferring to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory the ownership, in a particular form, of the lands to which they have traditional rights, but we are not transferring the absolute rights. If over the years someone has acquired a mining right, that right is to continue untrammelled. My friend from Lilley points out that there must be no interference with the rights of renewal. I believe that that offends against the spirit of the legislation. It is not even anti-mining to say that we ought to do that. We are transferring the ownership of this land to the Aboriginal people in the same sense as we transferred the ownership of Papua New Guinea to the people of Papua New Guinea at independence. I suggest that the honourable member for Lilley would say: 'We should have retained control of the copper mine in Bougainville'. But he would not say that of course. We have to find a new formula for dealing with mining. I believe that the minerals on these lands should belong to the Aboriginal people and, therefore, that we have to find some formula by which the Aborigines can develop these lands if they wish to do so in their name, in their right and under their ownership. One of my objections to this Bill is in fact that it ought to be renamed. It is really not an Aboriginal land rights Bill. It deals with the mining rights on Aboriginal lands. That theme runs through the Bill and seems to be of greater authority than the actual Aboriginal lands themselves. I think we are only moving halfway. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>It is one of those intriguing facts in our society that the right of the miner runs continuously whereas no other right does. One may have a home on land but it is no trouble for the Government to take a person's home and put a road through it. It is no trouble taking a person's farm and turning it into something else. Land can be acquired for any of these purposes and we do it all the time. If one pegs out land as a miner, one has a particular relationship to the land. In fact, one has almost all the land rights which we are now trying to obtain for Aboriginal people. What this Bill purported to do, one would hope, would be to transfer that ownership to the Aboriginal people. Later at the Committee stage we will discuss some particular instances. There is no suggestion at this stage that we should take from people their present rights. We are talking about renewals. Why should a person have an absolute right to renew a lease? That right does not exist anywhere else. </para>
        <para>If one is leasing part of Canberra, there is no suggestion that one has an absolute right to continue with that lease after 99 years has elapsed. If one is leasing something from the honourable member for Lilley, when the lease is up and unless it is written into it in some particular way, one does not have the absolute right to continue. Many people in this country have acquired rights over land by simply occupying it in the past. The Aboriginal people, having occupied the land for 20 000 or 30 000 years, must almost have that right. I am saying that this is not anti development, anti-mining or any of those things. If we are really genuine about transferring the rights, the proprietorship of this land to the Aboriginal people, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in the present sense. </para>
        <para>I support my colleague the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> in what he had to say about those other tilings which again put certain rights above the rights of Aboriginal people in towns and on Crown lands. I think we are discussing a very important principle. </para>

Therefore, if we have to decide a new formula, introduce subsidiary legislation or something of that nature to bring about a different deal in relation to mining rights, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in their present form because I believe it offends the spirit of the legislation and it will make absolutely certain that there are large parts of the Northern Territory on Aboriginal domain which will never belong to the Aboriginal in the strict sense. </para>

I think he thought he was replying to another matter because he had a speech prepared on it. In any event, I will say a few words about it now but more will be said about this matter at a subsequent stage. The fundamental question here is this: Should miners, those people who are entrepreneur i ally engaged in a pursuit of gouging minerals from the ground in the Northern Territory, need consent when land becomes Aboriginal land? For the first time in Australia's history, as a result of this legislation, Aboriginal people will have land rights. It might have been all right to ride roughshod over the Aborigines in bygone times but the whole purpose of this legislation is to grant land rights. </para>

        <para>The Opposition is moving amendments to delete a number of words which would have the effect of giving Aborigines rights in this particular matter. The amendments are designed to ensure that mining interests with options and other rights, interest in land and the like, must seek consent from Aboriginal people in their corporate state when land becomes Aboriginal land. The Government can bastard i se this legislation and it can ruin it but this was indeed the unqualified intent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward which has been set out in the most unequivocal and unambiguous terms in his report. I should like to make a brief reference to some of the salient comments that he made about this matter. An inquiry has been conducted into this matter. The then Opposition, the present Government, was in agreement with the fact that we should have this great and high principled application to the issues involved. Unless the Government can put up a case against the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward to this Parliament it ought to adopt the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward certainly made out a most forthright case along the lines that the amendment proposes. In paragraph 623 of his second report,  His  Honour said: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>When the understandable expectations of these companies that they would be able to continue exploration under the rules which governed them to begin with, are weighed against the equally reasonable expectation of Aborigines that their wishes about reserve lands will now be respected, I have no doubt in my mind which expectation must be disappointed. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am sure that the Committee has no doubt in its mind about what  His  Honour implied in that respect. The 1975 Labor legislation, which acted as a catalyst on the whole consideration of this matter and which is still substantially upheld in the current legislation, gave expression to these principles. I do not think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Minister,</inline> that I am mistaken if I say that the 1976 legislation, as distinct from the current legislation- the Coalition legislation- also provided that mining interests seeking extensions should be subject to consent. At one point in time we were all in agreement in respect of this matter-  His  Honour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, the Opposition and the Liberal and National Country parties. But something has happened. What is it that has happened since June 1976 to cause the Aboriginal needs to become secondary and subjective. I believe that the Government has a lot to answer for in this regard. This is not a question of saying that the Government does not want mining in the Northern Territory or that it does not recognise the need for mining; it would recognise the need for mining in any State or Territory regardless of who owned the land. If the Government is trying to get the thing on the cheap, and to come in on the grouter and say that here it has this distinctive, discriminatory situation where only Aboriginal people will not have a say about the terms and conditions, it is resorting to the extreme form of paternalism and it is running in the face of the attitude of the Aboriginal people which has been unanimously expressed. </para>
        <para>Can any honourable member present- the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> is a great zealot and enthusiast and is highly experienced in these things- point to one corporate body of Aboriginal people which wants what this Government is proposing under this provision? Of course not. So, the Government is just denying all the counsel and all the high conviction that it has had in bygone times. It has changed its course of action. The Government is not prepared to require these mining companies to front up now in the face of the new situation where there are now new owners, the Aboriginal people. If the Government does not accept the proposition that the legislation will be significant it will not be significant, especially in respect of the great area of responsibility that the Government is turning over to the Country Party dominated Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory which comprises people who have opposed nearly all these principles. </para>
        <para>The Minister has put the whole situation in such a way that so many of the important implemental aspects of these matters will be in the hands of people who have opposed any progress in these issues. Unless this Government which in fact has a prerogative over the matter about which we are now talking- the question of consent about existing mining interests- is prepared to put some teeth into the legislation and show that it means business what will happen in respect of these things about which the Commonwealth, has a over sighting role in regard to the Legislative Assembly? These people have shown an antipathy. I do not regard the Minister as having an antipathy to the best interests of Aboriginal People and their quests for land rights. I regard him as being sympathetic. I am putting it to him that here is a matter in respect of which he has an unfettered prerogative and for which once he showed some enthusiasm. Now he has welsher on the deal and the Committee is entitled to some explanation. Unless there is some explanation I believe Aboriginal people around Australia will regard this government as lacking good faith in respect of this important matter. </para>

          <para>- I must say something about what the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson),</inline> has just said. He used very strong words concerning the Legislative Assembly and the powers that are given to it in this Bill He has insinuated that the Assembly will control these mining interests and the land on which Aborigines will have mineral rights. Just looking briefly at clause 73, the ordinance which is complementary to this legislation concerns sacred sites and the entry of persons onto Aboriginal land. As I have already said, the Legislative Assembly has voted 3 times against the Labor Party when it wanted to throw open Aboriginal land to everyone- Collins and all the rest. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The people who defended the Aboriginal cause were the members of the Legislative Council as it was called in those days. The Labor Party members in the Northern Territory were the ones who consistently voted to do away with the Aboriginal permit system, and honourable members opposite know it. The matter comes up again and again. The complementary legislation refers also to protection, conservation, prohibiting the entry of persons into controlled fishing areas and. so on. It is completely wrong to say to this Government that the Legislative Assembly members will hold the Aboriginal land rights with regard to minerals in the hollow of their hands. That is absolute nonsense. </para>
        <para>While we have been discussing this matter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward has been quoted at length as being the ultimate authority. I remind the Committee that he was advised by the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. I do not know whether the people involved took into account the real beliefs and traditions of the traditional Aborigines to whom this Bill after all refers. It seems to me that there has been heavy criticism of people who have advised the Government and who have lived in the Territory for many years, which is something that no one in this chamber apart from myself has done. There is a connection between the central Australian traditional land ownership which is connected with the Touring and the Arnhem Land or northern land ownership and clan gathering which is known as the Rangga. There has been much criticism that the Central Australian argument has been triggered by members of the Lutheran Church including Paul Albrecht, but many others have supported these moves. It has been said by the advisers of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward that the area in Central Australia was an isolated case of church dominance. Let me refer to a work put out by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Berndt</inline> which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The mala - </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That is a clan-  points to that religious aspect and to territorial possession. In the recent Gove Land Rights case, Yirrkala Aborigines made the point that members of the particular mad a -  which is the same as mala-  own their land because their linked mala had association which were . . . (secret-sacred) emblems. </para>
        <para class="block">This is similar to the Touring in Central Australia. This seems to have been completely ignored by the advisers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. The whole concept of the original Labor Party land Bill was to some extent based on a false premise. The land councils were set up by Europeans and they tended not to take into consideration the feelings, beliefs and land laws of the traditional Aborigines. We are now seeing this come into effect. I am associating what is happening in Central Australia- it is moving strongly from the traditional owners against this sort of white fellow set-up of large land councils and land ownership by people other than the traditional owners- with the Arnhem Land situation. This has been explained in the publication edited by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Peterson,</inline> which contains articles by learned men on Aboriginal affairs. </para>
        <para>Yesterday at a public meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Gavranic,</inline> who has spent some years at Gove amongst Aborigines, described to us with diagrams why the whole concept of these councils and this land ownership as it is now envisaged is incorrect. Unfortunately, one cannot produce the diagrams in this chamber. He was quite right in what he said. He was backing up such men as Strehlow, Albrecht, De Graf and so on. He said that land ownership was based on the family or clan groups. Aboriginals in those family groups relate many of their customs and actions, such as the marriage ceremony, to beliefs tied up with their history on the law of the land. Our original concept with respect to the needs of these people was that there was a whole mob of blacks out in the bush- we did not determine whether they were clans or tribes- and we 'white fellows' or 'balandas', as they are known at the Top End had the task of providing something there for these Aborigines. What did we do? We put a settlement in the middle. We did not understand that we were mixing together Aborigines from such tribes as the Pintubi, the Walbri, Aranda, the Iluawa and the like. This fact has only recently become obvious. I am afraid that this Bill, and the legislation introduced by the Labor Party before it, missed that point. The Labor legislation missed the point utterly. This Bill still does. We should realise that this is the situation. We have heard former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs speaking about the ownership of land and tying it to the large land councils. This is what is happening. -It is not correct. It is time that this Government learned that it is not correct. </para>

          <para>-After listening to what the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> has just said, perhaps we can expect that when this matter goes to the vote he will oppose the Bill. It is quite obvious from his remarks to the present that he does not support the Bill in its entirety. What I wish to mention this evening is the question of roads. Throughout the schedule to the Bill and in the various descriptions given we find that roads are not included. In the Bill that was introduced last year by the Australian Labor Party but which, as a result of what happened on 11 November, never came before the Parliament for finalisation, roads were included in the definitions. In the definition of Aboriginal land, control of the roads concerned was given to the Aboriginal people. I query whether in considering this aspect Aboriginal people should be given control over these roads. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I suppose that in many areas people do not like to see roads put through their land. As it is their land, they wish to have some say in the use to which it is put. No protection is provided against an influx of people- tourists etcetera- on those roads. I am sure that everyone will admit that such an influx can have a bad effect in certain areas. Consider the property of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in Victoria. Would it be all right if a road were constructed through the Prime Minister's property and he were given no right whatsoever to restrict the access of people to that road? A similar question would arise in relation to roads being constructed through land held by graziers and others. Why are Aboriginals not to be given control over the roads which run through their lands? Why are roads to be taken out of the control which Aboriginals will exercise over the land through which those roads will run? This is a matter to which I feel consideration should be given. Does this mean that this land will be open to every Tom, Dick and Harry who wishes to gain access to it? I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter to which some consideration should be given. I support the amendments which have been moved by the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>for his courtesy and the Parliament for its corporate courtesy is allowing me to interrupt this quite important debate on Aboriginal matters. I have interrupted the debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, perforce,</inline> because the report that I have just tabled has reached certain sections of the media and I would adjudge it proper that Parliament should have the report before it so that Parliament in its own way may direct its attention to the report and to its contents. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The report which I have just tabled was prepared by Major-General Stretton during the administration of the last Whitlam Government. Because of that fact, I have sought the approval of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> to table the report. That approval has been given by my friend, the Leader of the Opposition. I spoke to the honourable gentleman last week. I told him that, because the report was an administrative one and not a public one, I deemed it proper that I should have his approval before I used the report publicly. I told him that my assessment of the report was that it was completely innocuous but nevertheless I would send a copy to him. Subsequently, I wrote to him officially and my honourable friend replied giving me his approval to use the report. It may be an old fashioned point of punctilio; nevertheless, I do not believe in using administrative documents belonging to another government unless I have the approval of the lineal heir or successor of that government. </para>
          <para>The report is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Lessons and Recommendations from the Darwin Disaster.</inline> The tabling of this second report means that the only written departmental reports prepared by Major-General Stretton before the publication of his book have now been tabled. As honourable members are aware, Major-General Stretton, the Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organisation within the Department of Defence, has recently published a book on the first 7 days of relief operations in Darwin following cyclone Tracy in 1974. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> matters raised in the book have been the source of questions and personal explanations in the Parliament. As a result, I undertook to report more fully on this matter. It may be helpful, if I first put some matters in perspective. The book was written by a still serving senior Crown employee. It is relevant to record that Major-General Stretton did not attempt to follow the normal procedures laid down for a Government employee wishing to publish a book or otherwise to make public comment and use official information on matters concerning his duties as a Crown employee. Neither his departmental superiors nor I were aware of his intention, nor asked to approve, nor given an opportunity to study the accuracy and propriety of his text. </para>
          <para>It should be said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that the book is a substantially subjective account, essentially of Major-General Stretton 's own involvement in the aftermath of cyclone Tracy. In no way could it be said that it is a complete and authoritative record of the disaster, nor of the total relief operations which indeed began in Darwin as soon as the storm subsided. I remind honourable members that on 6 March 1975 the then Minister for Defence, the honourable Lance Barnard, tabled in this Parliament a documented report prepared, as was to be expected of him, by Major-General Stretton. This factual report described the way in which the people of Darwin, the Natural Disasters Organisation, the defence forces, various Commonwealth and State authorities, and indeed the nation as a whole reacted to provide immediate and generous assistance following the worst natural disaster in our history. </para>
          <para>It will be apparent from a cursory examination of the paper by Major-General Stretton- that is to say, the paper I have tabled- that it is of a formal and factual kind, discussing problems which occurred during cyclone Tracy, some analysis of the reasons for these problems, and his ideas and suggestions as to action to be considered whether by the Commonwealth Government, State governments or local Territory legislatures and authorities- to reduce further risks and problems. I say to my honourable friends that his suggestions ranged from the establishment of le sig lati on in this field- if I may indulge myself the luxury of a personal observation, I would have considerable doubt as to whether this Parliament could legislate in the manner suggested by the General- to increasing the level of first aid training in schools. I would hardly have thought that that would have been the preoccupation of this Parliament. I mention this to indicate the range of suggestions made by Major-General Stretton- not to denigrate them, but to indicate the generality of them and, if I may say with respect, the innocuity of them. </para>
          <para>The report I have tabled, in its general form and content, is quite different from the book which has now been published by Major-General Stretton. Neither in the formal report on the Darwin disaster dated 10 February 197S and tabled in this Parliament- I trust that it would not be an impertinence on my part if I were to observe that Parliament is entitled to the truth nor in this further submission dated 14 April 1975 which I have tabled this evening are there any suggestions of inadequate or improper conduct, concerning Ministers and other persons involved in the relief operations after cyclone Tracy, of the kind made in the book. </para>
          <para>I am not seeking to defend Ministers on my side of politics; I am speaking about Ministers who served in the last Government. Ministers are not, as some people suspect, malleable and given to being swept here and there; neither, may I venture the view, are Ministers disposed to resorting to public concealment. I go further to make this observation: Quite apart from the fact that in neither of these 2 reports are any critical comments made of Ministers- that includes my friend the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)-</inline> critical things are said in the book of unfortunate officials and servicemen in Darwin who, in many cases, with their wives and children, felt the full fury of cyclone Tracy. Major-General Stretton described in the book the effect on him of what he saw when he arrived there after the cyclone had passed. I have already given the House one example of the inaccuracy by Major-General Stretton in his description in the book of the non-availability of the then Minister for Defence, that is to say <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> to exercise his authority. The House may recall that in the book the author said that the then Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> was incommunicado. All my inquiries would indicate that that was simply not true. May I observe that there are other graceless references to Ministers which appear in the book for the first time. </para>
          <para>I should comment here on another matter raised by Major-General Stretton in his book, because it bears on the defence preparedness of this country. Major-General Stretton referred to the temporary failure of defence communications and on page 24 of his book observed: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It was unbelievable that the Defence Forces, with all the millions of dollars spent on signals equipment, could not communicate with their units in Darwin. What if there were an enemy attack? The rest of Australia may not know that Darwin was in enemy hands. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am advised by the Chiefs of Staff- they are the professionals in the field- that the deployment of mobile transmitters and receivers would be an obvious military precaution whenever an attack appeared likely and such action would provide essential alternative and back-up circuits. Such mobile equipment would be located so that damage to the permanent communications stations would not affect effective communications. I observe in passing that as a senior military officer Major-General Stretton, I expect, would understand that such an obvious military precaution would have been taken. </para>
          <para>As will be clear from the submission dated 14 April which I have just tabled, action on Major-General Stretton 's recommendations involved, firstly, the Natural Disasters Organisation itself and, beyond that, a large number of other Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities, and, as well, organisations outside the Government altogether. It is here that I observe that the Natural Disasters Organisation has a general co-ordinating function. As to the content of his report to the Minister in the preceding Administration which I have just tabled, the merit of the various suggestions has been examined by the relevant authorities. I instance to the House that the suggestions range from legislation to first aid training in schools. I assure the House that all these matters have been examined. This examination was initiated by the previous Government and it has been continued by the present Government. It is a matter of some substance to observe that some of the matters referred to by Major-General Stretton plainly belong to State authorities. The writ of this Parliament does not run in some of the fields to which he referred. </para>
          <para>My attention has been drawn to a claim by Major-General Stretton that, in addition to the report which I have now tabled, he made one further report to the then Chief of the General Staff concerning the performance of 7 Military District in Darwin. Upon inquiry I have been informed that, in the course of a short de-brief soon after he returned from Darwin, Major-General Stretton did mention this matter to General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Francis</inline> Hassett, now the Chief of Defence Force Staff. General Hassett did not regard Major-General Stretton 's oral- I repeat oral'- observations as being matters which required further action, particularly where they affected individuals. I emphasise 'particularly where they affected individuals'. For myself, nor do I. The book makes several ungenerous references to the Army but ignores some circumstances that were relevant to the. situation during and after the cyclone. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I am concerned to ensure that the Natural Disasters Organisation- which can be directed adequately only if it enjoys the confidence of, and an atmosphere of co-operation with, State and Territory administrations should get down to the work of disaster relief planning which is waiting to be done without the distractions that have lately been imposed upon that Organisation. I am therefore confirming as an instruction to Major-General Stretton that, as a senior serving officer with tasks demanding his effective performance in this civilian establishment, he- like any other military or civilian officer- is not to make public comments on matters of policy or administration pertaining to his official duties without prior approval from designated authority. The latitude which Major-General Stretton has lately improperly claimed for himself does not exist. </para>

I full well remember the discussion in the Cabinet, of which I was a member, following the cyclone disaster in Darwin. My impression of those days- I rely on my recollection- is that the most valuable contribution immediately after and thereafter in the relief of Darwin and the organisation of that relief and subsequently the organisation of services and responses necessary to restore the city was largely by the Police Commissioner of the city at that time.

          <para>- I wish to add a few remarks to the consideration of this Bill. Matters have been raised here tonight which throw doubts on the impartiality of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to look at the matters that are left in the hands of that legislative body. It is rather odd that people, some of whom have had quite a long experience with Aborigines in the Northern Territory, have expressed their concern that some of the matters in the Bill have been left to the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. I refer to the Presbyterian Church, the Quakers and the United Church in Northern Australia. They have made submissions to various members. They are concerned that some of these powers are to be left in the hands of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I am sure that they would be free of political bias, but they can see a possibility of the Aborigines not getting the fair go to which they are entitled if the Legislative Assembly has these powers. I suggest that these matters should be given further consideration. I suggest that these powers of the </para>

          <para>-The Government's attitude towards the amendments is that we do not accept them. I refer briefly to a number of pertinent points. The question of roads was raised by the honourable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wallis).</inline> I direct his attention to my reply in the second reading debate on the original Bill, when I explained fully the protection given by the legislation to the position of roads through Aboriginal land. I suggest that if the honourable gentleman reads that he will be satisfied as to the requirements of the Bill. Reference was made by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> about the definition of mining interest, particularly the exclusion of renewals of mining interests. I simply point out that the amendments originally proposed by the Government, which are now incorporated in this Bill, are more restrictive of the rights of mining companies holding mining interests which contain a right of renewal than the original provision in this respect in the Bill which I introduced on 4 June. The point is that the only rights of renewal which are protected are statutory rights in existence prior to the land becoming Aboriginal land. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>With respect to the amendment moved by the Opposition to include a reference to land in towns, the Opposition has drawn on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward's report. Without elaboration I refer the Committee to paragraphs 274 and 328, item 9, of his report, and remind the Committee that the legislation deals exclusively with traditional land rights. In that respect, to maintain consistency, the Government decided that any request by Aboriginal groups to land in towns should be dealt with outside the Bill and through the ordinary administration of land use in the Northern Territory.  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, when speaking of town claims, clearly indicated that the tenure of any land in towns by Aborigines should be the same kind of tenure as that for all other persons and that any requests for such land should go through the normal town planning procedures of the Northern Territory. That will be done. As I indicated in my initial second reading speech and subsequent statements, and with particular reference here to Alice Springs, the Government is committed to satisfying the requirements of Aborigines for land in towns such as camping areas and other areas of land for residential use. That commitment will be maintained. In fact it is being worked out right at the moment in Alice Springs. </para>

          <para>-May I raise a very brief matter in connection with clause5? Clause 5 concerns the functions of land trusts. In clause 5 (1) (b) there is an alteration from what appeared in the previous Bill which was introduced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> on 4 June. One of the functions of a Land Trust set out in paragraph (b) is: to exercise its powers as owner of land ... for the benefit of Aboriginal groups ... </para>

        <para class="block">I would like to know why the word 'communities' has been deleted from this paragraph. Is group' in fact to imply 'community'? Is a group a community? Is a community a group? I looked at a dictionary a short time ago to find the definition of 'community'. I admit that the dictionary was not the most reputable dictionary available, but it is one that is in common use. The dictionary that I consulted defines 'community' as joint ownership; identity of character', which seems to be an appropriate term to use in respect of Aboriginal people. It also defines the word as meaning 'fellowship'. I do not want to frighten the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> but the word is also defined as meaning 'organised political, municipal or social body- a body of people living in the same locality'. There has been this change. Was it deliberate? Was there some real purpose in substituting the word 'groups' for 'communities'? </para>

          <para>-The main issue involved in this clause is similar to the ones that were debated just a short time ago. The clause involves the issue of exempting existing mining leases or interests from delivery to land trusts. Sub-clause 10 (3) reads: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>For the purposes of this section, a lease of land granted under a law of the Northern Territory relating to mining for minerals shall be deemed to be an estate or interest in that land if the lease was granted before the date of commencement of this section or in pursuance of an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth before that date. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Opposition is seeking to omit the words 'before the date of commencement'. The effect of this sub-clause is to exempt the mining interests that are already existing from the provisions of the Bill which apply to Aboriginal land. </para>
        <para>Our views have been stated. We believe that it is not proper and it is not consistent with the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward to be renewing mining leases; that mining leases should get automatic renewal. We believe that all the companies holding leases should reapply and that they should not take for granted the question of consent. It is interesting to note that  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward said in his report, which was brought down in April 1974, that 29 exploration licences had been granted to 17 applicants. We know that the issuing of exploration licences was frozen in December 1972. </para>
        <para>I would like to summarise what His Honour had to say. For reasons that I have mentioned I will not quote large extracts from the report as this would be time consuming. His Honour said that the capital involved was risk capital. He pointed out that companies had been on notice for several years that Aboriginal wishes could no longer be ignored. I think that is an understatement of the fact. They have been on notice for a long time- since the 1967 referendum and certainly since the election of the Labor Government in 1972 when the then Prime Minister clearly indicated the intention of the then Government to give effect to these recommendations. So in that context these people have certainly been involved with risk capital and with risks. The fact that they have been there for so long ought not to represent a great deal of consolation or security of tenure for them, in view of the clear indications that there were going to be new concepts applying to these situations. </para>
        <para>His Honour said also that the freeze should continue for some time. He said that he did not stand for pre-emption- and who does? The Opposition does not, anyway. It does not stand for pre-emption of these existing mining interests- a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli.</inline> Now that there are new owners, or the traditional owners have been legalised in terms of the white man's way of doing things, things obviously have to change. Mining interests cannot regard renewal as a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli.</inline> In fact, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, as  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward pointed out, actually made the recommendation that there should be a freeze over mining renewals and mining development for 20 years. This was not just for one year or 2 years. We have had this freeze now for a certain time. As I understand the position it will run to the end of this year. The people who made that recommendation the members of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs- cannot be regarded as slouches in this situation. When it is all said and done the Council had among its members Professor Scanner who is one of the country's leading anthropologists- probably the leading anthropologist- in respect of these matters. Certainly he is highly and mutually well regarded from the standpoint of the 2 major sides of politics in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dexter,</inline> the permanent head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was also a member of the Council; so too was no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coombs.</inline> These men made the point that the freeze should go on for 20 years. But this Government is not applying that principle. It is seeing that those who have had these vested interests, advantages and privileges for so long are given the chance of compounding their privileges. This, as I see it, is completely unprincipled. </para>
        <para>When we consider the conditions enjoyed by some of these people, the Australian community would be shocked to know the extent to which this great bonanza has been handed out on a platter. Let me take, for example, the lease that Nab al co has, which covers 1800 hectares.  His  Honour pointed out that the rental was $8,630. This lease was given in 1969, and it runs for 42 years with an option for another 42 years. The proposition that the Minister is putting before us is that there should be automatic rights of renewal even in respect of the new legalised Aboriginal ownership. This is contrary to what he put before; it is contrary to what the Bill introduced by the Labor Party provided; it is contrary to what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward; it is contrary to the recommendations of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs; and it is contrary to what has been said by anybody with a reputation in respect of these matters. This bonanza is to go on and on. The attitude seems to be that if one has an advantage one should keep it and compound it. We can look at Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Groote Eylandt where the Gem co operation is producing manganese.  His  Honour said that the rental was $478-not $478,000-for 33 square kilometres from 1 964 for 42 years with options. The wharf area has a great allocation of space for 99 years and the town area has another allocation as well. Lots of lesser people like Kail is in the Northern Territory were paying $5. </para>
        <para class="block">That is an incongruous amount in terms of the capital which he has invested and the benefits which he accrued. Others were paying a rental of $118. </para>
        <para>When we go through the list which His Honour provided in his second report we see companies like Western Nuclear (Aust.) Pty Ltd in the Bul man area which has a lease granted from 1953. The Utah Development Company at Daly River had a mineral lease of 2590 square kilometres granted in 1971. Then, in the petroleum area there was Magellan Petroleum Aust. Ltd at Yuendumu, Southern Pacific Petroleum NL at Lake Mackay, Magellan Petroleum (NT) Pty Ltd at Haass Bluff, United Canso Oil and Gas N.T. Pty Ltd at the same place and Australian Aquitaine Petroleum Pty Ltd at Daly River and Wag a it, and so the list goes on. His Honour stated: </para>

        <para class="block">I do not want to labour the point much more. We were on it for a while when we spoke about the previous provisions which applied to this matter. But is seems to me that, if this legislation is to go through in the form proposed by the Minister, Australia will be breaking new ground. Here we have real owners who will not have any say and whose traditional lands which might be granted to them will be subject to mining ordinances and all sorts of complicated procedures which could deleteriously affect their way of life. They will not be given any opportunity to have any say about the matter. I put it to the Minister that he should accept the amendment which simply provides that there should now be a renegotiation. There is obviously a premium on the fact that owners can have an effective say in a situation which will emerge after the commencement of this legislation. I move: </para>

          <para>-In speaking to the amendment, I think a little bit of history will not go amiss. This is where we came in! I think of Nab al co Pty Ltd which, as I understand it, was one of the bodies with pre-existing arrangements written into its lease back in the 1960s. I recall what that situation was like and how the arrangements were made. There was supposed to be consultation. There was great unrest amongst the people of Yirrkala. A select committee of this Parliament was appointed. We went to the area and examined the matter. We heard what the people had to say. It was quite obvious that the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Aboriginal people had not been consulted in the sense in which we talk of consultation. Neither were the people defended in the way in which people defend their interests in our society. Neither did they have the same sort of advocacy. One of the sad things about the Aboriginal situation is that when they have to have advocates for their own cause, in the face of the needs of the rest of the community, the advocates are normally the people who also act for the sovereign power. </para>
        <para>When this happened the mining people had pegged the place out. They had put lines across it. The Aboriginal people raised this matter with us down here in the south. A number of us visited the area. In the first instance there was my friend the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> and myself. The people presented a petition to this Parliament. It was a celebrated petition in the form of a bark painting. Subsequently, the select committee made its recommendations. Not much notice was taken of those recommendations. So the lease was written for Nab al co, one of the great mining enterprises of the world. That was bad enough, but in the writing of the lease there was an extension so that when it is necessary for the company to have extra facilities available it will have the rights to those facilities. As far as I can see, it is almost a continuing right <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum</inline> and total in the geographical sense. For example, it covers ports, buildings and the expansion of the mining area. That is not within the spirit of this legislation. That is not what it is supposed to be about. That overwhelms any chance of the Aboriginal people owning the area. </para>
        <para>I regarded the whole operation by Nab al co and the Australian Government, and the impact which that had upon the people there, as a sad event in Australian social history. We have not done all that much towards repairing the situation. So I appeal to the Government and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as strongly as I can not to tolerate a continuation of this mining mystique in this situation. This of course raises another interesting piece of social philosophy, namely, the question of pre-existing contracts. In this case the contracts are in the mining lease. I do not think that if we were to assert the paramountcy of Aboriginal rights to the land in this situation Nab al co would leave this afternoon or tomorrow or before its 42 years were up. My friend the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> has pointed out the return which the mining companies receive in this instance. They are getting their pound of flesh over and over again. This legislation is not about Aboriginal land rights. It is about miners' rights. That was all right back at Eureka, but this is a different situation. I believe that we are abdicating our responsibilities. </para>
        <para>I speak as one who took an active part in the very beginnings of this matter. I mention this for the benefit of those honourable members who are sitting in the House and who are interested in the matter. It happened at that time that I came across advertisements in a Northern Territory newspaper advising that the company was going to apply for leases on the Gove Peninsula. It was stated on the bottom of the advertisement that objections could be lodged in the Warden's Court. I was going to Darwin so I sat down and lodged objections. I suppose that was one of the first instances in which Aboriginal land rights were claimed in a court. My action caused a great deal of difficulty for the mining companies and it raised a great deal of hostility on the part of the Government at that time. Some honourable members tried to have me put off the select committee because they said I had a personal interest in the matter. But they were not able to do that because on that occasion they did not have the numbers. So we soldiered on. Here we are still arguing the same case. I think the time has come when we should say that Aboriginal rights to land are superior to the rights of miners to the use of that land. If the land is to be used for mining it should be used for and on behalf of the Aboriginal people by some kind of authority, company or corporation which works on behalf of the Aboriginals, not for anyone else. </para>

          <para>- The Government does not accept the proposed amendment. I refer to two or three matters in order to clarify the position. The amendment which the Government has made to the Bill which I introduced on 4 June will preserve the special purpose leave granted to Nab al co at Gove under the special purpose lease ordinance and the Mining Gove Peninsula Nab al co Agreement Ordinance by ensuring that these are treated as land leases to be held in escrow and not mining interests. In other words, in the same way as the Bill preserves existing interests in land, in these respects the Bill preserves the special mining interests of the companies at Nabalco. </para>

        <para>I point out also to honourable members opposite that the Government has protected the Aboriginals in situations such as that at Gove and Groote Eylandt in that, where extensions are required to the interests in land of the companies  concerned pursuant to contractual obligations of the Commonwealth entered into with the companies, those companies must negotiate proper terms and conditions for any new lease. Where, however, the companies require new mineral leases, the granting of those new mineral leases will be subject to the same requirements of consent and negotiation of fair terms as all other mineral interests. </para>

          <para>- I would like to raise with the Minister a matter that has been referred to before. It concerns the exclusion of roads from grants of land to Aboriginal land trusts. The effect of clause 1 1 is along these lines. When the Minister is satisfied in terms of clause 50 that land should be granted to a Land Trust for the benefit of Aboriginals entitled to that land by Aboriginal tradition, land on which there is a road over which the public has a right of way is not included. Clause 11(3) states: </para>

        <para class="block">As the honourable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wallis)</inline> pointed out, it seems that Aboriginal people are being very greatly disadvantaged. Without labouring the point, it is contrary to the recommendations made under the tourism heading and under several other headings by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. It seems to me that it is important to mention that the Opposition feels gravely concerned about this and is obsessed with the conviction that the Aboriginal people will be languishing in great disadvantage as a result of the Government's intention to exclude roads from Aboriginal lands. As I understand the position, we are speaking not only about roads over which the public has a right of way but also about roads which might be created in the future. </para>
        <para>If this is the case, this could play havoc with Aboriginal traditional lands. If this situation was taken to the absurd stage, one could apply an L. J. Hooker type sub-division and mutilate and ruin the characteristics of the land as traditionally enjoyed by Aboriginal people. I do not really think that that is likely to happen but there are all kinds of intermediate levels of development about which one could speculate. In any event, if we look at the situation in Arnhem Land, at Oenpelli and at Maningrida, one already knows that if roads are disregarded as traditional land over which the Northern Territory Administration is to exercise its prerogative and rights which I have mentioned is an inferior concept to the concept of Aboriginal people exercising their right- an inundation of tourists can wreak havoc with Aboriginal life. The Aboriginal people will become spectacles posing for photographs. Any kind of white intrusion into a traditional area just brings about diminution of the traditional way of life. Obviously, this is a very important matter. I wonder what great conviction caused the Minister to disregard the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jusdee</inline> Woodward and all the other people with great knowledge and experience in these matters. Surely he knows, as one who has contemporaneously travelled over land in Aboriginal occupied areas would know, how devastating this can be. Clearly, the roads should be part of that traditional land administered under the provisions of this legislation. I wonder whether the Minister can throw any light on his departure from this principle. </para>

          <para>-I draw the attention of the Committee to subclause 2 of this clause. Sub-clause 9 makes it obligatory to reserve all minerals to the Crown in Aboriginal lands. I think this is reasonable in regard to the Aboriginal lands that will be added from time to time. With regard to the reserves, I hope that it would not be made obligatory to make these reservations in favour of the Crown. I do not say that they should never be made on reserves because it may be that, in cases where mineral rights have already been given, for example at Magellan and at Nabarlek, the reservations to the Crown should, of course, remain. I am speaking only of the lands set out in the schedule and not of other lands. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to give to the Aboriginals the normal mineral rights, with the exceptions of those areas in which some kind of mineral tenure is conceded already. </para>

        <para>I know it is said that this should not be done. It is said that this is not done for other people and should not be done for Aboriginals. This is not quite true. Old titles in most of the Australian States did carry mineral rights. Old titles in the Northern Territory, when it was under South Australian administration and some freehold was given, carried mineral rights. I am not suggesting for one moment that there should be a special arrangement in favour of Aboriginals. Rather I am suggesting that, in respect of the reserves and subject to the exceptions I have made, on these reserves the Aboriginals are holding the old title and as such should be treated on the same basis as those who held old titled.

I have not gone further than that. I have suggested only that this should be permissive rather man mandatory. I commend the amendment to the Minister and to the Committee. </para>

          <para>- The Government cannot accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> for a number of reasons. I will put to the Committee the 2 matters of substance. Firstly, the suggestion by the honourable member, admirable as it is, was not accepted either by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward in his report or by the previous Administration.  His  Honour wrestled with the question as to the nature of the rights which Aboriginals should have to minerals that might be found within Aboriginal land. It was put to him by one of the land councils that Aboriginals should have the absolute ownership of minerals found on Aboriginal land.  His  Honour rejected that and in its place granted to Aboriginals the veto power, as it is called- that is, the right to withhold consent to the grant of a mining interest over Aboriginal land, qualified however by the power in the Government to override that in the national interest, and qualified again by the power of Parliament to disallow the Government's action in invoking the national interest. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other matter that concerns the Government is that if the honourable member's amendment were followed through it would restrict Crown ownership of minerals in Aboriginal land to lands later granted on the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Commission and ensure that in the case of lands included in the Schedule- that is mainly the existing reserves freehold title would not be subject to reservation of minerals to the Crown. This would have the effect of separating those Aboriginals who obtained title to the existing reserves and other areas set out in the Schedule from those who later and by virtue of the machinery under the Bill obtain a title to their own traditional land. It seems to me that a point of distinction cannot be validly drawn between Aboriginal land which is traditional Aboriginal land and which presently is constituted by existing reserves, and other land, whether it be vacant Crown Land or alienated land, which later is found by the land commissioner to be traditional land and in respect of which on his recommendation a grant of title under the Bill is given to the Aboriginals concerned. </para>

        <para class="block">This matter concerns grants of interest in land the subject of a deed in escrow. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, where land is held in escrow by a land council, if a person seeks to renew his estate or interest in that land for a further period or to convert his interest an arbitrator appointed by the Minister to report on hardship that would be occasioned must give paramount consideration to the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owners. It is very difficult to see, given the tendering of anthropological evidence, that anything could really outweigh the hardship caused to Aboriginals by deprivation of their traditional land. The wording of the proposed amendment follows that which has been judicially interpreted by Australian courts, and it is hoped that this interpretation will be adopted by any person appointed arbitrator. </para>
        <para>However, without this amendment it seems clear that the criteria considered may be against the interests of Aboriginals. As honourable members will be aware, contemporary criteria particularly in the Northern Territory are often related to economic wellbeing. However, for Aboriginals no such claim as to the possibility of capital loss can be made. All they may offer to the arbitrator is their religious and traditional links with their land. It is hoped that the amendment will balance this redress and afford Aboriginals the special consideration that their claim warrants. I might add that this formula is taken from the former Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 when it was used in relation to the children of a marriage. It has been judicially interpreted. </para>
        <para>I suggest to the Minister that in such a situation, when we are talking about relative hardship, if on the one hand there is a mining interest or a person who is concerned with material interests and on the other hand there is an Aboriginal person who does not appear by contemporary standards and considerations to have much to lose, if those contemporary considerations are applied the Aboriginal person will be regarded as being the one who has least to lose. But, taking into account the criterion which has been proposed and the one which already has judicial acceptance in the matrimonial causes area- that paramount consideration has to be given to the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owner- he has a chance of getting a place m the sun. He would be unable to show that if his application were lost he would lose millions of dollars. He would be unable to show that he would be unable to continue living in a mansion or driving around in a Mercedes.  His  interests are relative interests. We must have proper regard for those relative interests- the interests of an Aboriginal person who is concerned with very basic things in life as compared with the interests of a person of considerable means, or the entrepreneurial kind of person who is establishing a mine- and clearly we must put the matter on an entirely different basis. It has to be weighted in favour of the Aboriginal person. </para>
        <para>Paramount consideration should be given to the person who is the subject of this legislation which is supposed to provide a benefit for the Aborigine. I put it to the Minister that, unless a consideration of this kind is to be accepted and is to apply, the application of this clause and the process of arbitrating will be extremely difficult. The Arbitrator will be left in a most unsatisfactory state of legal limbo. He will be living in the legalism of the twentieth century on the one hand whilst the interests of people taken into account are of bygone times. In fairness to the Arbitrator I put it to the Minister that he ought to adopt a provision which has found legal utilisation and legal effectiveness given in respect of children who would otherwise be disadvantaged in the matrimonial legislation. Aboriginal people unquestionably will be disadvantaged if they are put on the same interpretative basis in respect of this matter. </para>

          <para>-I should first like to explain the purposes of clause 13 and then refer to the particular provisions mentioned by the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> This clause prevents the Crown from granting interest in Aboriginal land the subject of a title deed held in escrow except where the Crown is obliged, under law, to grant such interest or the relevant land council consent or in the circumstances outlined in sub-clause 2(b). With respect to subclause 2 (b)(B). might I point out to the honourable gentleman that the provisions cast a burden upon the applicant to make out his case before the Arbitrator and thereby override the interests of the Aboriginals. In that sense, the applicant having such a burden, the interests of the Aboriginals are, by the force of the legislation, superior. That has the same effect as that which the honourable member is seeking, namely, to recognise the paramountcy of the Aboriginal interests. Therefore, it is not necessary for the Government to accede to the proposed amendment because, as I have indicated, the legislation already recognises the superiority of Aboriginal interests. I also mention that it does not refer to mining interests, but estates or interest in land. </para>

The Aboriginal people have waited 30 000 to 40 000 years for this legislation. It has been mooted for a long time by the present Government. I put it to the Minister in charge of the House that nothing deleterious will happen to the Aboriginal people if the debate is adjourned tonight and resumed tomorrow, Friday or even next week. Perhaps we could sit longer to debate this Bill. This question has been left unattended for a long time, for 175 years.

I know, for example that people of one Aboriginal reserve area, the Tanamai people, will be deprived of effective coverage. Their case has not even been mentioned at this stage. It is the last amendment of the 28 amendments that the Opposition will be moving. </para>

          <para>-The purpose of the amendment, as the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> pointed out, is to insert clause 56 of the 1975 Bill into this legislation. This new clause provides for the possibility of vesting land in Aboriginal councils for particular purposes, generally relating to needs, and is based on the recommendations of the Woodward report. In his first report the Commissioner suggested that local Aboriginal land be held on a community basis, a suggestion which was based on what the Commissioner felt to be a fairly clear consensus of Aboriginal opinion and because the Commission represented the basic political and social drift of Aborigines in modern society. However in paragraph 84 of the Commission's second report  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward stated that the system which he considered to be most in harmony with traditional Aboriginal social organisations was that of a trust made up of clan elders supported by an administrative organisation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Commissioner then noted that Aboriginal communities had appreciated the lack of practicability in vesting small areas of land in Aboriginal claims but also commented that as 'the most likely development over the next 50 years or so will be a gradual weakening of links with specific areas and sites and the strengthening of community identity with larger tracts of land' community ownership would be more appropriate at that time. To provide for this he recommended in paragraph 88 that legislation provide for both land ownership possibilities. The 1975 legislation catered for this, and this amendment makes a similar provision. This amendment will give effect to  His  Honour's point made in paragraph 88 that the form of ownership should not be forced along by the imposition of arrangements where they are not wanted and would not willingly be accepted or observed. For these reasons and to give flexibility to Aboriginal communities on this matter I commend the new clause to the Committee. </para>

          <para>- The Government cannot accept the amendment. The Bill as I have indicated before deals with traditional land rights. The granting of land to an Aboriginal council would not be in the nature of a traditional land right.  His  Honour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, at paragraph 89 of his report recommended the use of a trust, that is a land trust, in all cases for convenience of legislation and ease of understanding. The Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill which was passed recently by this chamber allows for the creation of Aboriginal councils and the holding of land by those councils. </para>

        <para class="block">I think that this is a matter of some practical importance to traditional Aboriginals. Some sites are known and some sites are made known by Aboriginals. Other sites are not known and not made known by their traditional owners. There are sites whose secrecy is part of their sacredness. This does not apply to all sites. In many cases the site referred to is not an art i fact, a painting on a wall or anything like that; it is simply a natural feature. The fact that this natural feature is sacred and is a site of significance means that it has to be concealed from everybody except the traditional people who are entitled to that knowledge. This is really fundamental to the nature and structure of Aboriginal society. By making it mandatory for these sites to be disclosed and put in a register we are violating one of the canons of Aboriginal society. </para>

            <para>- In many cases the sites can be described but not in every case. It is a real affront to Aboriginals to require them- as this clause does- to put sacred sites upon a register. It might be said that the register itself could be kept secret. Anybody who says this would not be really in touch with the nature of Aboriginal usage. Bad though it might be to disclose a site to a European, in Aboriginal eyes it would be far, far worse to describe and identify a site to another Aboriginal who was not entitled to know about it. It would be much worse to let another Aboriginal know than to let a European know. Until quite recently ceremonial murders have been committed in the centre of Australia just to protect the sacredness of this knowledge. This is something we may laugh at as some people would laugh at masonic secrecy or something of that character. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>It is absolutely fundamental to Aboriginal society that some things should be kept secret especially from other Aboriginals who are not permitted to know about them. This incidentally, is one of the main coherent forces which has kept Aboriginal society together in the past. It is a fact that Aboriginal society has remained together because the knowledge which is the authority has been kept compartmentalised. This is a matter which does not have any practical significance for anybody except Aboriginals. I am not suggesting that, where sites can be disclosed by Aboriginal usage, they should not be disclosed. But because apparently this aspect has not been sufficiently considered, I most earnestly ask the Government to add after the words 'disclosure of the sites for a register' the words insofar as such can be done without breach for Aboriginal usage'. It is for the Aboriginals themselves to say from time to time what their usage and traditional customs are. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> in his remarks regarding these sites and lands. What has been said by people from the Northern Territory, supported by tel exes, telegrams and letters from the traditional owners of Aboriginal land, is that they do not wish to have large councils and trusts. They have said that again and again and again. They say this because the concept of the compilation of a register of their lands which are once again tied to their Touring and their beliefs is something which relates in many cases to matters which are secret to them. This is what we have been saying over and over again. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> and the Government would be well advised to take note of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mackellar and also to take note of what the Aboriginal people are saying in this respect. This is so much a part of their complete history. We are trying to impose on them a concept of which they have no real understanding. The advice which came to the Labor Government and which has come to this Government on this aspect has not been given by these people; it has come from those whose job it is to advise those governments. If the Government persists with the present proposal without adopting the amendment it will be breaking across traditional Aboriginal beliefs. </para>

          <para>- The amendment which the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> has moved is implicit in the legislation because, from their very nature, identification and mapping of such sites would not be done in breach of Aboriginal usage. The intention of the amendment apparently is to ensure that the register does not record, or at least does not make available to unauthorised persons, information on secret or sacred matters. There is no reason whatever why the recording and mapping of sites for the purpose of identifying clan areas- and that is the purpose of this work- need incorporate any such material. It could be done by the simple location and nomination of sites without additional information and might often be done without referring to the most sacred or dangerous sites, and certainly without including any secret or sacred information. It seems preferable to leave a matter of this kind to the Aboriginals of the land councils who are themselves well versed in Aboriginal lore and custom. Indeed, there is already throughout Australia mapping of such sites. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies undertakes this kind of work, as I am sure the honourable member for Mackellar would acknowledge. However, I do acknowledge the force of what the honourable member says. For that reason, I am prepared to accede to the amendment. However, I do not accept the force of the reasons advanced in support of the amendment- I must say with respect- by the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder).</inline> The advice received by this Government on the contents of this Bill has come from traditional Aboriginal land owners and others who have traditional interests in Aboriginal land. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Chairman,</inline>I believe that a brief explanation of the purpose of this amendment is in order. The force of a proclamation is raised in this clause. It is our belief that the proclamation ought to have some of the force of regulations before the Parliament. If somebody moves for the disallowance of a regulation, that regulation is prevented from being implemented unless it is discussed within 1 5 sitting days. One of the difficulties with a proclamation is that it does not carry some of the force of a regulation. We think that its powers ought to be strengthened so that the Parliament can discuss each proclamation. In fact, the Parliament must discuss each proclamation. The problem with a proclamation at present is that it does not need to be discussed. If somebody moves for the disallowance of a regulation, that brings the matter before the Parliament for discussion. We propose to add the 2 techniques used by the Parliament together. I think we produce better parliamentary scrutiny of what is proposed by this amendment. </para>

I do not think this would be to the advantage of either community. In this respect I am thinking particularly of the advantage of the Aboriginal community. I think it would help Aboriginals if there were some kind of cut-off date to which they could work, because this would absolve them from continual bitterness and all sorts of fin angling which otherwise might go on. </para>

          <para>- I support these amendments for the reasons stated by the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> A backlash and so on might arise in the Northern Territory. This Bill is designed supposedly to help the traditional owners, the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. That is fair enough. But, if there is not some time decided upon after which claims cannot be made for areas- whether they be mining areas, pastoral areas, or what ever- we will not have development such as that carried out by the Gem co company on Groote Eylandt, at Gove, or at any other place, from which the Aborigines might derive considerable income. Therefore there will tend to be no development from which they can receive the considerable funds envisaged in this Bill to finance the councils and trusts, the benefit trust fund and so on. If we wish the Territory to be developed and the Aborigines to gain from that development, which is their right and of which we all are in favour, there should be some arrangement in this Bill which will give people investing risk capital in the Territory-most of the money invested in the Territory is risk capital some confidence that they will have security of their leases, whether they be pastoral, mining or whatever. </para>

          <para>- The Government cannot accept either of the proposed amendments. The first amendment deals with vacant Crown land and the second with alienated Crown land. That distinction needs to be borne in mind when considering the amendments. The first proposed amendment would give Aboriginals only 12 months in which to lodge claims to vacant Crown land. There has been a freeze against the alienation of any vacant Crown land until 31 December this year, pending the lodgment of any claims by Aboriginals to any part of that vacant Crown land. After 3 1 December this year there will be no alienation in respect of any land for which a claim has been made. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is difficult to see any reason to increase the existing pressure on Aboriginals to lodge such claims, since this is likely to induce them to make hasty or even unwise claims to land which is waste and likely to remain so. In this respect I refer the Committee to what was said by  His  Honour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, at paragraph 161 of his report.

          <para>This is equally true of much of the remaining unalienated Crown lands. Aboriginal people should think carefully before laying claim to any areas which are not going to be of value to them- particularly since they have unimpeded access to this country at present if they want to visit it for any traditional purposes. </para>

        <para class="block">I am quite satisfied that, as the present claims or pending claims are worked out, there will be no clash between other interests in the Northern Territory and Aboriginals in respect of the balance of vacant Crown land. </para>
        <para>The second amendment would require the Land Commissioner to complete his inquiry which is authorised under the Bill and his report on claims to alienated land within 18 months. This seems quite impracticable, being too short a time, given the likely pressure on the Commissioner to report on claims to vacant land and land leased by Aboriginals, such as Wave Hill, Willowra, Kildurk and the Tanami Desert. It also seems undesirable, since it is a difficult task which might properly take several years to complete satisfactorily, depending on the interest of Aboriginals in lodging claims and the Commissioner's ability to compile an adequate register of land owning groups outside reserves. If the Commissioner is given the time to make his inquiry, based on evidence put before him, and with objectivity, I am quite sure that there will not be any pressure on existing interests holding alienated Crown land, or undue pressure on Aboriginals, and there will not be any clash between Aboriginals and others in the Northern Territory. </para>

        <para class="block">I am heartened by recent events. I do not know whether they provide a licence to say a few words on this amendment. It is an important one. The Opposition proposes to delete clause 69 and to insert a new clause in relation to sacred sites. The Northern Territory legislature has a very disappointing record in regard to the protection of sacred sites. It has declared only 6 sites in 18 years. It seems that there are good reasons why we should have regard for the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward that this matter be the subject of Federal legislation. The Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders recently reported on this matter and recommended, in particular, that this matter remain the responsibility of the Australian Par.liament and Government. As honourable members would know, that Committee is chaired by a Government member, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> Its report was a unanimous one. It represented the views of both sides of the Parliament. At least among these informed people there is an attitude which is at variance with the one that the Government is incorporating in this legislation. </para>
        <para>The proposed new clause makes it an offence knowingly to damage or desecrate a site of significance to Aboriginal tradition. Sub-clause (3) lists defences against a prosecution under this clause. Sub-clause (4) provides for the declaration by regulation of sites of significance. It is not intended that all sites of significance be declared. In many cases Aborigines are unwilling to reveal the location of such sites. Existing protection for aU sites under the Native and Historical Objects Preservation Ordinance is inadequate because acquisition with compensation must occur before a site may be designated or protected in any way. The recent comment of the Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly is important. He said that the Assembly would try to identify and specify sacred sites. Even taken with the assurances expressed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> it is so general that honourable members opposite will see why Aboriginals, in particular the elders, of almost every clan in the Territory have made representations to have this matter legislated for and regulated by the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>The Committee of the Whole will recollect what the Minister said in his second reading speech, the good intentions and assurances of both the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> and the Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly. It seems to me that it is a very poor way to do business, to be stacking all our hopes and aspirations in respect of these matters on good intent rather than on matters that are properly prescribed in legislation. The question of the preservation of sacred sites has been the subject of very great indifference and neglect on the part of the Northern Territory legislature in the past. It is very difficult to generalise and to indict an entire legislature for what has happened, but I think it is fair to say that if one has regard to the history of the legislative body in the Northern Territory in respect of this matter one would hardly regard it as a body that is inspired with and obsessed by the need to act effectively on this matter. It is another matter for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward recommended the Australian Government should have responsibility. There is no question that the Aboriginal 1&gt;eople would like that. The effect of my very lengthy amendment is to provide for the acceptance of Commonwealth responsibility for this matter. </para>

          <para>-What I want to say relates not only to this amendment but also to subsequent amendments. The Opposition has been saying quite a lot by way of denigration of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I think the words that the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> used should be rebuted. He talked about the unenviable record of the legislature of the Northern Territory. Already my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> has sought to put the record straight. It is in this context, and in the context of those words, that I pay tribute to the pioneering work on the subject of Aboriginal land rights which has been undertaken over the years by the Northern Territory legislature. Apparently members opposite do not know that many of the principles governing land rights were considered initially in the Northern Territory Legislative Council in the 1960s by people familiar with the needs and traditions of the Aboriginals, developed over many years of direct association with those people. I believe that it was from those debates that the first recognition of land rights for the Aboriginal people emerged. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In 1964 the Northern Territory Legislative Council appointed a committee on Aboriginal integration. In May 1965 the committee, in tabling one of its reports, proposed the first steps to give effect to land tenure for Aboriginals on reserves. In August 1966 a Bill dealing with land titles for Aboriginals was introduced by a private member of that Council, but this initiative was overtaken by a further Bill sponsored by the Federal Government. This latter legislation came into effect in 1970. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ralph</inline> Hunt, the then Minister for the Interior, was able to approve a grant of over 70 leases to Aboriginals before the change of government in 1972. </para>
        <para>I thank sincerely the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> for his consultation with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, his time and the co-operative discussion on a large number of occasions with the Assembly. The Assembly is most anxious to give full cooperation to the Government. Indeed, it may well indicate the path for co-operation in legislation which eventually will reach far beyond the Northern Territory. I do not believe that sufficient recognition has been given by the Opposition and critics of the responsible approach adopted by the Northern Territory legislature to the question of land rights, especially in earlier years when the subject was less fashionable than it is now. </para>
        <para>I remind the Parliament that the large schedule of land to be declared Aboriginal land under this Bill was set aside and protected over the years for the benefit of Aboriginals under the authority of the Northern Territory ordinances, not by legislation passed by this Parliament. The responsible approach adopted by the Northern Territory legislature in the past gives every reason for confidence that the complementary legislation entrusted to the Legislative Assembly by this Bill will be wholly in harmony with the objectives of the Government and will fully protect the interests of the Aboriginal people of the Territory. That is the sort of undertaking which I and the Assembly have given to the Minister. I do not take very kindly to the remarks of members of the Opposition about the attitude of the Assembly. I do not think it is worthy of them. </para>

          <para>-The Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> can talk at great length, but the facts are that over the years the general membership of the Northern Territory legislature, particularly the political philosophy of the membership of the present Legislative Assembly, has been the principal factor in holding back the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Minister said that the Assembly would co-operate with the Government. That does not fill me with any glee. This legislation is designed to entrench the capacity of miners to mine on Aboriginal lands. It does not confer any absolute right at all. It is there until it is required to be used for something else. That has been the case with all the legislation that has come through the Legislative Council, as it was previously known, and the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory by proclamation, by ordinance or by any other means. I have sat here for 2 1 years now and watched the operation - </para>

I might be here longer than some of the people barking over there in possum corner, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calwell</inline> used to call it. The facts are that every possible step that could be taken to stultify and frustrate the development of the rights of the Aboriginal people of Australia has emanated  principally  from the National Country Party, and its principal spokesmen have been people like the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> and the members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, as it is now called. As I said before, this Bill is simply the continual entrenchment of vested rights, particularly in mining areas but also in pastoral areas, by the people of the Northern Territory. It is a step in the right direction but it is a very small step indeed. It does not matter what the Minister says in any form of sophistry that he happens to bring to this matter- he cannot ClOUd the issue. The facts are that unless this Parliament takes the initiative, takes up its own duties and establishes Aboriginal rights, these rights will never be protected. </para>

            <para>- Yes, they did. They fought 3 elections on that proposal and they were defeated every time. Finally, they were utterly defeated and as a result there are now no Labor members on the Legislative Assembly. That is why the Labor Party is now so crooked on the Legislative Assembly. It is just a case of sour grapes. The members of the Legislative Assembly have been working on Aboriginal land legislation for longer than the honourable member has, and they know far more about it than do many other people in this chamber who are interested in this subject. </para>

Might I refer the Opposition to the provisions of clause 73 ( 1 ) (a) which will require the Legislative Assembly ordinances to accord with certain stipulations that are directed towards protecting the interests of Aboriginals. Might I also with respect to the amendment refer members of the Opposition to sub-clause (6) and point out to them what they are proposing to do with regard to sacred sites which they seek to protect. That sub-clause envisages the legal desecration of sacred sites in relation to a mining operation. Not only that, a proposal of this nature negates the whole intention of this section as it further envisages the sale of a sacred site to mining interests. That is the proposal put forward by members of the Opposition who are so intent on denigrating mining in the name of upholding Aboriginal interests. </para>

The fact is that a person can get an interest or an estate which can be quite massive in size and say that Aboriginal people are not allowed entry. This provision can be used or invoked to deprive Aboriginal people of the use of their land. It is a very serious matter. It is just another one of the more recent issues that have come before the Committee, which really cut the whole basis of the Woodward recommendations down to a level where what remains is of infinitesimal benefit to the Aboriginal people. I express great concern that the hour will not allow the Committee to go into this matter in greater depth. </para><para>Amendment negatived. </para><para>Clause agreed to. </para><para>Clause 72 agreed to. </para><para>Clause 73 (Reciprocal legislation of the Northern Territory) </para></speech>

          <para>- I want to oppose clause 73. With proper respect for my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> and his impassioned defence of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, let us transfer this to another medium. Clause 73 leaves certain responsibilities to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. That may very well be a sound procedure in some instances, but it is not in this instance. The Minister is responsible for a certain area of this legislation. The land councils and land trusts are also a part of the system. We have interposed the Legislative Assembly and we expect it to carry out certain complementary operations. This seems to me to be a totally unnecessary complication of the system. Regardless of the composition of the Legislative Assembly and of its political philosophy, I think it is totally wrong for us to implement legislation here which puts this final complication into the Act. It will only bedevil the system right from the beginning. I think it is an unwarranted concession to whatever happens to be the sacred State rights that prevail somewhere north of the boundary of the Northern Territory. I appeal to the Minister to take a good look at this clause and not to complicate the system. Australia is nearly ungovernable as it presently stands. To put this piece of nonsense into the situation is totally unnecessary. In fact, we ought to send that advice to Britain. </para>

          <para>- I think a point has been raised here which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> will well understand when this Bill is debated in the other place. I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will ask the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> who will be in charge of the Bill, to look at this clause extremely carefully because it questions our rights in relation to what we have responsibility for when compared with State rights. When it comes to wildlife and certain other aspects I believe the Commonwealth should soil hold that power. </para>

The deletion of the area known as the Tanami region, the traditional land of the Warlpiri people, based principally at Yuendumu and Hooker Creek is in complete contrast to the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. The Commissioner in his second report, stated: </para><quote>
        <para>As for the . . . Tanami Desert, I am satisfied that there are sufficiently close ties between Aborigines still living nearby and those lands to justify their immediate transfer to Aboriginal ownership . . . </para>
      </quote><para class="block">This clear statement was accepted by the previous Government The land owners of the Tanami Desert were included in the schedule to the 1 975 Bill. This provision was in the Bill which was introduced in June of this year, but the Minister has since attributed that fact to a printer's error. I simply say that for reasons known only to the Minister it has been deleted from this Bill. We were told by the Minister in his second reading speech that the area was included as a mistake. No further explanation, other than that, was added. I think an explanation is due tonight. The insult to the Warlpiri people is clear, and their concern is equally clear. In a letter to the Minister on the third of this month they rejected the Government's move and requested an alteration to the Schedule so that their land would be put back under the operation of this Bill. However, on 17 November the Minister rejected their request. </para><para>These people have been seeking to have this land transferred to their ownership for almost 41 years. The first application was made in 1935 only 7 years after they suffered the last known Aboriginal massacre in Australian history when 31 members of their tribe were murdered in revenge killings. There is considerable documentation here which I would like to have dealt with. I imagine that this matter might be handled effectively in another place. Probably some of this material will be incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of that place. At this stage I prefer to convey to the Minister the fact that the Opposition is very seriously concerned about this matter. I want him to have sufficient time to deal with it. Supporters of the Government may like to say something about the matter; so I conclude my remarks and hope that there will be a satisfactory response. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The Aid acted at the request of the Board of Directors of Poseidon Ltd in appointing a receiver to the company to stabilise the situation and enable negotiations concerning the future role of Poseidon in the Windarra Nickel joint venture to be settled. </para>
            <para>The AIDC's loan to Poseidon is an important investment in the Corporation's financing of Australian Development, though by no means its largest. </para>
            <para>The AIDC's investment is secured by a first charge over Poseidon's share of a valuable resource, being developed in association with Western Mining Corporation as operational manager of the venture. The AIDC's financial position is thus not materially affected by the immediate financial difficulties of the Poseidon company. </para>
            <para>It follows that any imputation that the Aid acted improperly in not referring to Poseidon's financial difficulties in its loan documentation is without foundation. It is not the function of the Aid to make public comment on the affairs of a client company whose situation does not affect the financial position of the Corporation itself. </para>
            <para>The Aid did not advance $250,000 a week to Poseidon. In fact, from January 1976 until after the loan had closed, the Aid had only advanced a single amount of $ 1 1 7,000 of bridging finance which was subsequently repaid. Now that the company is in receivership, the Aid is of course providing the Receiver Manager with funds as necessary to maintain contributions to the Windarra development while Poseidon 's future is being determined.

Because of the general concessional rebate for resident individuals, no tax was payable for the 1975-76 income year by a child whose taxable income was less than $2,519 or by a trustee where the income to which a minor child was presently entitled was less than $2,519. With indexation, the corresponding tax thresh hold for the 1 976-77 income year is $2,846. </para>

          <para>Prior to the 1976-77 income year the concessional deduction or rebate to which a parent was entitled for the maintenance of a child was reduced on a sliding scale, and the tax payable by the parent thus increased, where the separate net income of the child exceeded a specified level. This was $ 150 in1975-76 and the $200 rebate for a student, for example, was eliminated entirely when the student's separate income reached $950. As from I July 1976 the replacement of rebates for dependent children by increased family allowances means that a child's separate income can no longer affect, by way of reduction in concessional rebates, the amount of tax payable by the parent or guardian. I understand, however, that in determining eligibility for payment of family allowance in respect of a student child aged between 18 and 25 years, the amount of income of the student is taken into account in deciding whether the student is dependent on the claimant. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The honourable member should be aware that it is not possible to reach firm conclusions about the likely deficit for the year as a whole on the basis of figures for the first few months only. At the very least it is important to look at the movements in outlays and receipts and to take account of any special factors bearing upon those movements. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Figures are now available for the first four months of 1976-77 and show a deficit of $2,859m, compared with the budgeted estimate for the year of $2,608m. However, an examination of the figures shows that outlays in the four months to October were 10.6 per cent higher than in the corresponding months a year earner, this rate of increase is marginally below the Budget estimate of an increase of 1 1.3 per cent for the year as a whole. Movements in outlays throughout the year are affected by the incidence of pay-days and other 'lumpy' transactions, but movements to date are broadly in line with the Budget estimate. </para>
          <para>It is the slow rate of growth of receipts- relative to the Budget estimate- which is responsible for the large deficit to date; total receipts in the four months to October were 1 1.0 per cent higher than in the corresponding months a year earlier, which compares with the Budget estimate of an increase of 18.8 per cent for the year as a whole. The relatively low increase in the most recent period, however, was largely a reflection of the fact that there was no quarterly collection of company tax in the first four months of this year. </para>
          <para>Because of the marked seasonal pattern in collections of tax from companies and non-PAYE individuals, further sizeable monthly deficits can be expected before the accounts swing into surplus next March or April. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2">
              <para>) The Budget estimates are subject to many assumptions and influences and it is inevitable that a number of revisions -in both directions-will be called for as the year progresses. At this time, however, there is no reason to believe that the outcome for the deficit will be substantially different from the Budget estimate of $2,608m. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The primary purpose of the Fund is to meet any losses incurred as a result of maintaining the reserve price operations at wool auctions since the floor price policy was introduced in the 1974-75 season. Until the scheme is terminated it is provided that any money standing to the credit of the Fund may be used by the Australian Wool Corporation for the purchase of wool in the performance of its functions or in the payment of advances to growers, the marketing of whose wool has been delayed by reason of the exercise of the powers and functions of the Corporation, or it may be invested. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(">
              <para>2 ) The Fund is financed by a tax of 5 per cent on the gross sales value of shorn wool sold. In addition, there is payable into the Fund any income derived from the investment of money standing to the credit of the Fund; interest received on advances to growers; interest on moneys standing to the credit of the Fund and used by the Corporation for the purchase of wool. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Yes. The Australian Wool Corporation receives information from the Commissioner of Taxation and arrangements have been made by the Corporation with the National Council of Wool-Selling Brokers of Australia for each broker to maintain a full record of tax deducted from account sales. Private buyers of wool and other dealers provide the Corporation with monthly lists of their transactions containing an identification of names and addresses of growers with whom they deal in wool. These records will be maintained until a decision is taken on the disposal of any final balance remaining to the credit of the Fund. </para>

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>The balance of the Market Support Fund at 31 October 1976 was approximately $36.5m. A hypothetical assessment of the possible state of the Fund, if the Corporation was able to sell the entire stockpile of wool it had purchased under the stockpile arrangement, at current market prices, requires a range of further assumptions to be made. The question therefore requests an answer to a set of hypothetical circumstances. If the Corporation were to sell the total inventory before the end of 1976 at current prices, the credit balance in the Fund would be possibly of the order of $90m. Assuming, in addition, the continuation of the existing wool tax until June 1977, the revenue from the wool tax plus interest earned on money standing to the credit of the Fund could produce a hypothetical balance of some $135m by 30 June 1976. </para>

            <para>Australia signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 18 December 1972 and ratified it on 10 December 1975: the delay in ratifying the Covenant thus took place under the previous Government. I am informed that the Covenant was not ratified earlier because it had been suggested that both the Inter anti on al Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights should be ratified at the same time. I am further informed that when it was decided not to pursue the original proposal to implement the terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in legislation, it was thought desirable to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at that stage and examine, separately, what domestic problems were required to be overcome to make it possible for Australia to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </para>

It would, therefore, not seem to be in keeping with such a policy for Ministers or members of the Commonwealth Public Service to visit Southern Rhodesia in any official capacity. This does not mean, however, that backbench members of any party in the Parliament, acting in their personal capacity, should not visit Southern Rhodesia to gain information on the situation there; </para>

              <para>Articles in the Western Press have reported the construction of a new barrier on the border between the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). This construction is said to be the fourth barrier to be raised along the border since World War II. It is understood that work on this barrier began in April 1976 and is now about two-thirds completed. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The new barrier extends over approximately 1346 km of the Gar's total borders which is about 60 per cent of the total Gar frontier with other countries. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>The barrier currently being erected stands on the border between the Gar and the FRG. There is also a barrier separating West Berlin from the territory of the Gar. </para>

            <item label="(5)">
              <para>Figures on the number of people who have left the Gar illegally since 1945 vary from source to source. One source claims that over 3 million Gar citizens have left the country illegally since 1949, and that 173 people have lost their lives attempting to leave the Gar for West Germany or West Berlin since the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Other sources put the figure of deaths at between 200 and 500 people. No cases are known of people losing their lives attempting to enter the Gar illegally, although many arrests of ' illegal immigrants' have been made by the Gar authorities. A recent case involved the arrest of a West Berliner who ran across the border waving a black flag in protest at the action of Gar border guards m shooting down a would-be defector at the Berlin Wall. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(6)">
              <para>The official Gar explanation for the barrier between the Gar and the FRG is that it is a normal border installation on the border between sovereign States, and that the controls exercised at the border are normal controls exercised by any sovereign State on its frontiers. The Gar claims that the barriers have been erected to protect its territorial integrity and to prevent incursion into the Gar by militaristic and re van chi st elements' from the West and to prevent the luring of Gar citizens to the West with 'propaganda ' and ' false promises '. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(7)">
              <para>The barriers between the Gar and the FRG were established after the illegal departure of almost 2.5 million people from the Gar for the FRG. After the border with the FRG had been effectively sealed, the main departure point became West Berlin and in August 1961 construction began on a wall to seal off West Berlin from the territory of the Gar. This reduced the flow of illegal departures substantially. As the total population has declined since the creation of the Gar, the authorities there obviously feel it necessary to maintain an effective control over emigration from the country. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Priorities Review Staff Report on Early Childhood Services tabled on 30 July 1 974 refers to ' a scheme for classifying local government areas according to need' developed by the Social Welfare Commission, and went on to give some examples of local government areas for the three categories of highest priority as put forward in that scheme. </para>
          <para>The table below sets out by State and by time period of the initial approval related to each particular centre, the number of centres approved for assistance under the Child Care Act 1972 in each of the three categories of highest priority of the five-point rating scale developed by the Social Welfare Commission. </para>
          <para>In all, 232 child care centres have been approved for capital and/or recurrent assistance under the Child Care Act to date. Of these five are in the Australian Capital Territory and three in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The 101 other centres or proposed other centres in the States for which capital and/or recurrent grants have been approved are located in local government areas of a higher socio-economic category than those specified in the above table. </para>
          <para>In this regard, three points are made: the socio-economic category rating is a broad scheme that does not specifically identify pockets of need in otherwise relatively affluent areas; the placement of child care centres needs to take into account such factors as major transport routes and thus convenience to clients who may not necessarily live in the immediate area of the centre; a number of centres being assisted under the Child Care Act existed before that legislation was enacted. </para>
          <para>The honourable member's attention is drawn to the situation that assistance has also been made available outside the provisions of the Child Care Act 1972, both through the States and directly to organisations for the establishment and/or operation of multifunctional and integrated projects providing a range of care and developmental services for children, including full and part-time day care and outside school hours care. </para>

Allowances have been increased substantially, by up to 40 per cent in the case of students who are independent of parental support; the limit of family income at which the maximum allowance is payable has been increased and requirements relating to the student's program have been eased where a student is unable to undertake a full study load because of course requirements or arising out of a direction by the student 's institution. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>These changes will have the effect of enabling a number of students who did not qualify for benefits in 1976 to receive assistance in 1977. </para>
          <para>However, students who receive assistance from other Commonwealth awards will no longer be eligible for Tertiary Education Assistance. Other students who receive substantial amounts from employment or from other, nonCommonwealth awards will have their allowances reduced. The number who will be affected in 1 977 is not known. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Williams Committee, which in 1975 reviewed the scheme, recommended that a student's own income should be means tested over the calendar year, since the allowance is intended to contribute to the support of the student for the calendar year, and not only the academic year. The Government has accepted this recommendation. Students who in 1977 will earn more than $ 1 500, however, will not automatically lose their allowance. For every $2 earned in excess of $1500 a student's allowance will be reduced by $1. Previously the reduction for dependent students was $1 for $1 and that for independent students was $ 1 for every $1.50. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Government is mindful that not all students who work during the long vacation also work part-time during the year. In these cases income earned may not exceed $1500 and the issue would not arise. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>There are two aspects to this question. In the first place, bonded teacher trainees have always been ineligible. Some states have moved recently to provide unbounded teacher training scholarships. Students are currently able to receive up to $600 from unbounded scholarships without affecting their allowances. In arriving at its decision to reduce this amount to $150 from 1977, the Government accepted the recommendation of the Williams Committee on this matter. The Committee felt that an amount as high as $600 ran contrary to the purpose of the means test designed to measure the level of support required by needy students. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>The maximum allowance of $43 per week payable to independent students in 1977 will represent an increase of more than $12 per week over the 1976 figure. Increases for dependent students are $7 per week for those living away from home and $5 per week for those living at home. </para>

          <para>In 1 976, 27 per cent of all TEAS beneficiaries were receiving maximum independent rates. An additional 48 per cent were receiving the maximum amount applicable to the two categories of dependent students. It must be assumed that the remainder received some support from either their own resources or their families. </para>

              <para>Government and Catholic education authorities in each State are responsible for developing procedures for determining which of their schools should be declared as disadvantaged, and a variety of measures of the socioeconomic nature of the communities served by the schools are employed in these selection processes. I understand that most States are using scales based upon the work of Broom, Jones and Zubrycki as a part of their procedures; it is my information that in all such instances other measures- such as the incidence of non-English speaking migrants, student retention rates, truancy, pupil performance, for example are also used, and that local knowledge and common sense play a large part in the determination of which schools should participate in the Disadvantaged Schools Program. </para>
