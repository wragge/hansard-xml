          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>Richard Gardiner Casey died on 1 7 June. In the history of our country few men have attracted, or earned, the respect due and paid to Lord Casey. Not only was his public contribution one of great distinction and lasting value; he was also a man of integrity and enormous common sense. He was the kind of man who imparted stature to the institutions he served. The Australian people can count themselves immensely fortunate to have had him as a servant over such a long period. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When I became a member of this Parliament in 1955 I found that Dick Casey was always prepared to listen and to help. One of his great qualities was that he was always prepared to assist younger people and to share his experience with them. I first came to know R. G. Casey through my family. He and my father were close friends over many years. They grew up together and they went to school and university together. I recall that they were both interested in automobiles, a part of history that might not be widely known. </para>
        <para>Lord Casey was an engineer by training, and proud of it. He wanted to understand how things worked and why. He always believed that the more engineers in Parliament the better it would be. At one stage my father and he became interested in a new engine designed by A. G. M. Mic hell. I am advised that at the time there were discussions about the engine with 2 major American firms but unfortunately, even though apparently the engine went very close to being sold to one of those firms, the sale did not quite come off. The Depression hit immediately afterwards, and that was the end of a radical new design motor. It was typical of Lord Casey that he would try to help someone with a good idea. They attempted to promote the engine. They were unsuccessful. </para>
        <para>One of Lord Casey&#39;s most impressive characteristics was his immense capacity for work. His industry was remarkable, and it was this extraordinary application that enabled him to undertake so many careers in the course of his lifetime. He was, at one time or another, a soldier, an administrator, a politician, a diplomat and a ViceRegal personage. In all of these careers he served with conspicuous success. In 1 9 1 4 he volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force and served with distinction at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. He was mentioned in dispatches, and for his valour he won the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross. </para>
        <para>From 1924 to 1931 he served his country in the External Affairs Department as Australian political liaison officer in London. His political career commenced in 1931 when he became a member of this House for the seat of Corio, a seat he held until his first resignation from the Parliament in 1940. During the period of the great Depression he served in several portfolios. He was Assistant Federal Treasurer from 1933 to 1935 and Federal Treasurer from 1935 to 1939. As Treasurer he took an active role in the development of a national insurance scheme which, for reasons beyond his control, was never implemented. From 1937 to 1939 he was Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research- an association he continued after the war and through his retirement and one of great lasting benefit to that organisation and to the nation. </para>
        <para>Lord Casey was a Liberal in the full sense. He was a man of progressive instincts, not fearful of change. He welcomed the challenge of a new circumstance, a new job. He was often ahead of his time and keen to play a part in defining a new role for his country. He represented Australia to the world in a critical period of our history. In 1940 Lord Casey resigned from the Parliament to become the first Australian Minister to Washington. He used his great energies in making sure that Australia&#39;s position was well known to the American Administration and the  President  of the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roosevelt.</inline> In 1942 at the request of the British Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Winston</inline> Churchill, Lord Casey assumed the position of Minister of State for the Middle East and had the rank of Cabinet Minister in the British War Cabinet. Speaking in the early part of this decade about the controversy that surrounded his acceptance of such a post, he remarked that such an appointment in the Middle East was far more important than the post he had left in Washington. He appreciated the need for Australia to recognise that its security depended on events in a number of areas of the world. </para>
        <para>In 1943 he took up his first Vice-Regal position as Governor of Bengal. During his time there from 1943 to 1946 he experienced at first hand contacts with leaders of the Indian nation which would stand him in good stead when he assumed responsibility for Australia&#39;s foreign policy. In 1949, in that vital election for Australia&#39;s future, Lord Casey returned to active politics as the representative for the seat of La Trobe. He held the seat until his retirement from politics in 1960. In 2 tasks which he undertook following the 1949 election he showed again the importance he placed on looking to the future and his concern that Australia should develop into a strong outward looking and tolerant nation. Immediately after the election he became Minister for Works and Housing and continued his involvement with the CSIRO, being Minister in charge from 1950 to 1960. It was in 195 1 that he became Minister for External Affairs and he held the post until his retirement. Looking ahead as always, he worked to establish a new set of relationships with the countries of our region.  His  permanent head at the time has recently recorded that Lord Casey&#39;s statements during his visit to Japan in 1 95 1 marked the first real movement from enmity to close co-operation between Australia and Japan. He appreciated the great significance of Australia&#39;s location close to the new states emerging in Asia and moved rapidly to expand our representation in the region. Earlier than most, he foresaw the importance of bringing China into the international community. He was always a realist about the world and never feared to see facts as they were.  His  advice was wise, his judgment sound. </para>
        <para>Lord Casey&#39;s career showed that deep patriotism could be combined with an outward-looking and humane international perspective. In 1965 he assumed a post for which he was superbly equipped- the Governor-Generalship. He had much of value to say. He used the position to dignify Australia and to symbolise the standards of public and private behaviour we all should strive to achieve. In his life he was assisted at all times by his wife, Lady Casey- a remarkable woman in her own right. She was to him, in all of his careers, a great comfort and a point of courage. This was exemplified by her devoted action of daily attendance at his hospital bed after his serious motor accident in 1 974. </para>
        <para>Richard Gardiner Casey upheld the highest standards of public life and in his private life was unfailingly generous and kindly. What he achieved he earned by his industry, his courage, his integrity and his humanity. He loved Australia, and because of his life we have a better sense of ourselves and what we can become. To Lady Casey and to her son and daughter I extend, on behalf of the Government, my deepest sympathy at the loss of a husband and a father. Australia has lost a devoted servant. I move: </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I support the motion. Lord Casey was a man of the greatest distinction and the highest distinctions. He was the most far-sighted and accomplished Liberal Foreign Minister Australia has produced in the post-war era and one of the most eminent Australians of his generation. He had a greater international reputation than many British contemporaries. He was better known in imperial and global councils than many fellow Australians who were to rise to higher office in his own country. In 1969 the Queen made him a Knight of the Garter, the highest honour she can award on her own initiative and the most ancient secular honour still awarded in the world. He was the 936th knight in over 6 centuries. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He was a man of unquestionable integrity, high principle, singular urbanity and personal charm, with valuable gifts as a diplomat and politician. No criticism one could make of him, even on this occasion, can alter our judgment of him as a great Australian. Indeed, it would do slight service to the memory of a man of such attainment if the shortcomings of his career or any limitations in his vision or judgment were glossed over in perfunctory tributes. His career had 3 main phases- that of the war and post-war years, then as Foreign Minister and finally as Governor-General. The first prepared him for the second, and the third was a reward for the other two. His 4 years as Treasurer, his membership of the British War Cabinet and his war service as Governor of Bengal equipped him with an all-round experience of political and administrative office which was probably unrivalled in this country. If he seemed a trifle out of touch and a trifle out of place in the Australian Parliament, there was no denying his capacity or experience. </para>
        <para>He was one of the first Australian statesmen to recognise the importance of Asia to Australia. His great achievement during his 9 years as Foreign Minister from 1951 to 1960 was to establish deep and lasting goodwill between Australia and Asian countries- a foundation of friendship which was happily to survive the stresses placed upon it throughout the 1960s and even, one fears, beyond. He had a regard, almost a love, for Asians which was free of sentimentality and rooted in a knowledge of their history and the diverse cultures of the region. </para>
        <para>He was the most creative and farsighted of all the Liberals who have been responsible for foreign affairs. Even in the Cold War atmosphere of the 1950s, when the post of Foreign Minister ought to have brought out the worst in a man, he maintained a characteristic dignity and restraint. He at least shook hands with Chou Enl a i at Geneva. He foresaw and strongly opposed the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. He was years ahead of his fellow Australian conservatives in urging recognition of China. One&#39;s chief regret must be that, for all the correctness and enlightenment of his views, there was something lacking in his ability to carry them through and embody them in national policy. The acute sense of lost opportunity one feels on reading his diaries was due perhaps to the realities of party politics in his day and the ascendancy of other more determined men around him. We must wonder what influence he might have brought to bear on the course of events and the tragic policy decisions that were to follow his departure from government. </para>
        <para>Looking back, it is astonishing that not until 1965 could the Liberals bring themselves to appoint an Australian to the nation&#39;s highest titular office. Lord Casey was the first Australian appointed Governor-General by the non-Labor parties. Labor governments had already appointed two, both of whom had filled the post with rectitude and distinction. When the Liberals did get around to choosing an Australian they opted for a party man. Lord Casey, like his successor, was transferred direct from a Liberal Cabinet to Yarralumla. But any misgivings this might have occasioned were rapidly removed by the qualities he brought to the office. He filled the post admirably. He received me many times as Leader of the Opposition. I was grateful for the courtesies he showed me then and I am grateful for the notes he sent me in succeeding years. He was a man singularly punctilious and courteous. I had been asked to write a review of his diaries. Some of my comments were somewhat sharp, but I received a handwritten note from him acknowledging many of the points and thanking me for the care with which I had reviewed his book. </para>
        <para>He enjoyed the respect and affection of the whole community. For all that, however, his term as Governor-General was not entirely free of controversy. The choice of a successor to Prime Minister Holt in 1967 was a considerable test of his vice-regal judgment. The last person he called to Yarralumla was the  Deputy  Leader of the senior coalition partner. It is the only example of questionable vice-regal conduct in this country for which a precedent can be found in the actions of the monarch herself, for in 1963 the Queen chose <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alec</inline> Douglas-Home to succeed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harold</inline> Macmillan when she might have chosen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> A. Butler. </para>
        <para>Lord Casey&#39;s death removes one of the most colourful and distinguished Australians in our experience. He was one of the few engineers maybe the only engineer- to be elected to this Parliament. He retained to the end of his life an expert acquaintance with and interest in all engineering, scientific and technical matters. There were many firsts to his credit- the first Australian overseas diplomat, liaison officer to London, Minister to Washington; the first Australian to serve as Minister in a British government; the first Australian to be a colonial governor; the first Commonwealth life peer. He had fought at Gallipoli. He became an audacious flyer. It is a career not likely to be repeated in our time for it belongs essentially to another age. Yet the best things about Lord Casey would be valued in any age and his achievements will be of lasting importance. He was above all and in the best sense of the word a man of fundamental and abiding decency. </para>
        <para>On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I extend to Lady Casey- herself a figure of public distinction and high personal qualities- and to the members of her family our deep sympathy in the loss which they and the nation have sustained. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the National Country Party I should like to associate the members of that Party in the motion of condolence to the Lady Casey and to the family of the late Lord Casey. In his many distinctions and degrees, the contributions which the late Lord Casey made throughout his long and distinguished career were very effectively and publicly acknowledged. There were three particular life phases which those of us who knew him well saw and respected. The first was of course his career. In the career outlined by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> this afternoon, there is an array of distinctions which fe.w in Australia have attained- as an engineer, as a soldier, as a politician, as a diplomat, as a Minister, as Governor of Bengal and finally, as Governor-General of Australia. He, of course, represented not just Australia but ordinary people in a way that few other Australians have been able to do. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>But it was not just in his career that he achieved such distinction. I think that all of us who knew him as a citizen respected him as one who had a continuing interest in the community around him. In his correspondence with those of us with whom he was associated even in the slightest way, he demonstrated a continuing interest in the world around him even in retirement. He was a man who retained not only a personal interest but one which was significant in the depth of its understanding. So often, having made a statement or a commitment on behalf of the Government, I found- and I know many of my colleagues found- that we would receive a letter from the late Lord Casey commenting upon that decision, sometimes asking for the reasons for it or explaining that he had some alternative point of view, and perhaps presenting it for consideration. </para>
        <para>I think it was the extent to which he, unlike so many others, maintained a diary that provided an opportunity to see something of that very important period of development of Australia at an intimate level. I certainly admired the way in which he recorded for posterity some of the events in which he was a principal party. He wrote of those events with a measure of&#34; personal insight and understanding that few others enjoy. It is of course through his diaries that so many others are able to share in something of the achievement of his own personal life. So firstly in his career and then as a citizen he achieved great distinction. </para>
        <para>Finally and most importantly I think we all remember him as a man. He and the Lady Make represented one of the finest families with which I have personally been associated. They were very close to each other and whatever their activities, whether it was flying aeroplanes or driving fast cars or in the more personal and deeper things in their association in public life, they retained a companionship that I think is something upon which all of us might reflect and which might well serve as a continuing example to so many future generations of Australians. He was a man admired by all who knew him. They, as a couple- the Lady Make and the late Lord Casey- set a fine example. It is with a deep feeling of humility that I, personally and on behalf of the National Country Party, should like to extend to the Lady Make and her family our tribute to a great Australian and one whose loss will be sadly felt. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Parliament first as the member for Corio in 1 93 1 , having defeated Arthur Lewis whose death preceded that of Lord Casey by about 12 months. He served the electorate of Corio well and I know that he is well thought of by those who remember his period as member for that electorate. He resigned in 1940 to take a diplomatic post and was succeeded by John Dedman who also died about 12 months ago. He was the first representative of the electorate of Corio to hold ministerial rank in this Parliament. The 2 members who succeeded him also rose to similar rank.  His  career was one at which most people would look in wonderment. In different circumstances he almost certainly would have served as Prime Minister. That he left the Parliament when he did most likely changed the course of Australia&#39;s political history. I think it is fair to say that had he stayed he almost certainly would have been Prime Minister and in all probability the change of government in 1941 would not have taken place. </para>
        <para>I associate myself with this motion. I think that in any era there are men who serve their nation in a manner which is unique and Lord Casey was one of those men. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>Lord Casey, Baron of Berwick, lived in the electorate of Holt, which I represent, and he too served 2 governments and 2 parliaments. He also served in the War Cabinet. I realise that the electors of Holt would like me to say on their behalf today that the loss of Lord Casey to the Australian Parliament, to this nation and to world affairs has been a tragedy. He was perhaps one of the greatest statesmen, ahead of his time, that the world has ever seen, and we were very fortunate, both here and in Westminster, to have a man with such foresight so shortly after the war. As he lived in the electorate of Holt, on behalf of the people of that electorate I would like to express to Lady Casey and her family our sense of loss and our respect for one of Australia&#39;s finest and most famous men and certainly a world diplomat. </para>

          <para>- I am going to transgress the normal forms of the House to pay a personal tribute to Lord Casey. I became a member of Parliament in 19SS, after a redistribution, to represent part of an electorate which Dick Casey had formerly represented. When I went into the electorate I found that there was an immense feeling of personal warmth for the man. I remember that soon after I was elected I said to him: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Sir, what</inline> shall I call you?&#39; He said to me: &#39;Billy, when you feel comfortable to do so you will call me Dick &#39;. It was not long before I did so because of the warmth of the man. He was a great Australian, but he was also a tremendous man. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>honourable members will be saddened to know of the recent deaths of Thomas Louis Bull, O.B.E., a former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator for</inline> the State of New South Wales, William Edward Aylett, a former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator for</inline> the State of Tasmania, George Irvine Whiteside, a former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator for</inline> the State of Queensland, and Laurence John Failes, a former member of this House for the electorate of Lawson. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline>had a deep personal understanding of the problems of the people who live in rural Australia. Through this understanding he was able to make a contribution of great value, not only to his work in this place, but also to the organisations and bodies on which he served. In the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> was an active member of committees, joining the Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes in 1967 and serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee from 1965 to 1971. He became  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> had a considerable knowledge of the workings of the Parliament and after serving as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees for some time in 1969 he was elected  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy President  of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> left the Senate in 1971, but this in no way ended his involvement in public life. In 1973 he became  Chairman  of the Riverina Advisory Council and in 1974  Chairman  of the New South Wales Pastures Protection Board Committee of Inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> is survived by his wife Jessie and 2 sons and 2 daughters. I am sure that all members will join me in extending sympathy to his family. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator William</inline>Edward Aylett was born in Tasmania in 1900. He died on 10 August this year. He left school in 1916 to work at Mount Bischoff tin mine on the west coast of Tasmania to help to support his family. Later he worked in the coal mining and timber industries in Victoria. He returned to Tasmania in 1925 where he became a farmer and became actively involved in the Labor movement. He was elected to the Senate in 1937. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> served for many years as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. He was a member of the Joint House Committee, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. After leaving the Senate in 1965 he continued in public life, becoming  President  of the United Council of Progress Associations of the Gold Coast City from 1969 to 1970. </para>
        <para>Former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside,</inline> who died on 27 July, was chosen by the Parliament of Queensland to represent that State in the Senate on 9 October 1962. He remained in the Senate until 29 November 1963. Before entering the Senate, former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> had a long record of service to the union movement and to the Australian Labor Party.  His  Party posts included the presidency of the Queensland Central Australian Labor Party Executive. He was a Queensland delegate to the Federal Australian Labor Party Executive and  Chairman  of the Labor Broadcasting Station Pty Ltd. In addition he was secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association. </para>
        <para>Laurence John Failes was elected to this chamber in 1949 as member for Lawson. I know that honourable members will be greatly saddened to hear of his death on 7 July. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull,</inline> he had a deep knowledge of rural affairs which he used to good effect during his long term in this House, retiring in 1 969. During his time as a member of this House he served on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, was a member of the House Committee and was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from 18 February 1959. I am sure that all honourable members will join with me in extending sympathy to his family. I move: </para>

          <para>- I support the motion. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has already given the details of the parliamentary service of our four former colleagues and also an indication of the range of interests which they had before they came into the Parliament, during their service and afterwards. He has thereby indicated the qualifications which made each of them in his way a valuable member of this Parliament. Very many people here would not have known some of the men concerned, because at the time Senators Aylett and Whiteside left the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Parliament only one in seven of the present members of the Senate and only one in five of the present members of the House of Representatives were in the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> served for 2 7 years, which is a very long period in parliamentary terms. Only the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne of the present members of this Parliament have served longer. </para>
        <para>Of the people mentioned in the motion, some were known well to honourable members; some were known only for a short time. I first met Laurie Failes, for instance, during the war at Gove- Nhulunbuy as it now is- when we were both serving in the Air Force. On subsequent occasions, of course, I was able to meet him in his electorate of Lawson, for which he was the first and only member. The electorate was created for him; it expired when he retired. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline>was first elected to the Parliament in 1938. It was a remarkable year. Labor won five of the 6 Australian States in the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> it will be recalled, entered the Parliament together with Senators Amour, Armstrong, Arthur and Ashley and others whose names began with letters lower in the alphabet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> was here for the shortest period- barely a year. He was appointed by the Parliament of Queensland to succeed a deceased Labor senator at a time when it was customary to fill casual Senate vacancies with persons of the same political party as that of the former senator. All our former colleagues served not only in the Parliament but also outside. My own colleagues have told me of the way they appreciated <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull&#39;s</inline> term, his actions and his conduct as  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy President  of the Senate and as  chairman  of 2 committees and a colleague on other Senate committees. The sentiments which the Prime Minister has expressed on behalf of the House to the relatives of our former colleagues I am certain are supported by all members. Many of us were associated with them outside the Parliament. Some few of us, a minority, were associated with all of them. We mourn them and we sympathise with their relatives in their loss. </para>

          <para>- I should like to associate the members of the National Country Party of Australia with the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> In particular I should like to express to the families of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> and the former member for Lawson, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie</inline> Failes, my own personal sympathy. Both of these men, in then- association with my Party, had a long and continuing connection with the rural industries. Tom Bull championed a cause which I think in this Parliament is best known and expressed by the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly).</inline> Indeed, while a senator within the Parliament on many occasions he found himself in some opposition to the former Leader of my Party, the then  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, whose policies on tariff matters tended to be somewhat contrary to those which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> preferred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> in fact, in his association with the grazing industry, first expressed concern about the extent to which there was a change in the structure of the Australian economy which export industries and those associated with them might find it hard to survive. Of course, on many occasions in the Parliament he gave voice to those concerns and in his attitudes and in his practice always upheld strongly support for the cause which he represented and in which he believed so strongly. To both his widow and his family I should like to extend my own personal sympathy. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Laurie Failes, the former member for Lawson and the only member for Lawson, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> has stated- was another whose connection with the rural industries began his interest in politics. Through the war years he served with the Royal Australian Air Force. On coming out of the Air Force he felt concern at the direction of the economic policies of the government of the day. I am interested to hear that the electorate of Lawson was created for him. Of course, it was created by a Labor government and won by a member of the Country Party, Laurie Failes, and held by him throughout the time that that seat remained. Laurie Failes was a sheep farmer and wheat farmer. He was associated with the development of a part of our rural sector which again has come under some pressure in recent years. He was a forceful and vocal exponent of the cause of those he represented. On behalf of the members of my Party I extend deep sympathy to his widow and family. </para>
        <para>Similarly, on behalf of the members of my Party I extend sympathy to the families of the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> and former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside.</inline> They were <inline font-style="italic">2 men who, in their</inline> association with the Australian Labor Party and with the Parliament, represented effectively the causes in which they believed. During the term when they were members of this Parliament they spoke, of course, about those issues with which they were associated. To their families I extend my deepest sympathy and also express an understanding of the traumas that parliamentary life imposes on the families of all members of this place, irrespective of the parties to which they belong. </para>
        <para>I think that motions of this sort give us an opportunity to say to those who, outside the Parliament, so often in our absence assist in meeting our electorate commitments how much we appreciate the way in which they carry that burden. In offering our condolences to the families of these former members of this Parliament, I think it is worth remembering those responsibilities, the way they are borne and, of course, the loneliness of frequent separation. In extending our condolences to the families of those who were former members, I think it is also worth expressing thanks to those of our own families who also bear those burdens. </para>

          <para>-I should very much like to associate my electorate of Riverina with this motion and to be associated with it personally. I join with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in the fine tributes that have been made about the former senator, the late Tom Bull. I find difficulty in expressing adequately my thoughts as I have lost a special friend. In the circumstances, words will not properly convey my real feelings. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Tom Bull was a man of unquestioned integrity. He was a country man and knew the country extremely well. He loved the country and he loved his country. He was a man of God. He was a man who accepted responsibility and he was a man of principle. He was a man who contributed in countless ways to the community. He was, indeed, a leader in every sense of the word. I remember him and I thank him for his friendship, for his wise counsel and for his personal help. He nominated me for preselection by the National Country Party for the seat of Riverina. He was my campaign manager during the recent December 1975 election. I am the richer for having known him and I am indebted to him but, sadly, it is a debt that must now remain unpaid. </para>
        <para>Tom Bull and I joked many times about the fact that we had both begun our formal education in a little country, one-teacher, 14-pupil school at a place called Gob b a gaul a. The school has long since been closed and demolished but I often think that if such schools could produce men like Tom Bull they must have been grand institutions. </para>
        <para>Tom Bull was always a devoted husband and father. In a world of changing values his family was and is a shining example of all those good things we speak about whenever we refer to the family as the basic unit of society. He was happiest when home with his wife, his sons, his daughters and his beautiful grandchildren. It is because of this wonderful family unity and spirit that I know how much he will be missed by his loved ones. Narrandera, the Riverina and Australia have lost a great man. We are all poorer for his passing. I join with other honourable members in expressing sincere sympathy to his wife and family. </para>

		  <para>FROM RECESSION TO RECOVERY</para>
      <para>When this Government came to office, Australia was still locked in its most serious postwar recession. </para>
      <para>That quite unnecessary calamity was the product of three years of Labor Government. </para>
      <para>The major distortions which that Government imparted to the economy in 1974 and 1975 had become deep-rooted obstacles to a return to full employment. </para>
      <para>The economy had been shaken to its foundations. </para>
      <para>The unfolding of economic conditions over the past eighteen months or so is detailed in Statement No. 2 attached to this Speech. </para>
      <para>Here I mention only a few facts. </para>
      <para>They are facts which clearly bring out the huge gulf which had opened up, by the time we came to office, between conditions in the economy that all Australians are entitled to expect and conditions as we actually found them. </para>
      <para>At the end of 1975, the private sector was employing no more people than it had been three years earlier, although over that period the labour force had expanded by about 370 000. </para>
      <para>Unemployment had risen to a level unheard of in this country since the Depression of the 1 930s. </para>
      <para>Gross non-farm product in the December quarter, seasonally adjusted and at constant prices, was still almost 5 per cent below its peak level recorded two years earlier. </para>
      <para>The farm sector was in a state of collapse. </para>
      <para>The share of company profits in national income- one of the flywheels of our whole economic system- remained depressed at around three-quarters of its long-run norm. </para>
      <para>Real business fixed investment fell in the December quarter to its lowest level for almost three years. </para>
      <para>The Consumer Price Index in the December quarter was 14.0 per cent above a year earlier. </para>
      <para>Above all, inflation showed no real prospect of a sustained move down. </para>
      <para>This was the economic legacy which we inherited. </para>
      <para>The human reflection of these dry economic facts was to be seen in the devastation of the lives of ordinary people which those events had wrought. </para>
      <para>I mention as one instance the catastrophic impact which the careering inflation of those three years has had upon the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who had thought that savings accumulated by the thrift and industry of their working lives would help to protect their later years; and who now find the real value of those savings cut to ribbons by the great inflation which the Government of that day induced and over which it so wantonly presided. </para>
      <para>I mention also the personal tragedies of school-leavers and other young people, and of disadvantaged groups in the community such as Aborigines, who have been denied jobs by the policies of those three years. </para>
      <para>Given this economic legacy there could be no rapid return to normality. </para>
      <para>On the contrary, restoring the economy was certain to be a protracted task. </para>
      <para>Before the election we said it would take a full three-year term. </para>
      <para>The Government quickly put in hand a coherent strategy involving all the main arms of economic policy. </para>
      <para>Initial measures to control government expenditures were taken as early as December and followed up by further measures in February. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, in January, major monetary measures were undertaken to drain off some part of the excessive liquidity build-up of 1 975. </para>
      <para>Since that time, especially during the seasonally tight June quarter, monetary policy has been operated flexibly- but always with a view to bearing down against current inflationary pressures while maintaining the cap.cacity of the financial system to underwrite recovery in the private sector. </para>
      <para>We had earlier made clear that, contrary to views in some quarters, we had no intention of depreciating the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. </para>
      <para>In February the Commonwealth sought to bring home to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that full wage indexation, by locking the economy into double digit inflation and a disaster level of business profitability, ran completely counter to hopes of a sustained economic recovery and a return to full employment. </para>
      <para>This fundamental truth was initially not widely understood. </para>
      <para>Since then, however, it has increasingly gained understanding and acceptance in the community. </para>
      <para>The full scale review of expenditures which, at the outset, we had put in hand culminated in my statement on Fiscal Policy Decisions of 20 May. </para>
      <para>In that statement I announced a sharp reduction in the rate of growth of expenditures previously in prospect for 1 976-77. </para>
      <para>At the same time I announced the introduction of full personal tax indexation and significant improvements in the manner of assisting families and to Medibank. </para>
      <para>As we have stressed from the outset, we have made our first priority the absolute necessity to combat inflation. </para>
      <para>We have done so not merely because of the direct hardships that inflation obviously brings, but because unless we can brake inflation we shall not succeed in restoring full employment. </para>
      <para>Against that background, I come to the present situation. </para>
      <para>The economy is now showing signs of progress. </para>
      <para>Typical of the early recovery stage in the economic cycle, the areas of strength are still scattered. </para>
      <para>Much of the early impetus to recovery has come from a cessation of the stock rundown which had continued heavily throughout 1975, and from continued strengthening in exports. </para>
      <para>More recently however, private consumption expenditure has begun to grow. </para>
      <para>In the business sector also there are early signs of confidence regenerating. </para>
      <para>Some healthy gains in capital spending on plant and equipment have already occurred. </para>
      <para>The key question hanging over the future course of the recovery is whether the main components of private demand- consumption and business investment- will firmly join stocks and exports in building a continuing recovery. </para>
      <para>If they do not, that recovery will falter and expire. </para>
      <para>Another key question concerns the extent to which the growth in demand will be met from imports and so not be translated into local production and local jobs. </para>
      <para>The recovery will be threatened if rising demand is associated with a too strongly rising tendency to import. </para>
      <para>The need to qualify answers to these questions indicates that the economy still lacks a fully assured foundation for recovery. </para>
      <para>When one asks, why should that be, there is a very simple answer. </para>
      <para>It is so because both the key questions I have mentioned depend for their outcome on the future of inflation in this country. </para>
      <para>Consumers will step up their spending and cut back on their savings only if they judge inflation to be declining. </para>
      <para>Businessmen will emerge further from their shell-holes and start buying plant, equipment and new buildings, re-stocking and taking on new workers only if the uncertainty wrought by runaway inflation can be removed from their calculations and profits again begin to represent a reasonable rate of return. </para>
      <para>The prospective threat to the recovery from import competition will only be banished if Australia&#39;s international competitiveness does not continue to be eroded for too much longer by cost escalation in excess of that of our trading partners. </para>
      <para>Each of these provisos points unequivocally to the fundamental needs to reduce inflation and, as an integral part of that process, to rectify the wage-profit distortion which the wages explosion of 1974 produced. </para>
      <para>These objectives are fundamental to recovery. </para>
      <para>There have been some favourable developments on the inflation front in recent months. </para>
      <para>The 5.6 per cent rise in the Consumer Price Index in the first half of 1976 represented some advance on the 6.4 per cent and the 7.2 per cent in the second and first halves, respectively, of 1975. </para>
      <para>The Arbitration Commission&#39;s decision of May and August in respect of wage adjustments for the Consumer Price Index movements in the first two quarters of 1976 hold out hopes for some further moderation of inflation in the remainder of the year. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, the previously very depressed level- though not yet the share- of aggregate profits has begun to pick up. </para>
      <para>In these two respects we are moving in the right direction. </para>
      <para>But we need to go much further- and we need to do so faster. </para>
      <para>Time is of the essence for two reasons. </para>
      <para>First, the sooner wages and profits return to a more normal relativity, the sooner job prospects will improve. </para>
      <para>On the more pessimistic assumption, the downward adjustment in the wage share that is now required would occur slowly via an unacceptably high level of unemployment persisting for a long period. </para>
      <para>The same adjustment can take place much more quickly, and with much less cost in terms of idle resources and production foregone, if the determinations of wage fixing authorities continue to eschew the full indexation of wages for past price increases and wage moderation prevails. </para>
      <para>This is the course the Government has been urging before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
      <para>The second reason why we need to get inflation down more quickly is in order to stop exporting jobs. </para>
      <para>In short, when we come to examine each of our current economic problems we find that all of them have their genesis in the inflationary experience of recent years. </para>
      <para>There is no way in which those problems can be solved other than by dealing with inflation itself. </para>
      <para>That is the key to it all. </para>
	  <para>ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND THE BUDGET</para>
      <para>Consistent with that view, this Budget is therefore an essential element in our anti-inflationary strategy. </para>
      <para>First, the Budget takes its place in the on-going process of imposing more effective control on Commonwealth outlays generally. </para>
      <para>Restraint on Budget outlays and on the size of the public sector is necessary to allow and to foster that expansion of the private sector to which we are committed. </para>
      <para>Secondly, through the full indexation of personal income taxation which I announced on 20 May, we are putting in place some of our proposed reforms. </para>
      <para>What these will mean is that the revenue side of fiscal policy will also be working to reinforce wage restraint, to strengthen company profitability and to boost business confidence. </para>
      <para>Thirdly, the substantial reduction in the magnitude of the deficit since we came to office, and of which this Budget constitutes a further step, will help to moderate the flow of liquidity into the economy. </para>
      <para>That is basic to achieving the monetary environment that is necessary if inflation is to be reduced. </para>
      <para>I shall indicate later the monetary conditions which might be expected in 1976-77, given the Budget outcome and other relevant influences. </para>
      <para>Of course, the very need for public sector restraint and tight control of the Budget deficit the basic thrust of the Government&#39;s fiscal and monetary policies- has been disputed by some. </para>
      <para>Yet all the evidence- in Australia and overseas is that, under the kind of inflationary conditions which we have been and are still experiencing, fiscal and monetary policies of what used to be known as the &#39;pump-priming&#39; kind no longer prime the pump but serve only to turn off the flow of jobs even further. </para>
      <para>The reason is to be found in what I have already said. </para>
      <para>It is inflation that is at the heart of the problem. </para>
      <para>This Government yields to none in its concern for the genuinely unemployed. </para>

        <para>But, whether they know it or not, those who, in the name of reducing unemployment, call for higher government spending, or bigger deficits, or full wage indexation, or devaluation of the Australian dollar, are calling for higher- not lower- unemployment in this country. </para>
        <para>The overwhelming weight of evidence is against such courses. </para>
        <para>They have been tried both here and abroad; and they have failed. </para>
        <para>Let me just mention here- for the case has been fully detailed elsewhere- that experience abroad strongly reinforces our conviction in these respects. </para>
        <para>At this year&#39;s Ministerial Council Meeting of the OECD, which I attended for Australia, the main industrialised nations of the nonCommunist world agreed on an economic strategy which had as its basic premise the view that: &#39;. . . the steady economic growth needed to restore full employment and satisfy rising economic and social aspirations will not prove sustainable unless all Member countries make further progress towards eradicating </para>
        <para>And I repeat, eradicating inflation.&#39; </para>
        <para>Consistent with that premise, OECD Ministers underlined the need for caution in the pursuit of expansionary policies and for firm use of fiscal and monetary policies to achieve the general economic climate required for non-inflationary growth. </para>
        <para>As the Communiqu&#233; says: &#39;. . . because of the virulence of recent inflationary experience, there is a danger that inflationary expectations could revive quite strongly if the pace of the recovery is too fast.&#39; </para>
        <para>Within that general context it was further agreed that: &#39;. . . because of inadequate investment in past years in some countries and in certain basic industries, there is a risk of supply bottlenecks at a comparatively early stage of the recovery ... In most countries, policies should be directed more towards promoting investment rather than consumption. In many cases, this will require an appropriate recovery of profits from the depressed levels of recent years. &#39; </para>
        <para class="block">On that basis, action was seen as being required both to stimulate investment and to restrain the rise in public expenditure. </para>
        <para>There could be no clearer demonstration of the appropriateness of the Government&#39;s economic strategy. </para>
        <para>I repeat- the speed with which we can restore full employment in Australia and &#39;get Australia moving again&#39; on a sustainable basis will be directly related to the speed with which, in the words of the OECD Communique, we as a nation can &#39;progress towards eradicating inflation&#39;. </para>
        <para>It follows that Australia would stand alone and against the background of its internationally unfavourable inflation rate would be all the more noticeable for doing so- if we were once again to begin applying a clearly inappropriate &#39; pump-priming &#39; policy. </para>
        <para>Whatever the virtues of such a policy may have been under conditions of stable prices, low unemployment and a smaller public sector, they have entirely evaporated under conditions of high inflation, high unemployment and a public sector already bloated beyond belief. </para>
        <para>Having consistently rejected the &#39;pumppriming&#39; expedient, however, the Government has not moved to the other extreme of trying to balance the Budget overnight. </para>
        <para>Rather, this Budget applies the maximum degree of restraint judged to be consistent with promoting confidence and maintain a steady path towards economic recovery. </para>
        <para>By careful choice of the taxation measures to be announced tonight and those of 20 May, we have matched restraint in our own spending with confidence-strengthening measures to boost the private sector. </para>
        <para>The way in which the various elements of the Budget slot into the anti-inflationary strategy highlights the importance of looking at all our policies- fiscal policy, monetary policy, wages policy and external policy- as a unified and coherent whole. </para>
        <para>No single component of the strategy can fail without putting the basic objective under threat. </para>
        <para>For example, a less firm fiscal stance would undermine the necessary degree of monetary control; or, alternatively, require a return to the kind of overly restrictive monetary policy which would inhibit recovery and the rebuilding of confidence. </para>
        <para>A lax monetary environment would endanger wage and price deceleration. </para>
        <para>A too stubborn adherence to the existing excessive level of real wages- for example, through full wage indexation- would continue to hold inflation high, depress consumer and business spending, hold back the creation of new jobs and prevent unemployment from falling. </para>
        <para>Examples could be multiplied; but I simply say that our strategy is a coherent one. </para>
        <para>All of its separate elements involve difficult decisions. </para>
        <para>But the Government and all sections of the community must persist with the fundamental task. </para>
        <para>In doing so, we can take comfort from two things. </para>
        <para>First, we know that the alternatives have been tried and found wanting. </para>
        <para>Secondly, although they are still limited, we are already beginning to see some positive results. </para>
		<para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para>Budget outlays in 1976-77 are estimated to total $24,32 lm, an increase of 1 1.3 per cent over actual outlays in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>In 1975-76 the increase was almost 23 per cent and in the year before that it was almost 46 per cent. </para>
      <para>This marked slowing in the prospective rate of growth of Budget outlays in 1976-77 accords with the key role of expenditure restraint in the Government&#39;s overall economic strategy to which I have referred. </para>
      <para>Many of the provisions included in the Budget estimates flow from decisions announced in my comprehensive statement to the House on 20 May. </para>
      <para>The references to individual provisions which follow are confined mainly to major items. </para>
      <para>Full details are set out in Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>Where appropriate, additional information will be announced by the Ministers concerned. </para>
      <para>The decisions reflected in these expenditure pro visions are in line with the Government&#39;s road priorities. </para>
      <para>They reflect, for example, this Government&#39;s philosophy that so far as possible responsibility for spending decisions should remain with private individuals and businesses, and not be assumed by governments. </para>
      <para>More and more Australians are coming to understand that, one way or another, they must pay for the things they want. </para>
      <para>This Government believes that Australians should have more scope to decide what they want </para>
      <para>At the same time, these expenditure decisions reflect the Government&#39;s main objectives to: promote confidence in the business sector; institute just social reforms in areas of need; and increase real levels of expenditure in those areas to which it gives priority. </para>
	  <para>EDUCATION</para>
      <para>For example, although the proposed increases in spending on education are less than some would like, this is an area where, notwithstanding our overall budgetary constraints, we have provided for increases in real levels of expenditure and restored triennial programs on a rolling basis. </para>
      <para>In short, education for this Government is a high priority area. </para>
      <para>In all, Commonwealth expenditure on education in 1976-77 is estimated at $2,204m, an increase of 15.3 per cent compared with 1 975-76. </para>
      <para>Grants to universities, colleges of advanced education, technical colleges and government and non-government schools by the respective education Commissions account for $ 1,751m, or nearly 80 per cent of the total allocation for 1976-77. </para>
      <para>In each case the budgetary provision represents a significant increase in real terms. </para>
      <para>The Government has given to the education Commissions, for planning guidance only, minimum expenditure levels for 1978 and 1979 which will involve further increases in real terms. </para>
      <para>As announced in my statement of 20 May, this planning guidance is: for universities, colleges and schools, 2 per cent growth in real terms per annum; and for technical and further education institutions, 5 per cent growth in real terms per annum. </para>
      <para>The Budget also provides $2m for the Curriculum Development Centre and $ 1 .  1 m for research by the Education Research and Development Committee. </para>
      <para>In addition the Commonwealth extends substantial assistance directly to students. </para>
      <para>This Budget includes a total of $155m in 1976-77 for a range of student assistance schemes, including the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and programs of assistance for isolated children and Aboriginal children. </para>
      <para>The Government is aware that many of these allowances have not been increased for some time; meanwhile, inflation has been proceeding. </para>
      <para>Large numbers of students are involved. </para>
      <para>It is not clear to us, however, that existing schemes are the most cost-effective, in terms of directing the substantial sums involved to the most needy and deserving students. </para>
      <para>We have therefore initiated an urgent investigation into the adequacy of existing rates of benefit and the possible rationalisation of the schemes. </para>
      <para>It will be recalled that full-time allowances under the National Employment and Training System were reviewed in February; payments in respect of in-plant and part-time training under that System are also now being similarly reviewed. </para>
      <para>With respect to student assistance schemes, the Government&#39;s decisions will be announced in October and implemented from the beginning of the 1977 academic year. </para>
      <para>The investigation will also cover the question of the reintroduction of tertiary education fees for those classes of students mentioned in my statement of 20 May. </para>
      <para>This does not of course involve reintroducing fees for Australian students undertaking their first degrees. </para>
	  <para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
      <para>Another area in which this Budget provides for a large real increase in expenditures is Social Security and Welfare. </para>
      <para>This is indeed the largest single component of Budget outlays. </para>
      <para>In 1975-76 it amounted to over $5,000m or 23 per cent of total outlays. </para>
      <para>The 1976-77 Budget provides for expenditure of $6, 1 87m, or about 25 per cent of total outlays. </para>
      <para>The Government has already initiated major reforms in this area; some further reforms will be announced tonight. </para>
	  <para>Family Allowances</para>
        <para>The new scheme of family allowances- one of this country&#39;s most significant social reforms- is now in operation. </para>
        <para>Under the new arrangements, rates of family allowances have been substantially increased and the tax rebates for dependent children abolished. </para>
        <para>The new arrangements will benefit, in particular, large families with low incomes: those in most need will derive most benefit. </para>
        <para>Some 300 000 low income families- with 800 000 children- with incomes such that they previously derived no benefit- or less than full benefit- from the dependent children&#39;s rebates, will benefit most. </para>
        <para>This accords with the Government&#39;s sense of priorities. </para>
		<para>Pensions</para>
        <para>We are committed to protect pensions against inflation. </para>
        <para>We will continue to honour that commitment. </para>
        <para>In line with it we propose to introduce legislation to tie future pension and benefit adjustments automatically to movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>The next two six-monthly increases, in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index, will come into effect in November 1 976 and May 1977. </para>
        <para>Effective from the first payday in November the standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased by $2.25 to $43.50 a week. </para>
        <para>This reflects the movement in the Consumer Price Index between the December 1975 quarter and the June 1976 quarter. </para>
        <para>The increase will apply in respect of age, invalid and repatriation service pensions, widows&#39; pensions and supporting mothers&#39; benefits. </para>
        <para>The combined married rate will rise by $4.00 to $72.50 a week. </para>
        <para>Similar increases will apply to unemployment, sickness and special benefits, sheltered employment allowances and tuberculosis allowances. </para>
        <para>In line with the practice initiated by our predecessors, there will be no increase in single unemployment and sickness benefits payable to persons under the age of 1 8 years. </para>
        <para>The increases are estimated to cost $190 million in 1976-77 and $508 million in a full year. </para>
        <para>I come now to another significant reform. </para>
        <para>Following a recommendation by the Income Security Review Committee, the Government has decided, with effect on pension payments after 1 1 November 1976, to abolish the separate property component in the means test for pensions. </para>
        <para>Those pensions that are now subject to a means test based on a combination of income and property will in future be subject to a test on income only, including income from property. </para>
        <para>It will be both simpler and more equitable to take into account for pension purposes the actual income received by a pensioner. </para>
        <para>Many people will gain from this overdue reform. </para>
        <para>It has been clearly inequitable that pensioners should have been means-tested on the basis of a notional return on property, even though in many cases their actual income from such property fell well short of that notional return. </para>
        <para>We believe therefore that this measure will be welcomed by all. </para>
        <para>Transitional arrangements will ensure that no existing pensioner will suffer a reduction in pension as a result of the change; these arrangements are estimated to cost about $7m in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
        <para>The main Repatriation pensions also will be increased in November 1976 and May 1977 in line with increases in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>The increases are estimated to cost $ 15.8m in 1976-77 and $38.8m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Along with the proposed changes to the Social Security legislation, we will be introducing legislation to increase automatically the main Repatriation pensions. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Repatriation will be announcing further details. </para>
		<para>Assistance to Handicapped People</para>
        <para>The Government attaches high priority to the provision of adequate facilities and care for handicapped people. </para>
        <para>Under the Handicapped Persons Assistance program funds are provided to help voluntary organisations establish and operate sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and training centres, and to provide accommodation for handicapped children and adults. </para>
        <para>We propose to increase expenditure on this program substantially over the next three years. </para>
        <para>This Budget provides a total of $30m for these purposes. </para>

          <para>In all, over these three years we shall be providing a total of $ 12 lm under this program. </para>
          <para>Arrangements will also be made so that selected organisations will be able to commence the planning and construction of approved projects now, in the firm knowledge that government funds will be forthcoming at nominated dates over the next three years. </para>
          <para>These arrangements parallel those already announced for aged persons homes and hostels under which up to $225m is to be made available over the next three years to provide urgently needed accommodation for about 15 000 aged people. </para>
		  <para>Handicapped Children</para>
        <para>We have decided to increase substantially both the handicapped child&#39;s allowance and the handicapped children&#39;s benefit. </para>
        <para>In recognition of the special financial problems that are involved in the care of handicapped children, the relative increase in benefits in this area outstrips that of any other area of the Budget. </para>
        <para>We have demonstrated our concern for this real area of under privilege by raising benefits sharply. </para>
        <para>The handicapped child&#39;s allowance will be increased from $ 10 to $ 1 5 a week and the handicapped children&#39;s benefit, payable in respect of handicapped children in institutions, will be increased from $3.50 to $5.00 a day. </para>
        <para>These increases, which will benefit about 2 1 000 children in these categories, will take effect from November and are estimated to cost an additional $3.8m in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Senior Citizens &#39; Centres</para>
        <para>We shall provide an amount of $4m for grants to approved senior citizens&#39; centres in 1976-77, and the same amount in each of the two succeeding financial years. </para>
		<para>OVERSEAS AID</para>
      <para>Notwithstanding the need to contain government spending, we are proposing to increase outlays from the Budget on overseas aid, excluding defence co-operation, to $400m in 1976-77; that is, by 14.6 per cent on 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Of this total, $228. lm is allocated to Papua New Guinea, which continues to be the major recipient of Australian aid. </para>
      <para>An estimated $26m will flow to Indonesia in 1976-77, being the first year of the new three year aid program of $86m to that country. </para>
      <para>Full details of Australia&#39;s overseas aid programs are set out in the accompanying Budget Paper, &#39;Australia&#39;s Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries 1976-77&#39;. </para>
	  <para>DEFENCE</para>
      <para>In these uncertain times, the highest priority of any responsible Government must be national security. </para>
      <para>Total outlays on defence activities in 1976-77 are estimated at $2, 178m, an increase of over 17 per cent compared with last year. </para>
      <para>The present Government is determined to restore and maintain an adequate Australian defence capability. </para>
      <para>This will require increases in defence expenditure over the years ahead, particularly for the more adequate equipment of the Defence Force. </para>
      <para>A White Paper on Defence is to be issued during this Session and at that time the Minister for Defence will make a comprehensive statement on the Government&#39;s defence policies. </para>
	  <para>HEALTH</para>
      <para>The cost to the taxpayer of health care in Australia has rocketed in recent years. </para>
      <para>Last year Commonwealth expenditure on health services amounted to about $2, 953m, including $ 1,637m on Medibank. </para>
      <para>At $1,6 12m the Budget provision for Medibank in 1976-77 is slightly less than last year. </para>
      <para>When allowance is made for the prepayment of $2 16m to the States at the end of June for hospital operating costs in the September quarter, the cost of Medibank this year is about $407m greater. </para>
      <para>But for the modifications we have made, the increase in cost this year would have been much greater still. </para>
      <para>Levy proceeds to be collected under the modified arrangements to come into effect on 1 October are estimated to offset the costs of Medibank by $25Om in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>As part of the reform of Medibank, the Government will provide $37.5m in 1976-77 towards the deficits incurred by registered hospital insurance organisations- including Medibank Private Insurance- from the payment of benefits to high risk and chronically ill members. </para>
      <para>In addition, $12m has been provided for a subsidy to registered hospital insurance organisations to reduce the cost for those Medibank levy payers who choose to take out basic hospital only insurance cover. </para>
      <para>The subsidy is intended to ensure that the cost of such insurance generally will not be more than $2.60 a week for family cover. </para>
      <para>The Government has also decided to make an advance of $ 10m in 1976-77 to Medibank Private Insurance for establishment purposes. </para>
      <para>In line with the undertaking given by the previous Government we have provided $108m for payments to the States in 1976-77 for the development of public hospitals and related health care facilities. </para>
      <para>A further $70m-compared with $54.3m last year- has been provided for payment of grants to States, local government authorities and other eligible organisations under the Community Health Program. </para>
      <para>We have also made a number of increases in other items of health expenditures. </para>
      <para>Commonwealth expenditure on medical research, including the special grants to the Hall and Florey Institutes, is estimated at $ 10.1m in 1976-77; expenditure in 1975-76 was $6.2m. </para>
      <para>New arrangements for financial assistance to the Red Cross Society&#39;s Blood Transfusion Service will result in an increase of $330,000 in the Commonwealth&#39;s subsidy to the Service in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>The provision for the Royal Flying Doctor Service in 1976-77 is increased by a special grant of $800,000 to $2m. </para>
	  <para>ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</para>
      <para>The Government is mindful of its election undertakings and is committed to promoting the welfare and well-being of Aboriginals. </para>
      <para>Unlike our predecessors, however, we do not see the achievement of that objective as being simply a matter of injecting ever-increasing amounts of money into an ever-increasing complexity of insufficiently considered programs. </para>
      <para>An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated the need to re-assess the efficacy of some of the approaches of the past. </para>
      <para>In this re-assessment the Government will have the benefit of the recent Hay Report on the programs involved. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, and pending its consideration of that Report, the Government is providing in this Budget no less than $153m for programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals. </para>
      <para>Although this is $33m less than expenditure in 1975-76, spending on many programs is being maintained at about the same levels as last year. </para>

		  <para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>As announced previously, advances totalling $375m- $ 10.4m more than was provided in 1975-76- will be available to the States for welfare housing in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided in principle to undertake a housing allowance voucher experiment; $75,000 is provided in the Budget for the first phase of this initiative. </para>
        <para>Should the experiment prove successful, implementation of such a program would give low income families the financial means to select their own rental accommodation on the open market. </para>
        <para>It would provide a new mechanism to make welfare housing sensitive to the needs of the users rather than those of the planners. </para>
        <para>It takes into account the view of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty that the first principle in the provision of assistance to low income people is that assistance must be linked to the person and not to the house. </para>
		<para>Growth Centres</para>
        <para>The Government has under way a comprehensive review of all major urban and regional development programs, including growth centres and decentralisation, land commissions, sewerage and urban rehabilitation. </para>
        <para>Pending review of the appropriate role for the Commonwealth in relation to growth centres, the Budget provides sufficient funds to preserve the Commonwealth&#39;s options in regard to Albury-Wodonga (for which $15m is provided), Bathurst-Orange ($2m) and Macarthur ($2m). </para>
		<para>Other Programs</para>
        <para>Other community development programs provided for in the Budget include: $50m for the National Sewerage Program; $ 1 5. 1 m for land commissions; $ 10.3m for the acquisition of property, planning and site development in the Woolloomooloo Basin in Sydney; and $9.4m to assist with the construction of water treatment plants in the Adelaide area. </para>
		<para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
      <para>A total of $133m has been provided for the Australian Broadcasting Commission; this compares with $ 1 37m last year. </para>
      <para>In his statement of 3 June the Prime Minister emphasised that the Government would seek to eliminate unnecessary expenditure on the arts in 1976-77, but maintain important and worthwhile programs. </para>
      <para>The Australia Council has been allocated $23m this year, about the same amount as was provided in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Expenditure on construction and running costs of the National Gallery, and on acquisitions, is estimated at $9.3m in 1976-77 compared with $4.6m in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>To meet existing commitments, about $llm has been provided by way of capital assistance for leisure facilities in the States, $5m more than was spent in 1 975-76. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s role in youth, sport and recreation programs is one of the matters to be examined by the Task Force that has been set up to examine welfare services and community based programs in the health welfare community development area. </para>
      <para>Pending the Government&#39;s consideration of the Task Force report, the 1976-77 Budget provisions for youth, sport and recreation are being maintained at the amount- almost $ 1.2m- that is required to meet existing commitments. </para>
	  <para>ECONOMIC SERVICES</para>
	  <para>Postal and Telecommunications Services</para>
        <para>The Australian Telecommunications Commission will undertake a capital program in 1976-77 which will require funds of $415m additional to those available from its own internal resources. </para>
        <para>As already announced, $2 15m of this will be provided from the Budget; the Commission will seek the balance of $200m by borrowing on the local capital market. </para>
        <para>Last year an amount of $392m was advanced to the Commission from the Budget. </para>
        <para>The Australian Postal Commission&#39;s operations in 1 975-76 yielded a surplus estimated at about $30m. </para>
        <para>The Commission therefore expects to be able not only to finance its 1976-77 capital program entirely from internal sources but also to repay $3m advanced to it by the Commonwealth in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>With effect from 1 September 1976, the fees payable by the licensees of commercial television stations are to be brought into line with the scale which, since 1973, has applied to commercial broadcasting stations. </para>
        <para>The new fees are estimated to yield additional revenue of $624,000 in 1976-77 and make total revenue from fees sufficient to cover the annual operational and capital costs of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. </para>
        <para>Radiocommunication licences are also to be increased for some classes of users from then present level of $ 12 a year to $20 a year. </para>
        <para>The Minister will announce the details; I mention, however, that there will be no increases in fees payable by voluntary bodies such as life saving organisations and rural fire brigades. </para>
        <para>These new fees will operate from 1 October and are estimated to increase revenue by $1.2m in 1 976-77 and $ 1 .6m in a full year. </para>
		<para>Air Transport</para>
        <para>The Government is concerned at the continuing high cost to the general public of providing airport and airways facilities. </para>
        <para>The gap between revenue and expenditure in this area was about $77m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>To help reduce this gap, and as already announced, air navigation charges are to be increased by 15 per cent with effect from 1 December 1976. </para>
        <para>The increase is expected to yield an additional $4m in revenue in 1976-77 and $8m in a full year. </para>
        <para>We are also implementing economies which, without adverse effects on safety standards, will result in expenditure on civil aviation faculties and services in 1976-77 being lower, in real terms, than in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Rail Transport</para>
        <para>An amount of $60. 8m is being provided to subsidise expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission. </para>
        <para>These losses, which greatly concern Government, are being generated primarily by the Tasmanian and non-metropolitan South Australian railway systems transferred to the Commonwealth under the previous Government. </para>
        <para>A further $36. lm is included to finance the capital program of the Australian National Railways Commission. </para>
        <para>This amount includes provision to continue the construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs. </para>
        <para>It also includes funds for essential capital works on the tasmanian railway system pending completion of the inquiry into that system that was announced in my statement of 20 May. </para>
        <para>The separate provision of $2m for the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge railway project will meet current commitments, pending the findings of the independent committee of inquiry that will be reporting on that project. </para>
		<para>Sea Transport</para>
        <para>The Australian Shipping Commission&#39;s capital expenditure program for 1976-77 requires provision of $63.4m from the Budget. </para>
        <para>This program relates essentially to the provision of terminals and the acquisition of vessels and seaborne equipment by the Australian National Line for use in coastal and overseas trades. </para>
        <para>The subsidy for the operation of &#39;Empress of Australia&#39; by the Australian National Line in its Bass Strait passenger service will be increased by $lm,to$2m,in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>An amount of $ 16m is provided to meet the estimated cost in 1976-77 of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme that has been introduced following the report of the Royal Commission into Transport to and from Tasmania. </para>
        <para>The Government is increasing its financial assistance to the Australian Shippers&#39; Council from $90,000 to $120,000 for 1976-77. </para>
        <para>Light dues levied on shipping to recover the cost of providing coastal navigation aids are to be increased from 3 1 cents per net registered ton per quarter to 35 cents from 1 October 1976. </para>
        <para>This increase is expected to yield an additional $ 1.7m in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>A separate levy on shipping of 1 cent per net registered ton per quarter has been collected to cover the cost of the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. </para>
        <para>An adequate working reserve has been built up and the Government has therefore decided to reduce this levy to 0.8 cents from 1 October 1976. </para>
		<para>Urban Public Transport</para>
        <para>The Budget estimates include almost $65m in assistance to the States for urban public transport projects. </para>
        <para>This amount includes $20m for payments which may be required in 1976-77 to meet the Commonwealth&#39;s share of approved cost increases in respect of previously approved projects. </para>
		<para>Roads</para>
        <para>An amount of $433. 5m will be made available to the States for roads in 1 976-77. </para>
        <para>This includes $35. 8m which will be made available in addition to the amounts appropriated under existing legislation. </para>
        <para>An amount of $8m is to be provided to the States in 1976-77 for expenditure on approved planning and research projects in relation to roads and urban public transport. </para>
		<para>Beef</para>
        <para>The Government has accepted the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s recommendation to continue for a further year the joint Commonwealth/State Government scheme for the provision of concessional carry-on finance to beef producers. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth will match State approvals in 1976-77 on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a limit of $ 1 5m on the Commonwealth Government contribution. </para>
		<para>Fertilisers</para>
        <para>The Government has considered the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which recommended that the subsidy of $78.74 per tonne on the nitrogen content of nitrogenous fertilisers be phased out over three years. </para>
        <para>The Government agrees in principle that this subsidy should be phased out and has decided that the rate should be reduced to $60 per tonne on 1 January 1977. </para>
        <para>The subsidy is estimated to cost $12m in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Rural Reconstruction</para>
        <para>The Rural Reconstruction Scheme, which expired on 30 June 1976, will be extended to 31 December 1976 pending finalisation of the Government&#39;s consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report. </para>
        <para>Of the total of $2 7m provided for the Scheme in 1976-77, $10m relates to the proposed extension to 3 1 December 1 976; the remainder relates to commitments under applications approved prior to 30 June 1976. </para>
		<para>Dairy Industry</para>
        <para>An amount of $ 13.5m has been included to meet the Commonwealth&#39;s estimated liability in respect of the Dairy Adjustment Program in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>This is additional to other assistance the Government has offered to the dairy industry by way of underwriting of producers&#39; returns from skim milk powder, casein, butter and cheese, details of which have already been announced by the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>
		<para>Wool</para>
        <para>The Commonwealth has authorised the Australian Wool Corporation to increase the level of support provided under its minimum reserve price scheme to 234 cents per kilo clean on a whole clip average basis. </para>
        <para>This is equivalent to 275 cents per kilo clean on the previous 2 1 micron basis. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding this increased level of support, it is expected that the Corporation will be able to repay in 1976-77 $245m of advances made by the Commonwealth to the Corporation in previous years. </para>
		<para>Water Resources Assessment Program</para>
        <para>The Government has decided to continue its support for the Commonwealth/State Water Resources Assessment Program for another three years; the provision for 1976-77 is $6.7m. </para>
		<para>Productivity Improvement Programs</para>
        <para>The Government is increasing, from $66,000 to $ 1 77,000, its support for programs designed to improve productivity at plant level. </para>
		<para>LEGAL AID</para>
      <para>An amount of $20m (including $3.7m for legal aid for the Aboriginal community) is included in the Budget for legal aid, compared with expenditure of $ 16.3m in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>The Attorney-General is negotiating with the States with the object, of bringing all forms of legal aid under the control of statutory Legal Aid Commissions and thereby effecting savings in the administration of legal aid. </para>
      <para>Pending completion of the negotiations, the Government is maintaining legal aid activities at their present level. </para>
      <para>To help offset the sharp rise in costs of legal aid to the Commonwealth over recent years, new and increased fees will be levied in Federal Courts; these fees are estimated to yield $2. 5m this year and $3. 5m in a full year. </para>
	  <para>PAYMENTS TO THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES</para>
      <para>One of the topics to which, since taking office, the Government has accorded a very high priority is that of the financial relations between the Commonwealth, State and local governments. </para>
      <para>The tax sharing scheme- the central element in our program of reform- is to a large extent now settled with the States. </para>
      <para>Under Stage 1 of the scheme, the States will be entitled to 33.6 per cent of the Commonwealth&#39;s personal income tax collections, excluding any special surcharges or rebates. </para>
      <para>On present estimates, which are necessarily subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty, this puts the States&#39; entitlement for 1976-77 at $3,716m. </para>
      <para>This would represent an increase of $643m, or about 2 1 per cent, over the comparable grants in 1975- 76, and is presently estimated to be $89m more than the States would have received under the old formula. </para>
      <para>The State Governments&#39; Loan Council programs for 1976-77 will total $l,356m, an increase of 5 per cent compared with 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Local government also will have an annual entitlement to a share of personal income tax. </para>
      <para>An amount of $140m is to be provided in 1976- 77- an increase of 75 per cent over last year. </para>
      <para>In recent years specific purpose payments to States and local government authorities have grown very fast; in 1974-75 the increase was no less than 92 per cent and in 1975-76 it was a further 34 per cent. </para>
      <para>After adjustment for the hospital prepayments to the States in late June, specific purpose payments are presently estimated to increase by about 9 per cent in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>Lumped together, net payments to States and local government authorities in 1976-77 are estimated to total $9,077m- an increase of 13 per cent after adjustment for the hospital prepayments. </para>
      <para>If allowance is made also for the non-recurring payments made for unemployment relief in 1975-76, the increase in 1976-77 becomes 15 per cent. </para>
      <para>This represents a significant increase in real terms and is a slightly faster increase than is in prospect for all other Budget outlays. </para>
      <para>The greater part of the funds we are providing to the States is untied and can be used by the States in ways of their own choosing: </para>
      <para>The States have always said they want greater freedom to make their own decisions and determine their own priorities. </para>
      <para>That is why we have increased our provision to them of untied funds relatively more than funds for specific purposes. </para>
      <para>The States now have the capacity to spend these untied funds in ways of their own choosing- be it welfare housing, or sewerage programs, or whatever it is to which they choose to give priority. </para>
      <para>The State Governments, along with the Commonwealth, must play their part in the battle against inflation. </para>
      <para>At a time when there are complaints about the level of funding of State Government programs the Commonwealth finds it particularly strange to find some State Governments actually supporting the even higher increases in their cost levels which full indexation of wages would bring. </para>
      <para>There is a need for restraint in the expenditures of State Governments as well as m the expenditures of this Government. </para>
      <para>The figures I have just given clearly show that the States are not being asked to bear any undue share of the task. </para>
	  <para>NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF</para>
      <para>The Budget includes an amount of $26m for relief payments in 1976-77 following natural disasters. </para>
      <para>This amount comprises continuing payments following floods and cyclones during 1975-76 and recently announced drought relief assistance to Western Australia. </para>
      <para>The Government has also undertaken to support, in accordance with the natural disaster assistance arrangements with the States, expenditures by the Victorian Government on certain drought relief measures. </para>
	  <para>GENERAL GOVERNMENT</para>
	  <para>Civil Works</para>
        <para>We have approved a total program of $293m for new works to be committed to construction in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>A total cash allocation of $4 10m has been set for expenditure during the year on new and already committed projects; this compares with actual expenditure of $425m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>For the Darwin Reconstruction Commission a new works program of $50m and an expenditure figure of $140m have been determined; actual expenditure in 1 975-76 was $ 1 10m. </para>
        <para>The approved new works program for the National Capital Development Commission is $153m, with a cash allocation of $195m compared with $ 188m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>For the remainder of the works program the limit on new works is $90m, including $50m for the Northern Territory, and the cash allocation is $75m; actual expenditure last year amounted to $127m. </para>
		<para>Canberra</para>
        <para>The Minister for the Capital Territory has already announced details of increases in general municipal rates and in water and sewerage rates in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
        <para>Action is in hand to limit the subsidy to the Canberra bus service to $5.4m in 1 976-77. </para>
        <para>There will be increased revenue from bus fares and paid parking spaces in Canberra. </para>
        <para>The Minister will be issuing details. </para>
		<para>Staff Ceilings</para>
        <para>Soon after taking office the present Government introduced new staff ceilings which were mainly responsible for reducing Commonwealth employment in the area covered by staff ceilings by 2.8 per cent in 1 975-76. </para>
        <para>This compares with a growth in Commonwealth employment in the area concerned of about 4 per cent per annum in the three years to 1974-75. </para>
        <para>On 14 June the Prime Minister announced a further overall reduction of 1.2 per cent in these staff ceilings to be achieved by 30 June 1 977. </para>
        <para>This comprised a 1.6 per cent reduction in the ceilings for Public Service Act employees and a 0.9 per cent reduction in the ceilings for certain Commonwealth Government authorities. </para>
        <para>These lower ceilings have been reflected in the detailed Budget estimates. </para>
        <para>The Prime Minister indicated at the time that the 1976-77 ceilings set in June were provisional, being subject to further review and possible adjustment in the light particularly of the Government&#39;s Budget decisions. </para>
        <para>Following further consideration in the Budget context, the Government has decided upon an objective of achieving a further reduction of 2 per cent in staff ceilings for Public Service Act employees during 1976-77, making the objective in this area a 3.7 per cent reduction in all. </para>
        <para>This further reduction is estimated to produce a saving to the Budget of about $22m in 1 976-77. </para>
        <para>Accompanying- though lesser- reductions in the staff ceilings for certain Commonwealth Government authorities will mean that, after allowance for the reduction previously announced, the total reduction in ceilings now being aimed at during the course of 1976-77 amounts to 2.5 per cent. </para>
        <para>The Government reaffirms its intention to achieve these reductions without sacking anyone and without creating personal hardship. </para>
		<para>Continuing Expenditure Control</para>
        <para>Following the change of Government we were able to keep total Budget outlays for 1975-76 within the original Budget estimates for the first time since 1968-69. </para>
        <para>We aim to repeat that performance again in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>We will not let up in our efforts to achieve savings and eliminate waste and inefficiencies wherever they occur. </para>
        <para>Because so much expenditure tends to be committed before the year starts, effective expenditure control must begin at the stage of commitment. </para>
        <para>To this end, new administrative arrangements have been developed for the regulation of forward expenditure commitments by departments and authorities which depend on the Budget for the whole or part of their finance. </para>
        <para>Limits within which departments and relevant authorities may make commitments during the current financial year- but which are to be financed from appropriations in future years- were determined as part of the Budget process. </para>
        <para>These limits can be increased only by specific Government decisions. </para>
        <para>We see the development of these new administrative arrangements as making a major contribution to the improvement of overall financial management in the area of Commonwealth administration. </para>
		<para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para>I turn now to the receipts side of the Budget. </para>
      <para>Government spending cannot be massively increased as in recent years without also significantly increasing the overall tax burden. </para>
      <para>This remains true notwithstanding the enormous deficits which have been allowed to open up between the outlays and the receipts side of the Budget- and which in due course have to be closed. </para>
      <para>With that latter important qualification, it is also obvious that, by prudently reining in the rate of growth of government spending, it becomes possible not only to avoid further increases in the tax burden but also to contemplate reducing it. </para>
      <para>In 1976-77, for the first time since the last Liberal-National Country Party Budget of August 1972, there will be no increases in the major indirect taxes. </para>
      <para>I contrast this with the 1975-76 Budget proposals for indirect tax increases which- even excluding the coal export duty- represented additional levies totalling $602m in 1975-76 and $688m in a full year </para>
      <para>Over the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76 the total of all the increases in taxation in this area lifted the annual level of taxation by over $ 1,000m. </para>
      <para>In this Budget, I repeat, there are no proposals to increase excise on cigarettes, or on beer, or on spirits, or on petrol. </para>
      <para>Moreover, because of our success to date in restraining expenditures, 1976-77 will see our first steps towards positively relieving the burden of taxation. </para>
      <para>The decisions involved- those already announced and those I am about to announce accord with our basic philosophy that individuals and businesses should have more say in spending decisions which concern them, and governments less. </para>
      <para>At the same time they are intended to strengthen confidence among consumers and investors, and thereby advance the recovery of the economy. </para>
	  <para>PERSONAL INCOME TAX</para>
      <para>The most important step in relieving the burden of taxation- the indexing of personal income tax- has already been taken and has been in operation for pay-as-you-earn purposes since 1 July. </para>
      <para>It represents perhaps the most significant reform of the personal income tax system in our time, and certainly the most costly in terms of revenue forgone. </para>
      <para>We have taken this step both in fulfilment of our objective of getting the Government&#39;s hands out of taxpayers&#39; pockets, and for wage policy reasons. </para>
      <para>Individuals, rightly in our view, attach considerable importance to their own command over their incomes and their ability so far as possible to spend those incomes as they see fit. </para>
      <para>The indexation arrangements which are now part of the income tax law will prevent the automatic increase in effective tax rates which used to come about as rising money incomes resulting purely from inflation took taxpayers further up the progressive rate scale. </para>
      <para>The law now provides for annual adjustments to prevent that. </para>
      <para>A change to the law will now be needed if a government seeks to increase effective real rates. </para>
      <para>This brake upon financial profligacy is a major step towards &#39;keeping governments honest&#39; with their taxpayers. </para>
      <para>The new arrangements are described in Statement No. 4 attached to this Speech. </para>
      <para>The cost of indexation and the changes associated with it is estimated to be $ 1,050m in 1 976-77 and $ 1 ,2 10m in a full year. </para>
      <para>We gave a commitment for 3 years; we fulfilled it in just under 6 months. </para>
	  <para>VALUATION OF TRADING STOCK</para>
      <para>The Government made it quite clear in its election policy statements that it was not prepared to see inflation continue to add to the tax burdens of individuals and businesses. </para>
      <para>We allowed ourselves a period of three years to give full effect to the necessary remedial legislation. </para>
      <para>So far as personal income tax is concerned, we have already fulfilled our undertaking by indexing the system as from 1 July 1976. </para>
      <para>We have now considered relieving businesses also from the impact of inflation on their tax burdens. </para>
      <para>In the kind of highly inflationary situation which Australia has recently been experiencing, firms have serious problems in financing the rapidly growing costs of an adequate and appropriate level of trading stocks. </para>
      <para>They have problems, too, with financing the soaring costs of replacing plant and equipment when depreciation allowances for taxation purposes are based on historical costs. </para>
      <para>Since coming to office the Government has given careful thought to the most effective ways of providing relief to firms beset with problems of these kinds arising from our recent high rates of inflation. </para>
      <para>In doing so it has had the benefit of the views originally stated by the Mathews Committee and, more recently, by Professor Mathews personally. </para>
      <para>It has also sought and received the views of leading representatives of the accountancy profession and of a wide sweep of industry interests. </para>
      <para>The Government has now decided to take a substantial step in relation to a system of trading stock valuation adjustments applying to taxable incomes earned in the 1976-77 income year. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, we are continuing to examine the impact of inflation on depreciation allowances and other aspects of business financing and profitability, with a view to bringing in appropriate legislation within the Government&#39;s current term of office and having regard to the availability, in the meantime, of the investment allowance. </para>
      <para>The key features of the proposed system of trading stock valuation adjustments will be: </para>
      <para>The adjustments will reduce taxable incomes in respect of income year 1 976-77. </para>
      <para>On practical grounds, the accent of the scheme will be, so far as possible, on simplicity. </para>
      <para>With that in mind, we propose the use of a general index for calculating the trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
      <para>Specifically, the cost of a firm&#39;s trading stock as at 1 July 1 976 will be revalued for income tax purposes by reference to the percentage increase in the &#39;goods&#39; component of the Consumer Price Index between the June quarter of 1976 and the June quarter of 1977. </para>
      <para>It is not proposed to bring the adjustments back into assessable income in later years in the circumstances proposed by the Mathews Committee- the adjustments will reduce tax, not defer it; in terms of the jargon, there will be no &#39;clawback&#34;. </para>
      <para>It will be necessary to lay down some safeguards against misuse of the system to avoid tax that ought to be paid; the precise nature of these is at present under consideration. </para>
      <para>By way of illustration I mention that, had such a scheme been operating fully in the current year on the basis of 1975-76 incomes, it is estimated that the cost to revenue this year would have been of the order of $700m. </para>
      <para>What the full cost of the final scheme would be in 1977-78 cannot of course be foreseen at this stage. </para>
      <para>That would depend among other things upon the rate of increase in the index during the current year. </para>
      <para>We have said that the scheme would be phased in. </para>
      <para>At this point it is clearly not possible for us to say how far, by this time next year, we shall feel able to go. </para>
      <para>We shall go as far as we can. </para>
      <para>What we do now undertake is that 50 per cent of the full adjustment will be allowed next year as deductions from 1 976-77 incomes. </para>
      <para>There are other aspects of the system of adjustments which require further study and which we are therefore not in a position to announce at present; these include, for example, the safeguards I have referred to and the categories of trading stocks to be included in the scheme. </para>
      <para>Legislation to be introduced in the next Autumn Sittings will provide full details. </para>
      <para>In settling those details, the Government will have discussions with professional and industry groups where appropriate. </para>
	  <para>PRIVATE COMPANIES</para>
      <para>The Government has undertaken to ease the distribution requirements for private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>
      <para>In this regard we have had the needs of small businesses particularly in mind. We believe in small businesses: They are essentially Australian. </para>
      <para>We attach importance to the spirit of free enterprise which small business symbolises. </para>
      <para>For distributions in respect of taxable incomes of the year 1975-76 and subsequent years the retention allowance for trading or business income will be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. </para>
      <para>This will increase by one-fifth the amount of after-tax income which a private company can retain without incurring Division 7 tax. </para>
      <para>No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there be no retention allowance for dividends that one private company receives from another. </para>
      <para>At the same time, the law will be amended to terminate the &#39;excess distribution&#39; provisions of Division 7, which permit a company which makes more than the minimum distribution in one year to make less than a minimum distribution in a later year without incurring Division 7 tax. </para>
      <para>With the proposed increase in the retention allowances there will no longer be any practical need to retain these highly complex provisions, which have also been of some concern in connection with schemes of tax avoidance; they are accordingly to be withdrawn subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. </para>
      <para>The increase in the retention allowance is estimated to cost about $lm in 1976-77 and $30m in a full year. </para>
	  <para>INCOME FROM MINING</para>
      <para>The Government has had under consideration the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the income tax arrangements applying to the mining and petroleum industries. </para>
      <para>In the light of that report it has decided on certain amendments to the law, bearing in mind both the Government&#39;s desire to see a healthy and efficient mining sector and the IAC&#39;s observations on the desirable relationships between the levels of tax on income from mining and on income from other business sources. </para>
      <para>The changes proposed are: </para>
      <para>Petroleum exploration expenditure and allowable capital expenditure on the mining of petroleum will be deductible against income from any source. </para>
      <para>Allowable capital expenditure of any mining company on the development of a mine or field will be deductible on a diminishing value basis, as at present, by reference to a maximum life of mine or field of 5 years, instead of 25 years as at present. </para>
      <para>Allowable capital expenditure on facilities used for the transportation of minerals, including petroleum, will now be deductible on a straight line basis over either 20 years, as at present, or 10 years, at the taxpayer&#39;s option to be exercised with the first claim for the deduction. </para>
      <para>The categories of expenditure covered by the present provisions giving deductions for allowable capital expenditure on mineral transport facilities will be extended to cover expenditure, presently not deductible, on port development such as harbour surveys, initial dredging, navigational aids and breakwaters. </para>
      <para>The amendments will apply first to capital expenditures incurred after today. </para>
      <para>They have no cost in 1976-77 but the revenue to be forgone in the first full year is estimated at $60m. </para>
	  <para>CRUDE OIL LEVY</para>
      <para>In the last Budget an excise of $2 per barrel was introduced on the production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas. </para>
      <para>Under existing policy any company discovering oil would receive import parity less the production excise. </para>
      <para>Many oil exploration companies have put to us that costs are so high today as to make commercial production from new oil discoveries of the size likely to be found in Australia unattractive at this level of return. </para>
      <para>The Government accepts that the levy represents a substantial deterrent to companies considering exploration for new fields. </para>
      <para>It has therefore decided that oil from discoveries after today will be free from the production excise. </para>
      <para>The result will be that all production of crude oil from future discoveries will receive full import parity at the nearest refinery port. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that this will significantly affect the level of activity within the oil exp lora ton industry. </para>
	  <para>COAL EXPORT DUTY</para>
      <para>The coal export duty introduced in the last Budget applies at two rates- $6 per tonne for high quality coal and $2 per tonne for other coal, apart from certain lower grade coal which is exempt. </para>
      <para>The Government has always regarded this as an entirely inappropriate form of tax. </para>
      <para>The quality of deposits varies markedly, but within and between the two categories which are subject to duty the effects of the duty fall in a quite haphazard manner. </para>
      <para>Marginal fields pay the same rate of duty as economically more profitable fields, or in some cases more. </para>
      <para>The imposition of this levy has had undesirable effects both on existing producers and on potential developments. </para>
      <para>It is the intention of the Government to remove this particular levy, but for budgetary reasons which will, I think, be obvious it is not possible to remove it at one stroke. </para>
      <para>It will however be reduced immediately, in what the Government regards as a first step towards completely phasing out this particular tax within three years. </para>
      <para>The Government is taking these steps towards phasing out this levy to encourage the healthy development of the industry. </para>
      <para>If the States take advantage of this situation to increase their own royalties the Government will have to review its position. </para>
      <para>So far as immediate steps are concerned, the Government will remove the duty from non co king coal and will reduce the rates on coking coals by 25 per cent- from $6 to $4.50 per tonne in the case of the higher rate of duty and from $2 to $ 1 .50 per tonne in the case of the lower rate. </para>
      <para>These changes, to apply immediately, will cost an estimated $33m in 1976-77 and $37m in a full year. </para>
	  <para>INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE</para>
      <para>Legislation to introduce an investment allowance was passed in the Autumn Sittings of the Parliament. </para>
      <para>During those Sittings and since, representations were received on a number of aspects of the allowance on which changes in the law were sought. </para>
      <para>In the course of its deliberations on the Budget the Government has carefully considered all of these representations and having done so has decided that the present scope of the allowance should remain unchanged. </para>
	  <para>PAYROLL TAX</para>
      <para>The present level of the exemption from payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is to be increased to the level recently adopted by the States. </para>
      <para>The present exemption of $20,800 will become $41,600 per annum; above $41,600 the exemption will phase out by $2 for every $3 by which the annual payroll exceeds that amount. </para>
      <para>The new exemption will apply from 1 January 1977. </para>
      <para>The change does not have any significant effect on Budget revenue. </para>
	  <para>INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS</para>
      <para>The Government has now considered the IAC report on &#39;Rural Income Fluctuations- Certain </para>
      <para class="block">Taxation Measures&#39;, which dealt with two broad questions: the averaging arrangements for primary producers, and a proposal for a scheme of income equalisation deposits for primary producers. </para>
      <para>The Government has decided to continue the averaging system in its present form, but will take up the proposal for a scheme of income equalisation deposits. </para>
      <para>Commencing with income year 1975-76, deposits lodged with the Government under the latter scheme will be deducted from the assessable income of the year of income in respect of which they are lodged, and included in assessable income of the year in which they are withdrawn. </para>
      <para>The scheme will enable primary producers to act themselves to even out the effects of fluctuating income on their tax liabilities over a period of years. </para>
      <para>Details of the scheme will be available when the legislation is introduced; the scheme will, however, include the following features: </para>
      <para>A minimum limit of $100 and a maximum limit of $ 100,000 is to be applied to the total value of a taxpayer&#39;s holdings. </para>
      <para>It will not be possible to withdraw deposits within the first 12 months after lodgment (other than in exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters, death, or financial stringency); however, there will be no maximum limit on the period for which an amount may be left on deposit. </para>
      <para>The scheme will apply to primary producers, but in determining taxable income&#39; from which deposits may be purchased, no distinction will be drawn between income obtained by primary producers from farm or non-farm sources. </para>
      <para>Interest is to be paid on the deposits at a rate, initially 5 per cent per annum, to be prescribed by regulation. </para>
      <para class="block">The present Drought Bonds Scheme is to be discontinued under appropriate transitional arrangements. </para>
      <para>Present holders of Drought Bonds will be offered the option of transferring to the new scheme. </para>
      <para>It is estimated that the revenue forgone in 1976-77 will be about $2m; the full-year cost of the scheme cannot be estimated at this stage. </para>
	  <para>ESTATE DUTY</para>
      <para>We undertook to increase the exemption from estate duty where the whole or part of the estate of a deceased person passes to a surviving spouse. </para>
      <para>This is an area of the law where personal tragedies abound. </para>
      <para>Even in current tight budgetary circumstances we have seen the need to pay special regard to rectifying the present situation. </para>
      <para>We shall therefore fulfil our undertaking in this Budget. </para>
      <para>We shall introduce a special deduction to apply where an interest in an estate passes to a surviving spouse. </para>
      <para>The deduction will be $50,000, or the entire net value of the spouse&#39;s interest in the estate if that is less than $50,000. </para>
      <para>The existing statutory exemptions, and the rebate of part of the duty in respect of a primary producer estate, will then apply as at present to the remainder of the estate. </para>
      <para>With the introduction of this special deduction, the deduction introduced in 1974 for an interest in the matrimonial home passing to a surviving spouse will be terminated. </para>
      <para>This was in any case an unsatisfactory provision, as it discriminated between different types of assets and was available in full only if the gross value of the interest in the home did not exceed $35,000. </para>
      <para>The new deduction will apply regardless of the nature of the assets and will not be reduced where the value of the relevant interest exceeds $50,000. </para>
      <para>In the case of an estate passing wholly to a surviving spouse, no duty will now be payable on an estate up to $90,000 (or $98,000 for primary producer estates). </para>
      <para>About 20 per cent of presently dutiable estates will cease to be dutiable, and the impact of duty on larger estates will be considerably reduced. </para>
      <para>The new provisions will apply to estates of persons who die after today. </para>
      <para>The cost of this measure is estimated to be $2m in 1 976-77 and $ 1 4m in a full year. </para>
	  <para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
      <para>In the aggregate, outlays in 1976-77 are estimated to increase by 11.3 per cent to $24,32 lm. </para>
      <para>Receipts are estimated to increase by 18.8 per cent to $2 1,7 13m. </para>
      <para>The overall deficit is therefore $2,608m. </para>
      <para>This is $977m less than the actual deficit of $3,585m in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>This latter figure would of course have been much greater had it not been for the actions taken by this Government immediately it came to office. </para>
      <para>When allowance is made for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit in 1976-77 is estimated at $l,879m; this is over $l,000m less than the domestic deficit of $2,905m last year. </para>
      <para>For all the reasons I have stated earlier this hauling in of the deficit this year is appropriate. </para>
      <para>But, over and beyond that, it can fairly be claimed that the deficit in prospect for 1976-77 differs in important respects from those of 1975-76 and 1974-75. </para>
      <para>The &#39;mix&#39; of the prospective deficit this year is vitally different from those of the last two years. </para>
      <para>It is particularly striking, for example, that the lower deficit in prospect for 1 976-77 is estimated to come about after forgoing revenue of no less than $ 1 ,250m on account of personal tax indexation and the investment allowance. </para>
      <para>Had we not chosen to make those desirable reductions in the burden of personal and corporate taxation the deficit would have been about $ 1,360m and the domestic deficit would have been down to around $630m. </para>
      <para>Not only is the reduction in the deficit appropriate to the evolving economic recovery but it is also being achieved after a major reduction in taxes which will play its own part in enhancing that recovery. </para>
      <para>More generally, this Budget reflects the Government&#39;s determination to press on with the major social, economic and administrative reforms that were outlined by the Prime Minister last November. </para>
      <para>It continues the drive to restore to individuals the economic independence that was so markedly eroded by the policies of our predecessors. </para>
      <para>It puts people first. </para>
      <para>It points towards the re-enhancement of the role of the private sector and away from the threat of big government. </para>
      <para>It emphasises the importance of free enterprise. </para>
      <para>For the first time in recent years, it gives real incentive for individuals and companies to venture and to succeed. </para>
      <para>THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
      <para class="block">Against that background, I believe there will be general agreement that this Budget is above all a fiscally responsible one. </para>
      <para>Among other things it represents another step towards a better &#39;mix&#39; of fiscal and monetary policies than has existed in recent years. </para>
      <para>The joint thrust of this Government&#39;s fiscal and monetary policies to date has slowed the growth in the monetary aggregates in recent months from the grossly excessive rates of 1 975. </para>
      <para>This Budget stays firmly on that track. </para>
      <para>The reduction we are effecting in the Budget deficit will reduce the Government&#39;s call on financing from the community. </para>
      <para>It thereby provides more scope for maintaining financial conditions appropriate to continuing recovery in the private sector while holding growth in the overall monetary aggregates at appropriate rates. </para>
      <para>Thus, the technical estimates at the moment suggest that with the monetary regulators at settings appropriate to continuing recovery in the private sector, a Budget outcome of the kind foreshadowed here, along with other factors affecting the financial system, could be consistent with growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the 10-12 per cent range during 1976-77. </para>
      <para>That range, which is subject to the usual hazards of forecasting, will no doubt change as circumstances unfold. </para>
      <para>Depending upon those circumstances it could also be necessary and appropriate for policy to be adjusted in the light of events as they develop. </para>
      <para>As of now, however, it gives a broad indication that growth in the monetary aggregates will be a notch or so lower than last year. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that, notwithstanding all the qualifications which necessarily attach to it, this broad indication of the monetary outlook will provide the private sector with a greater degree of certainty regarding that aspect of policy in the year ahead than it has previously enjoyed- particularly in recent years. </para>
      <para>It should help, for example, to allay fears of either excessive financial tightness or financial ease. </para>
      <para>Consistent with the aims of government policy, an outcome along these lines would contribute to reducing inflation while ensuring adequate funds to underwrite economic recovery. </para>
      <para>Within that broad monetary framework, the decisions of the wage-fixing authorities will be crucial to the speed of the wind-down in inflation that, one way or another, must be achieved. </para>
      <para>Provided there is significantly less than full flow-on of price increases to wages, an improvement of several percentage points in price performance, and a somewhat greater deceleration in money wages, can be had in 1976-77 as a whole. </para>
      <para>By the end of the period, we should be down to single digit rates. </para>
      <para>With some productivity gains accruing in the upturn, a noticeable rise in the profit share would then be in prospect. </para>
      <para>With such a gradual winding-down of inflation and inflationary expectations, recovery in demand and activity would be unlikely to proceed at more than a modest pace. </para>
      <para>Under those circumstances, both private consumption expenditure and business investment should, during 1976-77, become established as sources of continuing growth in demand for domestic production. </para>
      <para>Over the year as a whole they should, on that basis, record moderate increases in real terms. </para>
      <para>Unhappily, seasonal conditions appear likely to permit little if any increase in farm production overall; however, developments along the lines I have mentioned could reasonably be expected to result in gross non-farm product growing by about 4 per cent for the year as a whole. </para>
      <para>Given a more widespread recognition, on the part of all those principally concerned, of the central role which current rates of inflation are playing in holding back the recovery and keeping unemployment high, it is possible to envisage a more optimistic scenario. </para>
      <para>But until the evidence of that more widespread recognition comes up on the board- for example, in the determinations of the wage-fixing tribunals and in the co-operation with those decisions of the trade union leadership as a whole- we cannot plan on that. </para>
      <para>Even the more gradual recovery prospects, however, would be consistent, after allowance for labour force and productivity growth, with some gradual reduction in unemployment during the course of 1976-77. </para>
      <para>It would be rash to predict any earlier reduction in unemployment; movements in the remainder of calendar year 1976 are unlikely to be great. </para>
      <para>But 1977, all going well, should see the start of a more concerted fall. </para>
	  <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>This Budget embodies and advances the Government&#39;s overall economic and social strategy. </para>
      <para>The economy is now set on the right path and the combination of expenditure and tax measures in this Budget will help it along that path. </para>
      <para>For the first time in several years there are now good prospects of staying on a growth path we can sustain. </para>
      <para>Inflation- and therefore unemployment- will not be wiped out overnight, but even on a not over-optimistic view of things they will be steadily reduced by the budgetary and other policies to which this Government is adhering. </para>
      <para>After only eight months since, on coming to office, we confronted the full enormity of our inheritance, these policies are now beginning to produce results. </para>
      <para>At the same time the Budget also reflects the Government&#39;s priorities both as between private and public spending, and within the public sector itself. </para>
      <para>It is, as I said at the outset, both a Budget for confidence and a Budget for reform. </para>
      <para>As such, I commend the Budget to Honourable Members. </para>

          <page.no>30</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
		<para>Budget Aggregates</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The key Budget aggregates for 1976-77 are shown in the following table, together with comparable data for 1975-76: </para>
		<para>Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The budgeted increase of 11.3 per cent in outlays in 1976-77 is about half the increase in 1975-76, which in turn was about half the increase in 1974-75. The Budget therefore provides for a continuing marked deceleration in the rate of growth in outlays in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After remaining fairly steady around 24-25 per cent for many years, total outlays as a proportion of GDP jumped to 30.0 per cent in 1974-75 and increased further to 31.4 per cent in 1975-76. On the basis of present estimates the proportion in 1976-77 is expected to be around (perhaps slightly less than) 30 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government&#39;s decision to implement a new scheme of family allowances from 1 July 1976 is estimated to add close to $800 million to Budget outlays in 1976-77. The effects of this decision on the increase in outlays are expected to be largely - though not entirely - offset by other special factors, including the proposed borrowings by the Australian Telecommunications Commission from outside the Budget, the proposed large repayments by the Australian Wool Corporation and the large prepayments made to the States late in 1975-76 in respect of hospital operating costs in the September quarter of 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Budget outlays classified according to broad economic type are shown in the table below. The Commonwealth&#39;s own direct expenditure on goods and services is estimated to increase slightly faster than total outlays. Payments to or for the States are estimated to increase by 7.2 per cent compared with 1975-76 but if allowance were made for the prepayments in respect of hospital operating costs in late June the increase would be 12.6 per cent. Cash benefits to persons are estimated to increase by 21.4 per cent. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="100131197608175_30_2.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An account of the economic context of the 1976-77 Budget and of the postBudget outlook for the economy is presented in Statement No. 2. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A detailed account of estimated outlays in 1976-77, classified by function, is presented in Statement No. 3. The summary table below shows Budget outlays in 1975-76 and estimated outlays in 1976-77 classified according to the main functional headings. </para>
        <para>The major changes are: o total outlays are estimated to increase at half the rate which occurred in 1975-76 but outlays for defence and education are estimated to increase more rapidly than in 1975-76, reflecting the high priority which the Government attaches to these activities;  o  the further rapid increase in estimated outlays for social security and welfare reflects, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> the introduction of the new scheme of family allowances and the Government&#39;s decisions to maintain the real value of pensions and other benefits;  o  the large increase in respect of the &#39;Not allocated to function&#39; category is attributable mainly to a rapid increase in estimated payments of debt charges which, in turn, reflects the sharp rise in the level of outstanding debt following the large deficits of the past two years;  o  mainly as a consequence of the Government&#39;s changes to Medibank and the advance payments made to the States in June 1976 for hospital operating costs, outlays for health purposes are estimated to decline marginally in 1976-77, after more than doubling in 1975-76;  o  the decline in outlays on urban and regional development nec and the environment is concentrated in urban development programs which have grown very rapidly in recent years and which are currently under review; and <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> the estimated decline in outlays for economic services reflects changes in financing arrangements for the Telecommunications Commission and some other statutory authorities and the expected large repayments of earlier advances in 1976-77 from the Australian Wool Corporation. </para>
		<para>Budget Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget receipts are estimated to increase by 18.8 per cent in 1976-77 to $21 713 million. This is after allowance for the net loss to revenue of the taxation measures announced on 20 May and in the Budget Speech. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of the estimates for 1976-77, including the impact of the new measures on receipts, are presented in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase of 18.8 per cent in receipts in 1976-77 is less than the increases recorded in recent years. The 1976-77 figure includes the effects of the introduction of personal tax indexation, the abolition of rebates for dependent children (which has been offset by increased outlays on family allowances) and the proceeds of the Medibank levy which, for administrative reasons, is being collected through the taxation system. </para>
		<para>The Deficit</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated <inline font-style="italic">overall</inline> deficit of $2608 million is $977 million less than the 1975-76 deficit of $3585 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After allowance for the deficit incurred on overseas transactions - mainly in respect of defence and foreign aid expenditure - the Budget implies an estimated <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> deficit of $1879 million in 1976-77. This is $1026 million less than the <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> deficit in 1 975-76. </para>
		<para>Historical Data</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Historical data on Budget transactions are presented in Statement Nos 5 and 6. Statement No. 5 provides a detailed account of the Budget outcome in 1975-76, while Statement No. 6 presents Budget data in both functional and national accounts form for the period 1566-67 to 1976-77. An Appendix to the Budget Statements describes the basis of the functional classification of Budget outlays and notes some changes in classification. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Macro-economic policy is currently aimed at controlling inflation and, largely as a consequence of that, achieving moderate and sustainable economic recovery. Key elements in this strategy have been restraints upon government spending, the control of liquidity and advocacy of moderation in wage fixation. Expenditure restraint, which had commenced in the 1975-76 Budget, was taken further in the announcements of December 1975 and February 1976 and, much more significantly, in the Treasurer&#39;s statement of 20 May. Important changes in personal income tax and a new system of family allowances were also announced on the latter occasion. </para>

		</subdebateinfo>
		<para>Activity and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The course of economic activity in 1975-76 falls into two phases corresponding to the two half years: a decline in the first half followed by the beginnings of a recovery in the second half. To that extent experience in 1975-76 could be said to resemble that of 1974-75. However, the resemblance stops there. The decline in activity in the first half of 1975-76 was less marked, even though movements in final expenditures were similar. Whereas the increase in the second half of 1974-75 in total final expenditures owed much to rapidly increasing public sector demand, the 1975-76 upturn, though more gradual, occurred notwithstanding a contraction in public sector spending. In contrast to the second half of 1974-75, movements in the non-production sources of supply (stocks and imports) made a positive contribution to product in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following commentary, including the accompanying charts to which the text refers, employs semi-annual movements. All figures mentioned are seasonally adjusted and in constant price terms unless otherwise noted. Since the economy is an interrelated whole, starting the discussion with developments in real activity, though conventional, is to some extent arbitrary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Examining 1975 first in more detail, it can be seen from Chart 1 that <inline font-style="italic">total final expenditure</inline> (panel g) behaved very differently in the two halves of the calendar year, increasing by 2.8 per cent in the first half, but by only 0.8 per cent in the second half. <inline font-style="italic">Private consumption expenditure</inline> (panel a) increased fairly strongly in the first half and although higher on average in the second half of 1975, actually declined over the course of that period: The introduction of Medibank resulted in a smaller proportion of hospital services being recorded in private final consumption, and a larger proportion in government final consumption; this has had the effect of reducing the <inline font-style="italic">level</inline> of recorded consumption since the September quarter 1975. Recorded consumption declined 0.1 per cent in the September quarter and 0.2 per cent in the December quarter; after allowance for the Medibank reclassification, consumption increased marginally in both quarters. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Total private fixed investment</inline>(panels b, c and d) which had fallen through 1974, declined again in the first half of 1975. Business fixed investment showed little change in that half year but in the second half of the year there were falls in both investment in <inline font-style="italic">other, buildings</inline> (panel c) and in <inline font-style="italic">plant and equipment</inline> (panel d). Lending for housing by. the major institutions increased rapidly from the December quarter of 1974 through 1975, facilitating a revival in <inline font-style="italic">private dwelling investment</inline> (panel b) in the second half of 1975. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The growth in private consumption expenditure in the first half of 1975 was supplemented by some expansion in <inline font-style="italic">exports</inline> (panel f) but more significantly by strong growth in total <inline font-style="italic">government expenditure</inline> (panel e) which accounted for half the net increase <inline font-style="italic">m &#39;domestic final expenditure</inline> in that half year. Growth in government expenditure moderated in the second half of 1975 but still accounted for more than a third of the net increase in final expenditure in that period. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The effect on <inline font-style="italic">gross domestic product</inline> (panel j) of the rise in final expenditures in the first half of 1975 was partly blunted by the sudden switch from slight accumulation to marked de cumulation of <inline font-style="italic">stocks</inline> (panel h), this de cumulation continuing right through 1975. However, a sharp fall in <inline font-style="italic">imports</inline> (panel i) accompanied and thus offset in large part the turnaround in stocks. This ensured that much of the growth in expenditures in the first half of the year was in fact translated into increased product. Imports increased slightly in the second half of 1975 and, together with con tined stock de cumulation, more than offset the relatively small growth in final expenditures in the period; as a result total domestic product declined again. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The 1975-76 Budget assumed that 1975-76 would be a year of moderate product growth. In fact, total product declined slightly in the first half of the financial year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It has been suggested that this decline in activity in the first half of 1975-76 was due to premature contraction of fiscal stimulus in the 1975-76 Budget. However, the following analysis clearly refutes that hypothesis. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is no single budget parameter which accurately reflects the extent of fiscal push implied in any particular budget. To obtain a complete picture it is usually necessary to view a number of parameters collectively and in relation both to their own past magnitudes and to what has been and is occurring elsewhere in the economy. As a first approximation, however, the rate of increase in Budget outlays and the change in the domestic deficit (surplus) provide a useful indication. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As is clearly evidenced in the table, the rate of increase in total Commonwealth outlays accelerated markedly during 1974; it was not until the latter part of 197S that significant tapering occurred. Similarly, the domestic deficit was increasing throughout, very substantially so in 1974-75. It was not until the most recent half-year that the domestic deficit began to decrease. By these indicators, the impact of fiscal policy remained very strong into 1975-76 and could have been expected, given the normal lags and cumulative economic processes, to have imparted considerable impetus to total activity in 1975-76 and beyond, if the conventional responses had in fact been applying. In the event, the economy was sluggish during the first half of 1975-76 despite that impetus. This further suggests that, as in 1974-75, insufficient account was being taken of the influence of inflation on relationships between fiscal stimulus, income, aggregate demand, activity and employment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The two largest variations between actual events during 1975-76 and what was said in this document a year ago, were somewhat more sluggish growth in private consumption in the first half of the year, and a larger contribution to supplies from non-production sources - stock de cumulation and imports. Of the other major expenditure aggregates, private dwelling investment - which had earlier undergone a severe shake-out - grew rather more than expected but the absolute magnitudes were not all that large; new investment in other building and in plant and equipment remained, as foreseen, fairly sluggish overall. Government final demand and exports behaved, by and large, as anticipated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Why did the major elements of private final demand not continue to grow? What factors contributed to the behaviour of stocks and imports and the consequent reduced level of activity? Answers to these questions are clearly central to analysing the subdued performance of the economy in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The influences bearing on the individual decisions comprising the major aggregates are, of course, many and varied and those important for one decision will be less so for others. One major common influence on all decisions in 1975-76 (and the immediately preceding years) has been rapid inflation and, in the earlier stages, rapidly accelerating inflation. There is substantial evidence to suggest that the inflation of recent years both deepened and prolonged the recession; the effects of inflation on major final demand components are further discussed below. In the period under review, the inflationary environment also influenced the behaviour of stocks and imports, in each case contributing to the severity of the downturn in product; while obviously not the sole influence in either case, inflation played a major part in both. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The expected cyclical shift from run-down to build-up of stocks finally began to occur in the early months of 1976. However, up till that time the run-down in the latter part of 1975 had continued rapidly. Clearly, the sluggish behaviour of consumer demand provided one cause for continued intentional heavy de cumulation: this is evident from Table 2, which shows the ratio of non-farm stocks to sales. Low corporate profitability - part of the &#39;stagflation&#39; environment - and the attendant strains on corporate cash flows in combination with the higher cost of financing stocks, undoubtedly reinforced the normal cyclical stock-shedding process. Thus, at a time of sluggishness of final demand, the stock/ sales ratio had fallen below its longer-run average by late 1975, and by mid- 1976, well below. While it has been normal for this ratio to drop considerably below its average during past &#39;cycles&#39;, this has generally occurred in the past when expanding sales were met in part by buffering stock rundown - i.e. the rate has hitherto declined to low levels commensurate with early-1976 only after several quarters of expanding sales. What sets 1975-76 experience apart from earlier cycles in this respect is that the stock/ sales ratio had been reduced to a very low level by dint of more severe stock-shedding alone, and before any strong pick-up in sales had occurred. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In past cycles in Australia total product has been cushioned to some extent from variations in final demand by compensating movements in imports. Although not altogether absent, this cushioning effect on product has operated unusually, both with respect to magnitude and timing, during this cyclical downturn. Buoyed up by the lagged effects of the July 1973 across-the-board cut in tariffs and the September 1973 revaluation, imports reacted sluggishly to the slump in final demand in 1974; substantial increases contributed significantly to the slow-down and the decline in product in that year (Chart 1, panels i and j). The subsequent steep decline in imports in the first half of 1975 accompanying the sharp run-down in stocks, permitted the sizeable increase in final demand in that period to give rise to product growth. Steeped by the September 1974 devaluation and, to a lesser extent, the imposition of import quotas on certain items, the decline in imports in the first half of 1975 quickly reduced the ratio of imports to domestic sales from its unprecedentedly high 1974 level, to about the recent medium term average by mid-1975. As such, however, it remained still well above previous cyclical low points (Table 2). Although for 1975-76 as a whole imports were 4 per cent less than in the preceding year, imports of goods held steady in the first half of the year and then grew strongly through the second half. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Several possible reasons for this continuing high demand for imports suggest themselves. The most convincing of these has to do with the effects on import demand of the changes in relative competitiveness of domestic producers brought about by the combination of earlier exchange rate and tariff changes and the continued movements in relative prices due to higher wage increases in Australia than in its major trading partners. The &#39;market share&#39; effects of the unprecedented penetration by foreign suppliers during the 1973-74 import boom may also have been relevant. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As important as these inflation-related influences on stocks and imports have been in prolonging the period of decline in product, more fundamental, particularly from the standpoint of economic recovery, have been the effects of inflation on consumer and business confidence, and hence on final demand. It is really for these reasons that the earlier fiscal and monetary stimuli proved ineffective and the upturn in activity in the first half of 1975 that they had sought to foster proved to be unsustainable. By adding to inflation and inflationary expectations through large budget deficits, and the associated excessive additions to liquidity, the massive stimuli of 1974-75 carried within themselves the seeds of their own undoing. </para>

Conversely the share of wages, salaries and supplements rose from 64 to 71 per cent (Table 2). The comparative stability of real wages over 1975 as a whole and the first half of 1976 has allowed some marginal recovery in the profit share: in the six months to June it averaged 13 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1974 the experience of drastically reduced profitability led to a sharp reassessment of expected future profitability, both as to level and degree of uncertainty. Large cost increases could be foreseen but their size and, more importantly, the extent of their recoverability in prices, were very uncertain. Meanwhile internal cash flows, historically the most important source of corporate investment funds, contracted sharply. Inflation also caused problems on the supply side of capital markets; in particular, the uncertainty it induced caused lenders to opt for short-term assets or to require an appropriately higher return to lend long. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">As with economic activity, the monetary environment in the last financial year can be clearly divided into two parts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In response to both fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, liquidity eased rapidly in 1975 following the tightness of mid-1974. Although the rate of growth of outlays was reduced in the 1975-76 Budget, the continuing increase in the domestic deficit in 1975 (Table 1) had led to a build-up in the domestic monetary base which, by year-end, posed a clear threat to the development of anti-inflation policies. There was therefore a need for monetary policy action to reduce the excessive stock of money. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 5 and Chart 3.2 set out the main formation factors of private sector liquidity and the volume of money over 1975-76 and the two preceding financial years. Overriding all other influences during the period was strong, sustained stimulus from domestic budgetary transactions. Table 1 shows that, in seasonally adjusted terms, the budget domestic deficit rose from an annual rate of $500 million in the first half of 1974-75 to $3900 million by the first half of 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the first half of calendar 1975 this stimulus to domestic liquidity was reinforced by a surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions. In the second half, substantial private capital outflows, concentrated particularly in the month of December 1975, worked in the opposite direction. Similarly, monetary measures, which had been tending to add to liquidity since the second half of 1974, became more restraining from mid- 1975 onwards. None the less the build-up from budgetary sources was such that private sector liquidity increased by $2703 million in 1975, four times the average rise of the preceding ten years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Moreover, sales of government securities to the non-bank private sector throughout 1975 were not such as to restrain the consequent growth in the volume of money substantially. For the year as a whole, of a total budget deficit of $4167 million, only $518 million, or less than one-eighth, was offset by sales of government paper to the non-bank public. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From early 1975 the annual rate of growth of the volume of money, broadly defined, was around the historically high annual rate of 20 per cent (after adjustment for changed patterns of company tax collections). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With a slightly improved profit performance, low investment and heavy stock de cumulation, the corporate sector&#39;s net borrowing requirement was much less acute in 1975 than in 1974. Financial conditions were relatively easy and there was little difficulty in raising funds. There was some return to equity financing by companies as share prices recovered and new fixed interest raisings fell considerably. The demand for funds from financial institutions for corporate investment requirements was generally weak. The main demand for funds came from the household sector. In particular banks reported growth in personal lending through 1975 and mortgage institutions experienced keen demand for housing loans. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">At the end of 1975 financial institutions were flush with liquid funds. For example, the margin of free liquidity of the major trading banks was no less than ten percentage points. Savings bank deposits and funds held with permanent building societies had grown by more than S3.4 billion, or 22 per cent in 1975. At year&#39;s end private sector short term interest rates were substantially lower than in mid- 1974 and were tending downward. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Against this background, the Government acted in January 1976 to reduce the large stock of liquid funds in the private sector. In particular, a new form of government security, the Australian Savings Bond (which replaced Special Bonds as the Commonwealth security designed especially for &#39;household&#39; savers and small investors) was introduced with a view to attracting substantial subscriptions to Government securities from the non-bank public sector. The first Series, carrying a fixed interest rate of 10.5 per cent, quickly attracted net subscriptions of S757 million; the second Series, with an interest rate of 9.5 per cent, attracted net subscriptions of S275 million. Together with subscriptions of SI 94 million to the January/ February cash loan, the non-bank public added a total of $1187 million to its holdings of Commonwealth securities in the March quarter compared with $395 million in the first half of 1975-76 and $599 million in the whole of 1974-75 (Table 5 and Chart 3.2, panel (d)). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As part of the monetary measures introduced in January, the Reserve Bank and the trading banks agreed that the minimum LGS ratio for the purposes of the LGS convention would be increased from 18 per cent to 23 per cent until the end of March 1977. This new agreement had the effect of temporarily reducing the trading banks&#39; margins of free liquidity from 1 0 to 5 percentage points. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the March quarter there was a turnaround to a small surplus in the outcome of private sector foreign exchange transactions following the heavy net outflow of private capital in the December quarter. But a decline in the Budget deficit, in part seasonal but also reflecting a sharp reduction in the underlying rate, combined with the substantial take-up of government paper by non-bank investors, already described, to slow the rate of monetary growth (Table 5 and Chart 3.1). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">At the end of March the Treasurer reaffirmed that the Government would administer its monetary policies so that sufficient funds would be available to underwrite private sector recovery without being fully accommodating to inflation and that its policies would continue to be administered flexibly. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It was evident that, with the deferral of the February company tax instalment to the June quarter, there would be a very large seasonal drain of funds from markets in that quarter. Accordingly, measures were taken to enable financial institutions to meet the demands upon them in the seasonally tight period without undue strains and disruptions arising. A third Series of Australian Savings Bonds introduced early in April carried a lower rate of interest. Also early in April it was announced that the SRD ratio was to be reduced by two percentage points later that month and that the Reserve Bank would, as usual, be conducting its operations in financial markets to smooth out any marked seasonality and other temporary irregularities. In the event, action taken by the Reserve Bank included substantial net purchases of commercial bills. The seasonally tight liquidity period was traversed without undue strain; sensitive short term interest rates rose temporarily; longer term interest rates remained generally unchanged; banks maintained their rates of new lending, although the trading banks&#39; margin of free liquidity was reduced to a very low level. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overall the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of M3 was reduced to around 9 per cent in the six months to June 1976. Over 1975-76 as a whole M3 grew by about 14 per cent. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Following very rapid increases in 1974-75 the rate of increase in earnings moderated somewhat in 1975-76 (Chart 4, panels a and b). With wage increases in 1975-76 more or less in line with the rate of price increase, the severe compression of profits experienced in 1974-75 was arrested: however, full indexation of wages during most of the year and little growth in productivity over the year as a whole precluded more than a marginal recovery in the profit share (Chart 6). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Unit wage costs</inline>(Chart 5, panel a) rose more rapidly than average weekly earnings in the first half of 1975-76, though at rates well below those experienced at the peak in 1974-75. The rate of increase was less rapid in the second half. The behaviour of unit costs in both halves largely reflected variation in measured productivity since there was little difference in earnings growth (Chart 4, panel a), <inline font-style="italic">Unit gross surplus</inline> (Chart 5, panel b) increased noticeably in the first half year, falling back a little in the second half. For the year as a whole, the increase in unit gross surplus, together with increased product in the second half, led to a 16 per cent increase in the <inline font-style="italic">gross operating surplus of companies</inline> but, as noted, only marginal recovery in the profit share (Chart 6). Income of non-farm <inline font-style="italic">unincorporated</inline> enterprises increased 20 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given these movements in unit costs and gross surplus, <inline font-style="italic">aggregate non-farm prices</inline> accelerated in the first half of 1975-76 (Chart 5, panel c), moderating slightly in the second half. Falling farm and import prices offset the first half lift in non-farm aggregate price change, accounting for the more even picture for the implicit <inline font-style="italic">deflator for major GNE components</inline> (Chart 4, panel d). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Gross farm product</inline>is estimated to have increased by about 7 per cent in 1975-76 in constant prices, but declined by 3 per cent in current prices because of lower prices received for some products. There were sizeable increases in farm costs and <inline font-style="italic">farm income</inline> declined by about 20 per cent, compared with a 59 per cent decline in 1974-75 and increases in the 60 per cent range in the two preceding years. The gross value of production of <inline font-style="italic">wheat</inline> is estimated to have declined marginally in 1975-76, most <inline font-style="italic">other grains</inline> showing substantial increases. The value of <inline font-style="italic">wool</inline> production increased slightly, but was still well below the levels recorded from 1972 to 1974. The value of <inline font-style="italic">livestock</inline> slaughtered recovered somewhat from the very low level of 1974-75, but was still well below the 1973-74 level. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although the system of conditional wage indexation introduced by the Arbitration Commission in its April 1975 National Wage decision was clearly the dominant influence in the process of wage determination in 1975-76, it is not possible to ascribe precise relative influences on earnings growth to this and other developments. While in 1975 the indexation system was generally accepted as having contributed to an industrial relations climate more conducive to moderation of wage demands, it is equally clear that willingness to comply with the Commission&#39;s guidelines covering non-indexation increases was reinforced by labour market conditions. Clearly too, lags in the application of indexation adjustments had some, at least temporary, moderating effects. It is open to argument whether earnings growth for the year as a whole was greater or less than it would have been in the absence of indexation. What can be said is that although deceleration in average ordinary time earnings was substantial early in the year, the scope of that deceleration was limited, under conditions of full indexation, largely to elimination of increases in excess of the prevailing inflation rate. </para>

The Commission&#39;s decision of  28  May  1976  involved a degree of partial indexation which represented a first step towards some further deceleration of inflation through the wages mechanism. </para>

          <page.no>50</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
		<para>Background</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The preceding analysis has depicted an economy which is showing signs of recovery. So far, as described earlier, much of this growth appears to have come from a turnaround in inventory investment and growth in exports. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">By its very nature, inventory investment cannot be expected to be a continuing source of growth. The longevity of recovery therefore depends on the achievement of steady, sustainable growth in both private consumption and private fixed capital expenditure. If consumption fails to grow, there can be no recovery, simply because consumption is such a large part of total demand. If consumption does grow but investment fails to grow, there is a very real risk of the re-emergence of <inline font-style="italic">sectoral</inline> capacity constraints, and hence of upward pressure on at least some prices and/or spill-over into imports, at an early stage. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The strength of these components depends, in turn, on a number of factors. Crucial is the further diminution of inflation and inflationary expectations. An integral part of Australia&#39;s high inflation-high unemployment economic environment was the increase in the real wage that had earlier taken place, during  1974  in particular. Running as it did far ahead of productivity, and shifting factor shares, this dislocation of the normal relationships previously obtaining in the Australian economy has been preserved throughout the recession and, as discussed above, has contributed significantly both to its onset and its prolongation. It is important to state the implications of this fact for policy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Government policy starts from the standpoint that in current circumstances control of inflation is fundamental to the achievement of other economic policy objectives. The control of inflation is directed in part at those undesirable features which have commonly been associated with inflation: the inability of some groups to protect their incomes and savings, the distorting effects in the allocation of financial and real resources, and so on. But even more fundamental in recent experience has been the nexus whereby inflation has fostered recession and, most particularly, the very large increases in the real wage and associated factor share which made such a marked contribution to those developments in Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Unless and until the real wage is brought down relative to productivity in the process of winding inflation rates back, it will not be possible to restore fully the level of economic activity and to provide sufficient new job opportunities to reduce unemployment significantly. In the circumstances that prevail, those who argue for the increase or maintenance of real wages (or those who take decisions intended to increase or maintain them) are in effect, unwittingly or not, contributing to the maintenance of unemployment at present high levels. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As the Commonwealth has argued before the Arbitration Commission, the rate of recovery and return to high employment economic stability will be longer delayed the longer the present real wage imbalance is maintained. The necessary adjustment can take place <inline font-style="italic">much more quickly</inline> and with much less cost in terms of idle resources and production forgone, if money wages increase for a period at rates noticeably below the inherited rate of price change. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As they appeared earlier this year on the basis of the expenditure proposals and tax rates which existed then, prospects for the 1976-77 Budget were for a much larger deficit than in 1975-76. Such an outcome would, of course, have been completely incompatible with the objectives of policy. Inflationary expectations and inflation would have been exacerbated, not only because such an outcome would have been seen as failure by the Government to control its own activities, but also because of the massive infusion of liquidity into the economy implied by such a deficit. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Such a set back to the quelling of inflationary expectations, and to confidence more generally, would have further depressed private consumption and private investment spending. In addition, if other implications of recent experience have been correctly drawn, other components which could well have assisted in choking off recovery in such a situation are inventories and imports. With inflationary expectations reinforced and renewed uncertainty engendered, business would not have willingly built up its stock levels. Again, with no further inroads to be expected in the rate of inflation, Australia&#39;s competitive position vis-a-vis our major trading partners would have deteriorated further; the inevitable strengthening of import flows which would have resulted would also have dampened domestic production. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In sum, under these conditions an early end to the incipient recovery was to be expected. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It was in the light of this outlook that the fiscal measures of 20 May were framed. They incorporated expenditure restraint and personal tax indexation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a result of the 20 May package, and of other subsequent measures, a Budget deficit of $2608 million is now in prospect; the corresponding domestic deficit is $1879 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given these fiscal decisions and the background of other relevant developments, what is the economic outlook for the period ahead? </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It first needs to be said that no-one can accurately foretell the path which the economy will follow. This is particularly so given that the present position of the economy is considerably removed from past experience. The foregoing analysis has attempted, of course, to pinpoint some of the causal elements of this departure. A high level of unemployment continues to coincide with rates of price and wage increase which, while they showed some improvement over the course of 1975-76, are still clearly destabilising. The following description of the <inline font-style="italic">possible</inline> path of the economy over 1976-77 may then, indeed <inline font-style="italic">will,</inline> prove to be incorrect in detail if not, hopefully, in the broad. This will be particularly so if any of the specific working <inline font-style="italic">assumptions,</inline> which must be made in arriving at an overall forecast, are invalidated. </para>
		<para>Assumptions</para>
        <para>These assumptions include the following: o The general stance of monetary policy will be such that the banking system is able to meet the needs of the economy for finance while being less than fully accommodating to inflationary demands; o Apart from the Budget proposals themselves, there will be no new fiscal measures during 1976-77; o During 1976-77, no requirement for significant change in Australia&#39;s external economic policies will emerge, and the recovery in overseas economies will continue at a moderate rate; o Seasonal conditions will permit little if any increase in aggregate farm production; o Some form of partial indexation of award wages will continue, as will restraint in increases in other wages and conditions of employment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Of all these assumptions the most crucial is clearly the last. In effect, the course and extent of economic recovery in 1976-77 and beyond will be a function of the speed with which the present real wage imbalance can be rectified. To the extent that the assumption of continuing partial indexation proves invalid - or to the extent that restraint in other wage increases and conditions of employment is not maintained - the speed of recovery will be diminished, new jobs will not be created or will be created more slowly, and the present high levels of unemployment will be prolonged. </para>
		<para>Expenditure and Product</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the basis of the foregoing, <inline font-style="italic">private consumption expenditure,</inline> which has already shown some growth, is expected to continue to expand at a moderate rate. Such growth should be increasingly spread across all components. It seems likely that the rate of growth of consumption will exceed that of income when both are expressed in real terms, implying a further decline in the saving ratio. This latter development is however only reasonably to be expected in the context of improvement on the inflationary front and, at the worst, no renewed deterioration in the labour market. It may be noted specifically that these assumptions imply a rise in real consumption notwithstanding some decline in real average wages (see <inline font-style="italic">Prices and Incomes</inline> below). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Investment in dwellings</inline>grew very rapidly over the course of 1975-76. Financial flows and prospective monetary conditions suggest further moderate growth in 1976-77 as a whole, although the early months of the year may show the lagged effects of the downturn in building society finance approvals during the later months of 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Anticipations and survey data to hand suggest that <inline font-style="italic">business fixed investment</inline> could well begin to grow early in 1976-77. The picture of <inline font-style="italic">timing</inline> of recovery could differ somewhat between the two components: <inline font-style="italic">other building and construction</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">plant and equipment.</inline> Since the slump in non-dwelling construction investment has been relatively great, the outlook may still imply a fall for 1976-77 as a whole even though, <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> the year, the turnaround is occurring. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">plant and equipment,</inline> on the other hand, which has recently recorded growth, the further recovery in 1976-77 should result in a modest rise for the year as a whole. It must be stressed that the outlook for business investment is particularly contingent upon perceived improvement in the rate of inflation, improved profit performance and the general state of business confidence. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The policy decisions entailed in this Budget should imply that <inline font-style="italic">government expenditure on final goods and services,</inline> summed over all levels of government, will show only small increases in 1976-77. What growth there will be is likely to take place at the State and Local levels only. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Stocks</inline>have apparently turned around. Accumulation is expected to continue throughout 1976-77 and, if so, will contribute substantially to year-on-year growth in total product. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This outlook for domestic demand, taken together with the picture for exports and imports given below, is consistent with growth in <inline font-style="italic">gross non-farm product</inline> in real terms of about 4 per cent in 1976-77. This is not strong growth by the standards of previous recoveries but, failing a major improvement in the real wage imbalance and a consequential speed-up in winding down inflation, it is probably about all the economy will be able to sustain during the period. </para>
		<para>Balance of Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Developments in the balance of payments will be influenced by the strength of the recovery in world economic activity, and by that in the domestic economy. As the world economic recovery proceeds, <inline font-style="italic">export</inline> growth should consolidate and become more general, providing a significant source of stimulus to the domestic economy. <inline font-style="italic">Imports</inline> seem likely to continue to grow, probably at a somewhat faster rate than domestic demand. At this stage it seems plausible to think in terms of a trade surplus of about the same size as, and a <inline font-style="italic">current account deficit</inline> moderately larger than, in 1975-76. The capital account will benefit from a progressive resumption of long-term private capital inflow and a continuation of government borrowing at moderate levels. In the latter connection the recent purchase from the IMF under the compensatory financing facility is relevant. </para>
		<para>Monetary Conditions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The foregoing would imply approximate balance in the external account so that the major influence on domestic liquidity conditions would come from domestic budgetary transactions. The smaller deficit in prospect should contribute to a lesser monetary expansion than during 1975-76, when the volume of money (M3) rose by almost 14 per cent. In their nature monetary forecasts tend to be even more fallible than activity forecasts but, on the assumptions enunciated above and with appropriate settings of monetary policy, the <inline font-style="italic">volume of money</inline> broadly defined could increase by between 10 and 12 per cent over the course of 1976-77. It should be stressed that this expected growth in the volume of money is a forecast conditional upon the stated assumptions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">If the associated product and price expectations were to be realised, this would represent monetary growth consistent with objectives of policy, namely, to provide sufficient funds to foster sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while exerting some downward pressure on inflation; depending on precise outcomes it could imply some increase in the velocity of circulation. </para>
		<para>Labour Market</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Product growth of the order projected above would probably be accompanied by growth in <inline font-style="italic">productivity</inline> of more than half of that amount. <inline font-style="italic">Employment</inline> growth then appears likely to be of the order of 1-2 per cent for the year as a whole although a faster rate of growth, more than 2 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">over</inline> the year is implied. Employment in the private sector will probably grow somewhat faster than that while, by contrast with recent years, public sector employment will show little, if any, growth. The labour force is projected to grow by 2 per cent at most over the course of 1976-77. Present expectations are thus for only a gradual reduction in the rate of <inline font-style="italic">unemployment,</inline> with little if any of this appearing during calendar 1976. Prospects for continuing gains in the unemployment area do, of course, strengthen into the following financial year, 1977-78. </para>
		<para>Prices and Incomes</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The continued application of some form of partial indexation as applied in May and August, is consistent with a gradual winding down in the rate of inflation provided extra-indexation wage increases (and improvement in conditions) remain small. If these (rather pessimistic) assumptions about indexation and extra-indexation wage settlements were to prove accurate, <inline font-style="italic">average weekly earnings</inline> might grow by about 12 per cent compared with the 14 per cent increase recorded in 1975-76. On that basis, the increase in the <inline font-style="italic">consumer price index</inline> and more broadly based price indices would seem likely to be of a similar order of magnitude for the year as a whole. Real average earnings per employed person would remain approximately unchanged but, due to employment growth, aggregate real earnings would increase moderately. Given projected changes in personal taxes, cash benefits, and other income components, both average and aggregate real disposable household income would increase at a faster rate than the real earnings component. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Price changes of these magnitudes for the year as a whole imply a markedly better performance <inline font-style="italic">over the course of</inline> 1976-77 than occurred over the <inline font-style="italic">course</inline> of 1975-76. Looked at on a June quarter to June quarter basis, price increases some 4 to 5 percentage points lower than the increases recorded between the June quarters of 1975 and 1976 are expected for broadly based deflators. This picture would be consistent with annual rates of change in the single-digit area by the end of 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given the prospective productivity increases mentioned earlier the wage-price developments would be accompanied by noticeable, but incomplete, recovery in the share of national income going to profits. In absolute terms the increase in non-wage (non-farm) incomes can be expected to be quite strong - possibly considerably in excess of the increases recorded in 1975-76. Only slow growth is to be expected in aggregate farm income. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Needless to say, the picture in all respects would be better, the more rapidly the present inflation rate were wound down. The chief determinant of this during 1976-77 will be the extent to which the increase in money wages can be held below the inherited increase in prices. A more favourable outcome in this respect than that which has been taken for the purposes of the assumptions set out earlier would result, in time, in a sharper recovery in activity, a greater growth in employment and a more substantial inroad into present levels of unemployment. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for defence in 1976-77 are estimated at $2178.2 million, an increase of 17.6 per cent over 1975-76 and equivalent to 9.0 per cent of total Budget outlays. In 1975-76 defence outlays represented 8.5 per cent of total outlays. </para>
	  <para>Manpower Costs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision has been made for an increase of $88.5 million in manpower costs in 1976-77. The main reasons for the increase are the full-year effects of awards and determinations made in 1975-76 and a rise in the average number of service personnel. An increase in the number of pensioners, as well as a requirement to provide for an additional pension payday in 1976-77 are primarily responsible for the increase in the defence forces retirement and death benefits provision. Manpower costs are estimated to account for 52.7 per cent of total defence outlays in 1976-77, compared with 57.2 per cent of actual defence outlays in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Defence Equipment and Stores</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, etc.) is adequate to meet likely contingencies. Outlays on &#39;capital&#39; equipment in 1976-77 are estimated at $305.9 million, an increase of $158.2 million, and relate mainly to projects already committed, including patrol frigates, an oceanographic ship and Oberon submarines for the Navy, Nomad aircraft, tanks and Surface to Air Guided Weapons for the Army and replacement Hercules CI 30 aircraft and Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft for the RAAF. Provision has been made also for initial payments on new major equipment projects and for other equipment, details of which will be announced by the Minister for Defence. Expenditure on supporting equipment in 1976-77 is estimated at $178.1 million, an increase of $14.9 million over 1975-76. Outlays on repairs and maintenance are expected to increase by $5.0 million. </para>
		<para>Defence Facilities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading is to provide and maintain capital facilities, including adequate living and working accommodation for personnel. Advances to the States for the provision of housing for servicemen and their families are estimated at $36.2 million, $2.0 million more than the amount spent in 1975-76. Other significant buildings and works include the continuation of construction of the Naval support facility at Cockburn Sound (W.A.), an office building at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, a transmitting station at Humpty Doo (N.T.) and a supply centre at Zetland (N.S.W.). Provision also is made for upgrading of facilities at Has Marimba (N.S.W.), RAAF Regents Park (N.S.W.) and Williamstown Dockyard (Vic). Expenditure on these and other projects is expected to total $142.6 million in 1976-77, an increase of $16.3 million over 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Industrial Capacity</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main variation between expenditure in 1975-76 and 1976-77 relates to an increase of $15.4 million in the cost of maintaining reserve production capacity at Government factories and in industry. Part of this increase arises from changes in the methods of charging for Defence orders. Assistance provided in the estimates for the production of Nomad aircraft is $3.4 million lower than actual expenditure in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Defence Science and Technology Establishments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on defence science and technology is aimed at assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in military technology and at developing weapons systems suited to Australia&#39;s defence needs. Reductions in expenditure on the Woomera Joint Project resulting from the rundown of the Woomera Range towards a care and maintenance level are estimated to be more than offset by the full-year effects of recent wage and other cost increases. </para>
        <para>Defence Co-operation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Through defence co-operation the Government aims to help friendly countries in the region of immediate interest to Australia to strengthen their own and the region&#39;s capacity for defence. Estimated expenditure of $23.9 million in 1976-77 includes $6.9 million as part of our commitment to Indonesia under a second three year commitment program of $25 million which began last year, and $4.6 million for continuing assistance to Malaysia and Singapore at levels similar to those in past years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $12.2 million is included for defence co-operation with Papua New Guinea in 1976-77, compared with $27.8 million last year. The decrease reflects new budgetary arrangements for providing financial assistance to Papua New Guinea for defence which were introduced from 6 March 1975, and the completion of the transfer of defence assets during 1975-76. The continuing localisation of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has also reduced the numbers and support costs of Australian servicemen in Papua New Guinea. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There has been a modest increase in military training and advisory assistance to other countries, including the Philippines, Thailand and Fiji. </para>
		<para>Storage and Transport Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included here are removal and storage costs associated with the transfer of government employees in the defence sector and servicemen. </para>
		<para>General Administrative Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This broad category of expenditure covers a wide range of items including travel, office requisites, postage and telephone services, light, power and water supplies, freight and cartage, compensation payments, and medical and dental services provided by civilian authorities. The budgeted increase of $32.5 million is attributable mainly to increased costs of providing these services, and an increase in activity. </para>
		<para>Natural Disasters, Civil Defence and Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included under this heading are outlays on natural disasters, civil defence, war graves and various miscellaneous items. </para>
		<para>Recoveries and Repayments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Recoveries and repayments in 1976-77 are estimated to total $76.6 million, slightly more than in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The major items are payments by servicemen for rent and rations, contributions by other countries to the costs of joint defence activities and revenue from disposal of surplus defence equipment. </para>

The term &#39;service&#39; includes service in the 1914-18 War, the 1939-45 War, the Korea-Malaya Operations, the Far East Strategic Reserve, special service in South-East Asia (including Vietnam) and service with the Defence Force on or after 7 December 1972. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Basic eligibility varies according to the nature of service. Broadly, for those with &#39;active service&#39;, incapacity or death resulting from &#39;any occurrence&#39; during service may be accepted. For those with &#39;home service&#39;, however, the criterion is narrower, in that incapacity or death must have arisen out of, or be attributable to, that service; incapacity or death arising from a condition existing prior to enlistment may be accepted if aggravated or contributed to by the conditions of service. </para>
		<para>Classes of War Pensions</para>
        <para>Pensions are paid to eligible veterans in three main categories: &#176; The Special Rate (known as the T &#38; PI) Pension, payable to a veteran who, as a result of service, is blinded, or is totally and permanently incapacitated so that he is unable to earn more than a negligible percentage of a living wage; o The Intermediate Rate, payable to a veteran who, because of the severity of his incapacity accepted as related to service, can work only part-time or intermittently, and in consequence is unable to earn a living wage; and o The General Rate, payable to a veteran who has an incapacity accepted as related to service, but who is still able to work full-time, although under difficulty. The amounts payable range from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of the maximum general rate, according to the assessed degree of incapacity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pensions are also paid to the wives of incapacitated veterans and to their children. Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular veteran&#39;s incapacity. When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow&#39;s rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at &#39;orphan&#39; rates and other benefits. If a veteran&#39;s death has not been accepted as related to service, but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at the special rate or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service. Other dependants of deceased veterans may qualify for pensions in certain cases. </para>

        <para>Advances to States for Housing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides an amount of $375 million to be advanced to the States in 1976-77 for welfare housing purposes under the terms of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. The amount advanced in 1975-76 was $364.6 million. These advances, which are repayable at low rates of interest over a 53 year period, are mainly to assist the State housing authorities to provide dwellings for rental or sale on a concessional basis to low income families. A proportion of the advances is allocated to Home Builders&#39; accounts to provide low-interest housing loans to prospective home owners who meet specified eligibility conditions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Eligibility for allocation of a State housing authority dwelling, or for a loan from the Home Builders&#39; account, is determined by means tests. For allocation of a family dwelling from a State housing authority, average weekly income of the main family breadwinner during the previous six months (excluding overtime and child endowment) must not exceed 85 per cent of the Statistician&#39;s latest seasonally adjusted quarterly estimate of average weekly earnings. For a loan from Home Builders&#39; account funds, income of the main breadwinner must not exceed 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. In cases where the family includes more than two children an additional $2 per week is added to the income limit for each additional child. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Sales of State housing authority dwellings are limited to a maximum of 30 per cent of family dwellings completed during the five years commencing 1 January 1974. Sales may be made only to purchasers meeting the means test at the time of sale, and there are restrictions on resale. The maximum interest rate is set at 5.75 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of the Housing Agreement and the State by State allocation of the $375 million are presented in the document <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1976-77</inline> published concurrently with the Budget Speech. </para>
		<para>Grants to States for Housing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Housing Act)</inline> 1971 authorises the provision of housing assistance to the States by way of basic grants of $2.75 million a year, payable for a period of 30 years in respect of the States&#39; housing operations in each of the years 1971-72 and 1972-73; $5.5 million will again be paid in 1976-77. The payments are in lieu of an interest concession on funds used by the States for welfare housing in those years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The provision for payment of an additional grant of $1.25 million a year for rental assistance under this Act expired on 30 June 1976; no rental assistance grant is, therefore, payable in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act</inline> 1945, the Commonwealth pays a contribution under specified conditions towards the rental losses of houses built by a State under that Agreement. In 1975-76, an amount of $226 084 was paid to Queensland under the Act. </para>

		<para>Home Savings Grants</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the <inline font-style="italic">Home Savings Grant Act</inline> 1964 a grant is payable to eligible persons who have accumulated savings over a period of at least three years towards the purchase or construction of their first home. This scheme formally ends on 31 December 1976. It is to be replaced, however, by a new scheme to operate from 1 January 1977, details of which were announced in March 1976. Grants will continue to be paid under the 1964 Act, on homes contracted to be built or purchased on or before 31 December 1976, to persons who had commenced to save by 21 August 1973. Estimated expenditure in 1976-77 under the 1964 Act is $6.5 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The new scheme, when fully operative, will provide for payment of a grant of up to $2000 on the basis of $1 for each- $3 saved. Savings held in acceptable forms from 1 January 1976 will be eligible. The first $2000 grants will be payable in respect of homes acquired on or after 1 January 1979. Grants of up to $1333 will also be payable from 1 January 1978 for savings over two years and of up to $667 from 1 January 1977 for savings over one year, on the basis of $1 for each $3 saved after 1 January 1976. The new scheme will provide for grants to all persons whether married or single, who are Australian citizens, or who have the right to permanent residence in Australia, who are acquiring their first home. There is no limitation on the age of applicants nor on the value of the dwelling involved. Estimated expenditure in 1976-77 under the new scheme is $15 million. </para>
		<para>Housing Loans to Savings Banks</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">Banks (Housing Loans) Act</inline> 1974 provided for a special appropriation of $150 million to be advanced to savings banks and certain other banks for the purpose of making additional housing finance available to give a short-term stimulus to activity and employment in the home building industry. Advances of $119.7 million were made to banks in 1974-75 to meet drawings against loan approvals; a further $30.1 million was advanced in 1975-76. An amount of $0.2 million was not drawn. Repayments totalling $53.1 million were received in 1975-76, including a prepayment of $38.2 million. Repayments in 1976-77 are estimated at $10.7 million. </para>
		<para>Defence Service Homes (Australian Housing Corporation)</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Administration of the Defence Service Homes Scheme has been the responsibility of the Australian Housing Corporation since 24 June 1975. The Government decided in February 1976 to abolish the Corporation; alternative administrative arrangements are now being developed for the Defence Service Homes Scheme. Meanwhile, an amount of $10.2 million is being provided to meet administrative expenses in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $39.3 million is being advanced for the Defence Service Homes Scheme&#39;s lending program. An estimated $66.4 million representing principal repayments by borrowers will be retained by the Corporation for re lending. Thus $105.7 million will be available for the Defence Service Homes program in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a result of the decision to abolish the Corporation, $9 million of the funds advanced to the Corporation in 1974-75 were repaid to Consolidated Revenue in 1975-76. A further amount of $34.6 million was repaid to Consolidated Revenue by the Corporation in 1975-76, representing total principal repayments by borrowers for the five months to 1 December 1975. From that date, principal repayments have been retained by the Corporation for relending. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An interest subsidy of S24.5 million was paid to the Corporation in 1975-76; the estimated subsidy required for 1976-77 is $27 million. The interest subsidy reflects the extent to which interest charged to borrowers under the Defence Service Homes Scheme falls short of the interest rate payable to the Commonwealth on the Corporation&#39;s capital. </para>
        <para class="block">Housing in the Territories </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading covers the construction of new houses and flats and advances to individuals for the construction of dwellings in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Of the S78.8 million allocated for dwellings to be built for sale or rental in 1976-77, $22.8 million will be allocated to the Australian Capital Territory and $56 million to the Northern Territory. Of the latter amount S53.6 million is for dwelling construction by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in the $50.7 million for 1976-77 under Other Gross Advances for Housing is an advance to the Northern Territory Housing Commission of $21.2 million for the purpose of building dwellings for sale or rental. Of the balance, SI 5.6 million will be available for first mortgage lending by the ACT Commissioner for Housing in 1976-77. This represents a reduction from the S29.1 million available in 1975- 76 and is consistent with the Government&#39;s decision to apply a more stringent means test for eligibility - more closely matching that in the States - for ACT Commissioner for Housing loans. For eligible Northern Territory residents, SI 3.8 million, including SI 1.5 million under a concessional scheme to allow rebuilding following Cyclone Tracy, will be available for first mortgage lending by the NT Home Finance Trustee, compared with $11 million in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Housing for Aboriginals</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Government provides special assistance to help meet the housing needs of Aboriginals. The Budget provides $28.3 million for this purpose in 1976- 77, $15 million less than actual outlays in 1975-76. The Government is reviewing the objectives, priorities and delivery of its programs in this area and the Budget provision is to cover outstanding firm commitments. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimated outlays include $6.5 million in grants to the States ($13.2 million in 1975-76) and $7.2 million in grants to Aboriginal Housing Associations ($19.3 million in 1975-76) for the construction and purchase of homes for Aboriginal families. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The provision for the Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund of the Aboriginal Loans Commission will be increased from $7 million in 1975-76 to $10 million in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to Aboriginal Hostels Limited for the provision of hostel accommodation for Aboriginals are estimated at $3.7 million in 1976-77 compared with $3.5 million in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Other Recoveries and Repayments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included here are rents received in respect of Government-owned dwellings in the Territories. Receipts from rentals in the Northern Territory are estimated to increase from $2 million in 1975-76 to $4 million in 1976-77. The level of rent receipts for the Northern Territory in 1975-76 reflected the concessional level of rentals applied from 1 July 1 975, following a six month rent-free period, for cyclone damaged dwellings. The increase in 1976-77 reflects an increase in the number of Government-owned dwellings being rented in the Northern Territory and the Government&#39;s decision to increase rentals from August 1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from housing rentals in the A.C.T. are estimated to increase from $10.8 million in 1975-76 to $16.4 million in 1976-77. The increase reflects the full-year effect of increases in rents of Government dwellings in 1975-76 and a further increase, announced in June, to occur during 1976. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $10.3 million is provided in the Budget to meet the estimated cost in 1976-77 of the acquisition, planning and site development of land in the Woolloomooloo basin of Sydney. This continues the provision of financial assistance to New South Wales which commenced in 1975-76 under an agreement concluded with the State in 1974-75. The site is to be developed mainly for residential purposes. In addition to the provision of this financial assistance, the Commonwealth Government agreed to transfer to the State, at no cost, land valued in excess of $11 million. </para>
		<para>Urban Flood Mitigation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Government has undertaken in an agreement with the Queensland Government to provide 40 per cent of the cost of flood mitigation works on Breakfast Creek and Enoggera Creek in Brisbane. An amount of $1.8 million is provided in the Budget for this purpose in 1976-77, compared with $2.1 million in 1975-76.

Repayments of previous advances under this program are estimated at $0.4 million in 1976-77, compared with $0.1 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $8.7 million is provided for expenditure by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission on sewerage and garbage works. This is an increase of $4.7 million over funds made available in 1975-76 and reflects the high priority given to the replacement and repair of facilities damaged or destroyed by Cyclone Tracy. </para>

In 1976-77 it is estimated that the Australian Telecommunications Commission will need to borrow $415 million. The Government proposes that $215 million of this will be provided as advances from the Budget and that the Commission should seek to borrow the remaining $200 million on the domestic capital market. The Australian Postal Commission is not expected to require any advances from the Budget in 1976-77; rather, it is expected to repay $3 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Advances by the Commonwealth to Qantas Airways Ltd and the Australian National Airlines Commission mainly represent the passing on of proceeds of loans raised by the Government on behalf of the airlines to assist in the financing of aircraft. Amounts repaid by the airlines to the Government in respect of past loans are in turn repaid to the lenders. The proposed advances to Qantas in 1976-77 are to enable the airline to make the final payment on its twelfth Boeing B747 aircraft, while the proposed advances to TAA are to assist in purchasing its seventh Boeing B727-200 aircraft. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Department of Transport provides many services to the air transport industry, including the provision and operation of about 90 airports and of air navigational facilities. Those activities account for the major portion of administrative and operational expenditure and outlays on buildings, works and equipment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Efforts are being made to achieve economies in the provision of civil aviation services which are expected to lead to expenditure in this area being lower, in real terms, in 1976-77 than in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on buildings, works and equipment includes $2 million for continuation of the Brisbane Airport land acquisition program, $0.75 million for land acquisitions at Melbourne Airport and $3.5 million for further payments on three F28 aircraft to be delivered in 1976-77 for use by the Department of Transport in testing navigational aids. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government has decided to provide special assistance in 1976-77 to Conn air Pty Ltd and Bush Pilots Airways Ltd, which provide air services in northern Australia. At the same time a study is to be undertaken of the optimum arrangements for providing in the longer term for the essential air transport needs of the area served by Conn air. Other developmental air service subsidies will continue to be phased out. </para>

The total cost of the grants in 1976-77 is $61 000. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a further step towards achieving increased recovery of costs of providing airports and airways facilities, air navigation charges are to be increased from 1 December 1976 by 15 per cent, the maximum allowed under the 1973 Airlines Agreement with the two major domestic airlines. This increase is estimated to yield additional revenue of about $4 million in 1976-77 and $8 million in a full year. The balance of the increase in receipts from air navigation charges is due to the full-year effect of the 1975-76 increase in charges, and to traffic growth. The level of cost recovery is expected to be about 61 per cent in 1976-77 compared with about 60 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government has also taken the opportunity to review the scale of charges levied on the international airlines. Whereas all scheduled international routes are now subject to the same rate of charge, legislation will be introduced to vary the charges payable on individual routes so that they more directly reflect the cost of the facilities and services provided. No change in revenue is expected as a result of these changes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Revenue from business concessions at airports and rentals paid by airlines for airport terminals are the major elements of revenue included in other recoveries.

Late in 1975 the Act was extended to 31 December 1976, continuing the $78.74 per tonne subsidy rate, pending consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report on the subsidy. The Government has accepted in principle the Commission&#39;s recommendation that the subsidy be phased out and, as announced in the Budget Speech, proposes that the subsidy rate from 1 January 1977 be $60 per tonne. On that basis, subsidy payments in 1976-77 are estimated at $12 million. </para>

The 1975-76 Budget included $5.6 million for uranium exploration and development activities of the Commission. Mainly because of investments by the Commission in uranium mining ventures, actual expenditure totalled $10.7 million. In early 1976 the present Government decided to discontinue uranium exploration by the Commission at the end of the current field season; the $1.7 million provided for this purpose in 1976-77 accords with this decision. </para>

Firms will be encouraged to commence and develop a basic capability in industrial research and development and, in addition, worthwhile projects will receive support. The new scheme is designed to overcome two basic criticisms of the former scheme, namely the lack of any real selectivity in the administration of major grant allocations, and the complexity of the scheme itself. No funds have been allocated for payment of grants under this Act in 1976-77 but the administering body will enter commitments in 1976-77 involving expenditure in subsequent years. </para>

It became apparent during 1975-76 that the rate of expenditure under the scheme, while initially limited by difficulties in processing of claims, would substantially exceed the amount intended when the scheme was introduced. In order to reduce future expenditure under the scheme, legislation to amend the Act with effect from 1 July 1976 is to be introduced in the Budget Session of Parliament. The main changes proposed are the elimination of the premium rate of grant, a reduction in the grant ceiling for individual claims, and removal of special provisions relating to promotions sponsored by the Government. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The structural adjustment assistance scheme was introduced in 1973 to help eligible firms adjust to the effects of structural changes resulting from specified decisions of the Government. Outlays on the scheme declined from $5.3 million in 1974-75 to $1.1 million in 1975-76 following implementation of temporary protection measures for certain industries. The specified application periods in respect of all prescribed Government decisions have now expired.

        <para pgwide="yes">During 1974-75 and 1975-76, EFIC&#39;s export finance facility was provided with long-term loans from the Budget amounting to $4 million. These funds, advanced at 7i per cent, were blended with moneys provided by the trading banks at commercial rates of interest to produce concessional interest rates equivalent to those offered by foreign competitors. The subsidy involved in providing the Corporation with concessional finance amounted to $70 000 in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A new arrangement for financing EFIC&#39;s export finance activities began in July this year. The trading banks have agreed to fund the. export finance facility by way of loans at commercial rates of interest. The Corporation will on-lend the funds to foreign buyers at concessional rates of interest. The &#39;gap&#39; between the commercial rates at which EFIC will borrow and the corporation&#39;s on-lending rates will be financed from the Budget by an interest rate subsidy payable to EFIC each year. A provision of $500 000 has been made in the Budget for. this purpose. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government has developed a special instrument, the &#39;subsidy commitment authority&#39;, to control commitments on the Budget in the years ahead arising from the Corporation entering into loan transactions with overseas buyers involving subsidised interest rates. The subsidy commitment authority has been set at $15 million for 1976-77 and will be reviewed annually. It will enable EFIC, as appropriate, to finance capital goods exports aggregating approximately $75 million at existing rates of interest in present market conditions and to support Australian tenders for overseas contracts considerably in excess of this amount, given that all the tenders will not be successful. Put another way, the provision of concessional loans aggregating about $75 million would involve an interest subsidy of $15 million spread over the life of the loans. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The revised arrangements will enable EFIC to continue to provide concessional finance in support of Australian capital goods exports, will achieve substantial savings in 1976-77 and future Budgets, and will return the financing of capital goods exports to the private sector. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The item &#39;Other Assistance&#39; includes an amount of $0.7 million for the cost in 1976-77 of Australian participation, in conjunction with the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Japan, in a technical feasibility study of the VVabo hydro-electric project in Papua New Guinea; $1.3 million was spent on the study in 1975-76. </para>
        <para class="block">Industry Assistance Through the Taxation System </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A considerable amount of assistance to industry has been provided in the past through special taxation concessions. Some of these concessions were withdrawn during 1972-73 while others were withdrawn or modified in 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76. On the other hand, a new concession was introduced in 1974-75- double depreciation - applicable to new plant and equipment first used or installed ready for use by taxpayers in the manufacturing and primary industry sectors on or after 1 July 1974 and before 1 July 1975. The double depreciation scheme was extended in both time and coverage in 1975 but when the income tax law was amended to provide a new investment allowance provision was also made for the discontinuance of the double depreciation scheme for plant used or installed after 30 June 1976. The new investment allowance is applicable to new plant and equipment purchased, leased or constructed under a contract made on or after 1 January 1976. A 40 per cent rate will apply for the period 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1978, and a 20 per cent rate for the period 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1983. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Such concessions result in a reduction of, or a delay in the receipt of, Australian Government revenues (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients) . They are, in fact, as much a call on the Budget as equivalent direct outlays would be, and for this reason have sometimes been described as disguised expenditures. Assistance of this type through the taxation system has been provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their assessable income additional to those authorised under the general provisions of the income tax law. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1975-76 through the main taxation concessions is estimated to have been about $146 million. Details are shown below. (Pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme in respect of exports in 1970-71 and prior years are included under the heading &#39;Manufacturing Industry&#39;.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A those allowing the deduction of larger amounts than are authorised under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which, until it was withdrawn, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1974, gave a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deductions from income for this expenditure); </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">B those allowing certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and </para>
        <para>C those exempting certain classes of income. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main provisions in each of these classes, and the estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1975-76 are shown in the following table. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly &#39;Industry Assistance&#39;. These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; drought bonds; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees&#39; amenities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. Taxpayers to whom these provisions apply are assessed on their taxable incomes for the current year at rates of tax corresponding to the average of their incomes for the current year and the preceding four years. One effect of the provisions, which is an intended effect, is to ensure that <inline font-style="italic">fluctuations</inline> in income in conjunction with progression in rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but non fluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward trend in incomes over a number of years and, even if there are fluctuations in income superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions can result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over a period of years are comparable. </para>

The enabling legislation, the <inline font-style="italic">Stevedoring Industry Charge Act</inline> 1947, has been extended to that date. The 1976-77 estimate  &#91;Footnote continued from page 88&#93; (/) This estimate is based on the deductions allowable in the 1974-75 income year in respect of purchases and appropriations in that year (net of amounts included in the 1974-75 assessable income in respect of appropriations made in the previous year) <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> the depreciation that would have been allowable in that year on the relevant plant purchases or the plant in respect of which the appropriations were made. While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the .value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment &#39;n plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. provides for six months&#39; activity and represents collections of levies imposed on stevedoring employers which are collected by the Government on behalf of the Authority.

Apprenticeship training supervisors subsidised in State Government employment are estimated to cost the Commonwealth Government $0.2 million in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Employment Training Schemes</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">NEAT and other employment training arrangements are estimated to cost $41.1 million in 1976-77, an increase of S0.2 million on 1975-76. Under NEAT trainees receive full or part-time training allowances, living-away-from-home and book and equipment allowances, and assistance with the payment of fees and fares. Subsidies are available to employers who provide in-industry training or release trainees for training during working hours. Changes to the full-time training allowance, including the introduction of a means test on the income of the trainee and the trainee&#39;s spouse, were made by the Government in March-April 1976. These changes will restrict assistance to those in need and spread the available funds over a larger number of trainees. $40 million has been provided for NEAT in 1976-77, the same amount as was spent in 1975-76. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure for administration and other minor expenditures related to employment and industrial relations are estimated to increase by $4 million to $61.3 million in 1976-77, mainly because of wage, salary and other cost increases during 1975-76. As announced in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided to increase expenditure on productivity promotion programs to $177 000 in 1976-77. This compares with actual expenditure of $66 000 in 1975-76. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on assisted migration is estimated at $18.8 million in 1976-77, an increase of $4.1 million on 1975-76. The increase in expenditure reflects an increase of 10 000 to a total of 30 000 in the number of assisted migrants to be sought. The main components of the assisted migration program in 1976-77 are embarkation and passage costs ($11.1 million) and transitory accommodation ($6.4 million). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure in 1976-77 for administrative costs related to immigration and ethnic affairs is estimated at $21.9 million, an increase of $1.9 million on 1975-76. This reflects increased salary costs and higher levels of activity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Contributions by assisted migrants towards passage costs are to be increased from $150 to $300 for a family unit and from $150 to $200 for a single person and are estimated to total $2 million in 1976-77. </para>

Nor does it take into account the relevant activities of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The Government, in the national interest, has assumed large contingent liabilities in relation to developing countries through its support of EFIC activities in export and investment insurance.

		<para>General Revenue Funds</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">General revenue funds are utilised for purposes determined by the States. The financial assistance grants, which made up most of these funds up to and including 1975-76, were determined under a formula by which the grant to each State each year was equal to the grant paid in the previous year escalated by the percentage increase in the State&#39;s population and in average wages in the economy as a whole and by a further &#39;betterment&#39; factor. In recent years, including 1975-76, the betterment factor was 1.8 per cent. It was to have increased to 3.0 per cent in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The financial assistance grants are to be replaced by personal income tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and State Governments. Under &#39;Stage 1&#39; of these arrangements which will apply in 1976-77 and subsequent years, the States will be entitled to 33.6 per cent of Commonwealth personal income tax collections excluding the revenue effects of any special surcharges or rebates applied by the Commonwealth. Under &#39;Stage 2&#39; the States will also be able, if they wish, to legislate to impose a surcharge on personal income tax in the State additional to that imposed by the Commonwealth or to give, at cost to the State, a rebate on personal income tax payable under Commonwealth law. These arrangements for State surcharges or rebates are expected to apply from the beginning of 1977-78. (These tax sharing arrangements were settled following discussions at Premiers&#39; Conferences in February, April and June 1976.) The &#39;Stage 1&#39; arrangements include a guarantee that the States&#39; entitlements in any year will not be less than in the previous year and, in the four years 1976-77 to 1979-80, will not be less in a year than the amount which would have been yielded in that year by the financial assistance grants formula referred to above. On the basis of present estimates the States will receive $37 16.2 million under the tax sharing arrangement in 1976-77, $89 million more than their estimated entitlement under the former formula arrangements. </para>

(In 1975-76 there was in addition a $2 million reimbursement to South Australia and Tasmania in connection with sinking fund payments on debt taken over by the Commonwealth in connection with the transfer to the Commonwealth of railway systems in those States.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Assistance totalling S57.5 million paid to the States in 1974-75 represented debt charges on $1000 million of State debt.

        <para pgwide="yes">The Government is continuing a policy of restraint in its employment of staff in 1976-77 and has again set individual staff ceilings for departments and for authorities wholly or partly financed from the Budget. Mainly as a result of the staff ceilings announced by the present Government in February 1976, Commonwealth employment had been reduced by about 9300 or 2.8 per cent by the end of 1975-76. On 14 June 1976 the Prime Minister announced a further overall reduction of 1.2 per cent in staff ceilings to be achieved by 30 June 1977. This comprised a 1.6 per cent reduction in the ceilings for Public Service Act employees and a 0.9 per cent reduction in the ceilings for certain Commonwealth Government authorities. These lower ceilings have been reflected in the detailed Budget estimates. It was indicated at the time that the 1976-77 ceilings set in June were provisional and subject to further review and possible adjustment. Following further consideration in the Budget context, the Government has decided upon an objective of achieving a further reduction of 2 per cent in staff ceilings for Public Service Act employees during 1976-77, making the objective in this area a 3.7 per cent reduction in all. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This further reduction is estimated to produce a saving to the Budget of about $22 million in 1976-77; this saving had not been allocated, in detail, across departments at the time the Budget estimates were finalised. </para>

        <graphic href="100131197608175_136_47.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para>The following comments are in elaboration of these measures. </para>
      <para class="italic">
        <inline font-style="italic">Indexation of the Personal Income Tax System</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Automatic indexation of the personal income tax system, to apply with effect from 1 July 1976, was announced on 20 May 1976. Legislation to that effect has now been passed. </para>
      <para>The net tax payable by a taxpayer is determined: by calculating tax payable on his taxable income, according to the personal income tax rate schedule; and deducting from that amount any rebates to which he is entitled. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Unless provision to the contrary is made, as taxable income increases the marginal and average tax rates corresponding to the taxable income also increase, because the income is then further up the progressive rate scale. Tax payable therefore becomes a larger percentage of taxable income than before. Any rebates fixed in money terms (e.g. dependants&#39; rebates, and the general rebate) also become a smaller percentage of taxable income. For both reasons, net tax payable becomes a larger percentage of taxable income. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">If taxable income increased at <inline font-style="italic">the same rate</inline> as the price level, the <inline font-style="italic">before-tax real</inline> income would remain unchanged. But in those circumstances, for the reasons noted above, net tax payable would become a larger percentage of taxable income, and the disposable <inline font-style="italic">after-tax</inline> income would decrease in <inline font-style="italic">real</inline> terms. As the law stood previously, there was no provision for automatic adjustments to the personal income tax system to prevent such effects of inflation. Adjustments could be made on a discretionary basis by amending the income tax law. The law now provides for indexation of the basic parts of the system; adjustments will now occur automatically each year <inline font-style="italic">unless</inline> the law is changed. The effects of indexation were reflected in pay-as-you-earn deductions from salaries and wages as from 1 July 1976. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The indexation provisions of the law embrace the income brackets of the rate scale, the general rebate, the rebates for dependants (other than rebates for dependent children and students which have been abolished as part of the new family allowance arrangements), the housekeeper rebate and the sole parent rebate. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">These are to be automatically adjusted each year for increases which have occurred in the Consumer Price Index. The average level of the index in the year ending with the March quarter immediately preceding the year of income is compared with its average level in the twelve months ending with the previous March quarter. Any part of the increase that is attributable to higher indirect taxes imposed by the Commonwealth Government is netted out for the purpose of indexing the personal income tax system. The adjustment factor for 1976-77 indexation purposes is 13 per cent, 1 percentage point less than the movement in the published CPI - the difference reflects the effects of increases in indirect taxes during the period over which the movement was measured. Where these taxes are altered, to transfer command over resources between the private and the public sector, it is necessary to ensure that this objective is not nullified by other systematic changes. </para>
      <para>The indexation arrangements have the following effects: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The steps in the marginal tax rate schedule are widened in proportion to the price index (e.g. in 1975-76 the 20 cent rate applied to the first $2000 of income and the 27 cent rate to income between $2000 and $5000; in 1976-77 those rates will apply respectively to the first $2260 of income and to income between $2260 and $5650). </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="100131197608175_137_0.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">o</inline>These adjustments ensure that if a taxpayer&#39;s taxable income increases by the same percentage as the price index, the tax payable on it under the rate schedule will also increase by that same percentage (without indexation the tax payable would increase by more). That implies that tax payable remains the same in <inline font-style="italic">real</inline> terms. e The rebates which are a specified amount and are indexed also increase in amount by the same percentage as taxable income, and remain the same in <inline font-style="italic">real</inline> terms. o Both of these elements of the system also have the effect that a taxpayer on a fixed money income (which falls in real terms if prices rise) will have his tax reduced under indexation. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As already noted, the index applied relates to a <inline font-style="italic">past</inline> year. This is necessary for practical reasons. In any year there is therefore likely to be a difference between the price change experienced and that used for indexation (e.g. if prices were to rise by less than 13 per cent in 1976-77, tax indexation this year at that rate would tend to <inline font-style="italic">increase</inline> real after-tax incomes, not merely sustain them). Over a number of years the differences and their effects can be expected to average out to a substantial extent, with overcompensation for effects of price increases on the tax system occurring in some years, and under-compensation in other years. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the 1976-77 income year, the rebate allowed for the maintenance of a spouse, daughter-housekeeper or housekeeper, and the sole parent rebate, have been increased from $400 to $500 and $200 to $350, respectively. These increases were decided as a separate matter and are larger than the increases required by the strict application of the 13 per cent indexation factor. </para>

		<para>Retention Allowances of Private Companies</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a private company becomes liable to additional tax if it does not distribute a prescribed proportion of taxable income as reduced by company tax. The purpose of this provision is to maintain, as far as practicable, equity of treatment between shareholders in private companies and persons who operate unincorporated businesses as sole traders or partnerships. It is needed to prevent the kind of tax minimisation, by retention of profits in the private company&#39;s hands, that could be expected where there is a wide gap between the rate of company tax (42.5 per cent at present) and higher marginal rates of personal income tax (up to 65 per cent at present). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The retention allowance in respect of trading profits is to be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent (the allowance in respect of property income remaining at 10 per cent), thus placing more funds at the direct disposal of private companies for purposes of expansion and development. </para>

As indicated in Statement No. 2, a modest recovery is forecast in consumption expenditure during 1976-77. This recovery is expected to be reflected in increased consumption of goods subject to excise.

The main reasons for the still relatively high level of refunds in 1976-77 are the over-deduction of tax instalments paid prior to the introduction of the revised schedule on 1 January 1976; the tendency for many taxpayers to refrain from claiming dependants in declaration forms; and the high incidence of unemployment and part-time employment in 1975-76, with resultant over-deduction of tax on a full-year basis.

        <para pgwide="yes">This and other smaller increases are expected to be largely offset by an estimated decline of $14.7 million in stevedoring industry charges.

		  <title>STATEMENT No. 5- BUDGET RESULT, 1975-76</title>
          <page.no>149</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the aggregate, outlays in 1975-76 turned out to be very close to the original Budget estimate but receipts were significantly lower - and the deficit significantly higher - than had been estimated. </para>
      <para>The outcome is summarised in the table below: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It became apparent soon after the Budget was brought down that the deficit for the year would be considerably greater than that budgeted for. The most important contributing factor here was the likelihood that the increase in average weekly earnings would fall well short of the 22 per cent assumed for purposes of estimating pay as you earn income tax receipts, thereby substantially reducing receipts from this source. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On the outlays side too, though to a lesser extent, there were indications that expenditures on some activities would exceed the Budget estimates and increase the likely deficit. In particular, expenditure on unemployment benefits was running at much higher levels than had been allowed for in the estimates. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Against this background the outlook by mid-year was for an overall deficit of $4500 million or higher. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The incoming Government took immediate steps to restrain the growth in outlays and in the prospective deficit. A general freeze on new expenditure proposals was announced in December, together with stringent new staff ceilings on employment and reductions in the budgetary allocations for overtime and travel expenses. These measures were estimated to save $60 million directly over the remainder of 1975-76. Following an urgent review of government spending programs further decisions were announced on 3 February which were estimated to involve direct savings on outlays amounting to about $300 million in 1975-76. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Through these and other measures, total outlays in 1975-76 were held to a level lower than that budgeted for, the first time since 1968-69 that outlays have been contained within the original Budget estimate. This result was achieved despite prepayments in June of $216 million to the States for hospital operating costs which would not otherwise have been paid until 1976-77. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the event, receipts of company and other individuals (non-PAYE) income tax turned out to be higher than had been estimated and partly offset the large shortfall in PAYE receipts. The increased collections of company and non-PAYE income taxes reflected both improved collection procedures and higher 1974-75 incomes (which were subject to tax in 1975-76) than had been assumed at the time of the Budget. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The actual deficit of $3585 million was $786 million more than the Budget estimate. </para>
	  <para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although outlays in 1975-76 were only slightly different from the Budget estimate in the aggregate, there were substantial differences in respect of many categories of expenditure. The outcomes for major categories are compared with the Budget estimates in the following table: </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="100131197608175_149_61.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Comments on the main variations from the Budget estimates follow. <inline font-style="italic">Defence</inline></para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Defence outlays in 1975-76 were $53 million more than the Budget estimate. Manpower costs exceeded the Budget estimate by $63 million, reflecting both increases in rates of pay and higher than expected payments under the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits scheme. The latter outcome stemmed primarily from greater commutation requirements than had been estimated and from a post-Budget increase in rates of pensions. Largely because of cost increases during 1975-76, expenditure on administrative expenses exceeded the Budget estimate by $12 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Partly offsetting these increases, expenditure on defence facilities was $10 million less than the Budget estimate and there was an increase of $14 million in Trust Account balances during the year. </para>
	  <para>Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Actual outlays on education were S3 million higher than the 1975-76 Budget estimate. Payments under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme were $14 million more than the Budget provision, reflecting a greater number of students qualifying for benefit, and higher average benefit payments, than allowed for in the Budget estimate. On the other hand, the allowance for cost escalation of education grants included in the 1975-76 Budget estimates exceeded actual cost increases. </para>
		<para>Health</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for health in 1975-76 were $176 million greater than the Budget estimate. There was an increase of $126 million in payments for hospital running costs. This increase, however, reflected accelerated payments of $216 million to the States in 1975-76 for hospital operating costs which would normally have been paid in 1976-77. Excluding those accelerated payments, hospital payments were $90 million less than the Budget estimate, largely because some States entered the hospital side of Medibank later than expected. Claims in respect of medical services rendered before the introduction of Medibank on 1 July 1975 exceeded the Budget estimate by $21 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments of hospital benefits were $12 million more than estimated, mainly because rates of subsidised health benefit payments for low income groups were higher than expected. Wage and salary increases in repatriation institutions were largely responsible for the cost of hospital services to ex-servicemen and women exceeding the Budget estimate by $8 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Deficit financing of nursing homes operated by eligible organisations exceeded the Budget provision by $21 million, reflecting in the main an increased number of approved beds and a larger than expected carryover of operating deficits from 1974-75. Other nursing home benefits were $15 million lower than estimated, reflecting the Government&#39;s restraint on new commitments and increased recourse by nursing homes to the deficit financing arrangements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government&#39;s decision to refrain from entering into new expenditure commitments in certain areas was largely responsible also for expenditure on community health facilities falling short of the Budget estimate by $11 million. </para>
		<para>Social Security and Welfare</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for social security and welfare exceeded the Budget estimate by $240 million. Unemployment and sickness benefits accounted for $177 million of this increase reflecting in the main a higher than estimated average number of benefit recipients during the year. Again largely because of higher numbers of beneficiaries, payments of other pensions and benefits were $56 million more than the Budget estimate. Payments under the Regional Employment Development Scheme were $12 million below the Budget estimate. </para>
		<para>Housing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for housing were $70 million less than the Budget estimate. Repayments by banks of advances made to them in 1974-75 for housing lending exceeded the Budget estimate of $38 million as banks repaid some advances earlier than was required. The Government&#39;s decision in February to confine the Housing Corporation&#39;s activities to the provision of Defence Service Homes loans produced a saving of $45 million on the Budget estimate. Expenditure on housing in the Territories exceeded the Budget estimate by $22 million, mainly because the Darwin Reconstruction Commission made better progress than had been envisaged. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for activities under this heading fell short of the estimate by $40 million. In line with the Government&#39;s decision to effect expenditure savings in these areas there were shortfalls in respect of growth centres ($12 million), Land Commissions ($10 million) and the Area Improvement Program ($3 million). For similar reasons, expenditure on the development of Aboriginal amenities was $5 million lower than estimated. A shortfall of $9 million in outlays on the Woolloomooloo development project resulted largely from delays in the acquisition of land for the project. On the other hand, expenditure on sewerage programs in the Australian Capital Territory was $8 million higher than the Budget estimate. </para>
		<para>Culture and Recreation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on cultural and recreational activities was $9 million less than the Budget estimate. The largest shortfall occurred in respect of the National Gallery ($4 million), following the Government&#39;s decisions in February to defer acquisition of some overseas art works and to slow construction of the new National Gallery building. </para>
		<para>Transport and Communication</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for transport and communication exceeded the Budget estimate by $48 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There were increases compared with the Budget estimates in net advances to Qantas ($22 million) and to the Australian Shipping Commission ($25 million) for the purchase of aircraft and ships respectively. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The contribution of air navigation charges .towards the cost of civil aviation facilities fell short of the Budget estimate by $23 million because charges were increased later and by lesser amounts than had been envisaged at Budget time. Reflecting the Government&#39;s decisions in February to achieve expenditure savings, advances from the Budget to the Australian Postal Commission and Australian Telecommunications Commission were each $1 1 million less than originally estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to the States for Urban Public Transport Improvement programs were $9 million less than the Budget estimate. </para>
		<para>Industry Assistance and Development</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for industry assistance and development were $121 million less than estimated. This shortfall stemmed from two main sources. First, because of a sustained improvement in wool prices, the Australian Wool Corporation made net repayments of $31 million, rather than borrowing $80 million as had been envisaged at Budget time. Secondly, the Budget included $75 million for additional capital and advances to the Australian Industry Development Corporation; in the event no payment was made. Loans to beef producers also fell short of the Budget provision by $8 million and outlays on the new export development grants scheme were $10 million less than estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There were, however, some significant upward variations. The 1975-76 growers&#39; contribution of $30 million to the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Scheme, expected in June, was not received until July. The re-introduction of the superphosphate bounty by the incoming Government involved expenditure of $20 million which had not been provided for in the Budget and the continuation of the Nitrogenous Fertilizer Subsidy beyond 31 December 1975 added a further $7 million. Assistance to the shipbuilding industry exceeded the Budget prov is on by $12 million while residual payments under the now terminated export incentive grants scheme were $29 million higher. </para>
		<para>Labour and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for labour and employment activities exceeded the Budget estimate by $6 million. Payments to the Stevedoring Industry Authority were $14 million greater than the Budget provision following a post-Budget decision of the previous Government to increase the rate of the Stevedoring Industry Charge, the proceeds of which are passed back to the industry. This increase was partly offset by a shortfall of $12 million in payments under the NEAT System as a consequence of the Government&#39;s action to tighten eligibility conditions for assistance under the. System. </para>
		<para>Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total payments under this heading fell short of the Budget estimate by S38 million. Within this total there was a shortfall of $29 million in overseas aid payments reflecting both the Government&#39;s decision in February to effect reductions and deferments in aid expenditure of $21 million and expenditure slippages on projects and training along with a slower than expected draw-down of a loan to Fiji. Calls for payments to the Asian Development Bank were also less than expected. Partly offsetting these shortfalls, assistance to Papua New Guinea exceeded the Budget allocation by $3 million due to higher than expected termination and retirement benefit payments to expatriate officers of former Papua New Guinea Administrations and the Australian Staffing Assistance Group. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Administrative expenses under this heading were $8 million less than estimated, reflecting mainly a shortfall of $6 million in expenditure on the overseas construction program which resulted from restraints imposed on certain new projects and unexpected expenditure slippages. </para>
		<para>Administrative Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on administrative services were affected by the imposition of the new staff ceilings, cut-hacks in overtime and travel, and by measures to rationalise the use of commissions, boards of inquiry, other advisory bodies and consultants. These and other economy measures more than offset the costs of wage and salary increases during the year and total outlays turned out to be $20 million lower than the Budget estimate. </para>
        <para class="italic" pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays in this category fell short of the Budget estimate by $97 million, There was a shortfall of $112 million in financial assistance grants to the States. The Budget estimate was based on, inter alia, an assumed increase of 21 per cent in average wages in the year to March 1976; in the event the increase was 17 per cent. The New South Wales Government exercised its option to delay repayment of special advances of $6.5 million. Compensation payments to victims of the Darwin Cyclone disaster fell short of the Budget provision by $15 million as the number and value of claims turned out to be less than expected. On the other hand, payments to the States for natural disaster relief exceeded the Budget estimate by $22 million following severe damage caused by floods and cyclones affecting all mainland States except South Australia. </para>

      </para>
      <para>Customs Duty - Imports</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of customs duty on imports were $74 million higher than estimated, mainly because the value of imports turned out to be higher than had been assumed at Budget time. </para>
		<para>Customs Duty - Coal Exports</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Revenue from coal export levies was $8 million less than estimated. After the Budget was introduced the previous Government decided to exempt exports of steaming coal from the duty (at a cost of $4 million to revenue); in addition, the overall volume of exports was slightly lower than was estimated at Budget time. </para>
		<para>Excise Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Excise collections were $76 million less than the Budget estimate. Clearances of most major dutiable goods, particularly beer and cigarettes, were lower than had been estimated at Budget time. The levy on crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">LPG introduced in the 1975-76 Budget raised S257 million, compared with the Budget estimate of S280 million. </para>
		<para>Sales Tax</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Revenue from., sales tax was S17 million lower than estimated; this was mainly because prices of some taxable goods rose less rapidly than was assumed at Budget time. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax on Individuals - Pay-as-you-earn</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Gross collections of PAYE instalment deductions were $1346 million less than the Budget estimate. It was this very large shortfall which was primarily responsible for the actual deficit exceeding the Budget estimate by a wide margin. The Budget estimate of gross PAYE collections was based on assumed increases of 22 per cent in average weekly earnings in 1975-76 and 2 per cent in average employment (both on a male unit basis). In the event, earnings increased by about 14 per cent and there was little change in employment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Refunds of PAYE income tax collections were $318 million higher than estimated. The effect on refunds in 1975-76 of periods of unemployment and part-time employment for many taxpayers in 1974-75 - which effectively results in over-deduction of tax - was greater than estimated. In addition, the estimate did not allow sufficiently for the net over-deduction of instalments that resulted from the operation during 1974-75 of three different schedules of instalments, one of which compressed a full-year adjustment into a 6 month period. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax on Other Individuals</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections on assessment of income tax on individuals were $543 million greater than the Budget estimate. This reflected improved collection procedures instituted by the Taxation Office and higher than assumed incomes earned in 1974-75 (subject to tax in 1975-76) by non-farm unincorporated enterprises. </para>
		<para>Income Tax - Companies</para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Company income tax collections also were $363 million more than the Budget estimate, reflecting a larger than estimated increase in company incomes in 1974-75 (assessed to tax in 1975-76). </para>
		<para>Other Taxes, Fees and Fines</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other taxes, fees and fines exceeded the Budget estimate by $24 million. Receipts from the Stevedoring Industry Charge were $17 million greater than the estimate following an increase in the rate after the Budget was brought down; the proceeds from this charge are paid to the Stevedoring Industry Authority. </para>
		<para>Interest, Rent and Dividends</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from interest, rent and dividends were $76 million less than the Budget estimate. The main change was in respect of interest received from the States, reflecting the formal take-over by the Commonwealth of $1 000 million of State debt on which the interest liability amounted to $55 million. </para>

	  <para>Net Proceeds of Loan Raisings Overseas</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Three loans totalling $93 million were raised in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland&#39; in 1975-76. A further public loan of $162 million (SUS200 million) was raised in New York, of which $26 million was advanced to Qantas and $23 million to the Australian Shipping Commission. Other loan raisings on behalf of Qantas amounted to $23 million. Repayments of previous drawings for Qantas and the Australian National Airlines Commission amounted to $25 million. Other securities to the value of $89 million were repurchased or redeemed in New York, London, Germany and Canada. Repayments of $3 million were made on borrowings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Savings Bond introduced in January was designed especially for household savers and non-professional investors. This new bond proved to be highly attractive and made a significant contribution to financing the deficit. In the first five months after its issue, the Australian Savings Bond raised $1202 million, and there have been $22 million in redemptions. Net redemptions of the now superseded Special Bonds amounted to $57 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Four Government public cash and conversion loans in August, October, January/ February and April resulted in loan raisings of $1699 million. Total redemptions and repurchases amounted to $194 million. States Domestic Loan Raisings were $6 million, bringing net proceeds of loans raised in Australia in 1975-76 to $1511 million. </para>

		<para>Other Financing Transactions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The unusually large figure recorded under this heading included $720 million from security transactions between the Commonwealth Trust Fund and the Reserve Bank which supplemented the Bank&#39;s trading portfolio during the year. The trans- actions were designed to enable the Bank to carry out effectively its open market operations. These security transactions with the Bank were partly offset by cancellations of Treasury Bonds amounting to $95 million by the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other major transactions in this category included net payments of $119 million by the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, representing the employer contributions to their superannuation schemes, and $19 million in proceeds from coinage and bullion transactions. </para>
		<para>Residual Financing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To complete the financing of the deficit in 1975-76, $1350 million was borrowed from the Reserve Bank and Government cash balances were run down by $296 million. Of the amount borrowed from the Reserve Bank $850 million was covered by the issue of Treasury Bills and $500 million by the issue of new marketable securities. This is the first occasion since 1969-70 that borrowings in the form of Treasury Bills have remained outstanding at the end of a financial year. The issuing of new marketable securities to the Reserve Bank was supplementary to the transactions with the Bank recorded under Other Financing Transactions and will provide support to the market operations of the Bank during the seasonal upswing in liquidity. </para>

		  <title>STATEMENT No. 6- BUDGET TRANSACTIONS SINCE 1966-67</title>
          <page.no>158</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">This Statement presents Budget transactions since 1966-67 classified according to the two complementary methods of classification adopted throughout the Budget Speech and Statements. The <inline font-style="italic">functional classification,</inline> which was introduced in the 1973-74 Budget, categorises Budget outlays according to their primary objectives or purposes. This classification facilitates decision making on the nature, extent and relative priorities of Government activities. The <inline font-style="italic">national accounting classification</inline> details Budget outlays by economic type and facilitates comparisons of Budget aggregates with other national accounts data. This classification is essential when it comes to assessing the overall economic impact of the Budget. As the functional classification generally adopts national accounting conventions for the definition of Budget outlays and receipts, the data on outlays by function are in line with those used in the analysis of the economic impact of the Budget. This avoids the problems encountered prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually different classifications were used. </para>
	  <para>Functional Classification</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Functionally classified Budget data for the period 1966-67 to 1975-76, together with 1976-77 estimates, are presented in the tables at the end of this Statement. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In bringing together categories of outlays with similar objectives or purposes, the functional classification focuses attention on the nature of Government activities and the share of resources devoted to particular objectives. It also provides a logical framework within which programs can be developed to facilitate an assessment of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting stated objectives. Further information on the basis underlying the functional classification is given in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification is essentially a re-classification of appropriation data, supplemented with sub-costings of appropriation items of substantial magnitude that cover several functions. However, Table 2 provides less detail than do the tables in Statement No. 3, partly for ease of presentation and partly because some of the sub-costings necessary to eliminate the effects of all changes in accounting procedures and administrative arrangements are not available. To the extent possible, the definitions and concepts adopted for the historical series are the same as those used in Statement No. 3. <inline font-weight="bold">Major discontinuities</inline> are indicated where appropriate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Comparisons of trends over the period covered in the tables are affected by certain major developments such as the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, &#39;offsets&#39; to grants to the States, changes in the operation of certain retirement benefit schemes and the transfer of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways. These factors are mentioned in the Notes on Tables. </para>
		<para>Budget Sector Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the nine year period from 1966-67 to 1975-76, total outlays of the Commonwealth Government Budget Sector increased at an average annual rate of 15.5 per cent; details for each functional category are shown in the following table: </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The data in the tables are in current prices and reflect price increases as well as real increases in resources devoted to particular functional activities. Comparisons within and among different categories of outlays are also affected by differential rates, of price increase. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Average annual rates of increase can mask movements <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> the period covered. The chart below shows the proportion of total outlays within the major functions in each of the past ten years. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In 1974-75 and 1975-76 Budget outlays increased much faster than total output and represented a substantially increased share of GDP: </para>
		<para>Budget Sector Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of Commonwealth Government Budget Sector receipts for the period 1966-67 to 1975-76, together with 1976-77 estimates, are presented in Table 4. Data on the composition and rate of growth of Budget receipts over the period 1966-67 to 1975-76 are shown in the following table: </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The chart below gives an indication of the relative importance of the various categories of receipts in total Budget sector receipts over the ten years from 1966-67. </para>

          <graphic href="100131197608175_161_68.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">By far the most important single category of receipts is income tax on individuals, which increased from 37.8 per cent of total receipts in 1966-67 to 50.4 per cent in 1975-76. This increase stems largely from the effects of the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in personal incomes particularly wage and salary incomes. This growth occurred despite adjustments to the rate scale and other elements of the personal income tax system that were made in 1970-71, . 1972-73, 1974-75 and 1975-76 with a view to reducing rates of tax for most taxpayers. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The major reason for the contracting share of &#39;Other General Taxation&#39; in the total is that pay-roll tax revenue after 1971-72 relates to collections in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory only, following the transfer of this tax to the States in September 1971. The decision, announced in the 1974-75 Budget Speech, to abolish broadcast listeners and television viewers licences from 18 September 1974 has also contributed to this contraction in recent years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget receipts have represented a steadily increasing proportion of GDP in recent years. </para>

        </para>
		<para>The Budget Deficit</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The overall Budget deficit in each of the years 1966-67 to 1975-76 is shown in Table 1. There is a brief discussion of the Budget deficit in the next section. </para>
		<para>National. Accounts Classification</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The national accounts for the economy as a whole provide a systematic summary of the transactions that take place within the economy, especially those relating to the production and use of goods and services, and to transfers of income or capital between sectors of the economy. The national accounts classify transactions into various categories and, by outlining the relationships between the categories, enable analysis of the processes by which production and expenditure are linked. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Traditional methods of presenting estimates of public sector receipts and expenditure grew out of the requirement for maintaining parliamentary control over government spending. Estimates presented in a form suitable for this purpose do not necessarily lend themselves to an assessment of the economic impact of government financial activity. By presenting Budget data on a basis which is conceptually consistent with, and more easily related to, the national accounts for the economy as a whole, the national accounting presentation of Budget transactions by economic type clarifies the nature of transactions between the public sector and the rest of the economy. The classification also provides a consistent framework within which the aggregation of Commonwealth and State and local authority outlays and receipts is facilitated, to produce consolidated figures for the public sector as a whole. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is no single measure of the economic importance of government transactions. In terms of national accounting categories, the most direct influence that Budget outlays have on demand is by means of expenditure on final goods and services, i.e., the resources used in the provision of public goods such as defence, education, health and community amenities. Transfers and advances from the Budget to other sectors are also important, but the impact on economic activity of these outlays depends on the spending propensities of the recipients of the transfers and advances. For Budget receipts, it is also true that any assessment of their effect on the economy has to take into account the varying impact of different taxes and other receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A further important distinction is between domestic and overseas Budget transactions; payments made overseas do not add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services, while receipts from overseas resources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. The total economic impact of the Budget is an amalgam of all these influences. In a shorthand way the Budget deficit or surplus (and the domestic deficit or surplus) is usually taken as a summary measure of the Budget impact; like all summary measures, however, it is subject to a number of important qualifications. </para>
		<para>Commonwealth Government Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The contribution of the Commonwealth Government and its authorities to recent growth in the size of the public sector has been dominated by the transactions of the Budget sector. In 197S-76, for example, the Budget&#39;s direct call on resources, in the form of final expenditure on goods and services, represented over 80 per cent of final expenditure by the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole. Advances from the Budget to Commonwealth authorities also finance a significant part of final expenditures on goods and services recorded in the non-Budget sector. Direct expenditure on goods and services, however, represents only a moderate and, in recent years declining, proportion of total Budget outlays. The bulk of the Commonwealth&#39;s budgetary transactions comprise transfer payments and advances to other sectors of the economy, including other government sectors. In 1975-76 transfer payments and net advances accounted for 79 per cent of total Budget outlays, of which almost half represented grants and net advances to State Governments. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 3 attached to this Statement shows Budget outlays since 1966-67 on a national accounts basis. On this basis, transfers between different parts of the accounts of the Commonwealth Budget sector are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Government Budget sector and the rest of the economy, including other levels of government, and overseas. The national accounts figures therefore show government transactions classified into economically orientated categories comparable with those presented in the Budget Paper <inline font-style="italic">National Income and Expenditure</inline> 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the past decade there has been a tendency for Commonwealth Budget outlays to grow somewhat faster than expenditures in the economy as a whole. As indicated in the table on page 133 this outcome for the decade as a whole is heavily influenced by the experience of the last two years, 1974-75 and 1975-76. The following table compares the average annual rates of growth of the main components of Budget outlays with the average annual rate of growth in gross national expenditure for the period since 1966-67. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="100131197608175_163_70.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking the period as a whole, the Budget&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline> call on resources, as measured by final expenditure on goods and services, reached a peak of 7.2 per cent of gross national expenditure in 1967-68; it declined thereafter to 5.9 per cent in 1973-74 but in the last two years has again risen to be 6.7 per cent of GNE .in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In assessing the total economic impact of the Budget on final demand for goods and services it is not sufficient, however, to look only at its direct call on goods and services. This is because, as noted previously, much the larger proportion of Budget outlays is in the form of transfer payments, such as payments of pensions, subsidies, interest and grants, and the call on resources from such payments depends on the uses to which the recipients put the funds. Other Budget outlays take the form of advances (e.g.,, to the States) and the economic impact of these is different again. Consequently, it is necessary to take account of variations in the composition of total outlays in analysing the Budget&#39;s impact. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on goods and services declined as a proportion of total Budget outlays from a peak of 29.1 per cent in 1968-69 (associated with the strong growth in defence spending in the preceding years) to 21.1 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the other hand, cash benefits to persons have increased from 20.6 per cent in 1967-68 to 27.9 per cent in 1975-76. The high proportion in 1975-76 reflected, inter alia, the introduction of Medibank and high average levels of unemployment during the year. Although it is not possible to specify precisely the final use of funds transferred from the Budget in this way, many of the recipients of these benefits would have high marginal propensities to spend so that this category of outlays is likely to have a fairly immediate impact on final demand for consumption goods. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A major proportion of Commonwealth Government outlays comprises payments to the States and local government authorities. Because of changes from time to time in the methods of making such payments, it is more useful to look at &#39;Grants to or for the States and local government authorities&#39; and &#39;Net Advances to the States&#39; as one category. Considered as a whole, payments to the States have normally accounted for about one-third of Commonwealth Budget outlays. Over the last ten years, the proportion has ranged between 31.4 per cent in 1968-69 and 38.7 per cent in 1975-76. (The high 1975-76 figure reflects in part the prepayments totalling almost $216 million which were made to the States in June in respect of hospital operating costs which in the normal course of events would not have been made until 1976-77.) These outlays finance, inter alia, the States&#39; health and education services and their works and housing programs. As with cash benefits, it is not practicable to trace through precisely the final use of all these funds from the Budget. Moreover, the timing of outlays by the States can differ from the timing of payments to them of funds to finance those outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Advances other than to the States are distributed chiefly within the Commonwealth Government sector itself in the form of advances to government instrumentalities operating outside the Budget. These include the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, the Australian National Airlines Commission, Qantas Airways Limited, the Australian Shipping Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Advances to such authorities in 1975-76 amounted to $653 million or 3.0 per cent of Budget outlays; this represents a considerable fall from the 1974-75 level of 6.1 per cent when there were large advances to the Australian Wool Corporation. Again, it is generally not practicable to trace through the precise utilisation of the funds advanced to these instrumentalities from the Budget. It is possible though to offset transfers between the Budget and non-Budget sectors of the Commonwealth Government and to consolidate outlays, other than intersect or transfers, to form a statement of the outlays and receipts of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole. The method of consolidation used is outlined in a Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin dated September 1974. Table 5 attached to this Statement sets out national accounts estimates of the main categories of receipts and outlays of the Commonwealth sector as a whole for the period since 1966-67. Total outlays by the non-Budget sector amounted to $1 380 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There are some significant differences between the relative composition of outlays of the Commonwealth sector as a whole and that of the Budget sector alone. The following table details the respective compositions of outlays for 1975-76: </para>
        <para class="block">

          <inline font-style="italic">Total Public Sector Direct Expenditure on Goods and Services</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking into account State Governments and local authorities, the relative size of total public sector direct expenditure on goods and services remained fairly steady around 22 per cent until 1974-75 when there was a sharp increase to almost 25 per cent of GNE. The following table shows the trend in the public sector&#39;s share of expenditure on goods and services over the period since 1966-67: </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The sharp rise in the share of resources going to the public sector in 1974-75 and 1975-76 reflected a combination of increased demands by governments on the resources of the economy, and the downturn in private sector activity. </para>
		<para>Budget Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total budget receipts in national accounts terms have increased at an annual average rate of 14.8 per cent over the period from 1966-67, rising from 22.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1966-67 to 26.2 per cent in 1975-76. These receipts comprise taxes of various types together with a number of other charges, and interest, rent and dividends. As with outlays, different types of receipts have different effects on the economy. Taxes on incomes, for example, influence private demand for goods and services through their effect on the level of disposable incomes; sales taxes, on the other hand, affect private demand through the prices of goods. Consequently, the &#39;mix&#39; of Budget revenues, as well as their total size, is a relevant consideration in any assessment of the overall impact of the Budget on the economy. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Government has incurred overall deficits on its budgetary transactions in each of the years 1966-67 to 1975-76 <inline font-style="italic">(see</inline> Table 1). Estimates of the <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> budget result are available only for the years since 1968-69.

This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth pay-roll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transfer arrangements had the effect of reducing the growth of outlays and receipts below the rate that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the Tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in special purpose payments to the States are recorded under the appropriate functional headings, while &#39;offsetting adjustments&#39; to General Revenue Assistance Grants to the States are taken into account under the functional heading Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief. The assumption in 1973-74 of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education by the Commonwealth Government contributed to an increase in outlays classified to Education but also involved a compensating decrease in general purpose funds provided to the States. This means that the rate of increase in Commonwealth Government resources devoted to education, as shown in the function Education, is somewhat overstated. A similar effect occurs in 1974-75, which was the first full year of the new tertiary education arrangements; these arrangements applied only to the second half of 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in the operation of the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowance Schemes affect the outlays for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the relevant functions and under the receipts headings Other Taxes, Fees and Fines - Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. The implementation of the new Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme with effect from 1 July 1976 gives rise to similar effects. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Notes on Tables 1 and 2: Budget Sector Outlays Classified by Function </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations would be met, in the same way as other expenditures, by the States out of their approved Loan Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling $160 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Tables 1 and 2 show these amounts classified to &#39;Payments to the States, etc.&#39; instead of &#39;Housing&#39;. However, for the purposes of the calculation of the trend rates of growth and the chart of proportions of total outlays, these amounts have been included in the function &#39;Housing&#39;. </para>

		  <title>APPENDIX TO THE BUDGET STATEMENTS - THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF BUDGET OUTLAYS</title>
          <page.no>183</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the functional classification is to bring together outlays with like objectives or purposes. In this way the classification aims to present information on the nature of government activities, on the share of resources devoted to particular objectives and to facilitate assessment of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Compared with the classification used in Budget Statements prior to 1973-74, the functional classification has the added advantage of being based on national accounting conventions. There is thus a consistent conceptual basis underlying both the economic classification and the functional classification. This removes a considerable source of confusion which existed in Budget documents prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually different classifications were used - the so-called &#39;conventional&#39; classification and the national accounting classification. </para>
      <para class="block">Basis of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The conventions and principles used in the functional classification are essentially those set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts,</inline> United Nations, New York 1968. That classification is a widely accepted international standard for the classification of public expenditure by function. It is also used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a basis for the development of internationally comparable statistics on the public sector. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Bureau of Statistics has concurrently adopted these conventions and principles in the documents it publishes on public authority finance. While the major functional headings adopted for Budget purposes are conceptually consistent with those used by the Statistician in his publications, it should be noted that the figures published by the Bureau for Commonwealth Government outlays cover both Budget outlays and outlays by Commonwealth Government authorities which operate outside the Budget sector. They therefore differ somewhat from the figures shown for the Budget sector in the Budget Statements. Information on the transactions of authorities operating outside the Budget sector is shown in the <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities</inline> which is published with the Budget documents. Two further differences should be noted. First, outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements &#39;net&#39; of the relevant primary industry levies and charges; these outlays are shown on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, for the years prior to 1 974-75, part of the expenditure incurred by some Commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities operating in Papua New Guinea is classified by the Statistician as foreign aid. These outlays, however, are shown under the same functional heading in the Budget Statements as similar outlays made within Australia. Supplementary information on the functional allocation of these outlays is available in the Bureau&#39;s publication <inline font-style="italic">Public Authority Finance - Federal Authorities.</inline></para>
      <para class="block">The Structure of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The major functional headings are shown in the summary table in Statement No. 3. Brief descriptions of the contents of each function are given below. These descriptions are intended to convey the scope of the outlays included under each heading rather than to be a detailed listing of the contents of each category. Further detail on each function is provided in the body of Statement No. 3. Historical data for the period 1966-67 to 1975-76 are given in Statement No. 6. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">From an examination of the classification structure set out in the Budget Statements it will be evident that the functional classification is relatively aggregative in nature. On the whole it has not been possible, for example, to dissect the administrative outlays of departments and to allocate them over the particular sub-categories shown under each functional heading. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Outlays under each functional heading in the classification have been grouped together into readily identifiable expenditure blocks. These expenditure blocks do not, as a rule, purport to represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions or programs; rather, they are meant as recognisable and meaningful groupings which lend themselves to discussion and analysis. Nevertheless, the main outlay blocks are decidedly more purpose-oriented than was the case with the categories of expenditure identified under the conventional classification used prior to 1973-74. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Given the need to produce a continuing and up-to-date record of actual monthly outlays and receipts which is consistent with the overall estimates embodied in the Budget Speech and documents, it has been necessary to work largely within existing central accounting records. These records are, at present, built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than detailed costing documents. The figures presented, therefore, have been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented where necessary by a limited number of sub-costings of substantial appropriation items which cover several functions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It should be noted also that the functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. Furthermore, some outlay and receipt figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may, therefore, be classified under more than one functional heading and it will not always be possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Statements. The introduction of the functional classification, however, does not alter the structure of the appropriations or the summaries presented with the Appropriation Bills, such as the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure.</inline></para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the broad purposes for which government outlays are undertaken, it is important to note that such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions. Military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme, however, requires that an outlay be classified to the function which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example above, the primary function is considered to be defence; this is in line with United Nations recommendations. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is not possible, in any single classification system, to focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to the Government or the public. Supplementary information on particular aspects of expenditure is therefore provided in other documents; for example, details of wage and salary estimates are shown in the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure</inline> and a separate Budget Paper is provided on <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities.</inline> Other supplementary Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech this year deal with the Civil Works Program and Australia&#39;s Overseas Development Assistance. </para>
	  <para>The Implications of Adopting National Accounting Conventions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As indicated earlier in this Appendix, the use of definitions of Budget outlays and receipts based on national accounting conventions places Budget data on a basis which, in the main, is conceptually consistent with national accounting information published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and can be related to that information. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principles underlying the national accounting presentation of Budget data are set out in the Appendix to the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities,</inline> September 1974. Concurrent with the introduction of the functional classification in 1973-74, some changes were made to the previous national accounting definitions of outlays, receipts, the deficit, and their components used in the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para class="block">The more significant of these changes were: </para>

            <para>net advances to the Australian Wheat Board are now treated as outlay items, rather than financing transactions as in the past. This brings the classification of these short-term advances into line with that accorded to other advances from the budget: </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(6)">
                <para>purchases of land and existing buildings (including inter-departmental transfers for which a financial adjustment is made) are now treated as outlays rather than offsets to the proceeds from the sale of these assets under a receipts heading. This change permits gross outlays on these assets to be shown under the appropriate functional headings. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other conceptual changes in line with the principles set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts</inline> were also introduced. These changes relate mainly to the treatment of rents and business enterprise transactions and are indicated in the September 1974 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin. Overall, they do not have a very significant effect on the figures shown for total receipts and total outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The adoption of national accounting conventions implies that the receipts and outlay figures shown in the Statements attached to the Budget Speech relate, for the most part, to the net transactions of the budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important characteristics of the national accounting treatment shown in the Statements are: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>the transactions of various Funds forming the Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, payments to Trust Accounts are not shown as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure from Trust Accounts is included. The aim is essentially to record the transactions between the Budget sector and the rest of the economy. Allowance is made, however, for adjustments between functions arising from the transfer of existing assets where financial adjustments for these transfers are recorded; </para>

                <para>receipts derived from activities which are essentially of a governmental nature, involving regulation and compulsory payment, are normally treated as revenue items. As mentioned earlier, however, the various primary industry levies and charges which are collected by the Government and applied more or less directly for the purposes of commodity stabilisation, research and promotional activities are offset against the relevant outlays. Other recoveries and. repayments are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net outlay figures. For example, repayments of principal on advances to other authorities are offset against the corresponding advances under the same outlay heading. Bringing together the relevant outlays and recoveries or repayments makes it possible to see more readily the extent of financial resources which are directed through the Budget to a particular activity. Other taxes, compulsory charges, licence fees and the like which are more of a general revenue nature continue to be treated as receipts items under the heading &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines&#39;; </para>

          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>the operating revenues of activities which are carried out as business-type enterprises are shown net of operating expenses as receipts items and do not appear in the outlay tables.

          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important of these are interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading &#39;Public Debt Interest&#39;, while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">Changes in the Functional Classification </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because the organisation for and coverage of government activity is not static, changes need to be made to the functional classification headings and their contents from time to time. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principal changes made to the contents of the functional headings this year are indicated below: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Railways. In 1975-76 the Australian National Railways (ANR) replaced the Commonwealth Railways. Prior to that, Commonwealth Railways had been treated as a departmental enterprise within the Budget sector; its capital payments were shown as outlays under the heading &#39;Transport&#39; while operating receipts were offset against operating expenditure under the receipts heading &#39;Net Receipts from Government Enterprise Transactions&#39;. Under the new arrangements, ANR is treated as an enterprise outside the Budget sector with advances for capital purposes and an operating subsidy being shown as outlays. In the 1975-76 Budget Statements there was a break in the series at 1975-76 but it was noted that, if possible, data for earlier years would be adjusted to a comparable basis. This has now been done. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>Superannuation. The implementation from 1 July 1976 of the new Commonwealth Superannuation scheme is reflected directly in two items in the functional classification. First, outlays under the heading &#39;Net Superannuation Payments&#39; (NSP) have risen because under the new legislation the Government has assumed responsibility for the payment of the full pension, whereas under the previous arrangement the cost of the pension was shared proportionately between the Government and the Superannuation Fund. Secondly, there has been an increase in the receipts item &#39;Unfunded Employee Retirement Benefits Contributions&#39;. Under the new legislation, at the time of retirement, an officer&#39;s accumulated contributions (plus interest) are paid from the Superannuation Fund into CRF. The officer may then take an additional contributor financed pension (which is included under the outlays item NSP) or may elect to take a lump sum. To avoid distorting the outlays and receipts figures, payments of lump sums are netted off from the receipt item. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">In addition, payments will be made from the Superannuation Fund to CRF in respect of the Fund&#39;s liability for existing pensioners at 30 June 1976. The precise size and timing of these payments has still to be determined. Pending finalization of this matter and in view of the capital nature of this transaction (in the national accounting sense), the estimated payment in 1976-77 has been classified to &#39;Other Financing Transactions&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a consequence of changed administrative arrangements and problems of data availability, it has again been necessary to make some changes in the composition or presentation of the various expenditure blocks. Where appropriate these have been footnoted in the tables. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because the functional classification is derived largely from existing appropriation accounting data, adjustments to the functional classification are constrained by availability of suitable data in that system. In particular, the major &#34;changes to departmental administrative arrangements announced in December 1972. June 1974, June 1975, and December J 975. have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent set of outlay aggregates for the periods covered in the Budget statements. Where possible, the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by the sub-costing and re-grouping of appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies and produce an entirely comparable series. This should be borne in mind when examining the tables in Statement No. 3 and, more particularly, Statement No. 6. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For all these reasons, considerable care must be exercised when comparing functionally classified data in the 1976-77 Budget Statements with those in Budget Statements for earlier years. </para>

          <para>- I rise to warn the House of a toy- allegedly a toy- that is on sale in Hurstville in Sydney and which may be on sale in the electorates of other honourable members. It is a toy syringe and is called Hypo-Phony. It is said to be capable of giving fake hypodermic shots. The brochure that comes with this so-called toy says that you can pretend to give a shot to yourself, blood to an anaemic friend, hot blood to a cold girl, pep to a tired person or get blood out of a turnip, steak, roast, etc. The brochure then talks about endless fun possibilities and says that this thing is good for a million laughs. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Two years ago this object was investigated by the former Minister for Customs and Excise, the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> who ordered that a regulation be prepared to have the item banned from importation into Australia. Since that time apparently some attempt has been made to draw a regulation but no action has been completed. The so-called toy- I call it that because I do not want to dignify the product with a name of something that children would legitimately use- is still on sale. I understand that some were imported into this country within the past year or so. Last week when I found out about this I spoke to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> who is the Minister responsible for customs matters. He advised me that there was considerable concern about this. </para>
        <para>There is a degree of medical opinion that this item could be used as a real implement. There may be some doubt on that but it might be possible to adapt the item. This, of course, could possibly cause infection or even death to some people. I think the House would agree that clearly something which is suggestive of the use of drugs, and in particular hard drugs, ought not to be available in the community especially if it is sold as a toy, directed to young people, said to be good for laughs or capable of drawing blood, giving shots or the like. The brochure that goes with the item is quite irresponsible. It claims that the product is sold throughout various parts of the world and that various patents are pending. The product does not appear to originate in Australia. </para>
        <para>I do not know what the final decision of the new Minister will be on this matter, but there would seem to be 2 courses of action open to get something done about it. The first relates to item 18 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which refers to goods dangerous or a menace to the community. Perhaps the item could be banned under that regulation. However that may be too wide. I understand there have been some difficulties in the use of item 18. It may be said that such a blanket provision would not necessarily be appropriate for use in this case. Secondly, a new regulation could be drawn. If a new regulation were drawn it would need to be drawn with considerable precision. It is also, I put to the House, necessary that warnings be given to the community generally and that the House and the Minister be advised of other places where this product might be on sale. Surely in the interests of the community an approach to retailers to refuse to sell these items would be warranted. No doubt the Minister, if he chooses to proceed by way of one of the regulations, as I certainly hope he will, will also communicate to State Ministers who have control of consumer affairs the fact that this product is being sold and perhaps request that they look into the matter. But the important question is whether or not this type of item should be on sale and whether there should be a general information gathering process so that the item could, I hope, be banned from import and prevented from being on sale. </para>

          <para>- I draw the attention of the House to a recent rescue operation that has now become known as the mission to Entebbe. It is my opinion that this epic sortie will be enshrined in the annals of military history as one of the truly great actions of all time. I am sure that the heroism, daring and conspicuous gallantry of all those brave souls who took part have the admiration of all men of peace and goodwill. I have not the slightest doubt that, but for them, innocent men and women would have been slaughtered in the cause of political fanaticism. Terrorism in the form of the hijacking of aircraft would be in its death throes if all the nations of the world spelt out in bold terms then refusal to give sanctuary to these gangsters and made it clear that terrorism or aggression in whatever form it may take will be condemned and that automatic sanctions will be placed on transgressors. One could be pardoned for believing that a simple motion placed before the United Nations, condemning terrorism, would have been passed with enthusiasm and applause. I was staggered to read recently that this very motion, sponsored by responsible nations, had failed to pass. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In retrospect there can be no question that the terrorists were aided and abetted in their infamy by that madman and butcher of humanity, Id i Amin of Uganda. One of the hostages was a lady of some 75 years of age by the name of Dora Bloch. She was taken prisoner by the hijackers and, whilst at Entebbe airport, apparently complained of food poisoning and was taken to a Ugandan hospital. Apparently she was in hospital at the very time of the rescue operation. After the success of that venture the same woman was seen by independent witnesses to be dragged from the hospital, screaming, with Ugandan soldiers forcing sponges down her throat to stop her plaintive cries. Wire service reports clearly indicate that the body of this unfortunate woman, whose only crime was to be an innocent tourist, was found charred and burnt beyond recognition on the outskirts of Kampala. Despite the weight of diplomatic protests and inquiries from Israel and Great Britain, Amin of Uganda has washed his hands of the whole affair. So I believe that the time has now come for the Federal Government to sever diplomatic relations with Uganda, and I call upon the Government to do so. </para>

            <para>-That might be so. The scheme commenced on 1 July. It is a most important reform for Tasmania and I believe it will ensure the future stability and prosperity of the Tasmanian economy. I think in early 1973 the previous Labor Administration made certain hollow promises about assisting Tasmania with its freight problem and, of course, that Administration was in office for 3 years and nothing was done. No action was taken. Now we see that a Government which has been in power for only 6 months has implemented the scheme. I concede that there are problems with the scheme. It is a unique scheme; it is a new scheme. Naturally there will be difficulties with it. There are problems in determining the categories of goods which will be eligible for assistance. In my electorate of Braddon we have an important cheese industry but cheese is not included in the categories of goods. This is probably because of some misconception. However, representations have been made to the Government and the Minister and I trust that something will be done to include cheese in the scheme. There are other such commodities and one that comes to mind is potatoes. This is another important commodity produced on the north-west coast of Tasmania. At the moment the scheme does not operate as favourably for that industry as it might. I hope that the scheme will be implemented in such a way as to give the potato industry access to the important Sydney market. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There are review provisions available in the scheme which will enable industries of all kinds to make application upon appropriate grounds for inclusion in the scheme. The point I want to make tonight is that the Government and the Minister should be congratulated on ensuring that the scheme operated within the time limit proposed. It was suggested originally that the scheme would commence operating on 1 July and that deadline was met. It is a complex scheme. The Minister and the Department had a difficult task but they did the job very well. When it is operating fully I believe the scheme will enhance the prosperity of Tasmania. </para>

          <para>-I rise to bring to the attention of the House the Government&#39;s decision to adopt the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the production of gold. I believe this decision was made on wrong information supplied to the Commission and was made on the assumption that all the evidence contained in the IAC report which was presented on 6 June 1975 was correct. I submit that the report is so out of date as to be unrealistic and that the recommendation should no longer apply to the industry. I quote the report in part. It states: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The concessions . . . provided under this Act were designed for the situation where the price of gold was maintained at an artificially low level. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I further quote from the report: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>First, with the large increases in the price of gold which have occurred in recent years, the cost of these tax concessions in terms of the taxation revenue forgone has greatly increased. In 1973-74, the cost to the general community of these tax concessions totalled over $ 12m and, by 1980, they could cost in excess of $40m annually depending on movements in production costs and in the price of gold. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">With regard to this situation, the report further states: ... it must eventually result in a misallocation of resources between gold mining and other forms of mining . . . Under this proposal, gold producers would be subject to the same taxation provisions as other mineral producers by July 1980. </para>
        <para class="block">I believe that these assumptions are completely false. Firstly, they were based on an era in which gold was attaining a price of approximately $ 140 an ounce. Today, not much more than 12 months later, the price is approximately $89 or $90 an ounce. So the claim that the tax forgone would reach $40m per annum is entirely false. Today, there are few, if any, gold mining companies or individuals in a position where they would show enough profit to pay tax. So the amount of revenue forgone to the Government would be negligible. The industry today is in a very parlous state. There is a very weak market for the commodity. The last thing it needs is a kick in the teeth like the removal of the tax exemption clause. I submit that the IAC should have another complete look at the gold mining industry and that the Government should reconsider its decision to phase in the imposition of taxation the gold mining industry and give this industry another chance. The IAC report of 6 June 1975 goes on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Employment in the industry over the next two or three years is unlikely to be affected by the recommendations. ... the effect on the life of the mines is not expected to be significant. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The employment situation in the gold mining industry in Kalgoorlie at the present time is indeed at risk and the effect on the life of the mines is indeed great. I further quote from the report: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>However, it is believed that the recommended phasing out provisions could cost between $60m and $130m in revenue forgone . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In my opinion, in the phasing out period no revenue would be forgone because the industry is not in a position today where it would be paying tax and it is not likely to reach that position in the short term. We all know that a significant factor in the depressed price of gold is the International Monetary Fund sales of gold over the next <inline font-style="italic">3Vi</inline> years. It was proposed to sell 25 million ounces of gold over 4 years, commencing about January 1976. This scheme has approximately 3vi years to run. There is not a significant prospect of the price of gold rising during that time so we would see the gold industry maintaining an uneconomical situation for perhaps 3 years or more. During this time I do not believe that we ought to be talking about implementing a tax on gold. </para>
        <para>A further aspect of the gold mining industry in Kalgoorlie is that is does generate a tremendous amount of employment and a tremendous amount of interest for the individual prospector who goes out at weekends or in any other spare time and uses his individual initiative and his free enterprise instinct to gain himself some further employment and some betterment of his way of life and his standard of living. If the gold is to be taxed this incentive will be removed from these few honest, hard working individuals who are out there, in the outback of Australia, eking out a living and not only prospecting for gold but finding tomorrow&#39;s mines. It is obvious that today&#39;s prospectors are the people who bring in tomorrow&#39;s mines and the massive development that goes with them. With tomorrow&#39;s mines and the big mining development, we see great employment opportunities, development and tremendous capital inflow into the area. All of this will dry up if at this point in time we decide to impose a tax on gold mining. </para>
        <para>We have some massive ventures like the Telfer gold project in the Pilbara and the Blue Spec mine at Nullagine. We have projects in Tasmania and in Tennant Creek which in my opinion will wither and die on the vine if we impose a tax on gold. </para>
        <para>There could well be a closure of the State battery system in Western Australia which performs the custom milling operations for the prospectors. Because of the lack of incentive and the lack of ore coming from individual prospectors there will be a drying-up of job opportunities when the State batteries close down. This is a tremendous service industry to outback Australia and to Western Australia in particular. It helps individuals raise their standard of living, as I said a moment ago, and also creates a tremendous amount of export income for Australia and a tremendous amount of productivity for the area it serves. I ask the Government and the Ministers concerned to reconsider seriously the decision to implement the recommendations in the Industries Assistance Commission report. I submit that the LAC report is so out of date that it is not realistic today. </para>

            <para>The recommendations fall into four categories- those seeking action by Government, by the Aboriginal people, by Nab al co, and those seeking joint action. </para>
            <para>Those recommendations seeking action by the Government, and the action which has been taken are; 1, 8, 12: The Machinery for achieving the intention of these recommendations will be available under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill when this Bill and complementary legislation to be enacted by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly become law. 10: There has been a marked increase in the number of people seeking permits to go beyond the mining lease boundary, where previously they would have breached the permit requirements; it is expected that legislation to be enacted by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, complementary to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern </para>
            <para class="block">Territory) Bill, will make appropriate provisions in this regard. 14 and 15: These recommendations are under active consideration; it will also be appropriate for the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs to include questions such as this in its current examination of the question of alcohol and Aboriginals; I will await the outcome of the Standing Committee &#39;s inquiry with interest 16: There has been an increase in the number of Aborigines undergoing training as nursing aides and health workers. Training is given at the new health centre at Yirrkala in preference to the base hospital at Nhulunbuy. There are Aboriginal health workers on all homeland centres and these are supported by visiting doctors and sisters who offer continuous on-the-job training. 17: The water supply from Yirrkala Creek is under constant surveillance by the local health officer; the water is of acceptable standard when regularly chlorinated. 1 8 and 1 9: A range of adult education and training courses is available to Aborigines at Yirrkala. In addition to Mission and Government staff involved in Social work (including working with Aboriginals assistants) there are two adult education teachers at Yirrkala. </para>
            <para>Those recommendations seeking action on the part of the Aboriginal community and the action which I am informed has been taken by the community are: 7: The Aboriginal community has established an incorporated body to represent the community&#39;s interests, including the receipt and disbursement of moneys generated by the mining project. 9: The Aboriginal incorporated body has invested approximately $20,000 in stocks and shares and is considering the purchase of the Government&#39;s shares (to the value of $70,000 ) in the Yirrkala brickworks. 1 1: The Aboriginal community is actively considering this recommendation which relates to a contentious matter within the community. </para>
            <para>Recommendations seeking action by Nab al co Pty Ltd and action which I am informed the company is taking in respect of those recommendations are: 3: The Company has adopted the practice of holding meetings with the Aboriginal community on an ad hoc basis when specific issues need to be discussed, rather than at regular monthly intervals as was the earlier practice; these meetings are held at various locations appropriate to the subject under discussion. 4: The Company has provided a scale relief model which is temporarily located in its offices at Nhulunbuy but which will be housed at Yirrkala when suitable accommodation is available. </para>
            <para>S: The Company has been seeking to improve the effectiveness of its communication with the Aboriginal people and is prepared to meet with the Aboriginal people at any time or place nominated by them; the Aboriginal community is free to avail itself of whatever outside advice it considers necessary. 6: The Company <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> prepared to enter into direct negotiation as suggested by this recommendation; the arrangements for such negotiations at the appropriate time will be made in accordance with arrangements provided for in the Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill now before Parliament </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Those recommendations requiring joint action by all parties at Gove, and the action taken are: 2: Such negotiations will be possible under arrangements to be provided in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill now before Parliament. 13: The present red mud disposal areas were established as pilot projects but have continued in use pending negotiations of further leases for red mud disposal; the effects of red mud disposal on the environment are being taken into account in the consideration of the Company&#39;s further requirements; the appropriate Government Departments, the Aboriginal community and the Company are involved in these negotiations. 20: Since the report of the Committee the following action has taken place: </para>

              <para>To assist exporters to participate in the large scale procurement that is being undertaken by Indonesian Government instrumentalities, EFIC established in April 1975 ansi 8.5m credit line with the Indonesian Ministry of Finance under which credit terms of up to 10 years at internationally competitive interest rates were available. Although the Indonesian authorities indicated that the terms of this credit line were acceptable to them, they did not take advantage of it for procurement of Australian goods. This credit offer expired on 30 June 1 976. Notwithstanding expiry of EFIC&#39;s credit line offer, Australian capital goods exporters to Indonesia may still apply for concessional interest rate finance from the Corporation and any such applications will be considered on their merits on a case by case basis. </para>

I note however that in other documentation the revenue losses due to the tariff are based on the assumption of a complete removal of the tariff coupled with a devaluation sufficient to leave the overall value of imports unchanged. Since such a devaluation would be excessive (it would bring the balance of payments into disequilibrium by over-stimulating exports), any estimates of export revenue losses made on that basis would be considerably overstated. </para>

                  <para>It is possible to develop statistical comparisons which are not inconsistent with this assertion. However, single year comparisons of the proportions of gross domestic product (GDP) traded internationally by various countries can be significantly affected by a number of temporary factors. These could include the position of each country&#39;s economy in the business cycle, conditions in overseas markets, and, for countries importantly engaged in commodity trade, variations in seasonal conditions and commodity prices. </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para>More importantly, many longer-term factors need to be borne in mind when making such comparisons. For example, the creation of the Common Market led to a considerable growth in intra-EEC trade with an associated diversion of some trade away from non-member countries. In addition, basic geographical factors tend to constrain Australian participation in world trade. A further relevant point is that it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from such comparisons as to the &#39;efficiency&#39; or &#39;welfare &#39; of particular sectors of the Australian economy. </para>

              <para>The research conducted by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture has involved the study of disease dissemination mechanisms, methods of infection of the rape plant, and the effects of disease development on various stages of plant growth as well as breeding and testing of crop varieties for resistance to blackleg and testing of fungicides as protectants. The New South Wales research is directed towards avoidance of the disease through the use of tolerant varieties and variation of sowing time. The work of the Victorian Department of Agriculture initially involved research into factors contributing to incidence of the disease under field conditions, seed as a source of infection and methods of control. The current phase involves breeding for resistance using imported varieties as source of resistance. At the University of Western Australia, research has centred around the study of the host-parasite relationship and has two main facets, namely, the biology of the causal organism of blackleg and development of resistance in the host plant. </para>

              <para>The work by the Western Australian Department has led to the development of a technique for screening large numbers of rape varieties and crosses from these for blackleg resistance under glasshouse conditions. This has allowed the breeding and selection program to be speeded up. In addition, some seven research papers arising from this work have been prepared. Results of the fungicide work have so far been disappointing but it is proposed to continue in this area. </para>

          <para>Results in New South Wales have indicated that time of planting and variety (winter and spring types) may have a significant bearing on yield. However, atypical seasonal conditions have so far confused the picture. </para>
          <para>In Victoria, research to date has shown that incidence of the disease is strongly associated with the early (autumn) so wings followed by heavy winter rain. The best method of control of the disease in the field is to practise late so wings in isolation from other rape crops or fields sown to rape in the previous one or two seasons. An index of infection which enables the severity of crop infection to be accurately predicted has been developed. Infected seed has been shown to be relatively unimportant in the spread of the disease except for new crop areas. The breeding work is continuing. </para>
          <para>Work at the University of Western Australia has led to the buildup of a large collection of different types of the fungus which causes blackleg. These are to be used for testing new rape varieties for resistance as they become available. Laboratory techniques for measuring resistance to the disease have also been developed. Current research is concerned with imparting the resistance found in some imported varieties to locally developed strains whilst maintaining their yield potential. </para>

            <para>The total number of Aborigines registered for employment with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations at 2 April 1976 was 10 335. For a number of reasons, including the isolation of many Aboriginal communities, and the lack of awareness among Aborigines of their unemployment benefits entitlements, many Aborigines do not register for employment and the actual number unemployed may well be substantially greater. My Department estimates, on the basis of 1971 Census data, that the number of Aborigines now in the labour force is a little under 35 000. More satisfactory figures will be available in due course from the 1976 Census. </para>

              <para>Yes. By virtue of section 22 IP of the Income Tax Assessment Act, tax instalment deductions payable to the Commissioner of Taxation by a trustee in bankruptcy or by the liquidator of a company have priority over all other debts whether preferential, secured or unsecured, with the exception of specified costs, charges and expenses. They would thus rank in priority ahead of amounts payable for salaries and long service leave. (2) Section 22 IP comes into operation when an employer who has made deductions purporting to be for tax instalments fails to remit the amount deducted to the Commissioner or purchase tax stamps. If an employer carries out his statutory obligation and remits the instalments by the due date, the employees are allowed credit in their income tax assessments for the tax instalments deducted from their wages. If the employer goes bankrupt or, being a company, goes into liquidation without paying the instalments to the Commissioner, the Crown nevertheless keeps the employees indemnified against this loss and the Commissioner allows them credit for the amounts deducted although he may never receive any payment whatsoever. The Commissioner&#39;s priority thus merely attempts to ensure that he will be reimbursed, at least in part, for the credit allowed to employees. </para>
            </item>

          <para>After considering the matter my view is the same as that of the previous Treasurer who dealt with a similar question last year and after considering the purpose and operation of section 22 1 Preached the conclusion that it would be best if the priority conferred by the section is retained. </para>

              <para>1) It is not possible to isolate a single factor which may have caused a rise in prices for chopper dairy cows and other second grade beef shortly after the Tonga la slaughter. Processors can in most cases substitute meat from one type of beast for another if there is a change in relative prices. The following factors may have influenced the market: </para>

                <item label="(a)">
                  <para>In the last six months a record total of more than 1.1 million cattle have been slaughtered in Victoria, 17 per cent above the corresponding figure a year ago. With current weak demand this record supply has led to depressed prices for all types of cattle. </para>

                <item label="(b)">
                  <para>Last year many farmers because of the good season and the then low cattle prices held back cull cows which otherwise would have been marketed. Because of the current drought farmers have had to sell both the stock they held back last year and this years&#39; culls. The abnormally high supply of chopper cows, created by such forced sales, has contributed to the relatively lower prices for this type of stock. </para>

                  <para>Immediately following the slaughter at Tongala, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith,</inline> the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, guaranteed producers a bounty of $5.00 per head for stock slaughtered and buried by Councils. Farmers may have then decided to withhold their culls from sales and accept the bounty rather than risk a bill from their stock agents. It is estimated by the Victorian Meat Works Association that the number of such stock offered for sale fell by 30 per cent the following week. </para>

Australian wheat is inspected after its arrival in Bangladesh and before it is distributed locally. Sometimes it is stored in a single facility with shipments from other countries. The Food Ministry of the Government of Bangladesh has informed the High Commission that there has been no significant deterioration of stored food grain over the past two years. The problem of wastage of food grain because of inadequate storage facilities is regarded as more potential than actual, and various measures have been taken by the Government of Bangladesh and by aid donors to meet this problem. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Establishment and spread of beetles in northern areas of Australia has continued and there are now two species <inline font-style="italic">(Onthophagus gazella</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Euonitocellus intermedius)</inline> which occupy between them virtually the whole of the continent north of a line joining Exmouth in the west to Dubbo in the east. Another two species <inline font-style="italic">(Sisyphus spinipes</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Liatongus militaris)</inline> have multiplied dramatically in the Rockhampton area and are rapidly spreading although, even with human assistance, they will require some years to occupy all suitable areas. During the moist summer months all four of these species already occur in such numbers as to dispose rapidly or very large quantities of dung. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Similarly in New South Wales at Narrabri and surrounding districts, dung pads are being rapidly destroyed by introduced beetles, mainly <inline font-style="italic">E. inter medius, E. africa nus, O. gazella</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Onitis alexis.</inline> Studies in that area provide strong circumstantial evidence that bush fly numbers have been substantially reduced by dung beetle activity. Apart from establishing a significant population of beetles in northern Australia, these first years of the project have enabled much basic and vital research to be done on the biology, distribution, and breeding of the beetles. That research is now paying handsome dividends in speeding up the rate of establishment of new beetles in Australia. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>So far, 24 species of beetles have been released, 13 of which are known to have become established. In all, approximately one million beetles have been distributed in all Australian States. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>(a) Most of northern Australia already has a useful beetle population, although, in terms of the number of species present, it cannot yet be regarded as adequate. There are important gaps yet to be filled but some of the fifteen new species now being bred in Canberra are expected to make a significant contribution. </para>

                <item label="(b)">
                  <para>A suitable variety has not yet become established in south-eastern Australia, but one species <inline font-style="italic">(Onthophagus binodis)</inline> has begun to build up its numbers in south-western Australia, in the vicinity of Perth. In addition, a beetle <inline font-style="italic">(Hister nomas)</inline> that is predaceous on dung-breeding fly larvae has colonised a large part of coastal New South Wales down to the Victorian border. </para>

              <para>Collection of beetles overseas, initial egg production in South Africa, mass breeding in Australia, subsequent release and establishment are all time-consuming operations on which it is virtually impossible to put a precise time scale.

            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Probably another ten years is the minimum required to ensure that beetles will be established all over Australia. By that time, careful selection of the most effective species should have ensured a greatly improved level of dung disposal in all the major climatic zones of Australia, but there will still be very many species left in the Old World to supplement their activities if necessary. </para>

          <para>The Minister, knowing the Government&#39;s determination to reduce spending, was seeking an accurate assessment of progress to date with regard to all projects and likely cash flow requirements, and he was frankly admitting that there was no absolute certainty that funds would be appropriated by Parliament in 1976-77 immediately to meet these requirements in full. </para>
          <para>Since that time the Treasurer&#39;s statement of 20 May has made it clear that sufficient funds will be appropriated in 1976-77 to meet all commitments. The Supply Bill (No. 2) 1976-77 already provides for an amount of $4.6m for the Capital Assistance for Leisure Facilities Program, and further funds are to be provided in the Budget.

            <para>The  Hon.  G. McKinnon replied on 7 May 1976. The essence of his reply was: &#39;The CALF Programme has . . . been of great benefit to both local government authorities and community groups in contributing a real stimulus to the development of recreational facilities. &#39;. . . I would see the severe curtailment or abandonment of the scheme as a retrograde step. &#39;. . . . my officers will cooperate as you require, however, . . . deferring of expenditure on works currently in progress until the 1977-78 financial year would be seen as a breach of faith by the local governments and community groups and would place my department in a difficult position.&#39; </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>The  Hon.  J. D. Herbert replied on 27 April 1976. The essence of his reply was: &#39;. deferment of expenditure to 1977-78 . . . could lead to a number of projects being left in an unfinished state and be incapable of being used for the purpose intended or cause extreme financial embarrassment where the projects are nearing completion and the organisation has borrowed to the full extent to finance the work.&#39; </para>
        <para>The  Hon.  B. R. Dixon sent a telegram on 23 April 1 976 requesting that the Minister defer sending letters to those Victorian grantees who have approved projects on which work has not yet commenced or projects for which contracts have not been signed. </para>
        <para>He then wrote on 30 April: &#39;I appreciate the Commonwealth&#39;s desire to reduce cash requirements in 1976-77 ... I also wish to avoid undue deferral of projects to which we are jointly committed. I believe that this can be achieved provided I can receive your assurance that the Commonwealth will, in due course, honour its present commitments to Victoria in full. &#39;I would be reluctant to advise municipal councils to slow down or scale down their approved projects which are so greatly needed. This can be avoided if you can eventually meet your committed portion of our joint contribution. &#39; </para>
        <para>The  Hon.  T. Mcasey replied on 29 April 1 976 the essence of his reply was: &#39;Your letter . . . represents a complete breach of faith to a number of hardworking voluntary organisations and local government . . . you have . . . entirely ignored expenses for working drawings and the like that organisations have already incurred in good faith. Your letter leaves me with no confidence in your Government&#39;s written commitments ... the voluntary organisations and local government . . . will feel the same.&#39; &#39;. . . your proposal to defer . . . is so unrealistic that it leaves me wondering whether you even considered what this meant.&#39; &#39;Work will commence in two weeks on the Campbelltown project. A contract will be let in the next few weeks for the Enfield project and Angle Park is currently before our Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. What is the position with these commitments? &#39;I trust that . . . you will now review your decision.&#39; </para>
        <para>The  Hond. Arb la ster, the then Minister, replied on 7 May that his Department had previously warned grant recipients that the date when commitments could be met depended on the availability of funds in any year. &#39;I am most disturbed at the possibility that projects in N.S.W. for which grants have been approved will be disadvantaged as a result of the responsible attitude adopted by the N.S.W. Government compared with other States. In these circumstances I would seek your urgent assurance that if any cancellation of grants is necessary, that this will be undertaken on a pro rata basis in relation to the overall grants approved rather than by selective discrimination of individual projects which may not have commenced as a result of my Department &#39;s actions. &#39; </para>
        <para>Since the recent change of Government in N.S.W. discussions have been continuing at an officer level. </para>

              <para>Under the Australian Meat Board&#39;s diversification scheme, exporters are required to sell to markets other than the U.S.A. in order to earn an entitlement to ship meat to the U.S.A. These entitlements, known as credits, can be traded between exporters. The fact that credits can be traded enables the diversification scheme to work as an equalisation system, equalising returns from over the total industry. In theory this results in cattle prices being related to the average equalised return and not to the price obtained in any particular market. In fact there are variations for different classes of cattle which in pan reflects the different requirements of varying markets. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Australian Agricultural Council has agreed on the need for production restraint for the dairy industry. Among guidelines adopted to achieve restraint, is agreement in principle to amend, where necessary, the system operating in individual States so that farmers holding quotas for market milk will no longer be required to fill individual dairy quotas during the off-season. The Ministers for Agriculture from Tasmania and Western Australia while indicating general support for this proposal said they would need to consult with their Governments and industries. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The implementation of the proposal is a matter for the States and there may be some variations between States as to the way in which the changed policy operates. It is the Commonwealth&#39;s understanding that in general quota holders will no longer be obliged to supply the minimum quantum of milk specified in contracts and no penalties will attach for failure to supply milk during the off-season. However, the volume of milk availability differs between States and in Western Australia, for instance, it may be necessary to require quota holders to meet a percentage of their quota during the off-season to ensure adequate fresh milk is available for consumers. </para>

            <para>Is the Minister aware that the Australian Broadcasting Commission talk back session <inline font-style="italic">Morning Extra</inline> invites listeners beyond the Sydney area to ring the station reverse charge? This morning I understand that there were calls from as distant as Renmark, Forbes and Cairns. Having in mind that the ABC recently withdrew several popular programs as an economy measure when previously required by the Government to exercise restraint in spending and that further substantial staff cuts are allegedly contemplated, will the Minister take steps to establish whether the ABC can justify its action in accepting these reverse charge calls for a program of dubious merits? </para>

            <para>Is the Minister for Overseas Trade aware of reports of alleged dumping of New Zealand timber on Australian domestic markets? Is he also aware of claims that this New Zealand timber is priced at approximately half the price of timber ex some Australian mills and that as a result many of these mills face closure? Will the Minister assure the House that the Government is giving urgent attention to the matter? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The following additional information is provided in answer to the honourable member&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In 1974-75 and the first nine months of 1975-76, New Zealand supplied only 6 per cent of Australia &#39;s total imports of sawn timber. Statistics for the first nine months of 1 975-76 compared with the same period in 1974-75 show that the value of imports of sawn timber from all sources decreased by over 5 per cent. During the first nine months of 1975-76, imports of sawn timber from New Zealand are running some 12 per cent higher in quantity terms and some 9 per cent higher in value terms compared with 1974-75. New Zealand thus appears to be improving its share of the Australian market at the expense of other supplying countries rather than by taking sales away from Australian mills. </para>
            <para>Should there be evidence that importation of New Zealand sawn timber is taking place under conditions which constitute dumping and which causes or may cause injury to Australian producers the appropriate action would be submission of a case to the Bureau of Customs, Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. </para>

Telecom Australia employs a number of staff on recruitment activities, many of whom are not exclusively engaged in such activities and, therefore, it has been necessary to make an assessment of the time and annual salaries expended full-time on recruitment. The assessed figures are 53 man years at an annual cost of $620,000 for salaries. The position in Australia Post is similar and the assessed figures are 30 man years at an annual cost of approximately $300,000. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission currently employs 4 officers for staff recruitment, the salaries of whom amount to $45,177 per annum. </para>

              <para>The short answer is no. At the close of the 1975-76 season the auction price for 21 micron wool was 287 cents per kg clean which was less than 15 per cent above the floor price for this wool category. An increase of 20 per cent in the floor price for 2 1 micron wool for the 1976-77 season would have been difficult to sustain. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Wool of 21 micron represents only a relatively small percentage of the clip and its market behaviour is not necessarily representative of the whole clip. Accordingly, the Government decided that the floor price would be expressed as a &#39;whole clip average&#39; for 1976-77. The whole clip average floor price for 1976-77 has been established at 234 cents kg clean and this represents an increase in the floor of 1 4 per cent over the clip average which applied in 1 975-76. </para>
          <para>The Government also decided that the floor price policy would be continued during 1977-78 at a price not below the level of the floor decided for this season. </para>

              <para>(2) &#38; (3) I understand that the New Zealand Wheatgrowers&#39; Compensation Scheme provides for a form of crop insurance which affords protection to wheat growers against losses from hail, flood and frost. It is a grower financed scheme and for the cover growers pay a levy of 15 cents per tonne of wheat into a compensation fund. The grower carries the first one third of the risk and the fund the other two thirds. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It should be noted that the Australian wheat industry is on a very much larger scale than New Zealand&#39;s and the fluctuations in yield from one natural cause or another are very much greater. For these reasons alone these difficulties in implementing a similar scheme in Australia are infinitely greater. An indication of the smallness of the scheme in New Zealand, from the Australian point of view, is seen in the fact that only six claims totalling $3,350 were paid on wheat from the 1974 harvest. </para>
          <para>All-risk crop insurance has received consideration in Australia, principally by the Australian Wheatgrowers&#39; Federation. The matter is a very complex one and the major deterrent probably has been the cost of implementation in the Australian situation where yields are so variable. The publication &#39;The Principles of Rural Policy in Australia: A Discussion Paper&#39; (the so called &#39;Green Paper&#39;) gives a brief section (paras 4.79 to 4.90) on the topic. </para>
          <para>A pilot all-risks insurance scheme covering wheat grown in Western Australia was introduced in April 1974. 1 understand however that it will not be continued in the future. </para>
          <para>The Government has already expressed its interest in natural disasters insurance schemes. The Insurance Industry Conference has been asked to report on the feasibility of introducing a crop and livestock insurance scheme and in addition a study is currently being undertaken into the possibility of introducing a more widely based natural disasters insurance scheme covering the major natural hazards such as earthquake, tropical cyclones, floods and bushfires. </para>
