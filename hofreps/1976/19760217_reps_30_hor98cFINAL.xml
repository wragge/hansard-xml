          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr CHIPP</inline>(Hotham)-It gives me a great deal of pleasure to move that the right honourable member for Bruce be  Speaker  of this House. I do so with a great sense of honour. It gives me pleasure because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> has been a close personal friend of mine since I entered this Parliament. I hasten to add that I do not suggest for a moment that a close friendship with me necessarily leads people to high office, and I do not rely on that ground for nominating the right honourable member for Bruce. I have nominated him because I believe he has outstanding character and the experience and the personality that would make him an outstanding  Speaker  of this House. I think he has proven beyond any doubt that he has character. Politics is an arena wherein there are many victories and many defeats. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> has accepted the defeats and the victories with grace and dignity. He has shown enormous courage in adversity and his integrity is respected by all throughout the nation irrespective of their political persuasion. During his time he has undergone several ballots inside and outside the party room. I believe that today, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clerk,</inline> you will not have to call for a photograph to determine the result of this ballot. </para>
          <para>In addition to being fitted for this position by his character his experience is second to none in this chamber. He was the Leader of the Liberal Party and led the Liberal Parry after its first defeat in 23 years. I say without hesitation- I think I would have unanimous support- that a great . share of the credit for the extraordinary position that the Liberal Party is in today, with the biggest majority ever in this House, can be laid at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> &#39;s door for his efforts in rebuilding the Liberal Party after that defeat. He has been leader of the House of Representatives and, as I have also occupied that role, I know that that kind of experience and training is very helpful for the holder of the position of  Speaker.  He knows that you cannot always manage this House, which sometimes tends to become extraordinarily difficult, through the pure legal processes of the Standing Orders. Tolerance needs to be shown and consultation is needed with the Leader of the House on this side and his counterpart on the other side. He has had a distinguished ministerial career, among his portfolios being that of Attorney-General.  His  legal training will give him extraordinary insight in interpreting the Standing Orders. He is a Privy Councillor. </para>
          <para>The third thing is his personality. He has shown through the years, as a friend of mine and as a friend of many people in this House, tolerance that I think is a vital quality for a person who is to be the  Speaker.  He is a very approachable man and I am sure he is the sort of person to give the 34 new faces in this place, the new members, every help and encouragement. He also has a sense of humour and that is absolutely vital for a person in the position of  Speaker.  However I do implore him not to have his nose broken again if he plays squash any more with any Ministers because the sight of a  Speaker  with his nose in plaster under the wig he threatens to wear might well test our sense of humour. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Parliament needs such a man as the right honourable member for Bruce. This country is in a crisis state. The dignity of the Parliament needs to be restored and it can be restored only by a man who will command respect. Parliamentarians speak in this place and on television about the dignity of Parliament and say that politicians must be respected but that dignity and respect should be shown here. Sometimes I cringe when I see school children in the gallery during some of the behaviour that occurs in this House. Respect cannot be demanded, it must be earned, and we as members of the thirtieth Parliament have to earn that respect. There is a place in this House for interjection at the right time and sometimes our tempers become heated. Therefore the office of  Speaker  needs a man of tolerance, character and integrity. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> is such a man and I have pleasure in nominating him. </para>

            <para>-I am honoured and privileged to second this motion on behalf of the National Country Party. I also am very pleased in a personal sense to second the motion that the right honourable Bill Snedden be elected to the office of  Speaker  of this House, a motion so capably moved by the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp).</inline> One of the main reasons it gives me pleasure is that I have always had a strong personal respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> as a man. Like the honourable member for Hotham, I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> as a personal friend but this will not influence him at all in any treatment that he might give when he is elected  Speaker.  He commands my respect for the way in which he has carried out his duties as a member of this House during the 17 years that I have had the opportunity of seeing him in action in this House. I believe that all fair-minded members of this House would agree that the right honourable Bill Snedden has conducted himself as a very able member of Parliament and has handled the hurly burly of debate in a calm, effective and dignified manner. I am sure that these qualities will be displayed in his important position as  Speaker  of the House.  His  ability cannot be questioned, as the list of the offices he has held and which were detailed by the honourable member for Hotham will show. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I endorse strongly the personal tributes that were paid by the mover of the motion to the right honourable Bill Snedden. He has been an outstanding all-rounder in his lifetime. He has been a great community worker, a great member of Parliament, a great parent and a great sportsman. I am confident he will discharge his duties without fear or favour. I am sure he will always reach his decisions on the grounds of fairness and regard for the Standing Orders, and for the dignity and decorum of this House. I am sure that the right honourable Bill Snedden will be a fine Speaker. In conclusion, I offer him my personal co-operation. I am sure all members of the National Country Party will do the same and will support this motion unanimously. I formally second the motion. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline>G. WHITLAM (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- It is appropriate that the first motion I move in this Parliament, like my last motion in the old Parliament should concern the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes).</inline> On the last occasion I spoke he was  Speaker.  He was entrusted by honourable members with a task of unprecedented importance for the institution of Parliament and for the future of Australian democracy. By the manner in which he discharged that task- by the manner in which he carried out his duties, throughout his term as  Speaker  and during the gravest crisis ever confronted by the Parliament- the honourable member brought credit and dignity to his office, and earned, as no  Speaker  has before him, the right to continue in the chair. During the events of 1 1 November- momentous for the Parliament, for  the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions, for Australia&#39;s reputation in the worldthe honourable member for Corio emerged as a true and valiant defender of the rights of Parliament. No higher praise can be given to a <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker. Mr Speaker</inline> Scholes upheld the ancient traditions of his office and discharged the primary function for which that office was created. He stood firm in defence of the people&#39;s House against a challenge to its authority, first from the Senate, and subsequently from the representative of the Crown itself. </para>
          <para>On the afternoon of 1 1 November <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes</inline> was directed by the House to wait upon the Governor-General and convey to him the views of this House- its want of confidence in the installed Prime Minister and its wish that the leader of the Party commanding a majority in the people&#39;s House be called upon once more to form a Government. It is no fault of the honourable member for Corio that his message went unheeded and unheard, that the Governor-General refused to see him until after the dissolution of Parliament was proclaimed, that the  Speaker  was insulted by the representative of the Queen, and that the office of  Speaker  and all the rights and privileges it embodies were treated with contempt. After the <inline font-style="italic">coup d&#39;etat</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> Scholes was the only member of this House to retain office with the approval of the House. He did not rest in his endeavours to redress the wrong that was done to this institution and to defend the rights of honourable members. He wrote promptly to the Queen expressing his concern at the events of 1 1 November. He elicited from  Her  Majesty a response to the effect that if the Queen&#39;s representative chose to abuse his powers there was nothing she could do about it and nothing we could do about it. That response was proper, and doubtless, I regret to say, it was accurate. </para>
          <para>The rights of the Australian Parliament in relation to the Crown remain unclear. The reserve powers of the representative of the Crown in Australia remain unchallenged. Powers that the American people rejected in 1776 survive in Australia in 1976. Sooner or later those powers must be curtailed if parliamentary democracy in this country is to flourish in full measure. The record will show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> Scholes took his stand in defence of the great central principle of our system of governmentthat the will of the people resides in this, the people&#39;s House, and in this House alone. For the record and for the information of honourable members I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence between  Her  Majesty and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> Scholes. </para>

			<para>I am compelled by events involving yourself through your representative in Australia,  His Excellency  the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr, A C, K.C.M.G., K.St.J., Q.C.. to communicate my concern at the maintenance in the office of the Prime Minister of the  Hon.  Malcolm Fraser, M.P. despite his lack of majority support in the House of Representatives. </para>
			<para>Immediately following the announcement of the dismissal of the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> &#39;s appointment, the House of Representatives carried a resolution expressing want of confidence in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s nominee and requesting the re-instatement of the former Prime Minister in whom the House expressed confidence. </para>
			<para>I am seriously concerned that the failure of the GovernorGeneral to withdraw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> &#39;s commission and his decision to delay seeing me as  Speaker  of the House of Representatives until after the dissolution of the Parliament had been proclaimed were acts contrary to the proper exercise of the Royal prerogative and constituted an act of contempt for the House of Representatives. It is improper that your representative should continue to impose a Prime Minister on Australia in whom the House of Representatives has expressed its lack of confidence and who has not on any substantial resolution been able to command a majority of votes on the floor of the House of Representatives. </para>
			<para>It is my belief that to maintain in office a Prime Minister imposed on the nation by Royal prerogative rather than through parliamentary endorsement constitutes a danger to our parliamentary system and will damage the standing of your representative in Australia and even yourself. </para>

An appointment was made for me to wait on the Governor-General at 4.45 p.m. The Governor-General prorogued the Parliament at 4.30 p.m. </para>

              <para>-None of us can have any doubt about the fitness of the honourable member for Corio to carry out the duties of  Speaker.  He has demonstrated all the qualities of a fine  Speaker-  wisdom, tolerance and selfassurance, clarity and certitude in his rulings, that special blend of firmness and fairness essential to the good conduct of proceedings. When the supreme challenge came to the rights of this Parliament he bore himself with dignity and carried out his tasks with the highest conception of his duty to the institution he serves and the cause of Australian democracy. It is above all in recognition of his actions and conduct at that time that I commend him to honourable members as our  Speaker. </para>

            <para>-In supporting the motion that the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> do take the Chair I remind the House- I am sure that all who were in the last Parliament will agree with me- of his great technical competence as a  Speaker.  He was a very fair  Speaker.  There was very great clarity in his rulings. While the turn of political fortune may mean that he will cease to have the Speaker&#39;s chair as a result of the election in this House there is nothing in his record that deserves defeat.  His  last action was to vindicate the rights of this House against what was an act of very great discourtesy. Had there been only one  deputy  to swear in both Houses we would have been cooling our heels in this chamber waiting for the process to be finished in the Senate. I would like to know why such a discourtesy, never offered, to this House before in my 30 years in this Parliament, took place. But it is consistent with the attitudes shown towards the rights of the House by the holder of that office. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is a great importance in the Speakership, but this importance is slurred over. No reference was made from the other side to the importance of the speakership in vindicating the rights of this Parliament. There is a tendency of mind in text books to talk about a military raid on Parliament as something done by Charles I and Cromwell. The last military raid on an English speaking parliament took place in Australia in 1917 under the orders of William Morris Hughes, who was the then Prime Minister. The  Speaker  of the day, although of the same political persuasion, did not co-operate; neither did the Clerks of the House. But a servile majority of the House of Representatives was prepared to vote to vindicate a military raid on itself which its own  Speaker  and its own  Clerk  did not support. So I say that in Australia the tradition of vindicating the rights of this House in the formation of a government and its rights <inline font-style="italic">vis-a-vis</inline> the Crown is very defective. I believe that the correspondence of the honourable member for Corio with the Governor-General, with the Queen and then with the Governor-General again will last in this country as significant documents beyond the chances and changes of any election because they are documents of the greatest significance and the principles incorporated in those documents are principles upon which proper parliamentary government in this country will have to proceed. I believe that abroad there are very few observers of the Westminister system who would not vindicate what was done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> Scholes. </para>
          <para>For those reasons I have pleasure in seconding his nomination to the Chair. However, knowing of course the composition of this Parliament and the likely election result I can only say that personally I very greatly regret that the Liberal Party did not choose a much more competent man as its nominee for  Speaker  and one in whom we would have much more confidence. I refer to the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles ).</inline></para>

            <para>- I rise to support the nomination of the right honourable Bill Snedden as  Speaker.  I do so and participate in this debate because of the innuendoes made and the inferences drawn by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> and the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley),</inline> the two who have nominated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes</inline> for the position of  Speaker.  There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition, by his innuendo and inference, demonstrates once more that he still fails to recognise the verdict of the Australian people on 13 December. Equally, I think it is a pity that he fails to recognise that the fault in many instances lies not in others but in ourselves. He should learn some humility and that the judgment of the Australian people is more important than that which he sought to impose on the previous Parliament and which he apparently still intends to endeavour to impose on this Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It seems to me that several aspects of the allegations made need to be answered. I deal first with the suggestion that in some way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes,</inline> as  Speaker,  acted with the authority and the backing of the members of this Parliament when he corresponded with  Her  Majesty the Queen. On no occasion was the question of his correspondence with  Her  Majesty raised in this chamber. He wrote to  Her  Majesty without in any way receiving the authorisation of this Parliament. That correspondence was undertaken on his own behalf without the backing of the Parliament and in a way which ignored completely the fact that under the Australian Constitution there is not one House of Parliament but there are 2 Houses of Parliament. </para>
          <para>In this Parliament a few moments ago the Leader of the Opposition once more stated that in his view the sooner the powers of the Senate are curtailed, as were the powers of the Senate in the United States of America, the better. Under the Australian Constitution, fortunately, the powers of changing the Constitution lie not with the members of the Opposition, not with the members of the Australian Labor Party, nor indeed even with the members of this Parliament. They lie with the Australian people. The only way in which the powers of the Australian Constitution can be changed significantly is by referendum. If the powers of the Senate are to be reduced it will not be by correspondence between the  Speaker  in this Chamber and  Her  Majesty. Neither will it be by inference that there should be a reduction in the powers of the Senate to enhance in some way the status of this House. </para>
          <para>The importance of this election is that we on the Government side of the House are confident that in the right honourable Bill Snedden we have a man who can and will act with the authority of this Parliament, who will act in accordance with the terms of the Australian Constitution. He is a man of experience and integrity, of competence and humility, a man in whom we have complete trust. There is no doubt that as a result the Australian Constitution will be observed and the rights and interests of the Australian people protected. </para>
          <para>I believe it inappropriate at this time that there should be any doubt about the capacity or otherwise of the Governor-General to have acted as he did. Indeed, the verdict of 13 December must remain the ultimate determinant and, as my colleague the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has said, if there is any doubt I would commend to honourable members a reading of the letter from the representative of  Her  Majesty the Queen which completely refutes the allegation that the Governor-General acted in any way outside the powers which are his within the Australian Constitution. </para>

You have good relations with members on both sides of the House and I know that you will perform the task of  Speaker  with dedication and great concern for this Parliament, for this institution. The Government, for its part, is determined to strengthen the institution of Parliament. Policy announcements will be made where they ought to be madewhen the House is sitting in the Parliament itself. There will be proper opportunities to debate matters of major significance and debate will not be cut off as it has been on some occasions in the past.

No one in the House has been a Minister longer than you; you have been a minister for 9 years, ranging from Attorney-General to Treasurer. You were Leader of the House on two occasions, amounting in all to 3 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> years. You were Leader of the Opposition for 2V4 years. You represented your Party and the Parliament at many conferences and in many overseas delegations. Few people could hope to equal your record of experience as a member of Parliament, as a representative of the Parliament, as a Minister in the Parliament. Three times, when you were in my present position you tendered congratulations to the  Speaker-  in February 1973, July 1974 and February 1975. You would blush if I were to recall the sentiments you expressed as those required by an ideal  Speaker.  It is enough for me to say that I will keep them by me for ready reference. </para>

After all, you yourself abetted the first attempt by the Senate to usurp the rights of this House in April 1974. The attempt failed because you, unlike your successor, did not corral the complete conservative coalition of newspaper proprietors, Chief Justice and Governor-General. I concede that your attitude is not likely to handicap the House in this Parliament when the Senate, I expect, will be quite quiescent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> there will be widespread satisfaction on both sides of the House that your Party, on one of those occasions when it conducted a secret ballot for its officers and nominees, made amends to you by nominating you to your high office. There is much personal goodwill towards you on both sides of the House. I certainly share that sentiment myself. I am most happy to convey to you the congratulations of myself and my colleagues. </para>

You take this office at a time when some of the problems which beset myself and my predecessor do not exist within this Parliament. The governing party has a majority in both Houses and therefore it is less likely that conflict between the Houses will exist. You also take office at a time when this House is at what I must say is its lowest position with regard to government and administration. This House has had removed from it its pre-eminent right over the finances of the Commonwealth. It has had removed from it rights which people&#39;s houses, including the House of Commons, have had for 700 years. </para>

            <para>-I would like to congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> on assuming this high office. The honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> was unkind enough to refer to a nose injury of yours which goes back so many decades that it must be embarrassing to consider the lapse of time. I would like to join him in saying that I hope we do not have the misfortune of seeing you taking the chair on any future occasion with your nose out of joint. I feel certain that you were reassured today to have the expression from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that he stands firmly behind you. Some people would be unkind enough to make some pointed comments about that remark. It is not the first time that he has given you assurances of complete and loyal support to you but I think he means it this time. I found the principle firmly enunciated this morning by the Prime Minister a rather novel one, that there would be a completely free flow of debate in this chamber- except when it was embarrassing and then, of course, the matter would be put to the vote. </para>

I sincerely trust that you display the depth of personal qualities which must also go with this. I believe you will and I wish you well in the future. </para>

              <para>- I thank the House and I thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> for the words he has spoken. There has been some departure from practice today in that issues of debate have been raised when really they should not have been raised. However, it was for the information of honourable gentlemen. I add that I think it will be in the interests of the House if we can have as many questions as possible in question time. I think the proposal put by the Prime Minister will contribute to that. I thank the Prime Minister for what he said. I thank the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam).</inline> All of them customarily congratulate the  Speaker,  but I felt in the congratulations a real sense of meaning. I appreciate that. The honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> may, I hope, understand that I felt that he contributed very greatly as a  Speaker  in the period that he served. I appreciate the kindness of the gesture of the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> in speaking as he did. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is in the chamber today the longest serving  Speaker  in our history, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McLeay. <inline font-style="italic">(Opposition members interjecting)</inline></para>

              <para>- Order! That is the first time I have said it. I hope it will not be said very often. I hope I will have no need to repeat it. The office of  Speaker  has a great tradition. In many ways it is the fulcrum of parliamentary democracy. I am greatly honoured to occupy the position. I will be most alert to my responsibility to protect the dignity, the decorum and authority of the House. I will expect all honourable members to conduct themselves and to make their contribution to proceedings appropriately. I look forward to retaining the camaraderie of my old colleagues of the House and to building that camaraderie with my new colleagues. I thank the House. </para>

          <para>- I have to report that the House this day attended His Excellency the Governor-General in the Senate chamber when His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of the Parliament. The Speech will be included in Hansard for record purposes. (The Speech read as follows)- </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Senators, Members of the House of Representatives: </para>
        <para>We assemble at a time when large areas of New South Wales and Queensland are being devastated by severe flooding. It is a terrible experience for those affected and my Government expresses its deepest concern for their plight. The Government is consulting with the States in taking action to ensure that all proper assistance is available. The Natural Disasters Organisation is operating smoothly. </para>
        <para>Following the decision of the Australian people in the elections last December for both Houses of Parliament, my Government believes that the Australian people have given it a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment for forty years and the worst prolonged inflation in the nation&#39;s history. The Government believes that excessive government intervention in the life of the nation is a major factor in economic instability. </para>
        <para>My Government&#39;s immediate objective is to bring inflation under control so that there can again be jobs for all who want to work. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s long term objective is to prevent the growth of centralised bureaucratic domination in Australia, the increasing dependence of individuals on the state. It is to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have- maximum freedom and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. </para>
        <para>As part of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing welfare assistance to those in real need. Unless there is a concentration on those in real need, schemes of assistance do not provide maximum possible assistance to the disadvantaged and become excessively costly. The Government does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the Government chooses to provide. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that adequate opportunities for the disadvantaged as well as the most rapid improvement in social service provision, are dependent on people being free and encouraged to achieve their best. The disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave them the maximum independence. </para>
        <para>At the root of the economic crisis is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector. Measures to deal with this crisis will advance Australia towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s strategy to achieve its objectives can be summarised as follows: </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(1)">
            <para>There will be a major direction of resources away from Government towards individuals and private enterprise; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(2)">
            <para>The internal structure of the Government is being made more economical and effective; a responsible Cabinet system has been instituted which will permit effective and co-ordinated decisions to be taken and implemented; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(3)">
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Major reforms</inline>will be implemented to protect individuals from being subjected to massive unlegislated tax increases; </para>
          </item>

            <para>Historic reforms will be made to reverse the concentration of power in the Federal Government and increase the autonomy and responsibilities of Local and State Governments.

            <para>In all policy areas the Government will be alert to opportunities to increase the freedom of Australians to choosewithout exploitation- the kinds of goods, services, and styles of life they want, and to minimise direction by Government and the unnecessary redirection of resources through the Government&#39;s bureaucracy. </para>

        <para>Control of inflation is the Government&#39;s first consideration. Unless inflation is brought under control there will be no adequate employment opportunities, no soundly based return to prosperity. </para>
        <para>The Government has already begun to implement its economic program to achieve this objective. It is a full three year program. </para>
        <para>The budget deficit must be lowered, otherwise inflationary pressures will intensify. The very rapid growth in government expenditure in recent times has been accompanied by enormous waste. The Government has taken a number of actions to reduce expenditure and inefficiency. </para>
        <para>Immediate economies have been made in administrative expenses. These affect, among other things, overtime, travel and subsistence expenses, advertising, consultancy work, the activities of commissions, boards of inquiry, and so on, as well as expenditure by Ministers and other members of Parliament. </para>
        <para>The growth of the Federal bureaucracy has been halted by the announcement of revised staff ceilings. Further revisions to these ceilings to reduce the size of the service were announced last week. </para>
        <para>There has been an initial review of the Government&#39;s spending programs and, with the other measures taken, expenditure reductions worth about $360m in the current year have been achieved. Savings from these decisions in later years will be considerably greater. </para>
        <para>The Government has also appointed an Administrative Review Committee to review administrative expenditure, achieve maximum administrative efficiency, and eliminate waste and duplication within and between Government Departments, and between Commonwealth and States. The committee will report progressively. </para>
        <para>The Government has been forced to examine all expenditures in terms of their priority. Choices have to be made. It will be necessary to economise on some worthwhile projects which are not urgent, in addition to continued action against waste and duplication, to effect the necessary transfer of resources to the private sector. Only if this is done can prosperity and productive job opportunities be restored. </para>
        <para>While the Government in these ways is seeking to cut the costs of public administration, it also seeks to promote worthwhile innovation in the Public Service. The Government will give close attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration when it is received. </para>
        <para>Concurrent with action to bring the deficit under control, the Government has announced a number of measures to further restrain inflation, encourage investment in plant and equipment and expand job opportunities in the private sector. </para>
        <para>These measures include the new 40 per cent investment allowance and the relaxation of conditions applying to the interest deductibility of convertible note issues. </para>
        <para>The Government has introduced a major set of monetary measures to take up excess liquidity and encourage investment. The package included a special new security, the Australian Savings Bond, which was outstandingly successful in supporting the February loan raisings. </para>
        <para>The Government will continue the suspension of the quarterly tax instalments for the three instalments that would have been payable for the 1976-77 financial year. </para>
        <para>Alongside its assistance to manufacturing and other industries, the Government has taken action to assist the rural community to overcome its present crisis. Rural industries will not be neglected as they have been in the past </para>
        <para>Government support for industry- primary as well as secondary- will be based on reports of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Government, of course, makes policy in this area. The Government is pursuing energetically proposals for a Rural Bank and a Farm Income Reserve Fund. </para>
        <para>An important contribution to economic revival and the expansion of job opportunities will be made by the Government&#39;s policy for Australia &#39;s resources. The prime objective of the Government&#39;s national resources policy is to return resource development to its proper role in the nation&#39;s economy and to restore overseas user&#39;s confidence in the Australian mining industry&#39;s long term reliability. </para>
        <para>The Government seeks to assure its overseas trading partners, including Japan, that we will be a stable and steady trading partner. Reliable access to overseas markets for a range of Australian products will be sought. </para>
        <para>The development of the North- West Shelf is a high priority and the Government is working closely with the Western Australian Government and private enterprise to bring the gas on-stream at the earliest possible date. </para>
        <para>The Government will energetically promote overseas trade and participate actively in the discussion of trade problems in the Conference on International Economic Cooperation and the forthcoming UNCTAD Ministerial Conference, as well as in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations being conducted under the auspices of G ATT. </para>
        <para>The Government will encourage measures aimed at improving the efficiency, economy, and adequacy of our transport services. In achieving these objectives it will work through Commonwealth, State and industry advisory bodies and it will review means of strengthening the Australian Shippers&#39; Council. </para>
        <para>Action will be taken to give effect to the Government&#39;s commitment to develop a relative freight equalisation scheme for Bass Strait traffic. </para>
        <para>The Government will ensure that business activity is regulated by law to prevent exploitation of consumers. It will also review existing regulations to ensure that they are in the public interest and do not needlessly hamper business efficiency. The Government will review the operation of the Trade Practices Act and closely cooperate with the States in protecting the consumer. </para>
        <para>Australia will not return to a soundly based prosperity without understanding and cooperation between all sections of the community. The Government needs broadly based advice from the community and in this regard will be looking to such bodies as the Economic Consultative Group and the proposed tripartite national consultative council in the industrial relations area. With this in mind the Government has established the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to develop and maintain close contact with consumers and business. In the field of transport, improved communication and cooperation with the States will be undertaken through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the Marine and Ports Council and the Transport Industries Advisory Council. </para>
        <para>Talks are to be held with union and employer groups on the future role and operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. </para>
        <para>A major step in the Government&#39;s strategy and an important support for community cooperation will be the introduction of tax indexation. </para>
        <para>In the next Budget, the Government will begin implementing its tax indexation policy. The greater the support given to the Government&#39;s economic program, the greater the first step can be. This reform will compel Governments to be honest- if they want more money, they must legislate for it. It will protect the average Australian and the low income earner against higher tax levels caused by inflation. It will check Government-induced inflation. It will be more effective in protecting the incomes of wage and salary earners than any other single measure. </para>
        <para>The Government intends to increase the capacity of Australian workers and employers to decide the leadership of their organisations. Legislation will be introduced providing for officially conducted secret ballots in elections for officials in organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Government is also proposing to ensure that members receive each year a report on the activities of their organisation and its finances. These measures will be discussed with the trade union movement before legislation is introduced. </para>
        <para>To re-establish a pattern of cooperation in national affairs and reverse the excessive centralising of power in Australia, the Government proposes to make the most important reform of the Federal system since Federation. Its core will be the principle of tax sharing. The possibilities of this new approach to Federalism are demonstrated by the recent Premiers&#39; Conference. The working of our governmental system has been corroded by the absence of reasonable financial autonomy for the States. Under this Government, the States will have access to a secure proportion of personal income tax revenue. This will both make possible more effective community participation in State and Local Government and a more rational use of the Government&#39;s resources. </para>
        <para>In making these reforms, particular care will be taken over the special circumstances of the less populous States to ensure that they are in no way disadvantaged. </para>
        <para>To assist in achieving cooperation between the various spheres of government, an Advisory Council on Inter-governmental Relations will be established. </para>
        <para>In line with its policy of developing governmental authority, the Government will progressively act to confer executive responsibility on the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with the objective of advancing the Territory to Statehood. A joint Federal and Northern Territory Legislative Assembly committee will be set up to work on arrangements for the transition to Statehood. </para>
        <para>For the A.C.T. the Government will propose legislation to ensure that the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly has responsibility for the financial management and decision-making related to Canberra&#39;s local affairs, although the Parliament will retain a reserve power of disallowance. A task force has been established to make recommendations on the framework for the transfer of appropriate authority to the Assembly. </para>
        <para>Action to restore Australia&#39;s economic well being and decentralise Government decision making is essential to the Government&#39;s ability to provide better and more effective assistance to the disadvantaged. The Government will not permit economic recovery to take place at the expense of those who are less well off. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to introduce to the Parliament amending legislation to increase social service pensions and benefit rates every six months in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Similar legislation will be introduced to increase repatriation compensation payments. </para>
        <para>The Government will proceed with a review of the income security system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in overcoming poverty. </para>
        <para>The possibility of expanding the area of choice in services available to the disadvantaged and those in real need, while fully maintaining support, will be investigated by the Government. </para>
        <para>It is believed by the Government that voluntary welfare organisations are a critically important part of the Australian welfare system. Accordingly, financial assistance to them will continue. In addition, the Government will assist voluntary bodies by placing public service resources at their disposal through improving opportunities for transferability of staff between the Government and the non-government sector. </para>
        <para>Medibank will be retained and the Government will ensure it operates efficiently. The Medibank Review Committee has been established to examine the program in this respect. </para>
        <para>Measures have been taken to ensure that only those genuinely eligible receive unemployment benefit. The Government will do everything in its power to ensure that these measures are applied with a sensitivity and understanding that respects the dignity of the unemployed, and that there is a simple, understandable and effective appeals system to protect applicants for benefits against arbitrary action by officials. </para>
        <para>The Government believes that education is a prime means for individual self development. An education system to achieve this end must be based on equality of opportunity and the pursuit of excellence. </para>
        <para>Legislation will be presented to Parliament early in the session to provide assistance to the States for education in 1976. This legislation will authorise funds for the programs of the Schools Commission, Universities Commission, Commission on Advanced Education and the Technical and Further Education Commission, which are now proceeding. </para>
        <para>The Government has requested reports from these Commissions on the triennium 1977-79 by the end of March. </para>
        <para>The relevant Commissions will be asked to give close attention to measures designed to achieve greater equality in teaching and facilities, and in particular to giving effective educational opportunities to the disadvantagedhandicapped, Aboriginal, isolated and migrant children. </para>
        <para>The functions of the Commissions and how they relate to State programs and responsibilities will be examined by the Government. Proposals are being considered for a single Tertiary Education Commission to perform the functions currently undertaken by the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education. </para>
        <para>The Government intends to proceed with the establishment of the maritime college at Launceston. </para>

        <para>Priority will be given to the protection of Australian interests in areas adjacent to our continent. In the Indian Ocean the Government supports United States efforts to balance the Soviet presence while hoping mutual restraint will keep the balance of forces at the lowest practicable level. Conscious of the steady and systematic development since 1968 of Soviet naval capabilities in the Indian Ocean area and its use of facilities there, and given the need of the United States to have adequate logistical back-up in an area where developments could affect global stability, the Government supports the United States development of Diego Garcia facilities. </para>
        <para>The Government believes Australia has a continuing responsibility to assist in the progress of Papua New Guinea and will, therefore, continue a comprehensive program for cooperation and development. The Government looks forward to the visit of Papua New Guinea&#39;s Prime Minister and to having early discussions with him. The Government also accepts that it has a responsibility to assist with the economic advancement of developing countries. </para>
        <para>The nation&#39;s security is a prime concern of the Government. The Government will watch the international situation closely to ensure timely warning of any changes adverse to the nation&#39;s security interests. It will maintain and foster the valuable defence relations with Australia&#39;s allies and other friends, including close associates in the neighbouring region. </para>

An order for medium range transport aircraft for the RAAF is expected to be placed within the next few months. </para>

        <para>The Government places importance on improving the Defence infrastructure, and has directed that a number of studies be undertaken in relation to our Western seaboard. These include an examination to expedite completion of HMAS Stirling in Cockburn Sound, and the early establishment of a Joint Services training area at Yampi Sound. </para>
        <para>The new Defence organisation established by the Defence Reorganisation Act will facilitate the development of a Defence Force in keeping with Australia&#39;s needs. A Defence Council has been established to facilitate the access by the Minister for Defence to all relevant advice and information concerning the control and administration of the Armed Services and to ensure that the views of the services are reviewed by an appropriate body. </para>
        <para>The Government is firmly committed to furthering equality of opportunity for women in education, employment, and in public life. It will encourage the full participation of women in all aspects of Australian life to ensure that their contribution of skills and talents is used to the full. The Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Scheme to be introduced shortly has been amended to make better provision for women employed by the Government. </para>

          <para>- A short while ago Tun Abdul Razak died. It is appropriate that the House pay its respects to his memory and to what he did in the service of his country and of the region in which he lived. Tun Abdul Razak &#39;s death is a great loss to the people of Malaysia, South East Asia and the world. In his death Australia itself has lost a dear and good friend. Tun Razak had a sustained and close contact with leaders of the Australian Government, of both sides of politics, for many years. He was greatly respected by all Australians and especially by those who came to know him. He was respected for his depth of feeling, his sense of purpose and his dedication. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Tun Razak &#39;s career was one of achievement. During the war he joined the Malayan resistance. He had a brilliant academic record in England where he was admitted to the Bar. He held high administrative posts in Malaya&#39;s preindependence period while seeking Malaya&#39;s national independence. It was one of those countries that moved from an old regime to a proper and dignified independence through co-operation, common sense and reason. In 1955 he was Education Minister and there laid the basis for Malaya&#39;s national education system. In 1957, on Malayan independence, Tun Razak became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and National Security. He spearheaded the antiinsurgency campaign. In 1960 he also became Minister for National and Rural Development, a post he held for 10 years, which he used to achieve rapid progress in the development of rural areas and which did much to raise the standard of life throughout rural Malaysia. </para>
        <para>In 1970 Tun Razak became Prime Minister and Defence and Foreign Affairs Minister. He made a significant contribution to the development of Malaysia both domestically and internationally. He was a skilled administrator and conducted Malaysian affairs with great dignity, calmness and sense of purpose. His statesmanship and his contribution to peace and stability in South East Asia will long be remembered. He helped to establish some notable and worthy goals not only for his own country but also for the region and he was not deterred by the fact that their achievement in the immediate present seemed difficult. I knew Tun Razak for a long period and I will mourn his loss personally. I therefore move: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Tun Abdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia, and expresses to the people of Malaysia profound regret and to his family tenders sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

          <para>- The Australian Labor Party supports the motion which the Prime Minister has moved. Only 4 months ago Tun Razak was the guest of the Parliament. He was returning a visit which I made 2 years ago. He was South East Asia&#39;s longest serving and one of its most dedicated national leaders. He had been a Minister since Malaysia was created. For the past 5 years he had been its Prime Minister. Before Malaysia was formed he had served as a Minister in the State of Pahang, of which his family were the hereditary rulers. He had devoted his whole adult life to equipping his nation for selfgovernment and asserting its independence. One of the most revealing things I learned from him was that when he was 10 years of age the coronation occurred of his grandfather as Sultan of Pehang. He said: &#39;A very big hall was built for the occasion and all the chiefs, nicely dressed, stood in the hall. The British Governor and his officers were there too. Everyone was standing except them. That picture has stayed in my mind. The British put us on the stage but with no part to play. This was our country but they sat there and ruled it, and all we could do was to stand by and watch. I remember that occasion very well &#39;. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Tun Razak was known as a very quiet person. He pursued a low profile in public life at home and abroad. Nevertheless, I believe that one needs to understand the man&#39;s background and his earliest impressions to understand, to appreciate, to applaud his consistency of purpose and his persistence in achieving it, and his achievements were remarkable. Malaysia is not the easiest country to rule- constitutionally, ethnically, culturally- yet he brought it together, he helped to bring it to independence, he preserved its independence and he gave it a leadership role in the region, not least in ASEAN, such as no other person could have done so well. He played a leading role in the creation of the concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia, a concept which, as the whole of ASEAN recognises, offers our best hope for the future of our region. </para>
        <para>I had been his guest on 9 visits to Malaysia since 1962. My wife and I had formed a close friendship with him and his wife. The new Prime Minister of Malaysia is, of course, a brotherinlaw of the late Tun Razak. They married sisters. Many of us have lost a good neighbour and a good friend in Tun Razak. We can at least be happy that a man who was brought into public life from the professions, where he enjoyed a very high standing indeed and an outstanding reputation, is the new Prime Minister of Malaysia. To Tun Razak &#39;s family, to the people of Malaysia, to the Government of Malaysia all Australians can say that they have lost a good neighbour and a good friend. We will remember the contribution that this man and those associated with him made to steady progress and proper aspirations in our region. </para>

          <para>- During the period when the House was not sitting Chou En-lai also died. With his death China lost one of her great leaders and the world lost one of this century&#39;s outstanding men.  His  death will be sadly felt not only by the Chinese people but also by people throughout the world. Chou&#39;s career spanned more than SO years, a record that few could equal. A determined revolutionary, he was a major figure in the turbulence of China&#39;s revolutionary period and beyond, playing the roles of party organiser, military leader and intellectual, combining those qualities and characteristics with rare skill and a rare capacity. He was second only to Mao Tsetung in his influence on contemporary China. As Premier, Chou En-lai stood willing to discuss with candour his country&#39;s position with visitors and other dignitaries. These explanations of China&#39;s role made a significant contribution to world understanding and in particular to an understanding of modern China. A committed believer in the Marxist-Leninist perspective in the world, he applied this perspective through the established canons of international relations. History will remember Chou En-lai as a major figure of his era who served his country with sacrifice and dedication over a span of years that has few parallels. In his last years, gravely ill, he worked with grace and composure to maintain and enhance China&#39;s internal stability and position in the world. I therefore move: </para>

          <para>- The Australian Labor Party supports the motion of condolence of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on the death of Premier Chou En-lai.  His  death has been lamented not only by the people of China, for whom it was an occasion of profound national grief, but also by statesmen and people the world over. With his great compatriot Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai embodied and expressed the aspirations of the people of China for national unity and international dignity.  His  death has removed the last but one of the giants of modern history. In the eyes of the world he represented the authentic spirit of the new China and her people. At the same time he remained a figure of world stature, of universal renown. While serving always the interests of his own people he was never remote from the wider concerns of humanity. He had an instinctive familiarity with nations and people everywhere, with the arts of diplomacy and the workings of governments. It was this which made him over half a century a supremely skilled and eloquent spokesman for his country, the supreme internationalist amongst statesmen and the chief interpreter to the world of the ideals and aspirations of his people. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>great achievement was to restore to a quarter of the world&#39;s people their proper place in the community of nations. He won for his country by slow degrees the trust and respect of other nations. For too long in that task he met grudging response from Australia and her allies. Only in recent years have all Australian governments and parties come to accept the place of China in our region and in the world and the legitimate claims of her people to recognition and full membership in the world community. I believe the judgment of history wm confirm that on all momentous issues affecting the peace and security of our region China has been proved right and the Western nations paid a heavy and tragic price for their folly and short-sightedness. </para>
        <para>Premier Chou En-lai worked tirelessly to better the living standards of his people. He was both a product and an architect of the tumultuous events of the revolution whose effects have transformed his country and its relations with the world. People everywhere admired his valiant participation in the Long March. Modern China owes much of its strength and confidence as well as its growing industrial development to the ideals he formulated and the inspiration he provided to his people. </para>
        <para>I made 2 visits to his country, the second as Prime Minister. During my visits I spent some 20 hours in discussion with him and was profoundly impressed by his charm, his humanity, his vigour and his vision. It was a vision which encompassed the world, a world where China would neither dominate nor be dominated. If the world now better understands China and the people of China it is chiefly because of this extraordinary man. He worked passionately for peace. He saw peace as the indispensable condition for the progress of mankind and the realisation of the aspirations of his country. He deepened and extended China&#39;s contacts with the world in culture and trade. More than anyone else he helped break down the ancient fears and suspicions of his country that prevailed abroad. His per.sonality embodied both the spirit of contemporary China and the values of its ancient civilisation, the longest civilisation to occupy one part of the earth&#39;s surface. In time I believe the world will come to see the full dimensions of its debt to this wise, patient, cultured and, in the highest sense, aristocratic representative of his people. </para>

        <para class="block">Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in support of this motion of condolence in respect of the death of the Premier of the People&#39;s Republic of China. Like so many people holding office in the parliaments throughout the world I have joined with the throng that has gone to China in recent years and have had the great privilege of meeting with Premier Chou En-lai. In speaking of this man one must of course reconcile his history with the torment of China up to 1949 and the great achievements of China since 1949. It has been an unfortunate aspect of Australian politics that the exploitation of foreign affairs during the 1950s and 1960s and the plight of Asia during that period clouded both the achievement of China and the ability and achievements of the individuals in the Government of China, one of whom was the Premier, Chou En-lai. The responsibility of the Government of China in 1949 to tackle the problems of some 600 million people, to get the industries going, to overcome the illiteracy, to overcome the enormous health problems, to overcome the poverty, then to face the trade embargoes, the hostility of much of the Western world, was a responsibility that fell very largely on the person of Chou En-lai. The internal problems of the cultural revolution took toll of his health and he came through that revolution in the same position as Premier of that country. In personal relations with Australia, he had much to do with the very important visit of the Australian Labor Party delegation to that country in 1971. He had a great deal to do with the exchange of representatives between the Labor Government of Australia in 1973 and his own country. The greatness of China in 1976 can be very directly associated with his ability and with his contribution to his own country. He was, by any political standards, a great man and he goes to his grave knowing that over 100 countries recognise his country. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I join the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in expressing regret at the death of General Mohammed. He had been Nigerian Head of State and Commander in Chief since July last year. Just 10 years ago in this House, on 8 March 1966, Prime Minister Holt moved a motion of condolence upon the death, also by assassination, of a former Prime Minister of Nigeria, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Abubakar</inline> Balewa. It is a tragic blow for the Nigerian people that domestic upheaval has again deprived the nation of its leadership. General Mohammed had served in the armed forces of his country during the civil war and also with the United Nations. He had launched many programs at home in the difficult ethnic and economic situation facing his country- the most populous and perhaps the most vital and bestendowed nation in Africa. He gave his support, as his country has consistently, to the Commonwealth. We extend our sympathy to his family and our good wishes to the Government and people of his country. </para>

The honourable member has had a distinguished parliamentary career, having been elected as honourable member for Lyne in a by-election on 22 March 1952. He has been re-elected on all subsequent occasions. During his membership of the House of Representatives he has demonstrated great ability and a knowledge and capacity which qualify him for the appointment which this </para>
        <para class="block">House is considering. During his parliamentary terms he occupied the position of Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from 28 February 1956 to 20 February 1961 and served as  Deputy Speaker  and  Chairman  of Committees from 8 March 1961 to 27 February 1973. He has been Acting  Speaker  on occasions. Indeed, the honourable member&#39;s service as  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy Speaker  in previous parliaments constitutes a parliamentary record. </para>
        <para>The position of  Chairman  of Committees of this House is extremely important because the occupant serves not only as  Chairman  of Committees but also as first  deputy  to the <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker. Mr Lucock</inline> brings to the House a vast experience of parliamentary procedure. Over the years as an occupant of this important post he exhibited great tolerance, wisdom, dignity and fairness on all occasions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> has represented Australia on many overseas delegations, and represented this country in a most distinguished manner. In 1957 he was a member of the Australian delegation to the 12th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> is regarded by parliamentarians in this country as an outstanding  chairman  who will bring great credit to this Parliament and to the position for which he is nominated. I have much pleasure in commending to the House <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Philip</inline> Lucock as a member exhibiting the best qualities required for the position of  Chairman  of Committees of the House of Representatives. </para>

My friend, the honourable member for Paterson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr O&#39;Keefe),</inline> has already mentioned that the honourable member for Lyne has established a record of service in this particular position in this Parliament.

When the parties to which he and I belong occupied the Opposition benches, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> served this House well as the senior  Deputy Chairman  of Committees. I am satisfied that he will be elected to this important position today. Perhaps he will allow me to say that this will be a proper return to the position in that it is almost a parliamentary tradition that he should occupy it. I hope I do not magnify any facet of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> &#39;s makeup by saying that. </para>

            <para>-I was saying that the honourable member for Lyne who also has been nominated is also a person of quality. He has shown his capacity to serve. However I believe that the interests of the House and the Parliament would be served by the continuation in office of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jenkins.</inline> He came to that office last year. He served for a relatively short period but he served well. I commend turn to the House. I suggest to the House that it would do itself and the institution of Parliament a service by appointing to the position of  Chairman  of Committees a member of the Opposition, a man who has shown his quality and capacity to serve in that role. </para>

          <para>-The House should be well aware by a simple glance at the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook</inline> of the qualifications that the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins)</inline> would bring to the task. He is a medical practitioner with an M.B., B.S. and is one of the few people in this Parliament who holds the degree of Master of Science. He served in the Victorian Parliament for eight or nine years and he has served with distinction in this Parliament.  His  qualifications, academic, political and parliamentary, are not unique in a House which has a great deal of quality but they are of a very high order. All of us have seen him in command in the chair. He provided adequate support to the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> as his  Deputy.  He handled all difficult occasions with aplomb, with rapport and, I believe, with fairness. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The House should be grateful for the service he has given on several very important committees. He was  chairman  of the Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. The work he has done there, I hope, will produce a more satisfactory parliamentary arrangement for all of us. Members casting their vote ought to remember that kind of service to the parliamentary system. He was  chairman  of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and brought the same qualities to that committee. In examining the qualifications of the 2 candidates for this position I think we should give consideration not only to their personal qualities but also to the general qualities of parliamentary work which they have produced over their years of effort in the parliamentary system. I claim, with no disrespect to my friend the honourable member for Lyne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lucock),</inline> that in work on the constructive side of the parliamentary system the honourable member for Scullin is pre-eminent. Therefore, if we want to do justice to the parliamentary system we should vote for the honourable member for Scullin. </para>
        <para>Let us turn for a moment to my honourable friend from Lyne. Apparently the 3 years he has been in recess on the Opposition benches have produced a changed person. I do not recognise any person of that name and kind sitting in the chair, deliberating with wisdom, dignity and fairness. I speak to the Liberals now: It is very difficult for a member of the National Country Party to be non-political about anything, even passing the salt. The honourable member for Lyne exercised a notable bias in the chair. It is true that he has been a member of Parliament for a long while. He has been a member for 23 years, but he has not had 23 years experience, he has had one year&#39;s experience 23 times because he is a remarkably slow learner of the rights and duties of the people for whom he deliberates, particularly members of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- I recognise the difficulties which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> will have overcoming some of the attitudes which you might have had in the past, but you will not be assisted in any way by having the honourable member for Lyne as  Deputy Speaker.  Therefore, this afternoon I hope we will cast our vote objectively and vote for my friend, the honourable member for Scullin. I put this point- this is something that honourable members opposite might consider more deeply when we are facing up to the next Federal election- it may well be that this Parliament should start to consider alternation. Perhaps the  Speaker  could be from the government party, and the  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy Speaker  could be from the Opposition party, as is the case with many of our Committees, standing committees and so on. I put that forward as a suggestion for the future because, much as honourable members opposite might ponder the scarcity of people on thus side of the House, in politics there is an awful lot of future but not too much of it will belong to them. </para>

          <para>- The Government and I would like to offer congratulations to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock,</inline> the honourable member for Lyne. He first entered this Parliament in 1952. He has had a long and distinguished career in the service of this Parliament and its institutions. He was the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from 1956 until 196 1 ,  Deputy Speaker  and  Chairman  of Committees from 1961 to 1973 and Acting  Speaker  in 1964. He has represented Australia overseas on many significant delegations. He has great experience in this House- experience when the House has been quiet and experience when it has been not as quiet as it should have been. He will be continuing his service to the Parliament in his capacity as  Chairman  of Committees and I believe all honourable members know that he can again carry out this task efficiently and with great distinction. I am very glad that the Parliament has the services of such a man. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I also congratulate the honourable member for Lyne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lucock).</inline> In doing so I wish to endorse the facts as given by the honourable member for Paterson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr O&#39;Keefe)</inline> and repudiate the views expressed by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant).</inline> I do not like being upstaged in this place. I do not remember when it last happened. The honourable member for Paterson was briefed on the facts by the same person as briefed me and I can therefore only say about his neighbour and my good friend that he has had the exceptional experience of 20 years in the Chair in one capacity or another in Government and in Opposition. There have been occasions when his rulings have differed from those of the  Speaker  and, as he would remember, I have given valiant support to his views in that conflict. I also said that I wish to repudiate the views expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Wills. I do not believe that one should express the same views about the honourable member for Lyne as so many people on both sides of the House express about all members of the Country Party in general. Of all members of the Country Party, the honourable member for Lyne has undoubtedly the best pastoral qualifications. In the company he has to keep he shines like a good deed in a naughty world. Both as Leader of my Party and as a personal friend, as I believe I can claim to be, I congratulate the honourable gentleman- not for the first time. </para>

He has continued in this office, not only because of the manner in which he has been able to control the debate of the House and the general operations of the chamber but also because of his great wisdom, dignity and fairness. I am sure that if he continues in that way we will treat him with the reverence he deserves. </para>

Also in the holiday about which I have spoken, I believe that he has probably come to realise that the Committee stages, which are his particular province, have started to take on a lesser importance in the Australian Parliament, yet they are the most important stages of the parliamentary process. I hope that he will use his position, his experience and the short time that he has had to reflect over the last 3 years, to produce improvements not just for his own sake but to enable all honourable members to debate the issues in the House or in the Committee stages.

          <para>-First of all I would like to thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> and the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> for their kind words. I would also like to thank my nominator and seconder, and the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins)</inline> for his remarks. I appreciate the work that he did during his term as  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy Speaker  in this Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about my pastoral experiences. I am reminded of certain words of the late Archie Cameron who once said that one of the things I did in my pastoral duties was to look after the sheep that were fleeced by certain people in a certain profession. Possibly that experience also would be of great value in this House. I might say to the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> that if he had put forward the same proposal during the last Parliament I would have been in wholehearted agreement, but over recent months I have changed my mind and now do not agree with his proposal at all. Of the honourable member for Scullin, at some stage you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and I might need his services, not as a  Chairman  of Committees but in his medical capacity as an anaesthetist to some honourable members who go over their time. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>May I make just two brief observations. A great deal has been said in this House about Parliament and parliamentary democracy. One of the remarks was passed by the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> and I think we should take notice of it. He said that neither you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> nor I nor any other occupant of the Chair could carry out his duties without the support of honourable members. I believe that at this stage with the complexity of our public life, with the challenge that is being thrown out to our parliamentary institution, there comes to each and every one of us in this House on both sides a tremendous responsibility. I do not exclude from that remark the members of the Press because I believe they too have a responsibility in this twentieth century. There are 2 things of paramount importance. One is the rights and privileges of every member, including members of the Opposition. Irrespective of what might have happened in this House recently I believe that is one of the things to which attention must be given. The second is that I believe we face a responsibility in view of the number of members who have been elected on the government side to see that members of this Parliament accept their responsibility as representatives of the electorate. </para>
        <para>Because of the complexities I believe there are 2 dangers. There is the danger of executive control that is sometimes overridden by departments and departmental heads. Each and every one of us must remember that the most vital and important functions that we have to fulfil in this place are our responsibility to the electorate, to the people who are our masters- that was said in the  recent election- to the government of a democracy and to make sure that we do nothing to lower the standards of this House, the responsibility of this House and the progress of Australia. To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I offer my wannest personal congratulations. You may rest assured that during the term of office for which it has been my privilege to be elected you will have my wholehearted support in every action that enhances the prestige of this House. </para>

Stations to provide Religious Programmes be abolished. that implementation of this would greatly reduce the beneficial effect Christian morality has had on the laws and culture of Australia which would be in opposition to the spirit and intent of the preamble to the Constitution which contains the words humbly relying on Almighty God. that 86 per cent of Australians claim to be Christians and such an overwhelming majority merits an increase rather than a decrease in religious content. that as the present time allowance for religion on T.V. was established by a Royal Commission, it should not be changed by the hurried decision of a small non-representative Committee composed of anonymous Members. </para>

        <para>That many of the countries who have benefited from Australia&#39;s foreign aid programs are now suffering even more because of economic problems, principally inflation.
