            <para>- My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already replied on one occasion to a question asked in this House regarding this matter. A number of members of the Opposition came to see me, when I was acting on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock's</inline> behalf, before the House rose about 10 days ago to put to me the question of the Australian Government's giving protection to this aid ship. The position is that the Australian Government is pursuing every possible endeavour to persuade both the Provisional Government of East Timor and the Indonesian Government to permit International Red Cross aid missions into East Timor. We believe that international aid certainly should be encouraged and that every possible effort should be made to enable reasonable relief and assistance measures to be provided in that sector. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With respect to other aid- a number of institutions in Australia is seeking to send aid; it is not only the Australian trade union movement that has an interest in despatching assistance to the people of East Timor- the position remains that the Australian Government is not prepared to permit Australian citizens to go into a position of total uncertainty as to whether they will be able to land their vessel or take their vessel into the waters of East Timor. However, following the approach that was made to me 10 days ago, the Department of Foreign Affairs has again taken up with the Government of Indonesia and the Provisional Government of East Timor through the Government of Indonesia the prospects of permitting Australian aid to flow as soon as possible. It is on that basis that the present position rests. From the Australian Government's point of view, it is hoped that the International Red Cross and international aid agencies will be permitted to function normally in East Timor at the earliest possible opportunity. </para>

It will not necessarily be transferred to the site that has in fact been chosen- I understand that there is some doubt about the wisdom of transferring it to that site- but it will be transferred to Hobart; there is no doubt about that. Because of measures that my colleague the Treasurer will be announcing in detail on Thursday, the honourable gentleman will understand that there are some financial stringencies upon us at the moment. Therefore the transfer will not be taking place forthwith or in the forthcoming financial year. But it is going to take place. </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman was right when he said that the local government authorities are waiting with some degree of eagerness to know the Government's commitments in this area. It has already been announced that local government will participate in the new proposals from 1 July. It is our intention to announce the total sum that is to be available under the federalism proposals well before that time so that local government will know where it stands and so that the State Grants Commissions can make their decisions concerning that pan of the funds that should be divided on the basis of needs within a particular State. I also remind the House that it will be at the next Premiers Conference that the nature of the division between that part which goes on a needs basis and that part which goes on a per capita or per capita weighted formula basis to all local governing authorities will be determined. The determinations will not necessarily have to be the same for each State because the circumstances of the different States are not all the same. The amount of money that will be available to local government authorities, I believe, will be of significant assistance to them and I also believe it will give them a security in revenue, not just for this year but for future years. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the main deficiencies in past arrangements was that grants would come one year but there would be nothing the next year. There was no certainty, no security under the arrangements that had been made that grants would continue to flow year by year. One of the main purposes of our program is to give certainty to local government authorities so that they know what the position is and so that they can plan accordingly and secondly, of course, to have equalisation grants on the basis of recommendations from State Grants Commissions to make up for areas of particular need or deficiency in certain local governing areas. I think the honourable member may assure the local government bodies which might have been in touch with him that the Government is fully aware of the need to have information made available in relation to these matters and I do not think he will have to contain his patience all that much longer. </para>

            <para>- Honourable members will recall that it is part of the Government's clear policy that it will consult with national employer and union organisations before the introduction of any industrial legislation. I fulfilled that obligation in relation to our current proposals on S May when I had discussions with representatives of both employers and the union movement. At those discussions I outlined proposals that the Government had in mind, including proposals for the election of officers to organisations. As a result of the views that were put by both sides at those discussions I have taken proposals to Cabinet and we have been considering, consistent with our basic objective of ensuring that every member of an organisation should have an adequate opportunity to vote without intimidation for those persons that he or she wishes to represent them, whether our objective could be met while having in mind the very substantial objections which were put to us by the union movement on 5 May. As a result of these considerations we believe that we can do this. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We propose to introduce legislation which will provide for secret postal ballots in all organisations, and of course this already is the case in a number of unions and employer bodies. What I have said underlines the Government's commitment to genuine and constructive consultations and a willingness to be flexible, to listen to different points of view consistent with our basic objectives. I would expect a positive response from both the union movement and the employers to the Prime Minister's proposals put last night for discussions on the economy including the question of wages policy and that a similar constructive and flexible approach will be shown by the representatives of unions and employers who we trust will take advantage of that invitation and attend discussions in the near future. </para>

            <para>-I know that the honourable member for Murray has been most assiduous in his representations on behalf of the very much aggrieved dairy industry in his area, as indeed have a good many honourable members on both sides of the chamber up to the aisle dividing the National Country Party and the Australian Labor Party, after which there seems to be a significant variance in attitude. A good many representations have been made to me about the plight of dairy farmers with respect to both the support scheme announced for skim milk powder and the possibility of its extension. As to that part of the honourable gentleman's question with respect to casein support, let me say that a number of plants of course have complete mobility between various alternative types of manufactured milk products. In general it was felt that the provision of the underwriting guarantee for skim milk powder meant the position would be adequately protected until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Crawford had an opportunity to examine the position of the industry as a whole. </para>

          <para>At the special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council held in Sydney last Friday a number of matters was examined in relation to the circumstances for control of production to which the honourable gentleman referred, and a program has been developed which I believe will enable some significant reduction in the quantity produced during the next financial year. This will entail necessarily co-operation between State governments, producers, industry organisations and the Federal Government. In recognition of the necessity to contain production I think that the decisions of the Agricultural Council can be said to be a milestone. </para>
          <para>In addition we are looking at other ways by which in the application of other programs, for example the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, we can provide some further assistance towards containing future production levels. With respect to the other part of the honourable gentleman's question about underwriting assistance after 30 June, Ministers recognise that there is a problem that will apply until such stage as governments can take a decision on the Crawford report. No decision has been taken, nor have firm recommendations been made, as to whether further assistance should be provided after 1 July. However, Ministers generally recognise the problem that will flow unless this position can be resolved before 30 June. I will be taking a paper to the Federal Government to examine what alternatives are available to us, and I hope that as a result the position of dairy farmers might be protected until a final decision can be taken on the long term future of the industry after the receipt and examination of the Crawford report. </para>

            <para>- The answer to that is a plain no. Medibank remains a universal scheme but at the same time we will be wanting, as I indicated last night, to offer people lower down the income scale and also other people a choice. Medibank remains a universal scheme. I would have thought that it was within our philosophy that an element of choice ought certainly to be built into that. Again I have to say to honourable gentlemen that if they wish further details it is a question of having some degree of patience and waiting until the Treasurer's statement and also the statement that will be made by the Minister concerned. I think that it ought also to be mentioned, in view of one or two of the reports this morning, that there is not really a trade-off between anything that is proposed in relation to Medibank and other particular matters that the Government has made decisions about. Questions concerning tax indexation are continuing ones that have their impact year by year. The impact of whatever might be done in relation to Medibank obviously has its impact to a major extent in the first year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the major objectives, of course, in relation to tax indexation is to establish a circumstance in which governments are forced to be honest with the electors of Australia and to make it plain that if governments want more of a person 's income they will have to legislate for it and not steal it by the illicit process of inflation. Governments would then be in a position of having to justify any particular program that they might want if they are seeking additional funds for that program. The continuing benefits of tax indexation, I believe, will accrue not only to individual taxpayers but also to the better government of this country. I also add, because this is part of the good news, that the cuts in expenditure, which I indicated only in the broadest terms and which will be indicated by the Treasurer and by other Ministers in detail on Thursday night, have of necessity had to be severe. Those cuts in expenditure and reductions in programs have had to be severe to bring back into reality the Government's command over the resources of Australia, to leave adequate room for individuals, for families and for businesses so that jobs and opportunities can be created for people all over Australia. Our philosophy is the reverse of that of the Australian Labor Party which would seek to take unto itself not only all political power but also all financial power leaving this whole community utterly dependent upon what it decides. That is not our philosophy. </para>

            <para>-I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Does he agree that indexation of personal income tax will involve not a true cost to the present revenues but only a diminution of those legislated increases caused by the impact of inflation? Does he also agree that, to the extent to which personal income tax is not fully indexed, the Government will continue to have available to it a significant source of revenue for which it is not required to legislate? Is it desirable that features of the tax system which result in legislated increases in tax should be removed from the system sooner rather than later? </para>

            <para>- I think that the sentiments expressed in the honourable gentleman's question are admirable ones. He will be able to understand the extent to which the Government has endorsed that view when he listens to the Treasurer on Thursday night. Not only are the honourable gentleman's sentiments admirable in this respect but also it ought to be noted that for quite some time it has been the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to achieve indexation of taxation. The ACTU has always regarded this as one of the elements that will help us to achieve some moderation in wage demands. </para>

            <para>- The program set out by the Government some weeks ago has advanced very well indeed, not only in relation to the Public Service proper but also in the nonPublic Service area. The honourable gentleman will recall what was said at the time about normal wastage, retrenchments and resignations. Ministers and the Public Service Board were to advise me if there would be any particular areas of difficulty in achieving the ceilings set. A week or two ago I indicated that the then level for the Public Service proper was below the ceiling set for 30 June 1976 and I can now inform the House that the number employed under the Public Service Act is already 1200 below the ceiling set for 30 June 1976. The number of persons employed by the Commonwealth but not under the Public Service Act is nearly 800 below the ceiling. So the total figure is about 2000 below the ceiling set for 30 June 1976. There have been one or two high priority areas where some minor expansion in the number of people available has been approved but I doubt whether this number would total 100 positions in all. The process will continue. However, it will continue only after examination of the particular circumstances and functions of each department. Quite obviously decisions being announced in detail by the Treasurer will enable the Public Service Board and other people to examine these matters again. I think that the achievement in relation to these matters, as a result of the process of wastage, resignations and retirements, indicates the extent to which the Public Service had become overblown under the previous Administration at the taxpayers' expense. </para>

Does this mean that he is proposing to reduce the levy or even eliminate it after the first year, or does it mean that he expects that the public will be foolish enough not to notice that it is around after the first year?

            <para>- I can only compliment Opposition members on the quality of their questions. They really are quite remarkable. I can only say that the questions do even Opposition members credit. The point missed by the honourable gentleman, who was once the Treasurer of this Commonwealth, is that indexation is a continuing process. It applies not just to this year but to next year and the year after. If the honourable gentleman did some sums he would be able to understand that the continuing impact of indexation would be a good deal more significant than the continuing impact of the other matters that he had in mind. </para>

            <para>- Last week or the week before last when this matter first arose, because of the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition I did call for the files from the Department. I can tell the honourable member and the House that I have been through at least 2 series of files. I understand that there are a couple more files of a purely technical nature relating directly to the Caravel les, the Vis counts and the Electras that have nothing to do in any sense with the allegations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The matter goes back to 16 August 1957 when Ansett Airways Pty Ltd sought permits to import 3 Electra aircraft. Ansett Transport Industries Ltd took over Australian National Airways Pty Ltd on 3 October 1957. Perhaps at this point I should explain to the House that in order to make it easy I have made some notes that are a brief summary of events that occurred. I might add in passing that it is a summary of events that the Leader of the Opposition when Prime Minister could just as easily have made by calling for the same files. </para>
          <para>The request made by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd was later amended to 4 aircraft by letter dated 7 October 1957. Ansett Transport Industries Ltd confirmed the request for 4 Electras on 4 November 1957. The then Director-General of Civil Aviation recommended on 26 November 1957 to the then Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Shane</inline> Paltridge, that the import permits be issued. This recommendation was approved but advice was not passed to AT I because the 1957 airlines agreement was under debate in Parliament. This agreement was approved on 12 December 1957. At that time Qantas Airways Ltd had an option on 6 Electras. Tasman Empire Airways had 3 positions held for early 1960 but did not have a formal option. Trans-Australiann Airlines had no order for Electras but had advice from Lockheed that it could have two for delivery in July and August 1959. On 3 December 1957 TAA applied for permission to import 2 </para>
          <para class="block">Caravel les. On 26 March 1958 the Cabinet approved the purchase of Electras by Qantas, but An set tana and TAA were to be advised that the purchase of Electras and Caravelles respectively could not be approved because the marginal economic conditions of the airline industry could be thrown into a state of serious imbalance by such purchases. Both airlines were to be advised further that as pure jet operations were likely to add substantially to national air transportation costs and to the need for accelerated airport development Cabinet should not be expected to approve the introduction of this type of aircraft into domestic service for some years to come. I should point out- this bears very much on the question raised by the honourable member and some honourable members will know that the Caravelle was a pure jet and the Electra was a prop jet requiring different requirements in facilities at airports and the like. </para>
          <para>Approval was given at that time for the import of four 800 series Vis counts to An set tana. Both airlines were to be advised that Cabinet would give favourable consideration to any reasonable request for the purchase of additional 800 series Vis counts. These decisions were as recommended by the Department and put to Cabinet by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge.</inline> I have to say that on reading the files at that point, it is quite clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> was opposed to the purchase of the Caravel les because of the advice he had received from the Department that they were unsuitable on the long stretch to Western Australia. He was vigorously opposed to the Electras because it was in prospect that if Ansett were to be granted the Electras at that point Ansett would have an advantage in selling seats over TAA which would have had the Vis counts only and which had not taken up an option or sought to take up an option to purchase Electras. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> M. Ansett, as he was then, sought to have the Government decision changed to permit his company to import Electras. Again the files make it clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett, as he is now, was very keen to gain that very advantage I spoke about by the purchase of Electras. He thought it would put An set tana up to a capacity equal to or better than TAA. </para>
          <para>So we come then to the critical period. A series of conferences followed, including one between the Ministers for Civil Aviation of Australia and New Zealand and one between the Prime Minister and the Chairmen of Ansett and TAA. At a conference held in Canberra on 9 May 1958 between representatives of the airlines and the Government the Government's policy to avoid a competitive equipment race for a multiplicity of jet types was explained to the domestic airlines. It is quite clear that the representatives of the airlines agreed then to purchase the Electras. The position as I have explained it is supported by the public statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett of, I think, last week. </para>
          <para>The then Minister for Civil Aviation announced on 22 May 1958 the Government's decision, after reviewing all the factors affecting the various applications by major airlines for licences to import new aircraft, to approve the purchase of the following Lockheed Electra turbo-prop airliners: Qantas was to get four; An set tana two and TAA two. It was further announced that it had been agreed that Tasman Empire Airways Limited should re-equip with 3 Electras. I am totally satisfied that there is nothing in the files that in any way impugns the reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Shane</inline> Paltridge. Indeed, quite the contrary, on reading the files it is quite clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> followed very closely, right through, the advice given to him by his Department. As I said, it is a bit hard to understand why the Leader of the Opposition should embark upon an exercise of this nature when in fact he was Prime Minister and had 3 years either to hold a public inquiry, if he had such doubts as he expressed the week before last, or to call for the files. </para>

              <para>- It is no good the Leader of the Opposition hiding behind the Church Committee or any other committee. He had a duty to investigate during his period as Prime Minister the allegations he has raised in the last weeks. If he had information in his little heart over the period of years when he was Prime Minister and he did nothing about it he reflects upon his own credibility and does nothing more nor less than that. The Leader of the Opposition could have had an investigation into this matter at any time. He could have set it up with his own terms of reference and done anything about it he liked. He chose not to do so. In fact he chose the contrary, to wait until he was back in Opposition, when he was no doubt looking for some way of covering up some other matter, and then to embark upon one of the worst mud-slinging exercises this Parliament has ever known. It is certainly the worst since I have been a member of this Parliament and I have seen one or two experts at the business of mud-slinging. He was prepared to attack the integrity of a man who cannot answer for himself. He was prepared to impugn that man's integrity and honesty and to cause worry to his family. This is what the </para>

            <para>- I think the honourable gentleman overlooks the fact that the prime target for this Government is to overcome inflation. I also believe that an increasing number of members within the trade union movement and an increasing number of people on the shop floor recognise that that is an essential prerequisite for the maintenance of their standard of living. It is not insignificant that major leaders in the trade union movement, and some people who hold not insignificant positions in the organisation of the party to which the honourable gentleman belongs, have supposed a position that is somewhat less than the one hat the honourable gentleman supports in relation to wage indexation. That has been done on fie basis of responsibility and concern for the future of Australia. We have to have a situation h which all Australians are prepared to cooper at in breaking the back of inflation. I believe that a great number of responsible members of the trade union movement wish that objective to be pursued and want to co-operate in realising it. The decisions which I announced in broad outline, but which the Treasurer and other Ministers will announce in detail, give, as I indicated last night, an unparalleled opportunity to break inflation in this country and get Australia moving and provide jobs for those who want 10 work. If the honourable gentleman had been a little more concerned for jobs and less concerned for politics he might have given some credit to that aim. </para>

              <para>-The Prime Minister served notice last night on the Australian people that Medibank will be destroyed. There is no way he can disguise his intentions. There is no point in evasion or in mincing words. Medibank, as we know it, is to go. One of the greatest social reforms in Australia's history- the most important single achievement of the Labor Governments marked for destruction. The Prime Minister will convince no one in the House or outside it, supporter or critic, by saying as he did again and again in answer to questions without notice today from both sides of the House that we must wait till Thursday night for details. This is one more breach- and the worst so far- of Liberal election promises. During the election campaign the Prime Minister gave repeated undertakings that Medibank would be preserved. Innumerable instances can be cited of the Prime Minister promising to maintain Medibank. I will give just one. On 9 December, after the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker-</inline> revealed that Medibank would be reviewed under a Fraser government, the caretaker Prime Minister said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>I have said repeatedly that essential programs in health, education, welfare and urban development will be maintained. Medibank will be maintained. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister went further. He insisted that a Liberal government would not keep Medibank in name only but would preserve the basic concept of the scheme. The Prime Minister not only said this throughout the election campaign right up to the concluding days of the election campaign but he also repeated it after the election was over. </para>
          <para>In particular I ask honourable members to read the interview that he gave on 3 February last to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review.</inline> I will quote the essential parts of the question put by the editor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maximilian</inline> Walsh, and the reply by the Prime Minister. The question reads:  . . . You frequently use the expression 'essential' to say that we will not cut them back below the essential level ... in respect of health care ... 1 just wonder whether you have any feelings, whether your essential was a blanket essential or whether it had a cut-off point. </para>
          <para class="block">The answer reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Well, you've got to look at it against a commitment to maintain Medibank and that's not just a verbal use of the term Medibank. 1 think the concept of Medibank was endorsed. </para>
            <para>I think a short answer to your question is that, yes, there is a commitment under Medibank to the total community . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister's statement last night reveals that the central concept of Medibank- free universal health insurance- will be dismantled. The Government has caved in to the private health fund lobby. It will force millions of Australians to return to the private funds. This is the plain meaning of the statement that people will be given 'an element of choice'. He repeated that phrase, 'element of choice', in question time today. Some choice there will be! Medibank will be made so expensive for many taxpayers that they will have to take out private insurance or risk leaving their families without protection. Medibank- intended as a full, automatic free service for all Australians, the birthright of all Australian citizens, the entitlement of every migrant to Australia- will become a second-best welfare scheme for a minority only. Health insurance will be divided into public and private sectors. The division will create inevitable social divisions in the community itself. All the inequalities and injustices, all the competitive snob be ries and wasted energies built into our education system will be perpetuated in health insurance. </para>
          <para>The concept of universal health insurance has been repeatedly endorsed by the Australian people. It has been the policy of the Australian Labor Party since 1968. It was first put to the voters in the 1969 election, when it was the central issue. It attracted enormous popular support. It was endorsed again by the people in 1972 and in 1974 when they elected and re-elected a </para>
          <para class="block">Labor Government. It was endorsed again in the 1975 election when both sides in the Parliament undertook to preserve Medibank. The Liberals are now welching on that undertaking. Medibank is to join the long list of broken Fraser promises- no double taxation, support for wage indexation, maintenance of home loan interest deductibility, abolition of the means test, automatic and immediate pension adjustments. The attack on Medibank was concealed during the Liberal election campaign. So were the Liberal Party's other threats and cutbacks- cutbacks in the Children's Commission, cuts in foreign aid, threats to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, higher pharmaceutical charges, reductions in drug supplies for the chronically ill, the abandonment of the housing corporation with its help for low income families, the abolition of funeral benefits for pensioners, penal clauses against unions, a campaign of harassment and intimidation of those on the dole and restoration of radio and television licence fees. </para>
          <para>The broken promise on Medibank is destroying the last vestige of goodwill possessed by this Government. How can any government which attacks Medibank seriously appeal to employees to moderate their wage demands or expect unions to co-operate m furthering economic recovery? The Liberal record on Medibank has been one of utter cynicism and irresponsible obstruction right from the outset. The Liberals opposed Labor's original proposal for a levy on all taxpayers. They blocked the original Medibank Bills in the Senate. When these became the basis of a double dissolution in 1974 the people voted for Medibank in the subsequent election. The Liberals persisted in wanton, reckless, blind obstruction. They rejected the basic Medibank Bills again in the Senate. The Bills were finally passed at the Joint Sitting of Parliament in the middle of 1974. Frustrated by the people's decision the Liberals proceeded to obstruct the machinery Bills needed to implement Medibank. That is why they blocked the levy- not from any logical or reasoned opposition on grounds of principle, but in a furious attempt to block Medibank itself. When my Government set up the scheme on a different financial basis the anti-Labor States resisted it to the last. They joined the doctors and the conservative health funds in a rearguard action. They resisted the hospital side of the scheme while it became obvious from the success of Medibank in the Labor States that no State could afford to be without it. </para>
          <para>Despite this unparalleled record of hostility to Medibank the Liberals maintained the pretence that they would keep Medibank if they came to office. They went on deceiving the electorate. Last September the present Prime Minister went so far as to discipline his official spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp),</inline> for daring to suggest publicly that Medibank would be scrapped if the Liberals came to power. The honourable member was being more honest on this subject than his Leader has ever been. He let the cat out of the bag. He was forced to recant at a Party meeting a few days later. The then Leader of the Opposition was forced to cover up. When it comes to Medibank the Liberals can never be trusted. We need only look at their record. In the late 1940s, as a result of the Chifley Labor Government's policies, every State in Australia secured a free hospital system. When the Liberals got in they broke off these agreements with the States after the double dissolution in 1951 and they made the people pay for their hospital treatment in standard wards. The only State that kept its free hospitals going was Queensland- and that was due to a State Labor Government at the time. Eventually, even the present discredited Queensland Government accepted the Medibank hospital scheme. It fell into line with the other States which had fought Medibank for so long. The Liberals in Canberra destroyed one Medibank scheme before; now they are trying again. </para>
          <para>Even when he announces the end of Medibank the Prime Minister lacks the courage to spell out his intentions. He resorts to verbiage and evasion. He goes on asserting that the 'essential elements' of the schemes will be preserved but gives no definition of 'essential'. This was the subterfuge used in the election campaign when he conned people into believing that Medibank would remain. I warned of this deception at the time. My warnings were justified. </para>
          <para>What justification can there be for attacking Medibank? We all remember the evils and weaknesses of the old system- the multiplicity of inefficient and competing private funds, the waste, the plight of a million or more Australians who had no health insurance at all. People talk glibly and without evidence of 'rip-offs' and 'swindles' under Medibank. Does anyone imagine that doctors were not exploiting the old system? Of course they were. Inevitably there were loopholes in Medibank which need to be closed. My Government was doing this. Medibank was working well. As the Melbourne  Age said  yesterday in an editorial: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Contrary to the critics' expectations, and in spite of some abuses by a few doctors, Medibank has not turned out to be a wasteful extravagance. There are no signs of any significant increase in demand for doctors' services or standard ward hospital beds. Medibank claims are running below budgeted projections. Certainly some weaknesses have been exposed and some loopholes nave been exploited; none is difficult to remedy. If administrative costs are regarded as too high this is due mainly to the refusal of many doctors to bulk-bill and of major private funds to act as agents. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As the article points out, Canada's experience has shown that public health insurance schemes covering everyone can operate more economically than voluntary private funds. In 1973, in Canada for every dollar appropriated 97.7c was paid out in benefits; in the United States contributors to private funds had to pay $1.20 for every dollar's worth of benefits. Similarly, Canadians are paying less <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for public health, including universal health care, than United States citizens, who have no national health insurance scheme. </para>
          <para>I make it clear that the Opposition has no objection in principle to a levy for Medibank. After all, we sought to introduce one. But our levy would have fallen on every taxpayer in equal proportion. There would have been a ceiling of $150 payable by any taxpayer. It would not have driven higher income earners out of Medibank and created a dual system of health insurance. There would have been no opting out. Medibank would not have become a poor man's health fund for the infirm, the unemployed, the Aborigines and the migrants. It would not have been limited to the disadvantaged sections of the community. Labor does not believe in a 2 -class system of health insurance- one for the rich and one for the poor. We believe in full, automatic health insurance for everyone. </para>
          <para>It is humbug for the Government to complain about the growing cost of health care to the community. The community will pay a far greater cost in the long run if health care is neglected. The cost of health is increasing in every country in the world. These rising costs have nothing to do with Medibank. The community has to pay these charges whether they are met by the public or the private sector. The only way the ultimate cost can be reduced is by making the method of insurance as economical and efficient as possible. This can only be achieved by a single national fund. This is the real purpose of Medibank. By undermining the basis of Medibank and restoring health insurance to private funds, the Government is ensuring that the ultimate cost to the taxpayer, to business, to hospitals, to society at large will be greater. As the Jimmy Committee reported, the private funds are bureaucracies; they are not democracies. The members of the funds are not given the right to elect the directors, who are a self-perpetuating hierarchy. Through inaction by the Federal Government people are compelled to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more through compulsory insurance for health, third party claims and workers compensation than they would need to pay to a truly national scheme in each sector. The Prime Minister is placing his ideological obsessions, his hatred of the public sector, ahead of the community's needs. Merely to satisfy his prejudice against public initiative he is destroying one of the finest achievements of the Labor Government. He is condemning the Australian people to a more costly, more inefficient system of health insurance. He is creating needless social divisions in the community. He is ensuring that the better-off, privately insured patient will have immediate access to the best hospital and medical facilities while the poorer Medibank patient will receive inferior facilities. Australians have come to accept Medibank. The Governor-General, in his Speech opening the Parliament, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Medibank will be retained and the Government will ensure it operates efficiently. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government's intentions as revealed by the Prime Minister last night amount to a breach of this undertaking. The Government stands condemned for its deception, incompetence, disregard for the true health needs of the Australian people and its threatened destruction of a great social reform. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> commenced his address in this debate by saying: 'Medibank is about to be destroyed; Medibank is to go'. He chose to speculate and make assumptions and then to make out his case on those speculations and assumptions. It is characteristic of his misguided tactics- tactics that have proved to be disastrous to his own Party in the past. No doubt he hoped that, in any confusion he may generate, some political capital would flow to him and to his discredited Party. The Leader of the Opposition would have done his cause and the cause of his Party more credit if he had shown the patience to await an announcement of the Government's decisions in Parliament on Thursday. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> last night informed the Australian people that the Medibank Review Committee has been examining every aspect of the scheme. He assured the nation that it is not a question whether Medibank will be retained or not, because it certainly will be. The Prime Minister gave that assurance. He quite rightly raised the question how Medibank is to be financed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Australian Labor Party, when in office, had a scheme to finance Medibank by imposing a straight levy of 1.35 per cent of taxable income. The purpose of this levy was to provide 50 per cent of the cost of Medibank and the other 50 per cent was to come from Consolidated Revenue. The then Opposition opposed that idea, and quite rightly so, because all the straight levy would have done would have been to lock into Medibank the rapidly rising cost structure of health care in Australia. It would have provided no opportunity to stabilise rising doctors' fees or health costs. Under the Labor Party proposal or formula it would have required not a 1.35 per cent levy to meet the next financial year's expenditure but a levy of over 2 per cent to raise the $900m that would have been necessary to meet half the cost of the anticipated $ 1,800m expenditure to cover Medibank in the next financial year. Such a proposal would have shown no regard or preferential treatment for the lower income earners, especially with the application of a ceiling, because this in fact would have protected higher income earners and would have put the great burden of the levy on those who had to pay the full amount under such a levy. As the Prime Minister said last night, high quality health care for all Australians is plainly very expensive. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that payment of health costs should be made in a way that can be seen by the doctors and the individuals concerned. The Government has consistently made it plain that Medibank will be retained, that the principle of universal coverage for health care will be retained, that there will be no means test at the point of service, but because of Medibank 's great expense and because of alleged abuses, rip-offs and overuse, we have always reserved the right to review its operations and methods of financing the scheme. In paying for Medibank the Government will make sure that the poorest people in the community do not have to make any payment. The Prime Minister said again last night: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Those further up the income scale will still have very heavily subsidised cover under Medibank. Those who are better off still will be paying much more nearly the full cost of what Medibank provides. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It will be well for the House to know something of the escalation of health costs and health care in Australia. Sure, Medibank in its present form has achieved universal coverage, but it also has some very serious weaknesses. Medibank has achieved universal coverage in its present form at the expense of very largely disregarding the need for economy and efficiency in overall health care expenditure by the individual and the community. It provides few incentives to economy in the use of health services either on the part of the consumer or, more particularly, on the part of the medical profession which has a key role in determining overall health costs. </para>
          <para>In its present form Medibank places on the State and Federal governments virtually the whole responsibility for financing the basic level of hospital and medical insurance. It does this not only for those who need assistance with their health care costs but also for those who can afford to pay for themselves. While funds for health services flowed from both the public and private sectors, the share of the burden accepted by the public sector has grown sharply in recent years- from 52 percent between 1963 and 1970, to 57 per cent in 1972-73 and to an estimated 74 per cent in 1975-76. Within the public sector the Commonwealth's share has risen from 55 per cent in 1972-73 to an estimated 73 per cent in 1975- 76. Not only has the Commonwealth's share grown quickly but also the actual amount of expenditure has risen from $260m in 1963-64 to an estimated $2,500m in 1975-76, which represents an increase of about 1000 per cent in a 12-year period. At the same time the State expenditure has risen from $20 1 m to $950m and private expenditure from $4 18m to $ 1,200m. Total expenditures on health in Australia are estimated at $4,700m in 1 975-76 and $5,400m in 1976- 77. The largest proportion of total expenditure, that is 54 per cent, goes on public and private institutional care- $202m goes to general hospitals; $107m goes to mental hospitals; $348m goes to nursing homes; and $1 17m goes to miscellaneous institutions. Another 42 per cent is spent on pharmaceutical goods, medical appliances and private medical and dental services. </para>
          <para>It is against this background of mounting expenditure for the treatment of the sick and a growing incidence of abuse and over use of medical services that the Government has reviewed the operations of Medibank. Any government that did not look at the total rising cost structure and analyse whether in fact every dollar spent is being spent wisely and that the health of the community has improved as a result, would be failing in its duty. One of the great factors that has been contributing to increasing costs of health care in Australia has been the rising costs in the medical profession itself. The Government has honoured its electoral commitments on Medibank as events will establish. However, it is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to see no occasion to control costs or to attempt to achieve efficiency in health care to the advantage of the general public and certainly to the advantage of the more disadvantaged sections of the community. The former Labor Government's irresponsible and crazy record during its 3 years of office earned it the humiliating defeat that it deserved on 13 December last year. The present Government has set to work to re-establish some stability, some sanity in Government spending in order to restore and maintain one of the highest standards of living in the world. </para>
          <para>Our task has not been easy. As most people would know, it is easy to destroy; it is harder to build. Labor's policies were destroying the economic stability of Australia and thus threatening its social structure. The present Government is committed to rebuilding Australia so that there is job security for the people, production of wealth and social security in a real sense for the people. Notwithstanding the enormous task confronting the Government in restoring economic stability, the Government is not about to destroy Medibank or universal health coverage. Therefore I submit that the matter of public importance brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition is based on assumption. It is a nonsense, and the Government rejects it. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> is a man who prides himself on being as good as his word. He has just broken another promise. Before the election he said very clearly in his policy statement: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>We will maintain Medibank and ensure that the standard of health care does not decline. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Parliament is now preparing to watch the dismemberment of the Medibank concept. What is left of the carcass will not be recognisable; only the name will be. It seems that the Prime Minister is satisfied that he has fulfilled his commitment to the Australian electorate merely by retaining the name 'Medibank'. This is not the first of the undertakings given to the Australian electorate by the Prime Minister which, within a short period of assuming office, he has completely jettisoned. </para>
          <para>Before I go to the substance of other remarks I want to make, let me attend to some of the comments of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> He asserted quite falsely- he would know quite falsely from his experience in debates in this House and from the points which he made when we were the Government- that the levy of 1.35 per cent on taxable income which we originally proposed to apply was aimed at raising half of the cost of Medibank. He was one of a number of Liberal-Country Party speakers who pointed out that we had- we had done so consciously retreated from the original proposition and that a 1.35 per cent levy on taxable income would raise only about 40 per cent of the total cost. We accepted that. We accepted that the greater the proportion of the total cost which was funded from general revenue, the more equitably the cost would be distributed between income groups because a progressive tax burden associated with general revenue raising is a much fairer and more equitable system of raising income than a flat percentage level which, in turn, is a much fairer and more equitable system of raising income than the old discredited and totally unsatisfactory system of private health insurance whereby a flat poll tax was imposed on all those who desired to join the funds- and there were not many who had anything but a sense of necessity because there was no alternative. </para>
          <para>The Minister said, again quite falsely and wilfully so, that our scheme paid no attention to low income earners, that they were not regarded. They were exempted specifically from making any contribution under the original proposal for a levy for the Medibank program. He went on to assert the virtue of what is to be proposed under the dismembered program of Medibank namely, that members of the public will be better for being able to see that they are making a payment to the Medibank concept as it survives. As a general statement maybe there is something to support that proposition, but not a levy so severe that the public will groan under its burden, not a program that will be so cruel in the way in which the cost burden falls that there will be massive dissatisfaction in the Australian community. </para>
          <para>He went on to renew another old, tired and totally dis proven fallacy about the alleged abuses and ripoffs which have flourished under Medibank. The fact is that the abuses and ripoffs flourished under the old system of private health insurance. The Minister will recall that in the first medical fees review tribunal there were startling disclosures of the way in which pathologists were ripping off on a massive scale and paying commission rates on a very generous basis to private practitioners who over-utilised in referring pathology tests to particular laboratories. That happened under the old scheme. Under Medibank, with the sort of utilisation profiles which can be accumulated by the Medibank computer, it is possible to identify exactly where this abuse is occurring, to sheet home the responsibility and to take effective action to prevent it in future. If honourable members doubt the force of that argument they ought to look at the experience in </para>
          <para class="block">Canada where the capacity to divulge these sorts of utilisation profiles- not to identify particular medical practitioners- led to a salutary contraction in the rate of growth of this sort of utilisation. </para>
          <para>The Minister asserts, again falsely, that Medibank places the full burden of health insurance on to State governments and the Federal Government. While it is true to say that the State and Federal governments are meeting costs which, in a significant proportion in the past, were met by the public directly, the fact is that the total cost is still being met by the same people- the taxpayers in the community. The virtue of Medibank is that it raises money more efficiently, distributes it more efficiently and does not waste money on clumsy administrative requirements or on ripoffs for people in private health insurance funds who like to fiddle about the city with investment and grab whatever influence and prestige that may or may not give to them. The fact is that the States do not meet more of the outlay than they would have met before. By and large the SO so formula is represented to the States. In the case of Queensland in a full financial year the amount is $60m. The public hospitals system in the States of this Commonwealth could not have continued to function much longer without the advent of Medibank. If the Minister or anyone else wants to know, the State Health Ministers, regardless of their political affiliations, urged me to enter into long-term contracts with them on the cost sharing formula because they did not trust their colleagues in the coalition parties and they feared that if they came into office this would be one of the first agreements to be destroyed. That is why in all cases the agreements are long term. </para>
          <para>The Minister fiddled about with statistics which are totally meaningless. Unfortunately, I do not think he realised how meaningless they are. Of course the cost of health care in Australia, in any way in which one likes to look at it, has increased enormously in the last decade. It has increased faster than the rate of growth in national expenditure, faster than the rate of growth in the national product. But this is not a novel experience for this country. Every advanced country is experiencing the same problem. This rate of escalation was unleashed long before Medibank came into operation. In fact the existence of this rapid escalation and the problems it portended for the future were substantial reasons why Medibank had to be brought in. Medibank meant that money could be spent more efficiently and that the same total volume of money could be spread further and could provide adequate attention for all people in the community. </para>
          <para>Let us be clear on what is being proposed. The public is not going to be saved in any way at all. The proposals of the Government are to shift a large amount of the funding on to individual income earners in the community. The Prime Minister said last night: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Those who are better off still will be paying much more nearly the full cost of what Medibank provides. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Nearly paying the full cost of Medibank would represent a levy of somewhere near 3 per cent of taxable income. So we are talking about a range of levy probably between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent of taxable income. This comes from the coalition parties which declaimed in such a falsely virtuous style when in Opposition up until last December their complete repugnance of the proposition that there should be any levy at all. On average, their levy will be more than twice as high as the levy the previous Government was proposing as a proportion of taxable income. As far as one can calculate from the inferences of the Prime Minister's statement and from the informed comment of the Press, it means an increase in personal tax of up to 20 per cent because, make no mistake about it, people paying this earmarked contribution are adding to total revenue. It is an increase in tax. Indexation will not give that sort of tax relief. </para>
          <para>Finally, because time is running out, I pose a pertinent question which the Prime Minister could not understand at question time today: What happens when inflation becomes more tractable? The rate of increase in inflation drops considerably. This means that indexation- the rate of reduction in the otherwise increased tax burden- will be much less than the rate of increase in total tax which will arise as a result of the Medibank levy. Is it proposed by the Government that the Medibank levy should be indexed too, or is the devious effect sought by the Government to increase the total tax collection at a rate higher than would otherwise be achieved if indexation worked right across the spectrum of personal tax contribution? The public is about to be conned. The coalition Government has turned its back on every virtue it espoused in Opposition. It is the high cost Government, the high tax Government. If the full benefit of indexation is not provided in the forthcoming Budget it will represent a reduction in consumption in the community. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government's commitments on Medibank- I will refer to them later- are quite clear. The Government has been quite sincere and consistent in the attitude which it has taken. This will be revealed on Thursday. The Opposition has shown itself to be too eager by far in listing this matter for debate today. Honourable members opposite were told quite clearly that a full statement would be made on Thursday. So anything they say today is pure conjecture and will only add to the confusion which the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford),</inline> suggested last night was the result of the statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> Honourable members opposite themselves are deliberately adding to this confusion. </para>
          <para>One may ask what is the real reason for the Opposition's bringing on this debate today. After a week's recess honourable members opposite felt that they would be failing in their duty if they did not propose a matter of public importance by which to criticise the Government. A lot of rumours have been floating around Parliament House in the last day or two as to what the Opposition would actually produce today. It cannot use the subject of East Timor again because in the recent debate in this House initiated by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> the division between the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> on this important issue of East Timor was shown clearly. There is a split within the Australian Labor Party on that subject. It was also rumoured that the Opposition would move a censure motion in relation to the economy. Why did honourable members opposite not do that? I would say that they did not do it because any argument they put forward about the ills of the economy could be neatly and easily turned around and put back at their door for having caused the present ills in the economy. It was said that the Opposition would censure the Government on the Prime Minister's statement last night, on the whole statement, not just one section of it. Why did the Opposition not bring that up for debate today when it was there very clearly? </para>

              <para>- If he said nothing, why did the Opposition pick out a part of it today for debate? Honourable members opposite, on their own words, are debating nothing. Therefore the point that the Government has no case to answer is substantiated. If honourable members opposite were to bring up the Prime Minister's statement today it could be turned around and used against them because obviously what he said last night is common sense for the future of Australia. The other matter which we are all waiting to hear about from the Opposition side is the overseas loans affair. Why did honourable members opposite not bring that matter up? The reason is obvious. It is because any further debate on the overseas loans affair would only produce further revelations of the misdeeds of the previous Government in this regard and further damaging publicity on its activities. </para>

          <para>The Opposition is endeavouring to use Medibank as an emotional issue. It is attempting to cloud the facts and to confuse the people of Australia. One does not only have to use today's debate to realise that fact. The Opposition introduced an earlier debate on this same subject on 19 February. The subject of the matter of public importance debated on that day was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Conflicting statements by Government spokesmen on the future of Medibank and their failure to specify how the scheme will continue to operate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Members of the Opposition are over-anxious. They will hear all this on Thursday. Instead of them waiting for that announcement we already have had 2 ill-timed debates on this proposal which is particularly important for all Australians. If members of the Opposition are sincere in wanting to debate Medibank why do they not wait until after Thursday when the facts will be known and they will have a basis for debate instead of busily throwing their conjectures around at the present time. </para>
          <para>I want to refer to the central point of this debate raised by the Opposition- its claim that the Government has failed to honour its election commitment. The Prime Minister had said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We will maintain Medibank, and ensure that the standard of health care does not decline. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One should remember the second part of that statement, that the standard of health care will not decline, as well as the first part. As the Prime Minister said last night, it was in danger of declining for the most underprivileged section of our community because of increasing competition for standard wards beds, the only hospital accommodation for such people. Other people should have a greater choice. In the program <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> on 28 November last year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Well keep Medibank but we didn't say it would be unchanged. We want to make quite sure that Medibank does not lower the health standards available to people in Australia and Tor the poorer people in particular, those who would have got priority in standard ward beds in public hospitals before, they now get no priority, they can't afford to go to private hospitals, they have to take their queue with everyone else for the standard ward beds in public hospitals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If one reads through all the statements made by the Prime Minister, both before the election last December and since, one cannot say that he has been anything else but remarkably consistent in the attitude he has taken- that Medibank will be retained but there will be changes. </para>
          <para>What are the basic features of Medibank? The first is that there is universal and automatic cover for those who desire it, particularly those who cannot afford any other choice. The second is that there is no means test for these people. It was obvious from the statement made last night that the basis and whole being of Medibank will continue unchanged. What is different? Let us read between the lines of what the Prime Minister said last night about what is to happen in regard to a revised Medibank and what would have happened under the original scheme of the Labor Government. Under both forms of Medibank the poorer sections of the community would be covered at no cost. I refer to the people whose incomes fall below the tax level. The next group of people would be partly subsidising Medibank and would be partly subsidised by it. There is to be no difference for that group. The basic difference is that the Labor Government aimed to kill the religious and private hospitals in this country and, under the rules of the Medibank game that it was playing, people would be forced from that form of hospital accommodation and would have to join the queue of people waiting for standard ward accommodation in this country. </para>
          <para>As I see the situation the only change being proposed is that people in Australia who want the freedom to choose religious or private hospital accommodation will be better able to achieve that wish. At the same time they will not put undue pressure on standard ward accommodation to the detriment of the poor. The Opposition says that the Government is introducing a dual system. It was the Opposition, the Labor Party, which introduced a dual system by which an elitist or very wealthy group had a disproportionate share of the health care resources of this country. If honourable members want examples of how this is happening they should consider the situation in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The Government's proposal will maintain a healthy balance in providing health care in this country. </para>
          <para>Private or religious organisations own 20 per cent of all hospital beds in this country and if they are forced to close, and some are on the brink of being closed at present because of Medibank, there will be an enormous charge on the taxpayers of our society to replace those hospital beds. Those beds would not be replaced immediately; it would take years. We would lose the services of these people who had made health care their vocation. The Opposition could never guarantee that those hospital beds would have come into the standard ward system. The existence of these hospitals provides a freedom of choice. They illustrate cost effectiveness in health care and they should be preserved. </para>
          <para>Members of the Opposition talk about levies and total payment in our society. They should look at the capital cost as well as the running cost required to continue the present Medibank system on that basis. People who say that there is no need to change Medibank are not aware of the situation. They are not aware of problems associated with pathology, workers compensation, phantom patients claimed by some doctors and over-usage of outpatient departments. I could continue my remarks along those lines. If I have any criticism to offer about what the Government may be doing it is that it would appear that it is more concerned in arguing the financing of health care on an illness basis than expending money to provide good health in this country. I hope that when the decision on Medibank is made and announced there will be an opportunity to channel some of the funds that go into illness care to illness prevention in order that there will be a better cost effective basis. </para>
          <para>The Government has no case to answer. I believe that the Opposition has a lot of questions to answer. It is trying to confuse the issue for the people of Australia at the present time. Why does it not bring forward for discussion as matters of public importance such subjects as the situation in East Timor, the economy, the Prime Minister and the overseas loans affair? The answer is quite obvious. The Opposition is discredited and has no proposals for the future. </para>

However we want to ensure that Ministers do not interrupt the adjournment debate but are not denied some opportunity to respond, if need be, as a result of matters canvassed during the adjournment debate. The procedure has been used on very few occasions since it was introduced. It is not intended by the Government that it should be abused but rather that it should be available for use if necessity requires.

            <para>-The Opposition again opposes this proposition but we do not intend to divide on the motion because that would be pointless. We agree that this procedure has not been properly tried at this stage but when it comes up for consideration we would like to see some safeguards built into the proposition that Ministers have an additional 10 minutes in which to speak. I think Ministers should be restricted to answering matters which fall within their ministerial responsibilities. This is the main reason for the Opposition opposing this particular proposal. We do not like sitting duck propositions where 2 Ministers can get up one after the other and take advantage of an opportunity to make political speeches. That is something which I think will eventually be discussed by the Standing Orders Committee. The Opposition opposes this proposal but we do not intend to divide at this stage. </para>

          <para>- I think it ill becomes the Leader of the House to indicate that the Opposition is not co-operating in the Government 's program. It has been noticeable that in almost all debates the Government is listing possibly 2 speakers to each one for the Opposition. Some debates have obviously been very protracted. We do not object to that. We think that debates should be, but if the Government's program is tight then it is up to the Government to make sure that its own members meet the Government's commitments. The Government should not ask the Opposition to drop out while the Government continues to list more and more speakers. </para>

          <para>- I am resuming this debate from when this matter was last before the House about 10 days ago, when I spoke for some 4 minutes. As there has been this break of more than a week I return to the introductory speech made on behalf of the Opposition by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford),</inline> the distinguished member who is the shadow Treasurer. He will be responsible for the Opposition's main economic speeches and statements of policy during these next several years prior to the next general election. Having regard to the background of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> I am most interested in some of the comments that the honourable member for Adelaide made. I ought to explain this by saying that it is well known in this House that the honourable member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, is a man very interested in history. He is extremely interested in European history. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>People may recall that on the defeat of the McMahon Government in 1972, on 2 December on that year, the now Leader of the Opposition was heard to announce to the spellbound people of Australia that this was a great anniversary. It was the anniversary of the Battle of Austerlitz, when a distinguished Cor sian general masquerading as a French emperor inflicted enormous casualties upon the armies of Russia, Prussia and Austria. Here was this manifestation of the Leader's intense interest in European history, in the use of an historical reference that would impress those people in our country less familiar with the details of European history than the honourable gentleman is. I find that the most reliable form of praise is imitation. The future Treasurer of a Labor Government is using words in the opening speech on a debate of this nature that I can only describe as rather crass and, to my mind, a little absurd. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In opening this debate on these 2 Appropriation Bills, I am bound to mention the occasion when Appropriation Bills were last before this Parliament. I am referring of course to Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) which eventually were passed by the Senate, after a damaging delay, on that infamous <inline font-style="italic">coup d'etat</inline> day, 1 1 November 1975. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am hoping that the honourable member for Adelaide will go back to his history teacher, the Leader of the Opposition, and ask him to be painstaking, to be serious in his revelation of his knowledge of history and to tell him of the last occasion when what is called a <inline font-style="italic">coup d'etat</inline> in the French language was followed within a period of 4 weeks by a general election. Here is a clear manifestation of the Labor Party technique, bereft of integrity as it is, unencumbered by conscience, as is well known, of describing events in dramatic terms which are the grossest misrepresentations. </para>
        <para>It was utter drivel for those honourable gentlemen to refer to the events of last November as a <inline font-style="italic">coup d'etat.</inline> It was in fact a judgment that resulted in the Constitution of Australia functioning properly, functioning so as to permit the electors of Australia, at an appropriate time, there having been a block- a complete confrontation between the Senate and the House of Representatives- to make up their minds and to cast their decision. There is nothing further from the truth than the words of the Australian Labor Party speakers who describe that series of events as a <inline font-style="italic">coup d'etat.</inline> In fact when that French emperor of whom the Leader of the Opposition is so keen to speak found himself in a situation where he was to be elevated from the position of consul-general or something of that nature and to be crowned an emperor, he was rather like the Leader of the Opposition, so fascinated with power that, to the amazement of all present, from the hands of the Pope he grabbed the crown and put it on his own head. I cannot help feeling in this context that on those occasions when the Leader of the Opposition was addressing the rowdy people who had surrounded him on 1 1 November he rather felt in those circumstances that he had been crowned and had lost the crown. A further statement that was made by the  speaker  leading for the Opposition, the honourable member for Adelaide, was this: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The stark fact is that a parliamentary democracy anywhere is a system which requires tolerance on the part of those operating it if it is to survive. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I would have thought that the history of parliamentary democracy over the last five or six hundred years in the countries that speak the English language or the French language has proved that that statement historically is utterly wrong. In fact, parliamentary democracy has survived in circumstances of conflict, where in the United Kingdom a king had his head chopped off and in the United States of America, as it became on the North American continent, colonists were prepared to rise in rebellion and establish themselves as people prepared to operate the parliamentary system as they saw it. </para>
        <para>There is no evidence that parliamentary democracy is a fragile system. The honourable member for Adelaide said that it is a fickle flower and a fragile mechanism. If the Labor Party had any real reasons for complaint it might be kind enough to explain after these extraordinary words at this extraordinary opening of this debate why it has in its platform a portion which states that its aim is to destroy the Senate, to take away from the States the right of representation in a house in which all the States are equal. Why should the Labor Party do such a thing? Is its ambition to concentrate all power in the House of Representatives, to destroy the Constitution? This has again and again been made clear by the Leader of the Opposition and appears to be confirmed by the Opposition's future Treasurer in so many of his comments. </para>
        <para>I hope that his reference to codifying the Constitution and making it clear to the Australian people will be looked at by the Government and that it will not be possible for those pseudo great men, interpreters of the Constitution who wish to misrepresent the facts, to put the Governor-General into a position where his situation is falsified. The fact of the matter is that, in spite of these complaints, the Governor-General personally was appointed by the Labor Party Government, and the speech that was made on his appointment by the Labor Party's Prime Minister, the honourable member for Werriwa, was full of praise. When that jurist came to a conclusion that he had reached the stage at which a decision had to be made that the question would be put to the Australian people so that they could make their decision, he made it because he had no alternative. This constant barrage and attack, fostered within the ranks of those who espouse socialism and the brotherhood of mankind, that has followed the Governor-General around this community in the last 6 months has been disgraceful in the extreme and by no means anything of which the Opposition as a political party should be proud. </para>
        <para>I turn now to some of the other comments that have been made that have aroused great interest in this debate and in particular to the comments of my colleague and friend from Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> I believe that there ought to be a statement from the Treasurer of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> dealing with this particular matter. I refer to the reference of the honourable member for Mackellar to the deficit as set out by the Treasury, to the deficit as admitted by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in the Labor Party Government, the deficit which has excited so much concern in Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar said that the effective deficit as at the end of March was not the $4.95 billion of which the Treasury speaks; in terms of the use of central bank credit it was $ 1 . 1 90 billion. We use that word 'billion' in the American fashion, as representing one thousand million dollars. He said that even this deficit is mythical because if one looks at the last Treasurer's statement one will see that on his estimates no less than $4.8 billion worth of capital works were included in the Federal Budget and charged in as part of this mythical deficit. I believe that this ought to be clarified for the House of Representatives and that there ought to be a serious statement so that we can have at least some criticism from my friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> who was Treasurer some time ago, or some explanation how it is that these investments can be so included if they are going in fact to affect what we call the domestic deficit. Then someone might explain- I do not think one would need Professor Friedman to help one how inflation has so grown in Australia that we have a resultant diminution in the value of all of the assets of our people, of all those people who have worked for decades, for 20 or 30 years or more and who are watching their assets being diminished in Australia at more than 10 per cent per annum. They are aware of the fact that all the contributions that they have put away to help them in their years of retirement are diminishing in value at that rate. Surely it must be possible for these points to be clarified. I think it is essential that it be done because I think that it is an impossible situation that we should find the integrity of the Treasury advisers to the Government being questioned in the House of Representatives with no recognition from the Ministers of State that this is taking place. </para>
        <para>I can recall the comments that were made during the Budget Speech of my friend from Melbourne Ports when he referred to the fact- 1 think it was in 1973- that it was an appropriate time for a transfer of assets from the private to the public sector. I believe that was what he said. There is another way that one can transfer assets from one sector to another sector. It does involve one with trouble with the police. It is called stealing. One moves into someone's home and says: 'I am transferring from your sector some assets to another sector which will be under my control'. In fact this is what Treasurers do when they take from people who live in this country assets which in fact are theirs, that they have spent a lifetime developing and accumulating, and transfer them to what is airily known as the public sector. Then we are told by someone with a very flexible mind and a very flexible sense of the truth that this means that the assets of the entire country- of all people living within the country- have been expanded by this transference from the private to the public sector. I have yet to meet the Australian citizen who can tell me that anything transferred from his sector to some government-owned, controlled and directed sector ever finds its way back to him. I do not believe it does. </para>
        <para>I believe, as I said at the commencement of my remarks, that honourable gentlemen opposite stand charged with having engaged in an extraordinary debate on economic matters in which they devoted an enormous amount of time to vituperative, impertinent and out of order references to the Queen's Representative in Australiatheir own appointment in any event. History will record that the honourable gentleman who was prepared to worship the victory of the Emperor Napoleon on 2 December 1 806 at Austerlitz was a conqueror who put his foot in a hole and fell flat on his face, where he properly belongs. </para>

          <para>-The final statement of the honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Graham)</inline> about an honourable member putting his foot in a hole and falling flat on his face makes it fairly obvious to many of us who know both him and the Governor-General why he was so keen to protect the Governor-General. It was because they have a lot in common, especially late in the evenings. I address myself to the Appropriation Bills which are before us for debate today. One of the points with which I shall deal concerns alleged savings by the Government. When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> introduced these Appropriation Bills he also presented a statement of savings expected in annual appropriations. The alleged total savings amount to in excess of $477m but let us examine closely what is involved in the proposed savings. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> during his election campaign and when refusing Supply last year talked about wasteful expenditure by the previous Government. Let us examine what the present Government has been able to save and in what areas. I point out in passing that of the savings of $477m an amount of $93m relates to savings on Medibank. But nothing really has been done because this amount arises from the proposed expenditure for the first year of Medibank not being as high as was estimated. I will give details of this aspect later. </para>
        <para>The Government has estimated a saving of $64m on the Childrens Commission by not establishing it, but of course the Government proposes an expenditure of $55m under Appropriations Bills (3) and (4) on an interim committee, which is the same sort of organisation. This is just a sleight of hand. Where, in fact, is the Government saving money? According to the statement of savings provided by the Treasurer an amount of almost $7m will be saved in respect of the Commonwealth Police. I submit that is not a true figure because I know that it has now been decided to replace Commonwealth police officers at many Commonwealth factories and other locations with locally recruited guards. The net result is that whatever is saved on the Commonwealth Police will be spent on guards who will be performing duties previously performed by the police. This is exactly what happened at the munitions factory at St Marys in my area. Some of the employees panicked because they thought that the removal of the Commonwealth Police was an indication that the munitions factory was about to close. I suggest that this is not a true saving but a transfer of expenditure from one department to another. </para>
        <para>It is proposed to save $20,000 in running expenses of the Institute of Family Studies. It is ridiculous to try to save such a small amount if by its expenditure some families could be prevented from breaking up with resultant deserted wives and children getting into trouble. An amount of $102,000 is to be saved by not appointing an Australian ombudsman, even though the Government said it would make such an appointment. Legislation was introduced by the previous Labor Government but nothing has been done about it. A sum of $210,000 is to be saved from expenditure on cadets. All honourable members will recall what was said about the cadet corps when Government supporters were in Opposition. It is proposed to save $ 1.75m on housing for servicemen through advances to the States. Money will not be given to the States to house servicemen. I ask honourable members to recall this Government's promises to servicemen. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the matter of education. This is important because the statement of savings shows not only where the Government proposes to save money but also how elitist it is. I should have hoped that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar),</inline> who is at the table, would have fought for more reasonable proposals, even though this matter is not directly under his administration. Expenditure on assistance for Vietnamese and Cambodian students is expected to be reduced by $80,000. In other words, 25 per cent of the money previously allocated to help these refugees is to be saved. This is an action by a government which was responsible for many of the refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia. It is proposed to save $276,000 on Aboriginal secondary grants. An amount of $7 1 ,500 is to be saved on Aboriginal study grants and $538,000 is to be saved on assistance for isolated children. There is to be a saving of $419,000 on the adult migrant education program and $983,400 on the child migrant educational program. It is proposed to save more than $4m on these aspects of education. The Government proudly announces these savings on education, especially as they affect Aborigines and migrants. </para>
        <para>In respect of the Universities Commission- an elitist organisation- the total saving is to be $6,750. I ask honourable members to compare that amount with the $4,047,900 to be saved on education generally, especially migrant education and the education of Aboriginal children. Of course we know why the Government has made such proposals- it represents people who benefit from being able to send their children to universities at no cost. The Government also proposes to save $940,000 in its payment of teaching subsidies to mission authorities in the Northern Territory. Honourable members can imagine how the churches would have screamed had the Labor Government reduced payments to the churches by $1,000. This Government is reducing its payments by more than $900,000 yet I have not heard any screams from the church authorities. Expenditure on the National Employment and Training scheme- the NEAT scheme- is to be reduced to result in a saving of $5. lm. A saving of $2m is to be made in expenditure on the Regional Employment Development scheme- the RED scheme- at a time when we have more unemployment than ever before. </para>
        <para>The interest subsidy to the Australian Housing Corporation is to be cut by more than $3m. What a way to save money. People will now have to pay more interest on their housing loans. Bilateral aid to Papua New Guinea is to be cut by $7.2m. Food aid through the Australian Development Assistance Agency by way of food grains is to be cut by $5.3m. This is happening because the Government knows it can sell food grains overseas. It is now suggested that we should be giving away beef cattle instead. A total saving of more than $l6m is estimated for the Department of Foreign Affairs, most of the savings- $ 14m- being achieved through the Australian Development Assistance Agency and not from savings on wasteful expenditure within the Department itself. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the proposed saving of $93m on the Health Insurance Commission. This Commission was established by Act of Parliament in 1973. Much of the discussion on Medibank has been focused, I am sorry to say, almost completely on the cost of financing it. We have the Prime Minister talking about everybody having to pay for Medibank. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> is speaking in the same way. I am not for one minute suggesting that we do not have to pay for medical care. Obviously we have to pay for it. It is a question of who pays for it and how the payments are distributed amongst different sections of the community. But let me discuss some of the non-financial aspects of Med i bank the good aspects of Medibank- that are threatened by the proposed changes in the financing of Medibank. </para>
        <para>The most important point about the introduction of Medibank as far as I am concerned is that it has reduced the incentive to doctors to perform unnecessary operations because of the fee for service factor. That is an important point as far as I am concerned. It has removed the application of a means test in public hospitals in all of the States. Such a test has not applied in the case of Queensland. It has made it possible for people to enter standard wards and there be treated by doctors who are paid on a sessional basis. In standard wards there is no incentive to the medical profession to perform unnecessary surgery. That is one of the most important points that those of us- there were quite a few of us- on this side of the House who are medical practitioners and who helped in the introduction of Medibank in this country tried to bring about. A lot of unnecessary surgery is performed in this country, but relatively little research has been carried out on this matter. In this respect I refer to a couple of points which to me are quite clear cut. </para>
        <para>There is very little difference between the Australian medical profession and the medical profession in corresponding countries- for example, the United States of America or Canada. Let us look at what happens in those countries. They have been able to look at the figures in more detail than we have been able to do so far. All the evidence so far in this country shows quite clearly that the number of operations performed in private hospitals and in the private and intermediate wards of public hospitals is much greater than the number of operations performed on public ward patients. There are two main systems of health insurance in the United States, namely, the health maintenance organisations such as the Kaiser Permanent organisations, and the Blue Cross organisation. The Blue Cross organisation corresponds to the medical funds as they existed previously in Australia and to some extent to Medibank insofar as it applies to private and intermediate ward patients. In other words, the patients pay their doctor for a service and get a refund from the insurance organisation- the Blue Cross organisation- for that service. With respect to the health maintenance organisations- the Kaiser Permanent organisation and similar organisations- a fixed amount is paid to the medical profession, which contracts to provide all the necessary health care to the people who belong to that scheme. So it is obviously in the interests of the medical profession under that sort of scheme to perform as few operations as possible and to have as few people as possible in hospital. </para>
        <para>I am not suggesting that that by itself is the solution. Obviously one could get the extreme position arising where doctors would collect the money and not perform necessary work or not admit people to hospital for necessary care. The advantage in the United States, of course, is that the two systems are running side by side. The important point there is that when one matches exactly as to age, income and previous medical history the people who belong to the health maintenance organisation and the Blue Cross organisation one finds that the number of operations on backs, the number of hysterectomies and the number of tonsillectomies are 2 to <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> times as great in the case of those covered by the Blue Cross organisation. In other words, they are 2 to 2Vi times as great in the case of those people on whom it is in a doctor's financial interest to perform an operation. In a study carried out in Winnipeg in Canada the amount of surgery performed on doctors' wives was compared with that carried out on women in the same age group whose husbands were in the same professional bracket and in the same income bracket. In other words, there was a comparison of the incidence of surgical operations involving doctors' wives and the wives of barristers, solicitors, members of Parliament and such like. There was a clear cut difference. Nearly twice as many operations were performed on non-doctors' wives- on the wives of other professional people- than on doctors' wives. I assume that a doctor would be just as keen as a solicitor or banister to have his wife's ailments cured, but it would appear that he is not nearly as keen as the solicitor or the barrister to have her submitted to surgery. </para>

            <para>- Yes, it is because of his professional knowledge. Exactly. The doctor knows that many operations are completely unnecessary. He knows that a large proportion of the hysterectomies are completely unnecessary, that a large proportion of the back operations are completely unnecessary and that a large proportion of the tonsillectomies are completely unnecessary. If it was just that they were unnecessary and cost money it would not be a sufficient ground to get terribly he up about. But unnecessary operations cause morbidity and cause a certain amount of mortality. It is important not to have unnecessary operations. I am sure that the honourable member for Phillip will agree with me when I say that members of the legal profession are less likely to get involved in legal actions that they would have to fund themselves than other similarly placed people outside of the legal profession. In other words, legal practitioners know full well that advice is often given to clients to carry out legal action because there is a benefit to be gained by the legal practitioner out of it. I am sure that the honourable member for Phillip has never fallen into that category, but he will probably agree with me when I say that a certain proportion of the legal profession would act in that way. </para>

        <para>This is exactly what happens in the medical profession. The medical practitioners do the same. I do not know whether they do it consciously. When I was in medical practice I occasionally used to send to a consultant surgeon people whom I believed had no physical condition which would be ameliorated by surgery. I had watched such patients for a long time, but I was not 100 per cent sure about them. So I sent them along to a consultant surgeon. A proportion of them were operated on. I would then ask the surgeon: 'Why did you operate on <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs SoandSo?</inline> After all, I think you would probably agree with me that it is not going to do her any good'. He would say: 'If I had not, somebody else would have done so'. But that somebody else would have done so only because a financial benefit was involved. I think that such actions can often be quite subconscious, but there is a clear cut financial benefit involved. </para>
        <para>A very interesting seminar was held on this subject at the Australian National University. The leader of the seminar was Professor Brown from Calgary University in Canada. He compared the cost of health care in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. People from the Department of Health were at the seminar, as was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Austin</inline> Holmes, who is one of the members of the Medibank Review Committee. There were other people at it who obviously have some influence with this Government. I am sure that they were impressed, if they needed to be impressed, with the point that Professor Brown was making, namely, that a large amount of unnecessary medical treatment is carried out if doctors are paid on a fee-for-service basis. </para>
        <para>I would like to interpolate here one point that is not often mentioned. Supporters of the Government and members of the Australian Medical Association and other medical organisations often talk about Canada going broke under its scheme and say that we have the same scheme as Canada. I suggest that one of the important points that people ought to take into account is that the doctors in Canada are paid on a fee-for-service basis even for services provided to standard ward patients in public hospitals, and therefore the cost is unlimited. Firstly, there is no disincentive there to doctors to operate because they are paid on a fee-for-service basis; secondly, a doctor will just call in at a hospital there and say to his patient 'Good afternoon', 'Good morning' or whatever it may be and be entitled to a fee on a fee-for-service basis. That is the scheme New South Wales surgeons are striking for. </para>
        <para>I meant to deal in more detail with the deficit and general economic questions but I got carried away with Medibank because I think it is a most important issue. I hope that when honourable members, especially Government supporters, discuss Medibank they will realise that money is only one part of Medibank. I know that money is all-important in many of the discussions that we have in this Parliament but it is not the only point. The other important thing to be remembered is that after all most doctors who would be affected by changes to the Medibank scheme probably pay something of the order of 65 per cent tax as a marginal tax rate, so the Government in fact recovers two-thirds of the money. Therefore the question of money is not the only point we have to talk about when we talk about Medibank. We have to make sure that Medibank is not changed in such a way that it encourages the unnecessary treatment of patients and the potentially dangerous treatment of patients. </para>
        <para>I would like to make one final point in regard to the Prime Minister's speech which was broadcast on radio and television last night. He made the point that tax indexation makes governments more responsible. In principle I support that proposition. Tax indexation means that there is not an automatic increase in Government revenue. Therefore in theory when a government wants to start a new program or wants to spend more money on defence, immigration or whatever it may be, it has to go out and defend that proposition before the public. That is important in a democracy, but it is not necessarily absolute because deficit financing will obviously also be used. We were a contributing factor here; I am not going to deny this but it is quite obvious that this Government will not reverse the position in the coming Budget- I have no terribly strong objection to deficit financing. I was going to deal with that at greater length in my speech but I was sidetracked onto Medibank. It is important to remember that tax indexation does not make governments more responsible if in fact they can still expend the money on their pet schemes whether they be our pet schemes such as Medibank or schemes to help the rural sector or Cabinet members with which this Government is concerned. </para>

          <para>-In rising to support the Appropriation Bills may I say first and foremost how delighted I was today to hear the unequivocal assurance from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the Antarctic Division would be transferred to Hobart. There has never been any doubt that our Government would honour its commitment in respect of the Antarctic base. However, largely as a result of a deferral of the project due to the economic chaos which we inherited from the previous Government, there was a certain degree of Press speculation aided and abetted by certain people in the Australian Labor Party who tried to spread the story that the Antarctic base would not be coming to Hobart. I do not think anybody in Tasmania can be in any doubt after today's answer to a question asked in this House when the Prime Minister said clearly and unequivocably that that base will be transferred to Hobart. </para>

            <para>- I congratulate the Government on this decision. The honourable member for Prospect says not now. Let me remind him that my predecessor for the electorate of Denison had 3 years in which to get the Whitlam Government to get that base to Hobart. The original decision was made in April 1973. The Government of the day fiddled around with it. It dithered and delayed. It did not even get the matter to the Public Works Committee. It went so slowly with this that it gave it second-grade treatment and then it had the gall to criticise us because we took 6 months to do it. The Prime Minister said back in February that the deferral was necessary because of the economic situation. The people of Hobart will live with that deferral but we will honour our word. We will carry out our commitment and the Antarctic base will be transferred to Hobart. </para>

        <para>Secondly, I would like to take this occasion publicly to congratulate the Government on the new federalism policy. I am amazed to read the extraordinary comments in the Press to the effect that the result of the New South Wales election was in some way affected by the federalism policy. An independent observer of standing in the community such as Professor Don Aitkin has made it quite clear and my own observations in that campaign make it quite clear that the attempts to describe the federalism policy as one of double taxation and the attempts to discredit it failed miserably. I think the truth must be known that the New South Wales election was fought basically on local issues together with one other matter raised in this House by the back bench supporters of the Government, namely the $40 funeral benefit for pensioners. I want to say publicly that I support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> the Premier of South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, who have welcomed this federalism policy. I want to say publicly that I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Tonkin and the remarks of many others from big and small States who have commended this policy because it is going to give back to the States a most precious right which was taken away in the years of centralism under the previous Government right to determine their own future, a right to make decisions for Tasmanians in Tasmania and decisions for Queenslanders in </para>

        <para>Thirdly, I want to commend the Government on the speed with which it is proceeding to honour a sacred election commitment, namely to bring in a freight equalisation scheme for Tasmania.

All we had was the Jimmy report which dragged on and on and in the meantime Tasmania has had to contend with freight increases of over 50 per. cent. Unlike the Whitlam Government we are going to honour our commitment on freight equalisation. I publicly commend the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> whom I have publicly attacked on many occasions in the past because of his apathy and lack of concern for Tasmania. He has changed. He has definitely changed. The legislation will come in and we will have freight equalisation for Tasmania operative as from, I believe, 1 July. </para>

        <para class="block">The honourable member went on to say a lot of things about the collegiate system and a lot of things about the National Civic Council.

The honourable member, intentionally or otherwise, misled the House when he said that he was in favour of officially conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union. The honourable member has a long and colourful career both in the trade union movement and in this Parliament.

A motion was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Monk</inline> and seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> in respect of the adoption of a certain report which recommended against court controlled ballots. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made very well known at that 18th Commonwealth Triennia Conference that he was opposed to court controlled ballots in the trade union movement. He was consistent again in 1951 on the question of union ballots. I quote again from the minutes of the 10th session conducted on Sunday evening, 4 March 1951. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">That piece of infamous legislation was to give the trade unionists of Australia the right to a clean ballot; yet the honourable member for Hindmarsh tells us he supported it. He went on in the same speech to describe it as the most deadly legislation in the annals of this Parliament. I will admit that I was in short pants in 1951, but how in 1976 can the honourable member for Hindmarsh expect to whack it over members of this Parliament by saying that he has always supported it? I quote again his words: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Therefore I was in favour of officially conducted ballots inside the Australian Workers Union. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">At the time of his 1948 speech he was an officer of the AWU in South Australia; at the time of his 1951 speech he was an officer of the AWU in South Australia; and when the matter was debated in this Parliament he still had a strong, long-standing connection with the AWU. I want to say from the outset that I have no connection with, nor am I a member of, nor, as far as I am aware, have I ever had any dealings with the organisation called the NCC. I am not speaking now of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who in my opinion sought to raise this matter a few days ago, but because it seemed to me that </para>
        <para class="block">Questions of sectarianism were creeping into the debate on whether the collegiate system ought to be retained. I want to say as a person coming from a small State that I believe it would be devastating to the small States of Australia if the collegiate system of voting in trade unions was taken away. Whilst I do not claim any expertise in the field, I will support to the hilt the Minister for Labor and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> in his endeavour to ensure that those unions which wish to have access to the collegiate system are given that right. At least under the collegiate system the representatives from the smaller States have an opportunity of serving on federal executives with a possibility of becoming national  president,  national vice-president or national treasurer. But that possibility is taken away from them by the creation of a system under which New South Wales and Victoria have the weight of numbers. The only exception could be a person of outstanding ability. I concede that the honourable member for Hindmarsh in his own way is outstanding, as is the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young).</inline> He is an exception to the rule. But nine times out of ten South Australians, Western Australians and Tasmanians can kiss goodbye any chance of getting a significant union position if the collegiate system is taken away. </para>
        <para>I make this plea as a federalist: The collegiate system is a system which is recognised not only in this country but also in the United States of America as being a fair system. We are watching two of the great political parties of the world at this moment proceeding to elect delegates who will nominate their respective candidates for the position of President of the United States of America. The fascinating thing is that after they have chosen their candidates there is a vote and everybody in America gets a vote. But that is not the end of the election. The votes that people cast go to electing members of a college and it is the college which formally elects the new President of the United States of America. </para>
        <para>I ask those who are opposed to the collegiate system: Why? What is the reason behind their opposition? I do not hesitate to say that there seem to be 2 groups determined to get rid of the collegiate system. First there are those who live in New South Wales and Victoria and who think that Australia begins in New South Wales and Victoria. The honourable member for Port Adelaide and I will be as one when I say we cannot have a bar of that argument. Secondly there are those who want to see certain right-wing unions in this country taken over by the communists. I will not be party to any debate in this chamber nor will I back my cart to change in any way the legislation if it will lead to either centralisation of power in the trade union movement or a communist takeover. </para>
        <para>As I said, I have a lot of affection for the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but my ears nearly fell off when I heard him say what he said in the chamber the other night, because for him to say that he supports and always was in favour of officially conducted union ballots in the Australian Workers Union is not correct. He knows it is not correct, unless his memory has reached the stage, which I do not believe it has, that he cannot remember back to 1948. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is a very capable and experienced parliamentarian and he should not make statements in this chamber which are demonstrably untrue. Quite frankly, if that is the basis of the argument of those who are out to destroy the collegiate system, I believe they will not get very far in their attempts. </para>
        <para>In supporting the Appropriation Bills may I in conclusion make one final remark in respect of Tasmania. One is entitled occasionally to be parochial. It has been said that Tasmanians have been stirring things up in Canberra, that Tasmanians have been causing trouble, that Tasmanians apparently have not been behaving as quiet little boys. I want to say 2 things: First, I do not believe that any Tasmanian member of this chamber came here to be a quiet little boy; secondly, and more importantly, I do not believe the Prime Minister or the Cabinet want us to be quiet little boys. I believe that is a point of some significance. When I read in the Press clap-trap about having knuckles rapped because one had the temerity to stand up and oppose the Party line in respect of funeral benefits, when I hear people saying that the Tasmanians have gone mad again, and when I hear the statement: 'If you keep carrying on like this you will be appointed as official food taster at the Lodge for the next 6 months', I just want to say that the Prime Minister of Australia has had at least 3 opportunities privately, and many publicly, to rap me over the knuckles. I want to say publicly that not only does he not rap over the knuckles people who have the courage or otherwise to disagree with his point of view, but I think he welcomes disagreement. I think that is very refreshing after 3 years of one-man government in this country when, with all due respect, the previous Prime Minister dominated the scene and, because of his strength and because of his power, was able to make decisions which perhaps were not in accordance with the overall wishes of his Party. Because he was surrounded by his yes men the previous Prime Minister of Australia was almost in a situation where he was able to rule single-handed. The Prime Minister of the country today is not a man who wants yes-men. He wants a strong, virile back bench to keep the Cabinet, and the Government, on its toes. He has a good, strong, virile back bench, and I suggest he has a dashed good Cabinet. </para>
        <para>I welcome the initiative and the drive that the new Government is showing. How refreshing it is to see a government which is tackling the problems of inflation and unemployment. How refreshing it is to see a government which is honouring its commitments. These are things which we did not see in Australia from 1972 to 1975. Whilst we do not expect miracles overnight, I believe our Government is on the right track. I believe it has the support of the overwhelming majority of Australians and I believe this country will be a better country in 1978 when we next face the people, because we had the strength and courage to take the tough decisions and to do the job that the people sent us here to do. I support the Bill. </para>

          <para>-In speaking to the Appropriation Bills, firstly let me say to the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> that he will probably get a smack across the knuckles one of these days, probably as soon as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> finds out he is here and knows what he is up to. I do not have to apologise for the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron).</inline> I think it was rather presumptuous of the honourable member for Hindmarsh to make comments on the trade union movement, considering he was almost 25 years of age before he became the General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union in South Australia; considering that he spent only 13 years in that profession; considering that he spent another 20 years as an executive member of the South Australian </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Branch of the Union and was a delegate to the International Labour Conference; considering that he was shadow Minister and Minister for Labor for many years in the national Parliament; and considering that the first trade union college in Albury-Wodonga was named after him. So, I would think that we ought not to take too seriously his comments on the manner in which trade union ballots are conducted! As the honourable member for Denison said, the honourable member for Hindmarsh might have said something different in 1 95 1 . </para>
        <para>Let us relate to something a little more relevant. The present Prime Minister of this country said, in the lead up to the December election: 'I support, my Government will support and we will continue to support full indexation'. It may interest honourable members opposite to know that the Government Parties have had 5 policies on indexation since 1 December last year. Now they are asking the trade union movement and the wage and salary earners of this country to put trust in the Government. They say: 'We will do the right thing by you' when they have already announced, as I have said, 5 policies on indexation. Now we have the amazing performance of the Prime Minister last night on television trying to assure the people of Australia that everything will be rosy, that whatever he does to hurt them he will do something else to help them overcome that problem. It is very difficult to question anybody making a speech on television, but when given the first opportunity today in the national Parliament of this country to expand on some of the comments he made last night he was unable to do so. </para>
        <para>I want to refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations</inline> which was tabled with the Appropriation Bills by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> because it does not seem that the Prime Minister is too anxious to do so. It must be very demoralising for the Government to find that its greatest supporter, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> criticised what the Prime Minister said last night. Not only that; it did so on its mad page, page 6, where one would expect the Sydney Morning Herald never to deviate. Whatever it says on pages 1 to 5 and from page 7 to the classifieds, never ever on page 6 will it say anything to condemn the conservative forces of this country. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> editorial contains criticisms of what the Prime Minister had to say, or in fact criticisms of what the Prime Minister did not say. Of course this Government, as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> points out, will destroy the concept of Medibank as it was introduced by the Labor Administration. There will be no such thing as national health insurance in this country after Thursday night's statement. The Government will divide the country between the low and middle income earners, and the high income earners. Of course it will see that the people who earn most will be treated under private health insurance and that others will be looked after by Medibank, which will be looked upon in this country, after the Thursday night announcement, as a second class health system. If the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> can see it, as it appears from this morning's editorial, everyone ought to be able to see it. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Denison says that the back bench members fought very hard on the $40 funeral benefit even though in the final analysis they capitulated and voted for the legislation to go through the House of Representatives. We predicted accurately what would occur. We said it would come back from the Senate amended. Members of the back bench bowed to the master who said that the legislation involving a sum of $1.7m must go through the House- a most amazing political decision if ever there was one. Now we are being told that they will stand up to some of the major decisions that will have to be made by this Government on questions like Medibank. Who on the other side of the House has raised any of the questions contained in the document entitled <inline font-style="italic">The New Investment Allowance"!</inline> Has anyone said in the Party room that this may not be the best thing for Australia? Honourable members opposite do not give all the flamboyance to publications relating to taking money away as they do to publications relating to money which is being given out. </para>
        <para>Perhaps there may be no great criticism from this side about the 40 per cent investment allowance instituted by the Government to get the private sector going. Let me just read some of the things that are in the publication to try to attract people to invest their money, and which show how much they will save. <inline font-style="italic">The New Investment Allowance</inline> states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>At the company tax rate of 42.5 per cent an investment of $50,000, for example, gives a tax bonus of $8,500 that is itself tax-free- the bonus is $850 for an investment of $5,000. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Everybody is asked to go to the addresses of the offices which are printed on the back of the publication and to find out how they can get money from the Government. If people go to a different office they can obtain the document <inline font-style="italic">Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations</inline> and find out how their hopes and aspirations for a decent community in this country are being dashed by this Government. This </para>
        <para class="block">Government says that it has to save money. Let us look at what savings really do right across the board when talked about in these terms. They mean reduced services to the public in health, social welfare and education, and reduced employment opportunities both in the private and public sector at a time when hundreds of thousands are out of work. It is gross waste as projects on which money has already been spent are left uncompleted, and it is gross inefficiency as public servants are denied the means to do their job. There are dashed hopes and expectations and broken commitments as communities are denied the funds for projects for which they have worked and planned. It has reduced spending on research and planning, and it has reduced the information available to the public. Let us look at one item in the publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations.</inline> One item on page 17 shows that $102,000 has been set aside for the operations of the Ombudsman of the national government. How much has the Government saved? It has saved $102,000. No one comes out and says: 'We will not have an ombudsman', but that is what has happened under this Government This is something that Government supporters were beating their chests about in the December election campaign. They said: 'We will give out information. There will be none of the secret things; none of these loan affairs. Under this Government everything will be done right. You will all be applauding us in 3 years '. No one is applauding after 3 months. </para>
        <para>This is the worst group, laughingly called a government, that we have had in Canberra for years. Honourable members should look at all the things that are being said. Let us look at some of the observations that have been made about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> contribution last night. Let us look at what Allan Barnes had to say in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> contribution. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The disorganised state of the Fraser Government was never more obvious than in the Prime Minister's misconceived address to the nation last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> set out to reassure the Australian public. He succeeded only in confusing them. Instead of setting the scene for his Treasurer's major economic statement on Thursday night, the Prime Minister pre-empted it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Further on he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It was a time for simple, direct, honest words from our head of Government. Instead, we got vague promises of substantial 'savings' in Government spending. There was no explanation of what priorities had been applied in achieving these cuts or how they would offset extra expenditure on the investment allowances, the superphosphate bounty, the aid for dairy farmers or income tax indexation and still reduce the dreaded deficit. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Granted that the Prime Minister was serious about making a broadcast to the nation. Perhaps he could not say as much as he wanted to say last night because of the television time made available to him, although I doubt that extra time would ever be refused if he asked for it. But here in the national Parliament today he could have expanded on his statement. He could have told all honourable members and the people of Australia he was the person who was not going to have any secrets- what all these savings mean. Of course public servants are an easy target. We can all get stuck into them. Public servants were carrying out certain programs but because of the Government's savings many public servants are sitting in their offices twiddling their thumbs. They cannot carry out their duties. Let us take a couple of examples. The first one relates to Aboriginal vocational officers from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The job depends very much on travelling throughout their areas of responsibility in the country and country towns finding jobs for the Aboriginal people. It depends on travel and travel allowances. Now it has been disbanded. That concept was applauded by honourable members from both sides of the House. It was designed to assist people who had additional difficulty in finding employment. But what do we find? The Government is now boasting that it has made a gigantic saving. What the saving means is that fewer and fewer Aboriginal people will be able to find employment. I hope that the Government is proud of that little saving. </para>
        <para>We see on page 66 of the Treasury Information Paper how much money is to be saved on housing. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that we have too much housing in Australia, that no one is waiting for a house, least of all those on low incomes! A lot of honourable members opposite represent areas in which people are queued up all the time trying to find accommodation. But they sit on the Government benches boasting of saving $20m when housing is desperately needed in Australia. Those are the people who are feeling the blow. Let us look at the area improvement programs. If there was one policy of the Whitlam Administration which was of enormous assistance to local organisations it was the area improvement program. A lot of the ideas as to how the money was to be spent were generated from within the communities themselves. Now the Government says that it is saving $4.5m. Those communities which may have raised money to do part of the work themselves now find that the concept has been completely disbanded. </para>
        <para>The Government should not tell us that it intends to start them up again. It says: 'We are stopping them only for a little while until we get inflation under control'. One would think that honourable members opposite were all new members but almost everybody who sits on the Government front bench was here for part of the time from 1949-1972. Previous Liberal governments did not have those programs. This Government will not bring them back because it did not have any ideas at all about the role which the Australian Government ought to play in the communities of this country. All of those people- especially the person who now leads the Government- always defeated any idea put forward by the Liberal or Country Parties for more involvement in these responsibilities. So do not let us be confused when spokesmen for the Government say: 'We are stopping them only until we have inflation under control, then they will all be re-established.' The Government knows, I know and the Australian people are entitled to know that they will never be reestablished. </para>
        <para>The Government set out to destroy Medibank and the funeral benefit. It is now setting out to destroy many fine programs such as the area improvement program and the Australian Assistance Plan. No doubt it will be hellbent on destroying the Australian Schools Commission. We will see whether at the time of the Budget the hairy-chested back benchers on the Government side will get up and tell the Prime Minister not to touch the Australian Schools Commission. Honourable members opposite should listen to the Treasurer on Thursday night when he talks about some of these programs and saving $2,000m. They are all being taken for a ride. Obviously at the next Senate election we will see the voting figures of 13 December completely reversed and we will have more Labor senators in the upper House to express the views and disappointments of those people who voted for this Government. </para>
        <para>It appears from the Prime Minister's speech last night that all of a sudden the Prime Minister has discovered that there are 300 000 families in the Australian community who pay little or no tax. He announced that he is going to assist them. Again I remind honourable members opposite and the people of Australia that when Labor came to power on 2 December 1972, according to Professor Henderson the former Liberal Government left behind a legacy of 12 per cent of the people of Australia living in poverty. It should come as no surprise to any conservative politician in this country that there are poor people, because it was their policies from 1949-1972 that impoverished 12 per cent of the people of Australia. The Government now says that it is better to put a levy on Medibank, it is better to destroy Medibank as a social instrument and put a bit more money back into the pay packet out of tax indexation because then each family can find its own level. That was the philosophy of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, of Holt, of Gorton and of McMahon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was there supporting that philosophy in his years as a Minister. But we will go back to that. </para>
        <para>How are any of the policies being announced by this Government going to overcome the problems we found at the commencement of our 3 years in office? Honourable members opposite should have a look at the Treasury Information Paper and see how the Government is destroying the concept of Australian Government involvement in the Australian communities. It is absolutely disgraceful that this Government should present an argument that money can be taken from health expenditure; not just capital expenditure but research and planning expenditure, areas where money is invested to save money. That expenditure has been axed. To vindicate the decisions of the Australian Government the people are told that the Government will make sure that every department is affected. The Government has even saved $238 from the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I do not know how that was done or who made that magnificent decision. I do not know whether or not it went to the full Cabinet. But the axe had to fall on all departments. The planning and research section of the Health Department has also received the axe, as have the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, the 2 territories for which the Commonwealth Government is absolutely responsible. </para>
        <para>We find cuts in housing, health and child care right across the board, made without thought and with absolutely no relationship to the difficulties of the communities. The Government has decided to follow this act right through and to show the people that it will do what it said in December- that it would cut back the deficit irrespective of its effect on the communities. The figure of $2,000m is supposed to be a magical political solution and it will look impressive, but the Government must put it into effect. Honourable members opposite should go into the communities and talk to people. Those honourable members who come from Melbourne should talk to the Brotherhood of St Laurence and ask about the additional problems that will be thrust upon them. They should talk to people in local government, in the schools which have started new programs under the Australian Schools Commission or the Pre-Schools Commission, and see what will happen to those people if these monies are cut up to and including the time of the Budget. </para>
        <para>The Government is intent on destroying all the concepts of the Labor Administration by saying that it has to defeat inflation, but it is opposed to the concept of Australian Government responsibility. The Government wants to give everything back to the States. It may say that the Premier of Queensland has the same priorities as the Premier of South Australia. That is a laugh. We will see unequal distribution of State resources. Whatever the Premier of Queensland sees as a priority he will push, as against the priorities of the other States. What the previous Government started was to be admired. It was involved with the communities, it listened to the communities and acted upon their advice. All those programs are now being slashed. They should have been consolidated, not slashed because of the Prime Minister's act to endorse the magical deficit figure cutting of $2 ,000m. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> who is trying to interject should not talk so much in here but should go and talk to some of the people in his electorate and ask them whether they are happy. Like me, he would have 40 or 50 schools in his electorate, child care centres and dental clinics at the schools, all established by the Labor Administration. He should go and listen for a while and not talk to people all the time. He should ask them whether they endorse the actions taken by this Government. He should ask the Catholic schools with which he is so well associated what they think about the slashing of funds for Catholic schools in this country. He should ask them what would have happened if it had not been for the Australian Schools Commission. He should ask about the migrants and the children who are being taught in the schools in their own language. He should ask them about the cut in their programs. Then he may come to understand what a myth this project of cutting the deficit is. What the Government is doing is getting back to the old philosophy of the years between 1949 and 1972. The only things that Government supporters want to concern themselves with in this Parliament are pensions and foreign affairs. Everything else falls to the States. Honourable members opposite say: 'Do not touch it, do not concern ourselves. We do not want any responsibility for it. In that way something will happen. They say that everything should be taken out of their area and then perhaps we will be better off. The Parliament will not have to concern itself with the real problems of Australian communities. </para>

          <para>-Having just listened to the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> one can readily understand why the economy of Australia is in such a desperate position. Apparently the honourable member is opposed to every cut in expenditure anywhere. It does not matter what the expenditure relates to or its extent. He says we must not cut it. We must just let the country drift. We must let the economy of this country develop to such a situation that unemployment and inflation will go from bad to worse. That is what happened during the 3 years of the previous Government. That is the attitude of the honourable member. He made no attempt to look at the Government's economic policy, which makes a sound approach to economic management. We would all like to do more in almost all the fields mentioned by the honourable member if this were reasonably practical economically. </para>

            <para>- As one of the honourable member's colleagues said, one man's wage rise is often another man's job. He talked about asking the children about their schools. I suggest that he should ask children how they feel when their parents are unemployed. These are the sorts of things that he should consider when running a government in a country like Australia. This country should be able to provide assistance across the board for all the many needs which governments should consider. The whole of the speech of the honourable member for Port Adelaide could be summed up as containing nothing but destructive criticism, as did that of many of his colleagues. I listened to him fairly carefully and did not hear him suggest any progressive move or measure. He referred only to the irrational, reckless, irresponsible expenditure of the Government he supported during its 3 years which brought this country to its present - </para>

            <para>- It is irresponsible to spend more money than the Australian community can be reasonably expected to provide while at the same time enabling prosperity in this country to continue. Under the Government in power before the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Antony Whitlam)</inline> came to this place private enterprise was completely disregarded. That is one of the reasons why we are in the situation we are in today. The Labor Government did not realise that fact until very late in the piece when it started to feel the effects. It realised then that it should have done more to keep private enterprise operating and providing jobs that people so sorely need. If there is one Party represented in this House which claims that it endeavours to provide employment and to look after the work force in this country it is the Australian Labor Party. There is no area in which it failed more miserably during its 3 years in government The honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned, as did some other honourable members, criticisms in the Press. For efficient operation of democratic government in any country there has to be some sort of active and effective Opposition. The Labor Party has failed to provide that Opposition and the media has taken on that responsibility. At times the media has stretched things a bit; I believe it has overdone things in an endeavour to make up for that - </para>

            <para>-Yes, failure; on the part of the Labor Party, as my friend the honourable member for Lyne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lucock)</inline> points out. Another point I want to make following the remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide relates to what has been provided for the States by this Government. I certainly agree that there is a need for balance in this area. However the previous Government, the Labor Government, was determined to have centralised government in Australia. Its objective was the wiping out of the States and the Senate and the establishment of one centralised government here in Canberra. We on this side of the House are not prepared to go along with that point of view. Whatever members of the Opposition like to say about that point let me say that if it is a question of giving more authority to the States as against having a centralised government to the disadvantage of many parts of the Australian continent and the island of Tasmania, I think we would prefer the former course. We would prefer that to happen rather than have the centralised government that the Labor Party would like. </para>

        <para>Careful and effective economic management of national finance is one of the most important tasks of any national government. That is what this Government aims to do. If in doing so it has to cut expenditure in some areas where it would prefer to see expenditure continue at current levels, that is its national responsibility. It is important that we have our economy on an even keel. That would be to the advantage of the honourable member for Port Adelaide as well as the rest of the Australian community. He might not feel the results as much as others but it is important to realise that everybody benefits from a sound national economy. To achieve that the Government has to take measures that it would not have had to take if it were not for the reckless mismanagement of the Australian economy over the 3 years that the Labor Party was in office. The importance of sound economic management has to be recognised because of its effect on every other department of national operation. If we do not have finance with which to operate we must get along by using extensive and excessive loans, and high taxation. Consequently we have inflation and unemployment. We have seen that pattern unfolding. It is the responsibility of the Government we support to do what it can to see that that situation is rectified and this is not going to be easy. When a national economic structure has been built up along the lines followed by the previous Labor Government is is not easy to rectify the situation without causing some heartaches, without doing some things that nobody would want to do in different circumstances. </para>
        <para>The point is that some of these unpopular measures will have to be taken. They will be taken only by a courageous and determined government and that is what this Government has proved itself to be. Nevertheless it is important that no sector of the Australian community should suffer unduly in carrying the burden that will have to be carried. We will have to endure that period while we restructure the economy of this country and bring it to a level where we know it can be and where we know it should be. </para>
        <para>I want to move on and refer to some other specific aspects that I think are important and to some changes that have been made. I want to refer firstly to local government. It is one arm of government that has been neglected. Do not let me hear the honourable member for Port Adelaide say that the Government he supported did anything worthwhile for local government during its time in office. That Government did not accept the advice of the Australian Council for Local Government Associations which wanted a growth tax, a share of income tax, to enable local government to fulfil the responsibilities which rest upon its shoulders, responsibilities which it had to carry out under the inflationary trend that was coming. Local government had to accept added responsibilities that were foisted upon it. I know that some of those responsibilities were given to local government by Governments I supported. Let me be honest about that point. I refer to responsibilities such as that relating to the local ownership plan for aerodromes. I submit that that responsibility falls too heavily on the shoulders of local government. Local government also has responsibility for health, road development and the development of recreational facilities for many people. The honourable member for Port Adelaide spends most of his time in our capital cities and sometimes he might see that the Government has done a good deal to provide recreational facilities in those areas. But if he has the time he should come out to areas such as that where I live where he will see some splendid sporting facilities which have been provided by local government and which are a heavy financial burden on those local government bodies. It is time, high time, that local government got a share of personal income tax. </para>

            <para>- It is long overdue, as my friend the honourable member for Holt says. The only comment I have to make on that point, and I have made it before, is that the decision taken by the Australian Council for Local Government Association to ask for 2 per cent, I thought, was too modest. However at least the Government did meet that 2 per cent requirement. I would have liked to have seen a higher percentage given to local government. In time to come there may be a need for local government to get a larger share of the tax pool of this country if it is to operate effectively in its sphere as the third arm of government. Local government in its field is just as important as State and Federal governments are. Local governments do have to look after the day to day needs of the people they represent. They have been doing so under very difficult circumstances. They have been running into crippling debts. I should like to comment in regard to local government on some statements made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> recently. I think his statement was on 9 May. It is a very recent one. </para>

        <para class="block">It certainly will have to do just that. I commend the Prime Minister for the statement he made. I am sorry he did not get even wider publicity for it because it does set out the situation as far as local government is concerned. It does allay the fears that many local governments have expressed because they are concerned about the actual details of how this matter of the 2 per cent of tax will be distributed. It will be distributed through the States Grants Commissions. It is quite possible too that in these sorts of operations they do find that there is need to change and to improve them in the light of experience. But it is a wonderful thing that we can say here today that at last this Government has recognised the importance and the equality of the third arm of government local government- in the control of the affairs of the people of Australia. </para>
        <para>I should like to say a few words now about natural disasters because they occur from time to time. We have heard of tragic circumstances around the world in recent times in the way of earthquakes. In our country recently we suffered disastrous floods in my own State of Queensland and in the State of New South Wales. The point I want to make particularly in this regard is the need to profit from the experiences we had in that time. I know that the warning systems along the Macintyre River were not as effective as they should have been. They went out of operation sooner than they should have done. I submit that there should be an examination of the best possible warning systems that can be made available to allow people to get the earliest notification of the flood levels and the length of time they might have to make preparations for the floods that are coming down. This examination might be going on at the moment; I do not know. If it is then I commend it; if it is not, then I urge that it be undertaken. I should also like to see inter-state consultation in that area. I know that in Queensland for some reason or other we were some time behind in getting the fodder drop in our area compared with New South Wales. I shall not go into the details of that. What I want to do is to draw attention to the matter so as to ensure that whatever problems were met then will be overcome in the future. Therefore I suggest that there should be consultation between the States to arrive at a system of operation through our natural disaster organisation which will enable all the States to get not only equitable treatment but also treatment which has the same timetable and also to ensure that there is no dissatisfaction between the States, which there should not be. I should like to see the inter crossing of States in times of natural disaster. I spoke to the Premier of Queensland during the Queensland floods and he said that he had no objection to it at all. But of course it cannot be done overnight; these things have to be organised. I strongly urge that there be consultation between emergency services of the States with the object of getting the best possible emergency services in all States. There are lessons to be learned, and I hope that this will be undertaken. </para>
        <para>I should like to pay tribute to those people who were involved in the State emergency services at that time. The Prime Minister himself took an active part. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> who is sitting at the table, came to Queensland and had a look at the flood areas. On one occasion I met him at Stanthorpe. But problems still remain. I believe we do need a common system of land to air signals. I am not sure whether a common system is operating yet, but if it is not, it should be. I hope that it will be provided. I should also like to see instituted in that field a better system of surveys in areas where it could be supposed that communications might have broken down. I have had complaints and recommendations which I have here, but I probably will not have time to elaborate on them. But some shires have given me their views on this matter and no doubt others will put their views forward. I hope that these views will be collated and that the fullest possible advantage will be taken of methods of dealing with those natural disasters and that the splendid organisation that we have will be even more efficient in the future. </para>
        <para>I refer now to something that I have spoken on before and that is the Postal and Telecommunications Commission. The Telecommunications Commission has made a profit and while it might gain some satisfaction out of that- and perhaps we all do; we like to see these commissions making a profit- but while it is making that profit there are many very deserving citizens of this country still waiting to have a telephone connected. If it is only a matter of funds, I hope that those funds will be provided to enable more people who have waited long enough to have telephones provided. I hope in the light of that profit too that some of the conditions attaching to the installation of telephones will be eased to enable more people to take advantage of them. I believe that with regard to the operation of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, the criteria which they had to operate under, brought about by the previous Government, reveal that the Commissions are a bit top-heavy. This needs to be examined. I believe that the whole operation needs to be looked at. I believe that the criteria under which they operate should be examined because in my opinion it is not possible to provide what Australia should have- a reasonably economic communications system across the nation. That cannot be provided simply on a user pays basis. If we are going to insist on a user pays basis for the complete operation of the postal and telecommunications systems we shall have a very weak type of communications system in many of the less densely populated areas of this country. </para>
        <para>The people who are providing a very substantial proportion of the gross domestic product and of the export income of this country deserve the consideration of the Australian people. For example, in my State there was a recent discovery of more natural gas. A pipeline is to be built at a cost of $2.5m to be connected to the pipeline already there. What is that worth to Queensland, to Australia, to the capital city of Brisbane? Why should people in that area and areas around it be deprived of a reasonable postal service? It is all very well to take the production that comes from those areas and give nothing in return and then say that a communication service must be provided on a user pays basis. What are we going to do with those sparsely settled areas in this country? Are we going to forget them? Are we going to let the population trend which is already there accentuate even further or are we going to do what we should be doing, which is, utilise all the areas capable of the production of wealth in this country which we need. So I say that if there is to be a sound communications policy then that user pays policy must be confined to those areas where it is reasonably economically practical to follow it. In those areas where it is not practical to follow it, because of the contribution of the areas to the national economy there should be some Treasury subvention, some Government funds made available to enable those communications to be provided. Unless we do have that, I say that we are going to fall down on our job as a nation. </para>
        <para>Strangely enough, as a member of the National Country Party, I have not yet referred I hope my friends on the Opposition side will take note of this- to the plight of primary industry, but I shall do so in the little time that is left to me. There is a very great need for consideration to be given to it with the finances that are available. Here again we must ensure balanced development in Australia. Members of the Opposition laugh; they do not give a damn what happens to the people in rural areas of this country. They cannot argue about these facts but they do nothing about them. There is a need for greater consideration to be given to those areas of primary industry where the need for assistance at the moment is very great indeed. </para>
        <para>I turn to defence. No doubt my friend the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sullivan)</inline> was disappointed that I had not mentioned it. We must provide adequate defence for Australia. If we provide all the funds that the Australian Labor Party and the honourable member for Port Adelaide say we should not cut, what do we do? Do we have no defence at all? From some of the statements I hear it would seem that members of the Opposition do not care whether we have any defence at all. </para>

The Bills provide for a total expenditure of approximately $505m. A week or so ago the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> referred in his second reading speeches on the Bills to a Treasury information paper and said something about the statement of savings expected in the annual appropriation. He suggested that under the 2 Appropriation Bills there would be savings of some $478.2m. I do not know how members of the public understand that. The Treasurer said that savings on both Bills will exceed the original amount of $344m which the Appropriation Bills are to appropriate- an increase, he says, of $28m. Many people would regard this as a lot of political mumbo-jumbo and wonder why the Treasurer cannot spell it out more clearly.

            <para>- The honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume)</inline> was supposed to be a director. These 2 stock exchange giants were strongly condemned in the report for their practices. Time will not permit me to deal fully with the Rae report. I shall deal with a couple of scandals that surfaced during the Committee's investigations. Senior members of the 2 firms were members of the Stock Exchange. This is what the Labor Party was endeavouring to legislate upon to have corrected, but the legislation was held up in the Senate when we were in power. We legislated in this House to prevent the directors of any companies registered on the Stock Exchange from becoming members of that Exchange. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>At the time of the debate on that legislation I remember that the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> with other Government supporters, condemned this provision of the legislation saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir so-and-so,</inline> a man of impeccable character, would have to resign from the Stock Exchange because he is a director of so-and-so. The Labor Party was not concerned about the individual; we thought it was wrong for people to be members of the Stock Exchange and also company directors because when the Stock Exchange Committee is called upon to punish company directors or companies for nefarious practices the members virtually sit in judgment upon themselves. I cannot imagine any honourable member believing sincerely that he should sit on a jury in his own trial. That is virtually what the practice meant. The present </para>
        <para class="block">Government rejected this legislation introduced by the Whitlam administration. </para>
        <para>In evidence before the Rae Committee the  Chairman  of the Stock Exchange, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> H. Cooper, as recorded in Volume 2 of the Rae Committee report, admitted that it is possible for members of the Committee of the Stock Exchange to sit in judgment of themselves although the rule requires that they do not exercise a vote on such matters. So, as I see it, the Committee of the Stock Exchange can sit in judgment and handle charges levelled against its members. More publicity should be given to this. I shall try to develop the argument about why more publicity was not given to this by the Australian media. As I said, members of the Stock Exchange Committee can sit in judgment on charges made by the Senate Committee against the 2 firms mentioned. Patrick Partners and King and Yu ill were the two in question. Can the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> tell me or this Parliament whether this is not a fact? This is why the small investor will not risk his money, because the Liberals cannot afford to clean up the Stock Exchange and pass a uniform company law. </para>
        <para>I regret that the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett)</inline> in his speech a little while ago implied that the Whitlam administration was trying to centralise everything and to run the whole of the country from Canberra, denying to the States any power at all. A uniform company law is urgently needed in Australia. Grave charges are made in the Rae Committee report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has shown commendable honesty in this regard. I believe, as one newspaper stated, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> forthrightness and honesty as  Chairman  of this investigating committee has militated against him getting into the Cabinet in the Fraser Government because big business has warned the Prime Minister and told him that big business does not want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> because he was so forthright and honest in his searching out of the nefarious practices of some of the big companies when he was  Chairman  of the Rae Committee. Let me deal further with Patrick Partners and its association with a man called <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas.</inline></para>

There was no registration of a prospectus with a stock exchange and no general meeting of the company to approve the increase in the issued capital; so the capital was watered without the consent of the shareholders. King and Yu ill did not disclose on the contract notes that it was acting as principal in the sale; so the client was justified in believing that he was dealing with it as agent and that the shares were part of the original issue.

        <para class="block">The Rae Committee's report stated that 6 financial writers were given shares at par for boosting in their newspapers shares floated by Patrick Partners. Those writers sold their shares and made thousands of dollars. One of those financial writers is now a member of this House. He is the honourable member for Macarthur. When the directors of Patrick Partners were proceeded against under the bankruptcy laws of New South Wales the honourable member for Macarthur was excluded from those proceedings. He was able to buy himself out of bankruptcy. If he had been convicted of bankruptcy, under the Electoral Act he would have lost his seat in this Parliament. The same honourable member is a director of Tancred Brothers, a Brisbane meat firm which paid money to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Todd,</inline> a New York banker, for and on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> to investigate what is known as the loans affair. It is no wonder he is known in his electorate as 'Hallelujah'. The last issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Nation Review</inline> states at page 75 1: - For instance, Todd was paid his advance by the Brisbane meat firm Tancred Brothers, of which the Liberal member for Macarthur, Michael £. Baume, is a director. Bjelke-petersen 's right-hand man, Wiley Fan cher (Fan cher the rancher), who with Todd and Queensland Agent-General Wally Rae carried out the inquiry, is a buddy of Doug Anthony's. Other names in the documents- Gould, Bracey, Hamilton- had gone to ground. Phones had been disconnected, companies liquidated, whereabouts unknown. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bracey</inline> emerged to appear in court in Sydney on Thursday on. a charge of conspiracy to defraud. The word was that Bracey 's connections were indeed interesting, including the former N.S.W. Attorney-General, John Maddison, and a certain Sydney solicitor - </para>
        <para class="block">I was criticised for mentioning his name in this Parliament a few weeks ago- named Sankey who is currently pursuing Whitlam, Connor and Murphy through the Queanbeyan courts on a conspiracy charge.

        <para class="block">Those are the real reasons why there is redundancy in the economy today. The small investor will not invest in the Sydney Stock Exchange, knowing that it is run by a bunch of crooks and that has been allowed because the Liberal Party would not agree to the amendments to the Companies Act which the Whitlam Government tried to make but which were obstructed in the Senate. During our administration we tried to prevent company directors from being members of the Stock Exchange. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> is sitting at the table. He is a man who is regarded with a great deal of respect by all honourable members on this side of the House and who has not yet allowed himself to be fully contaminated by the skullduggery of Liberal Party politics. I hope that one day he will be able to influence his party to amend the Companies Act in such a way as to encourage the small investor to invest in the stock market and thereby stimulate the economy in such a way that many decent Australians will be able to find successful and lucrative employment. </para>

          <para>-The honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> has acquired a reputation in this chamber and throughout the country for his sense of justice. I do not want to comment at great length about that, but I do want to make 2 points. When he left the New South Wales Police Force and came into this chamber it was said that the New South Wales Police Force never would be quite the same again. I understand that it also has been said by some wit that when he left the New South Wales Police Force and entered the Parliamentary Labor Party the average standard in both places rose. We saw some examples of that tonight. I do not want to develop that theme further except to say that no doubt in due time the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume)</inline> will make his own ready and sensitive response to what has been said. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Hunter also has an incredibly sensitive and fine sense of history. When political parties come into government in this place they are expected to keep their promises. When the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young),</inline> who is now leaving this chamber, spoke this afternoon I was surprised beyond belief that he had the wit or the gall to accuse the present Government of breaking the major promises on which it was elected to office. The Marquess of Rockingham was the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to undertake in government the promises he had made when in Opposition. It was George the Third who said of him, being surprised at this proposition: 'You must remember that when an Opposition gets into government it makes a few gestures to old principles but from then on the farce is at an end. It has to get on with government'. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Promises made ought to be promises kept. I want to go over one or 2 promises that were deliberately and tragically broken by the present Opposition when it was in government. I refer firstly to the most important promise. The promise on which any government has to be sustained in this place and the promise that has existed since the last year of World War II is the promise of full employment. We are in a position today where there is significant unemployment, the causes of which were inherited from the Labor </para>
        <para class="block">Government and which have come about since the Labor Government came into power. The Labor Government was in power for 3 years. In that time it showed more than any other government in Australia's history that it was willing to put people out of work, that it was willing to import into Australia the situation of people knocking on back doors with the catch-cry: 'Lady, have you got a job?' That is the philosophy that the Labor Government imported into Australia and that is the philosophy, that is the practice, of which we have to rid this country. That promise has been made. We intend to keep the promise in respect of having a stable economy in this country. </para>
        <para>Let us consider some other propositions. The Labor Government forgot one overriding, important ingredient; that is, that one cannot in fact provide people with the wherewithal that they desire in terms of living standards, stable prices and jobs unless there is economic growth in Australia. Unless there is development, unless there is growth, none of those things can be provided. That basic and most tragic ingredient in fact sifted itself through the 3 years Labor was in office and the electorate and the Australian people ought never to be allowed to forget that fact and that experience. </para>
        <para>We know that the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> is vying with some other members of his own Party to get into a position of leadership. I would say that on this afternoon's performance there are a number of New South Wales members who would leave him for dead. They would finish the race before he got into the straight because this afternoon's performance was an incredible tragedy. Let me remind him of some of the propositions he has made. He said this Government is not going on with some of the park schemes; it is not going on with some of the local improvement schemes that his Party, when in office, had in mind; it is not doing a whole wealth of other activities that his Party had undertaken. He has forgotten that a cake can have in it very satisfactory ingredients such as sultanas and other fruit but when there is an ounce of strychnine in it, it is useless. Such was the position with the Labor Party and those propositions he put came to nought. What he would have would be an excellent park scheme and an excellent area improvement scheme in which the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians could rest. That is the Labor Party's sense. That is the sense of economy which Labor had and which it imported into this country. That is one belief of which this country has to be rid. He made a number of other propositions which I find intriguing but which time would prevent me dwelling on, but the overall philosophy of them deserve to be rejected. </para>
        <para>There is one other point of the experience of the Labor Government which is now possible to be calculated. Not only was it in a couple of years able to generate high unemployment, not only was it in a couple of years able to generate a very great and an increasing rate of inflation- and by the way, it is a rate which is decreasing very rapidly at the present time- but at the same time it was also able to rob Australians and Australian households of the dollars which were earned and which were going into those households. The national account figures for December last year which are now available indicate the kind of experience we had at the end of the term of the previous Labor Government. An important question for anybody to ask is: How much of every dollar that is being earned and that is going into an Australian household is being surrendered to government and to public authorities? It is now quite clear that as at December last year when the Labor Government was rejected of every earned dollar that was going into an Australian household under a socialist government- and it gave the lead to the other governments in Australia and to the other public authorities over 40c was surrendered to a public authority. So at the same time the Labor Government was able to reintroduce the word 'dole', was able to reintroduce the word 'hyper-inflation' and was able to show how governments could rip it off. That is the kind of situation which this Government has to remedy. It is the kind of situation this Government has to alter and today it is in the process of altering it. I hope that that will be appreciated by the Opposition. </para>
        <para>The Labor Party's performance in office needs to be borne in mind. AH of that of course only has meaning and the process can be given meaning only if we come back to the proposition made by Chifley and by Dedman when they made their solemn promises on full employment in 1945 and if we can have economic growth developing in Australia. The national account figures illustrate one further point which indicates the dying performance of the previous Labor Government. It is simply this: In terms of the national product of Australia, over the last quarter of 1 975- that is the December quarter- the Labor Government's performance was not only worse than for the December quarter of the year earlier, but it was worse than the performance of 2 years earlier and one has to go to some years previously with a smaller Australia with a smaller work force in order to see just how bad the performance of the previous Labor Government was. So we were in a continuous period of decline, of declining living standards and those other facets of those declining living standards to which I have given quick passing reference this evening. But the philosophy of that also deserves to be borne in mind. There are people who think that they can be engaged in personal campaigns of vilification to vindicate their position. In politics they adopt the court room position all the time but unless people are able to live decently all of those protestations of court room rights which are so actively pursued by the Sydney silk that leads the Labor Party come to nothing. </para>

            <para>-You not only wear loud shirts, you portray the essential narrowness and the bigotry of your own Victorian Labor Party. The Victorian Labor Party has been a millstone around the neck of the Australian Labor Party for 25 years and it is personified in the honourable member for Melbourne. One has only to listen to him: Bark and the old mongoose looks backwards. One can see a departure from that sense and from that philosophy by the alternative government in Australia and it was for those reasons above all other reasons that alternative government was rejected. </para>

        <para>If I may I will look at things in another sense and look at the propositions that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> made last night because he made a number of propositions which are very important to be borne in mind. We know that we are unable to get to a state of economic equilibrium in Australia unless cost pressures are significantly reduced. Those cost pressures have to be reduced with an abiding sense of social justice and an abiding sense of the desire to distribute the burden in Australia. There are 3 propositions that the Prime Minister made last night which in fact have a very great and very overwhelming industrial significance. </para>
        <para>One proposition was the one on which the Government supports wage indexation, and that is plateau indexation. In other words, what the Government is saying in that proposition is simply this: We would desire to bring cost pressures down in Australia while guaranteeing for Australian workers below the average wage a living standard able to keep pace with inflation. At the same time the Prime Minister also proposed tax indexation which means that living standards in terms of household dollars disposable dollars- will be able to be retained by those citizens earning above the average wage. The third proposition the Prime Minister made and it is the first time it has been put together in this way in the history of this nation- is simply that the Government will attempt to maintain living standards for those on low incomes and those on high incomes with dependants. So there is a proposition which is designed to retain the levels of disposable income and disposable dollars during the period when cost pressures have to be reduced for Australians on low incomes, Australians on high incomes and Australians on those incomes with dependants. That is a very important social package and it must have meaning in this country. </para>

            <para>- Never been tried before, as the honourable member has emphasised. The British Labour Government, for example, which is in a similar bind but rather worse, in trying to reduce cost pressures in that nation is not going to the same length to provide social justice by guaranteeing disposable incomes to its own citizens with varying numbers of dependants and at various levels of income. I believe therefore that that proposition, that that deal, that that offer- because it is an offer- ought to be heeded by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Above all, the Arbitration Commission must be concerned with the take-home pay in people's pay packets or the income available to households. Those 3 propositions have a great deal to do with what is available to people and to households. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I hope that in that sense the Government becomes very active in seeking to sell what it has proposed and what it put forward last night. It is quite clear that the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions will not seek to sell it. He has a political career in mind. He intends to challenge the honourable member for Port Adelaide; we know that. He is not concerned with economic equilibrium. He is not concerned with protecting the rights of those people whose rights have to be protected during times such as these. We know the Government not only has to sell this from Parliament but also has to sell it on shop floors, in offices and on the wharves throughout Australia, because there are other union leaders in the nation whose job it is to wreck and muck up the economy. We remember only last year the case of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and Carmichael and Halfpenny who, because the workers of this country supported wage indexation and because they agreed with the proposition of tax indexation, could get nothing but a day-long strike. It was in that sense that we saw that workers in Australia had the sense to know that the alternatives to what we were proposing- the Labor Party was proposing some of the same measures- should not be abandoned for the sake of union leaders whose desire was to cause social wreckage and economic disaffection. </para>
        <para>I hope that the 3 strands of the Prime Minister's offer last night are heeded by those who ought to heed them. I hope they are heeded by those who have to sell them. It is quite clear that the path of recent years deserves to be reversed. There is room within which it can be reversed. It is clear that the announced Budget deficit in terms of Reserve Bank borrowings is not quite as large as the published figures indicate. The published figures indicate it is of the order of $4,800m. Honourable members will notice that I still use the English numbers. In terms of effective Reserve Bank new finance it is a little over $3,000m. That difference gives the Government more room to manoeuvre in respect of the current economic position in Australia than is generally realised. </para>
        <para>When one appreciates that in those circumstances there is also great evidence that the rate of market-caused inflation is decreasing very rapidly- for example, the last consumer price index in all items excepting food showed the greatest drop over a quarter for very many years- I believe we are at a significant turning point. I believe that significant turning point can only be gained and can only be secured if 4 areas of the population with responsibility realise the social justice and the sense of fairness of what is being done. Three of those sections are simply the Arbitration Commission, employers, and business, which still retains a great obligation to expand employment opportunities as quickly as it possibly can. After all, business must realise that if it does not expand employment opportunities to provide jobs the voter will opt for another kind of system which will not be so good for business. All the Government can do is provide the ingredients with which those with goodwill are able to generate something that is worth while for Australia. The fourth group amongst whom there should be an appreciation of what is being offered are the workers. I believe that they will and that they will show great sense about what the Prime Minister offered last night, j lust as they showed significant sense during the last months of the Labor Government. They know when something that is being offered is fair. They know when a government is trying to protect their rights as well as to uplift the totality of the Australian community and the Australian economy. The sense of justice that underlay last night's proposition ought to be appreciated. </para>

          <para>- I was astounded by the humbug and hypocrisy of the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns).</inline> The Government Parties are still talking about what the Australian Labor Party did when it was in government. Let us look at the real question of unemployment. Unemployment today is no better than it was 6 months ago when the Liberal and National Country parties became the government. Basically they have done nothing about it. The honourable member for Lilley was greatly concerned about what the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions said about wage indexation last night following the address to the nation by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> He said that the Government would not get the co-operation of the ACTU unless the ACTU got the co-operation of the Government. This Government was elected on a promise of retaining wage indexation. What was the first thing it did? The first thing it did when the matter came up for consideration in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was to ask for a 3.2 per cent increase in wages rather than the 6.4 per cent as required under indexation. If the Government wants to double cross people- that is what its action amounts to- I think it will get the type of co-operation to which a double-crosser is entitled. </para>

        <para>Like a lot of other people, I am trying to find out just what the Prime Minister did say last night. The medicine is to be doled out on Thursday night by the Treasurer. That is what the Prime Minister kept saying last night. He dealt with matters in an air-fairy manner. Many people were disappointed with what they heard last night. I know I stayed home to listen to what the Prime Minister had to say because one always has to know what the enemy is doing. I expected to hear something, but nothing was forthcoming. One thing that is obvious is that Medibank is under challenge from the Liberal and National Country parties. They are going to whittle it away. Once again they have been guilty of humbug. When the Labor Party endeavoured to impose a levy for Medibank the then Opposition used its numbers in the Senate to stop it. Now the same people in government are going to do the thing which they rejected only last year in the Senate. Because of the increased cost of Medibank and because there is no levy the Government is now accusing the former Government of being responsible for a huge deficit brought about by the obstruction of the Liberal and National Country parties in the Senate. Honourable members opposite have to face up to their share of responsibility for things that have gone on. Look at what the Whitlam Government did in the field of social security. Look at the improved benefits that were given to people who needed aid. Compare what we spent on education with the paltry, piling amount spent by the previous Liberal-Country Party government. It spent $440m in its last full year as the Government as against $ 1902m allocated by the Labour Party in the 1975-76 Budget. Compare those achievements with the whittling away of the rights of people in which the Government is now indulging. No doubt a few more backhanders will be meted out on Thursday night by the Treasurer. </para>
        <para>This Government has nothing to be proud of. Its record came up for close scrutiny not in the opinion polls but in the cold hard reality of the ballot-box on 1 May in New South Wales. Its State colleagues got their ears belted off. It was only the gerrymander of electorates in typical Liberal-Country Party fashion that made the result appear so close after being dragged out day after day. The Labor Party polled the majority of votes in New South Wales. There is the real indication of what the people of this country think of the things the Government is doing. It is obvious why <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Willis called on the election some 6 months earlier than he need have. The Prime Minister had tipped him off- You had better get it in pretty soon, boy, or you will really get a lacing because after our mini-Budget comes down at the end of May and our Budget comes down in August you just will not win one seat'. That is the situation. I will be interested to hear how the honourable member for Lilley will justify the unpopular things which the Treasurer will dole out on Thursday night and again in August in the Budget. </para>
        <para>Some of the things that I want to deal with tonight in the limited time available to me relate once again to the tardiness of this Government in doing something for an industry in this country that employs directly and indirectly something like 5000 men and women. I am referring to the shipbuilding industry which is slowly but surely falling to pieces because of the need for this Government to decide what it is to do with ship building. Will it retain ship building or will it not? When this Government came into office the shipyards had orders. There was a need to place orders. Orders were in the offing, as I will outline in a moment. I want to deal with the policy expressed by the Government when it was in Opposition. I have a publication that was circulated by the now Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> which set out the whole transport policy of the then Opposition. If the ideas pinched from us were taken out of the document and only the ideas of the Opposition left in, the document would contain less than one page. I wish to deal with page 6. Under the heading <inline font-style="italic">Shipbuilding</inline> it states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An Australian shipbuilding and repair industry is essential to the national interest. The Liberal and Country Parties believe Australia must maintain an independent capacity to provide and service the relevant requirements of our commercial shipping and our defence forces. A Federal Liberal and Country Party Government will pursue policies which ensure the shipbuilding and repair industry operates as competitively and efficiently as possible. In this we will provide a building subsidy to protect our relatively small but vital industry. </para>

        <para class="block">It is now over 6 months since the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> became Ministers in the Liberal-Country Party, first of all in the caretaker Government and then in the Government after 13 December. Even at this date, 18 May, it appears that they are no closer to presenting a policy and making a decision on what they intend doing in the shipbuilding industry. I sat in on 2 delegations from the State Dockyard, one from the shop committee executive and the other from workers from the plant who came to Canberra to approach the various Ministers in an endeavour to get a decision out of the Government. All that I heard from the Minister was unnecessary abuse of the men who had come here. He charged them with threatening to hold stoppages unless he saw them. That was not true. No such threat had at any time been levelled against the Minister. The Minister gave them aline of baloney that any Irishman would have been proud of, but at no point did he come up with one fact or one figure to indicate what his Government would do in regard to shipbuilding. I believe the delegation will be here again on Thursday of this week in an endeavour to get an answer out of the Government as to what it is doing. </para>
        <para>Already people from the Whyalla shipyard have been here trying to get out of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> the Government's policy. It is obvious to me that the Government does not have a policy. It cannot make up its mind what it is going to do. On 29 April 1976 I directed a question to the Prime Minister. I set out some facts, asked the Government's policy on shipbuilding and when the industry could expect to hear the Government's policy on shipbuilding. I then outlined the situation in certain shipyards. This is the answer I got: </para>

        <para class="block">The Minister for Transport was in New Zealand at the time attending a conference. I make no comment about that. The facts of the matter are that the question did not belong to the Minister for Transport; it belonged to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in another place. That question was asked on 29 April. At this date, 18 May, still no decision on the industry has come from the Government. At this date Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd has two 40 000 ton bulk ships under construction. The first will be completed in May 1977 and the second in November 1977. Two trans-Tasman retro ships are being built for the Union Steamship Company. They are to be completed in June 1976 and February 1977. Honourable members can see that there is a need for the Government to make an early decision on policy so that orders can be placed, otherwise that yard will be forced to start laying off labour at an early date. The State Dockyard in Newcastle is building a vehicle deck container ship which is to be completed in June this year. Two 25 000 ton dead weight bulk ships are being built for the Australian National Line, the first to be completed in November 1976 and the second in May 1977. Once again this yard is in a perilous position regarding employment and unless orders are placed it will have to lay off labour. By rights they should be laying off labour now. I know that the drawing office has completed all the plans necessary to fulfill these orders. They have done all the work in anticipation of getting the three or four 15 000 ton bulk carriers that ANL put out to tender some months ago. </para>
        <para>It is not a question of there being no ships to build and of there being no need for ships in Australia. There is a need for coastal shipping to be built in Australian shipyards. ANL has made a decision that it needs to replace its Lake class ships. If it does not replace them now the cost of the 20 years survey will be monstrous. The building of the ships will not be an economic proposition if another 20 years survey has to be carried out. ANL has made its decision. It will replace that class of ship with three or four 15 000 ton bulk ships. Tenders have been called and have closed for these three or four ships. It is up to the Government to make a decision on policy. BHP has called tenders for two 13 500 ton general purpose ships. Tenders closed on 28 November and as yet an order has not been placed because that company is waiting for the Government to make a decision as to when and where those ships should be built. I know where those ships should be built. </para>

            <para>-It is obvious where the interests of the honourable member for Riverina lie. He would sooner have the ships built in Korea, Japan, Taiwan or anywhere with cheap labour than here in Australia. He wants subsidies, phosphate bounties and the like for his rural producers but he is not prepared to give anything to the secondary industries of this country. There is nothing wrong in giving the superphosphate bounty to people who need it, but I am damned if I can see any sense in doling out $5,000 a year to the Prime Minister. Millionaire Mai does not need it. The people in the shipbuilding industry do need assistance. </para>

        <para>There is a need for shipping. The Bureau of Transport Economics did a study on the needs of the oil industry on the coast ways. There is a need, within the next 5 years, to build a 20 000 to 30 000 ton product carrier to service the coast of Australia with oil products. ANL has a 16-year contract with John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd to build and to operate a 20 000 ton slab carrier. Eight ships should be and need to be built in an Australian yard. If only this Government would make up its mind. There is a need to replace the <inline font-style="italic">Tambo River,</inline> which was originally the <inline font-style="italic">Takasako,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Tolga.</inline> There is a need to replace the <inline font-style="italic">Iron Endeavour</inline> which the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd has had on the coast for some years now, sometimes operating full time and sometimes on a one-off one-overseas trip. There is a need for this work. All that honourable members opposite have to do is make up their minds and stop the Minister from foxing and clowning as he does when people who are concerned about their jobs and about the future of their industry come to see him. </para>
        <para>The Government has a responsibility to ensure the continued employment of some 2200 men at Whyalla, 1900 of them employed by BHP, 200 to 300 employed in the back-up industries which do the sub-contracting work, 2000 men employed at the State Dockyard and 300 to 400 men who provide the back-up to that particular industry. It is up to the Government to ensure that the countries which have cheap labour, about which the honourable member for Riverina is so concerned- Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan- are not building ships for Australian work at the expense of Australian workmen. The Government must stop the dumping on the Australian market of overseas built ships. There is a simple way out of it. It is better to employ Australians on building these ships than to employ people overseas. </para>
        <para>All the major overseas countries, including the United Kingdom and Sweden, are concerned with the dumping that is taking place. Japan has a serious problem because of the fall-off in the number of tankers and bulk ships being built throughout the world today, so Japan is prepared to build these ships for less than cost in order to use its shipyards to provide employment for its own people. Rather than find work for them this Government would sooner put Australian workers on the unemployment benefit and then call them dole bludgers. </para>

            <para>- The previous Government found work for them and had shipyards in full time employment. Those are the facts. We accept that the Australian shipbuilding industry is labour intensive, which is unfortunate in a country which has probably the highest labour cost of any shipbuilding countries in the world. Other countries have highly capital intensive industries. It is time that the Government of this country did something about assisting to modernise and to bring Australian shipyards up to a standard where they can compete. I will not say for one second and I am not stupid enough to believe that the Australian shipbuilding industry can compete with Japan on prices. Japan has the most highly sophisticated shipbuilding industry in the world. It has taken away a lot of work from the United Kingdom and Sweden, which is another highly sophisticated shipbuilding country and which is highly capital intensive rather than labour intensive. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I believe that the Australian industry is learning. The previous Government appointed a shipbuilding forum which went overseas last year. It contained representatives of management, trade unions and the men off the floor of the workshop. Together they looked at various shipyards throughout the world. The result of that forum has been a better understanding and realisation of just what is going on in shipyards throughout the world. As a younger man I was able to go overseas as a trade unionist and see what was going on. These people now have had an opportunity of knowing the position. There is a much different approach at the trade union level today. </para>
        <para>There is a need for the shipbuilding industry to get away from the multiplicity of trade unions. I see no reason why there cannot be a craft union and a non craft union in every shipyard. Jack Egerton and I were successful in Queensland in getting one industrial agreement which covered all the trade unions. The Liberal and Country parties have had 23 years to do something about it and they have done nothing. There is no reason why unions such as the Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia, the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia. the Transport Workers' Union of Australia, the Federated Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Association of Australasia and the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia in a shipyard could not be members of one union. The Liberal and Country parties have done aU they can to hinder and stop the amalgamation of trade unions, which is to the advantage of the industry in question. So we come to the point. There is a need for greater capital investment in the shipbuilding industry. There is a need for the Government to make up its mind. The Government has been in office for 6 months and a week now and has done nothing about it. </para>

            <para>-In this Bill, as with other measures associated with customs matters, the Government is proceeding on its path of saying as little as possible to the Parliament and leaving all the details to the officials. It is very difficult to associate the fine words of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> who is now at the table, of 29 April last when at page 1810 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he promised to encourage debate on such matters, with the brief second reading speech with which he introduced this Bill. This Bill deals with the value for duty provisions of the custom tariff. It replaces a system that has been in operation since 1922. The value on which the percentage duties are levied is of fundamental importance to any system of protection, and the Customs Act defines the mis-stating of that value as smuggling. So when a change is proposed to that fundamental base it behoves us to proceed with some care. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposals put forward by the Minister effectively change the current base from that of the price paid or the local domestic price in the country of origin to what is effectively the fan market price of a transaction at arm's length. The convention, which appears as a schedule to the Bill, is one drawn up by the Customs Cooperation Council in Brussels. It details the basis which is used by parties to the convention. One of the requirements is that in broad terms the value for duty base shall be that of cost, insurance and freight- the ci.f. value. That is a reasonable base, and countries which have adopted it have no trouble in setting their levels of protection accordingly. But all along our system has been based on what is virtually the free on board price of goods; that is, the amount less insurance and freight. For Australia to adopt the convention would mean a change to the situation where importers would be paying duty on the insurance and freight. The further away from the source of trade, the greater would be the differential payment with its consequent effects on international trade. </para>
          <para>So we find that in this Bill a different basis is adopted. It is notionally, and I particularly stress that word, the f.o.b. price again, and that is done by clause 4 of the Bill inserting section 154 (3) (d). According to the Minister, the modification is based on a protocol which is awaiting ratification. We have heard of this protocol before. It is set out as appendix 4 of the Green Paper on customs valuation, where it appears without a date. Where a system of valuation has been adopted by over 90 countries, and international trade is flowing on that basis, there would be great reluctance to introduce a change, or even the opportunity to change. One can imagine the confusion which would reign if one of the countries were to adopt this protocol, for it would change the whole level of duties. My understanding is that the proposal has been before the Customs Co-operation Council for some years and it is curious that the Minister should dismiss it so lightly. I would Uke to hear from him just when he expects this protocol to be ratified. </para>
          <para>There are broader social issues at stake. One would have expected the Minister, in introducing such important legislation, to have made at least a passing reference to the issues raised at paragraph 6.1 5 of the Green Paper, with its point that to the extent that an f.o.b. system does not result in a minimisation of social costs there will be a welfare loss to the community. Instead, he tells us that the Green Paper, which canvassed various issues but made no recommendations, was 'generally well received by industry and commerce'. </para>
          <para>I now want to turn, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> to some other peculiar aspects of the Minister's second reading speech. With exceptions, which I shall come to, the Minister informed the House that an interdepartmental committee was able to conclude that any difference in total customs duty payable following the implementation of the new system was 'likely to be negligible'. Yet one of the changes which will occur is that henceforth duties will be charged on the outside packages which until now have been dissected in the entry and entered free of duty. The Green Paper reports that there is an average duty rate of 27% per cent so that the amount Will henceforth be charged on the outside packages. It may be a small amount for each shipment, but according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, outside packages imported in 1974-1975 were valued at $60,899,002, meaning a duty collection of the order of $ 16.7m. There will be marked changes in the sales tax which is collected and these are set out in chapter 7 of the Green Paper. Yet sales tax is a revenue item. The duties of customs are said to be protective and not for revenue raising. When everyone has put their mark-up on this extra revenue collected on importation, the consumer in the end is likely to be paying some $30m extra. </para>
          <para>For an unknown change in the rate of sales tax collection, for the additional collection of $ 16.7m in customs duty, for some absurd impost on consumers, the Minister managed to devote a couple of lines of his speech. He said it would simplify entry procedures and be more in keeping with commercial procedures. We can find that note 2 to annex II will be added to by the exclusion of containers. We do not find any reference there to the fact that some packaging materials, for example, pallets, are required to be dealt with separately by the tariff, and according to the publication, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Customs Valuation Booklet,</inline> issued in April of this year, these will not be included in the value for duty. As I have said, to all these topics, the Minister devoted a couple of lines in his speech. </para>
          <para>There are other aspects of the change. With caution, the interdepartmental committee, in its Green Paper, said that there were arguments that the abandonment of the present system might lead to a lowering of protection but this could be corrected by tariff revision. And what does the Minister say in his second reading speech? He says that the committee recognised that there could be significant variations in the amount of duty payable, leading to adverse effects on local industries or importers. But never fear, says the Minister, provision will be made for the Industries Assistance Commission to consider possible tariff adjustments for a period of 6 months after adoption of the new system. I ask the Minister whether he is seriously putting forward the proposition that, if the value on which the duties are charged is reduced, and that information will only be available to the importer and the Customs officials handling the invoices, the local industry will be immediately aware of the erosion of their protection. They will only suspect it as they lose markets to imported goods. </para>
          <para>There are probably other changes which will affect importers. Let the Minister explain to us whether all the charges now to be included by note 2 in annex II are already included in the value for duty under the present system. If they are not, what new items are included and what effect will they have on the duties. Let him tell us the reaction he has had from the mercantile community when it realises that henceforth the amount on which it would pay duty would be increased by the allocation of advertising expenses over a period, although unrelated to the particular goods- as set out in the <inline font-style="italic">Valuation</inline></para>

I quote all these from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Customs Valuation Booklet.</inline> As a layman, I find this legislation most confusing. Nowhere in existence can I find a copy of the convention as it will exist when this legislation comes into force and it is quite apparent that we will all be faced with difficulties in reading it. </para>
          <para>When the Bland Committee, the Committee on Administrative Discretions, published its final report in October 1973- Parliamentary Paper No. 316 of 1973- it devoted a great deal of the report to the operations of the then Customs Department. It looked at a wide range of administrative discretions and recommended that a review process should be instituted for them. Commencing at page 1 13 of the report, we find a recommendation that appeals should be provided in the case of the value for duty of goods, in sections 154 and 160 of the Customs Act, and in section 7 of the Customs Tariff, in the f.o.b. price in the Customs Tariff section 8 on the inland freight charges for goods from Canada in section 155 of the Customs Act and on the determination of the rate of exchange in section 157. </para>
          <para>The result of those recommendations appears in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. What is missing from the Schedule at page 29 of that Act is the review of the value for duty and Canadian inland freight provisions and that could be understandable in the light of the changes which were even then proposed. Of course the Administrative Tribunals Act, in section 25 (2), made provision for new legislation to be added to the matters subject to review by the Tribunal but that does not appear in this Bill, before us. One thing the Bland Committee did favour was the provision in section 158 for the appointment of experts to arbitrate whenever there was doubt about the declared value of goods- it appears at page 62 of that report- but in this Bill section 158 has been removed. In the newly issued booklet, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Customs Valuation Booklet,</inline> paragraph 3.20 says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It may sometimes be appropriate to have recourse to valuation by experts acceptable to the importer and the Department. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now the Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot come into this House and propose the abolition of the legislation which provides for experts, saying that it is now redundant, while his Department tells the world that experts will be used. </para>
          <para>There are other provisions. Reading the booklet it seems to have little relationship to what is in this Bill but rather is an extension determined by officials. That may be necessary in the changing commercial world but it is equally necessary that there should be clear and concise means of appealing from arbitrary official decisions. And how much certainty will there be in business? Bureau of Customs notice no. 76/41 tells the importing community that advice will be available from Customs Houses but that the prime responsibility for establishing the value rests with the importer. Decisions will not be given on the acceptability of valuation assessments before the entry is lodged, that is before the goods are here. What confidence can industry have in this arrangement, save to rely on the good graces of Customs officials? </para>
          <para>It is no use the Minister pointing out that an action at law lies under section 167. That section as it stands says that, if one protests about the amount of duty, the duty charged is the correct duty unless the importer begins a court action. If and when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act comes into force, an appeal may lie to that body, with a further appeal to the courts on questions of law alone. But all along section 216 of the Customs Act will sit there. The Collector of Customs can detain the goods for as long as he likes if he is not satisfied as to the stated value. With the abolition of section 158, the importer has no recourse but to wait until the officials have determined just what the value will be. </para>
          <para>We recognise that with the adoption of this convention there is going to be a very marked change in the valuation system. The valuation booklet is full of descriptions of what will be notionally calculated and amounts which until now have not been affected by the tariff. I am sure that once the system comes into operation many honourable members will hear from importers who have incurred the extra costs. We also recognise that in abandoning the base of current domestic value there may be an erosion of the protection now afforded to local industry. It is a massive change, one that should not have been brought into this House without the most specific information on its effects. But in principle we do not oppose the change in the base of valuation. </para>

          <para class="block">Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> for taking the action that has led to the introduction of the Customs Amendment Bill into the chamber. I also take pleasure in associating my Party with this legislation. It is timely, because the procedures for the valuation for duty purposes contained in the present provisions of the Customs Act are unsatisfactory. The system is based upon a valuation at the free on board level on the higher amount as between the actual price paid by the importer and the current domestic value of the goods in the country of export. As the Minister indicated in his second reading speech, this system is currently faced with increasing administrative and legal problems as evidenced by the decisions handed down by the High Court in 1974 and 1975. The major amendment contained in this Bill is concerned with the introduction of what is known as the B russ ells Definition of Value. The main feature of this definition is the notional concept that the value for duty of any imported goods is the amount which those goods would fetch on the open market between a buyer and a seller independent of each other. It is a concept for general use irrespective of the terms under which the goods are imported. </para>
          <para>The Bill is not a surprise move on the part of the Minister to cause problems in the Department of Customs or to confuse those involved in the business of importing. One has only to be aware of the discussions, the investigations and the evaluation of the proposal which forms the basis of this Bill to know that it is a timely and much needed piece of legislation. In July 1973 it was publicly suggested that Australia should adopt the Brussels Definition of Value. A Green Paper has been available on this subject since February 1975. Customs officers have been conducting seminars and lectures on the details of the Brussels Definition of Value for importers and importing agents for some months. Consequently I do not believe that there can be any criticism which suggests that this legislation has been introduced in haste. Unquestionably it does entail some major changes in the overall system, but I believe that these will prove to be beneficial in the long run. No change in any system can be achieved without some problems. All honourable gentlemen would, or should, readily accept this. However, I believe that the problems ensuing from the adoption of the Brussels Definition of Value would not be lessened if the introduction of this Bill were to be postponed. Problems will occur because they will stem from the detailed implementation of the proposal; they will not stem from the timing of the introduction of the proposal. The honourable member for </para>
          <para class="block">Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> criticised the timing of the introduction of this Bill; but he certainly did not offer any constructive alternative and 1 do not really believe he has one to offer. </para>
          <para>In its execution the Bill is a very complex piece of legislation. It will require some effort on the part of importers to adapt to the changes as quickly as possible and to understand the details of it. The Brussels Definition of Value forms the basis for the valuation systems of over 90 countries including most of Australia's major trading partners. I urge the Minister to look more closely at the tariff implications of the proposed changes to the Brussels Definition of Value. The committee which prepared the Green Paper on this subject recognised that in particular cases there could be significant variations in the amount of duty payable, leading to adverse effects on local industries and importers. This is extremely serious because in my opinion we must not allow the situation to develop whereby we actually cause hardship in any Australian industry, particularly through our own actions, and then call in the Industries Assistance Commission to consider the problem. The damage will have been done. </para>
          <para>Surely we have sufficient evidence of how Australian industry can suffer from the actions of governments. For example, the 25 per cent tariff reduction by the previous Government brought disaster- yes, disaster- to some sections of Australian industry. We must remember that this type of disaster is measured in the loss of jobs by Australian men and women. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he will act before any damage is done to any Australian industry as a result of this legislation. If an industry is considered to be non-essential, inefficient or necessary to be closed in the light of the Brussels Definition of Value, I believe that a warning should be given to that industry and alternative arrangements for employment made for the men and women whose jobs would be affected. I cannot emphasise this point too much. I repeat my plea for the Minister to give his assurance that this situation will be avoided. I support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- As my colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> has said, the Opposition is not opposed to the principles of the Customs Amendment Bill, that is, to a change in the basis of the valuing of goods for customs purposes. We recognise that there are difficulties with the present system and that there may be loopholes which will be plugged by this Bill. But that does not mean we are content to let legislation pass without comment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It seems to me that in this Bill we are missing the precise and elegant wording, the meticulous attention to detail that we have come to expect from the First Parliamentary Counsel. I remind the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> that in the very first customs case that came before the High Court- Murray and Company v Collector of Customs (1903), 1 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 25- Chief Justice Griffiths set out at page 36 the criteria for a customs measure. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In construing them,-  that is, customs measures it  is not unimportant to remember that this is a provision relating to the tariff, and it is common knowledge that tariffs have serious effects on trade. It is important that persons engaged in the trade should know the  existing  law, and it is said to be important that they should also know what the law is likely to be in the near future. At any rate it is important that they should be able to know by reading the statute what the law is upon any particular point. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But in this important legislation, which will form the basis of our international trade for many years to come, those canons of construction seem to have been ignored. We find that there will be a schedule to the Act- a schedule containing the convention. That convention will be modified in ways set out in paragraphs (a) to (g) of the proposed new sub-section 154 (3), whilst over it all, like pepper and salt, is the wording of paragraph (h) of that sub-section putting a proviso on the word 'freight' whenever it appears. Nowhere is there a way of looking at the convention as amended. Nowhere is there a sign of the protocol which leads to paragraph (d) of sub-section 1 54 (3). Of course, the Minister may have had in mind the consequences of departing from a draft convention as exemplified in the Kellerman Lines case. How much simpler it would have been to remove from the Customs Act the existing provisions of section 154 and replace them with the words which put the convention into effect. How much simpler it would have been to leave section 155 in its present form instead of trying to insert wording about inland freight in Canada in any place where it might conceivably fit. If I can take the Minister at the table back to his law school days, he will remember the words in the case of Dean v Green, 1882, volume 8, Probate Division, page 79. The words of Lord Penzance, reported at page 89, state that it would be contrary to the recognised principles upon which courts of law construe Acts of Parliament to enlarge the conditions of the enactment and thereby restrain its operation by any reference to the words of a mere form given for convenience's sake in a schedule. The Minister will also recall the further rule, admittedly applying only to private Acts of </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament, that the words in a schedule cannot be construed to enlarge the words in the Act. All of the notes in Pan II of the schedule in this Bill could have been inserted as interpretive clauses if necessary, but there is a larger issue. The Minister will recall the case of Salomons v Commissioners for Customs and Excise, 1967, Volume 2, Queen's Bench Reports, page 116, in which a gentleman who had imported a polaroid camera into Britain had its value assessed under the convention we are now adopting and took the issue right through to the Court of Appeal. The Minister will remember that the case turned on the question of which market was to be considered in setting the market price. It is true that to make for certainty our courts follow the Court of Appeal in commercial matters. But when the law has been expounded as it was in Salomons' case and the meaning of the words determined, why can it not be included in the definition clauses of a Bill such as this? In fact, if I read paragraphs 2.41 and 3.16 of the Australian Customs Valuations booklet correctly, I am doubtful whether the decisions of the court are being followed. The Minister will soon have to explain how section 152 of the Customs Act fits in with the proposition in paragraph 2.41 of that booklet. </para>
          <para>Salomons' case raises another issue. It was said that for the valuation of non-commercial goods the British customs had an entirely different system, one carried out by administrative action. Reading paragraph 2.43 of the valuation booklet it appears that there is also a similar system operating in Australia. It may be that simpler methods are needed to value noncommercial shipments, but if that is so it should be included in the legislation. Last year more than 800 000 Australians went abroad as tourists. Most tourists bring something back to Australia. Are all their souvenirs and mementos, their tape recorders and radios, to be valued by a method which differs from this legislation which is solemnly put before us as the method of valuing goods imported into Australia? </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I have been putting to the House the proposition that when we undertake to adopt an international convention and then pass domestic legislation to do so it is all very well to place the convention in the legislation as a schedule, but it is just as important that the enacting legislation which puts the convention into effect should be clear to all those who have to deal with it. This Bill does not do that. It gives us an enormous piece of legislation by reference. I doubt whether the Minister himself can tell us just what part of the convention is affected by the proviso about inland Canadian freight. </para>
          <para>The next point I want to take up with the Minister is the question of the placing of this legislation in the Customs Act at all. I am well aware of the provisions of section 55 of the Constitution. Before the Customs Tariff 1965 was introduced the tariff was no more than a schedule with some prefatory notes. But since that date it has been expanded. Section 7 provides the method by which the value of parts shall be defined. Section 8 defines how the f.o.b. price is determined- something closely akin to what we are now enacting. Section 3 1 defines the landed price. Why is it that if the value of a part is defined in one Act the value of the whole must be defined in another? Why, if the Minister is correct in his second reading speech when he says that paragraph (d) modifies the definition in the schedule to provide that imported goods be valued on an f.o.b. basis, is this being put in one Act when the power to define the f.o.b. price is in another? </para>
          <para>What does this Bill mean when sub-section (2) of proposed section 154 states that this legislation will provide the basis for duty unless the tariff provides otherwise? I noticed that in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill which this House passed a couple of weeks ago the title of the tariff had been changed. After 75 years of being one of the only 2 Acts of the Parliamentthe Excise Tariff is the other one- which did not have the word ' Act ' in its title, the Customs Tariff became the Customs Tariff Act. Presumably there was good reason for this. There must have been some discussions and the Minister will no doubt let us know those reasons as he will let us know just what the rules are that divide valuation provisions between the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the articles themselves. Article II sets out in broad terms the proposition that relationships between companies should be taken into account. It refers to a commercial, financial or other relationship, whether by contract or otherwise, between the seller or any person associated in business with him and the buyer or any person associated in business with him. How fortunate for the drafters of this convention that paragraph (2) of article II is able to define when persons are associated in business. Of course it is all right in a convention but when it comes to domestic legislation we need to be clear what we are talking about. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that honourable members are interjecting. I know of their concern that this legislation should be able to be used by people concerned with the importation of goods to Australia. It has a very real effect on the cost of business and business recovery about which they talk so much. I am delighted to see that they are so interested. Reverting to this question of business association, the Attorneys-General of every State and the Commonwealth have discussed this matter. The companies legislation in each State and Territory goes to great lengths to define whether persons are directly or indirectly associated. Our own federal foreign investment legislation contains the same provisions. But in this case the corporate veil has been lifted in the widest words. It seems to me that we are merely asking for a court to cut down the words to an extent where they will make sense. I read in paragraph 3.41 of the valuation booklet, which seems to me to be the only source of information about what the legislation is intended to do but reads more like what the customs branch will do regardless, that the onus will be on the importer to show that his purchase was not influenced by such an association. And let him look to his list of shareholders, for an importer may find that he has associations, direct or indirect, which he has never even suspected. If he manages to make a good deal in his trading he will be suspect. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Next, I should like to turn to Article III. It looks all right on its face but note 2 gives me some concern. Harking back to the same valuation booklet, I found that paragraphs 3.44 to 3.50 inclusive all take into account actions which will occur in Australia after the goods have left the control of the customs branch. I anticipate that those provisions will involve a great deal of litigation and I can do no more than warn the Minister of what 6 Justices of the High Court of Australia said in the petrol rationing case, Wagner v. Gall, 79 Commonwealth Law Reports, at page 92. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank those honourable members who have contributed to this debate and the Opposition for the support it has indicated it will give to this Bill. It is an extremely important measure with respect to customs valuation in Australia. I was particularly interested in the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Antony Whitlam)</inline> calling to memory some very celebrated cases in the 19th century relating to customs valuation. I commend the honourable member on the research and thought he has devoted to this subject, but with this legislation the Government is a little more interested in the cases of <inline font-style="italic">Caterpillar Pty Ltd</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Carmody</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Sarah Coventry Pty Ltd v. Carmody</inline> which were heard not in the 19th century but in 1974 and 1975. Both of those cases have, as the honourable member for Grayndler will freely acknowledge, led to this particular amendment Bill. It was the decision of the High Court of Australia in both of those cases, which cast serious doubt on the existing valuation system in our customs legislation, which led not only this Government but also the previous Government to believe that a change in the valuation system was necessary and that an adoption of the Brussels definition of value was a desirable course of action. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I remind the House, in case there should be any doubt that this legislation has been introduced without warning or suddenly flung upon an unsuspecting commercial community, that it was first publicly mooted in July 1 973 by, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> when he was Minister for Customs and Excise. It was then suggested that there would be a change in the system of valuation and that consideration would be given to the introduction of the Brussels definition of value. A Green Paper has been available since February 1975- some 15 months ago. Customs officers have been conducting lectures and seminars for importers and agents for several months. Any suggestion, therefore, that this legislation has been suddenly dropped out of the sky and comes as a surprise to those in the commercial community who will have to cope with it is to mislead the House. I am not suggesting that either the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> or the honourable member for Grayndler were deliberately suggesting that, but there was just the faintest hint in both their speeches that somehow or other the Government had not treated this matter seriously. The Government recognises that it is a fundamental change. This is an extremely technical matter as the context of the 2 speeches made on behalf of the Opposition indicates, but in many respects the system of valuation that is going to be adopted will, by its very nature, remove a lot of the doubts and difficulties of construction which formed the basis of the speech of the honourable member for Grayndler. </para>
          <para>Essentially the Brussels definition of value as a system of valuation is a notional concept of valuation based on the price that goods would fetch at a sale in the open market between a buyer and a seller independent of each other. The honourable member for Grayndler took me back to law school days. Might I take him back to the provisions of the sixth schedule of the Stamp Duties Act of New South Wales. In many respects the concept that the real value of something is what it would fetch on an open market between a buyer and a seller is not only an equitable system of valuation but is also a system of valuation which most people in a commercial environment will understand. We all know that commercial transactions can, by various routes and various associations, perhaps wittingly or unwittingly conceal an arrangement or an association between a buyer and a seller, and that the provisions of revenue legislation both at a State and Federal level are directed to revealing the true nature of the relationship between the parties to a particular transaction. In fact, in the 2 cases that I have cited which were so critical to the Government's decision to introduce this legislation the High Court, by reason of its decision, indicated that the existing provisions dealing with that situation were inadequate. What we have with this new system of valuation is a concept of real value on the basis of the transaction being between parties who were at arm's length and who were independent of each other. That is going to be the basis of the valuation. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Port Adelaide quite rightly raised the question of the Government's preference for the fob system as opposed to the of system. This was a fair question to raise. It is not giving away any great State secrets to say that this matter exercised the mind of the Government when it was making a decision on this. Arguments can be advanced on both sides. There are arguments of certainty and perhaps, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, there are some social arguments in favour of the of basis of valuation. Certainly the majority of countries with which Australia trades- there are 2 important exceptions- has a of basis of valuation but Australia, being remote from many of its trading partners, has a situation where freight costs, particularly air freight costs, are an important element. It is not difficult to reach the conclusion that in sheer money terms and in sheer duty terms an fob system would produce quite different results and quite different levels of duty from a of system. On balance the Government felt that an fob system of valuation was preferable to a of system of valuation. </para>
          <para>Without in any way suggesting that there are not arguments the cannot be advanced in favour of the of system the Government felt on balance, particularly having regard to the remoteness of Australia from many of her trading partners, that an fob system of valuation was preferable. One has also to take into account the desire to minimise disruption when a change of this nature is made. Australian importers have been used to a system of fob when applying our valuation systems. That was another factor the Government took into account in deciding to opt for an fob system. However this is a matter which will nat.urally be kept under review by the Government. The experience of the operation of the new system will naturally be looked at carefully. </para>
          <para>The honourable members for Port Adelaide and Grayndler were a little concerned about the brevity of my second reading speech. I am touched that they should think that I should spend more time speaking in this House but, of course, it is the content of a second reading speech that really matters. This particular legislation, as I indicated earlier, has been mooted for a long period. The concept of the change in the valuation system can be reduced to a fairly limited number of words. It is a concept that I explained a few moments ago. It is a concept that has been explained in the second reading speech. It is a concept that I believe draws a majority support- a very strong majority support- from those in the commercial community who will have to contend with this legislation. </para>
          <para>Concern was also expressed regarding the availability of appeals against valuation determinations. It is understandable concern. Reference has been made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. Honourable members on both sides of the House will forgive me for reminding the House that when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal legislation was introduced by the previous Government last year it contained no schedules at all. But for the action of the then Opposition in the Senate there would not be any schedules in that legislation. If the Government of the day had had its way we would have had a skeleton piece of legislation which established a procedure, a machinery and a path for administrative appeals but which did not specify any pieces of legislation or any categories of decisions in respect of which appeals could be brought. My understanding of the matter insofar as customs valuations are concerned is that provision is made for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where there is a dispute as to value and that that provision is to be found in Part XII of the Schedule at page 29 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. So the claim made by members of the Opposition that there is no provision for appeals in these matters is, according to my understanding, an incorrect claim. I would respectfully refer those honourable members on the other side of the House who raised this matter to an examination of page 29 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sullivan)</inline> sought from me an assurance that where there was any danger to local industry, where levels of protection to local industry might be threatened by the introduction of this new system of valuation, we would act very quickly to see that references were made to the Industries </para>
          <para class="block">Assistance Commission. I am happy to repeat for the benefit not only of the honourable member for Riverina but also the House generally that where significant variations do occur with adverse effects to local industries provision will be made for the Industries Assistance Commission to consider possible tariff adjustments for a period of 6 months after the implementation of this change, which will come into operation on 1 July of this year. I am happy to repeat that assurance. It is a genuine assurance. There is nothing token about it. We do recognise that in some cases it might be necessary for the Industries Assistance Commission to examine whether tariff adjustments should be made. We were particularly concerned that this particular provision should be made and I am more than happy to give the honourable member for Riverina an assurance in those terms. </para>
          <para>The only other comment that I would like to make is that when a new system comes into operation in an area like this no matter how much warning has been given of it, no matter how much opportunity has been provided for comments and for submissions from interested parties, there is always a natural disposition to put off until fairly near to the operative date an application of the mind to the provisions of the new legislation. Understandably there will be a period after 1 July, which is when the new system comes into operation, when the importers will be making a genuine attempt to comply with the terms of the legislation and when, through no fault of their own, through no desire on their part to mislead the Customs Bureau, mistakes are made and incorrect statements are made regarding value. I am pleased to tell the House that the Customs Bureau has had detailed consultation with the Customs Agents Federation and that a detailed indication has been given to the federation of a procedure which will be adopted to accommodate examples where a genuine attempt has been made to comply with the terms of the new system of valuation but where, through no fault of those importers who are endeavouring to comply with it, some incorrect statement of value has been made. Those procedures have been explained in detail to the federation in a letter from the Comptroller of Customs. </para>
          <para>There is a recognition that for a period of 3 months transitional and administrative arrangements of this nature should operate. The view has been taken that, after that period of time having regard to the long lead-in to this change, sufficient time will have elapsed to enable importers to comply with the terms of the new provisions. But the Customs Bureau and my department certainly recognise that there will be some genuine problems. There would be some genuine problems even if the implementation of this legislation were put off for a further period of 12 months because it is in the nature of commercial transactions when one changes a system of this nature which has operated for so many years that, no matter how much warning one gives and no matter how much time one spends explaining the provisions of the new requirements to those who will be required to comply with them, there are nonetheless during the transitional period understandable teething problems. Mistakes will be made but, providing genuine attempts are made to comply, agents and importers will not be penalised. </para>
          <para>Again I thank those who have contributed to the debate. I believe that the change in the valuation system that the House is about to approve will remove the doubts that have arisen in recent years regarding the efficacy of the existing system. It will therefore protect the integrity of the revenue. I believe that the concept of valuation contained in this legislation will be more readily understood after it has been in operation and will provide a more equitable basis for the valuation of goods than has prevailed in the past. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition supports this Bill. Frankly this Bill, like the Customs Amendment Bill, which has just passed through this House, is not one of those Bills which will rivet the attention of the gallery or those listening to this debate at home and have them lifting the roof with their cheers. In fact, it is quite a complicated machinery Bill. Two of the amendments it contains will tend to improve the effectiveness of control over foreign investment. For example, the repeal of section 29 of the Foreign Takeovers Act will ensure that foreign and domestic companies are treated in the same way under the Trade Practices Act. Under section 29 of the Foreign Takeovers Act the Treasurer has the power to issue a certificate allowing a transaction involving foreign interests to go ahead if he is satisfied that the transaction is not contrary to the national interest. However, this certificate can be regarded as being binding on the Trade Practices Tribunal, so preventing that tribunal from scrutinising transactions involving foreign persons or companies. Repeal of section 29 does not remove the Government's responsibility for scrutinising transactions with overseas interests. Rather it ensures that, where required, two assessments will be made- one by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the other by the Trade Practices Tribunal. This double assessment will ensure after this Bill goes through that, if anything, greater care is taken with foreign investment proposals. Certificates which have already been issued will not be invalidated by this amendment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A second amendment strengthening the Act involves expanding the types of foreign control which the Act regulates. By adding the word 'practices' to clause 8, additional means by which foreign control might be obtained in a company are covered by the Act. This concept of regulating 'practices', which are not described in detail in the Act, was used in the original Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act. </para>
          <para>Other amendments clarify the way in which the Act is expected to work. Section 26 of the Act requires that any foreign interests intending to acquire a substantial shareholding in an Australian company must notify the Treasurer. It was not the intention of the Labor Government in introducing this clause to prevent preliminary discussion about transactions. The important point was that no legally binding agreement should be made until there has been adequate time for scrutiny by the Treasury. It is therefore appropriate that this amendment allows conditional agreements to be discussed and made as long as they do not become binding until approval is given. </para>
          <para>The other significant amendment in this Bill is to section 38 of the Act. The amendment protects the interests of Australians who might be penalised by actions which are inconsistent with the Act. The Labor Government had this machinery Bill in mind itself when it was removed from office. It certainly could not in any way oppose its passage through this House. For the reasons I have given the Opposition supports these generally technical amendments. </para>

            <para>-On behalf of the Government I thank the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> for his remarks. I think he has made it clear to the House that there is nothing particularly contentious in the Bill we have before us. The legislation puts into effect amendments which were foreshadowed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> in his speech to the Parliament on 1 April 1976. The Bill does not materially alter the existing Foreign Takeovers Act which has been in operation since 1 January 1976. It does, however, remove certain shortcomings that exist in the Act and at the same time firms up aspects that have been part of Liberal-National Country Party policy for a very considerable time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first matter to be dealt with refers to what the Treasurer called interlocking provisions between the foreign takeovers legislation and the Trade Practices Act. Honourable members should not be too disturbed by that terminology. I have heard it said that this is highly technical legislation, but I can assure the House that it cannot be all that complicated because alas I can understand it. However, the fact is that under the existing Foreign Takeovers Act an overseas investor as defined could be presented with a quite unreasonable advantage relative to a local investor when seeking to take over or to merge with an existing Australian enterprise. At present an overseas investor must satisfy the Treasurer that his request to take over an enterprise in Australia complies with the Foreign Takeovers Act. This, of course, is treated by the Treasurer in a thoroughly confidential manner. However, as the Act exists at the moment, if the Treasurer is satisfied with the application from the foreign company the approval is recognised by the Trade Practices Commission and consequentially the foreign company is at liberty to negotiate. </para>
          <para>Let us compare this with the position of a local investor, whether he be an individual or a company seeking to take over or to merge with an existing Australian enterprise. Such an applicant may be required to go before a public hearing of the Trade Practices Commission and satisfy that body the proposal meets with the criteria under which the Commission operates. The applicant's affairs and the proposal are exposed to the public view and equally the proposal is exposed to competitors whether they be local or foreign. Clearly this is an inequitable situation between local and foreign investors and it should not be tolerated any longer. I think it is correct to say that the previous Government had given notice that it was going to take the step that is encompassed in this Bill. </para>
          <para>It is also important that one or two other apparent anomalies are to be removed and guidelines are to be tightened up as a result of this Bill. For instance, previously it was unlawful for prospective parties to a takeover under the foreign takeovers legislation to conduct negotiations in respect of the proposal. This was never intended in the spirit of the original Bill which is now the Act. It was never intended that that should be the situation and quite clearly it is impractical to expect such a provision to remain. This is a matter which is causing the Government very considerable concern because it is quite possible that there would be in the country people who have unwittingly broken the Act in this respect and for that reason, particularly in view of the fact that there are very considerable penalties which would apply to people who contravene the Act in this way, clearly this has to be tidied up and removed. This is being made retrospective to 1 January 1976 which is the date on which the existing Act was given assent. That actually leads into quite a deep subject which there is no need to pursue at the moment but if in fact there was a situation uncovered where people or a company had been in contravention of the Act reinstatement could have been required and that obviously would lead to a very untidy situation and one which the participants could not reasonably have been expected to foresee. Particularly where share trading or other operations had been going on or may have been going on, it could have led to a very delicate position which I do not think anybody on either side of the House would want to see remain. </para>
          <para>We are grateful that the Opposition has given its indication that it is supporting the amendments that are before the House. This is one of those occasions when both sides of the Parliament can be seen to be working in the common interest, the common good and to meet the national need and I think as such it is something for which both sides of the House are grateful. On behalf of the Government I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for making his remarks so succinct. There was no need for him to be so modest about the entertainment that he was about to give us. We enjoyed his speech immensely as we always enjoy Opposition speeches when they are supporting what the Government is doing. </para>

            <para>-It is a pleasure indeed, as the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baillieu)</inline> indicated, to take pan in the debate which has been led by the eminent member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> particularly as he has indicated that the Opposition is supporting a Government measure. The Bill before the House is a very technical one. It is a machinery Bill. It is designed to close loopholes which exist in the Foreign Takeovers Act which came into effect on 1 January of this year. The points have all been made quite adequately by speakers who have preceded me, but I think it is probably worth indicating that some of the provisions of this Bill were foreshadowed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> in his capacity as the shadow Treasurer in October of last year when foreign investment legislation was being debated. At that stage the Treasurer expressed doubts about the relationship between the Trade Practices Act and the Foreign Takeovers Act and indicated that there was a possible area of advantage for foreign owned companies over Australian owned companies in applications before the Trade Practices Commission. Amongst other things, this legislation will remove the interrelationship between the Foreign Takeovers Act and the Trade Practices Act so that foreign interests no longer will be able to obtain automatic approval from the Trade Practices Commission consequent upon approval for their proposal under the Foreign Takeovers Act. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are 3 or 4 other machinery matters which are of some substance and which it is appropriate to amend at this time. The substance of the Act does not really change. As has been indicated by other speakers, it is basically a machinery matter. The range of control situations which the Act is designed to cover has run into some problems. Clause 5 extends the area of control by including the words 'or practices' after the word 'arrangements' in section 8 of the principal Act. That is designed to expand the role of the Act in covering all the possible situations. The existing Act also does not exempt share or asset acquisitions which had been approved prior to the commencement of this Act and which had not been effected by that date. It was never intended that the people involved should have to re-apply. Clause 6 alters that situation. </para>
          <para>There has been a problem with the 40-day period laid down under section 26 of the existing Act. It was never intended, as far as we can see, that the 40-day restriction should operate in such a way as to inhibit normal commercial activity. Clause 7 will make the necessary changes so that if the Government agrees with something the 40-day requirement need not be fulfilled. The same thing will apply in regard to increasing shareholdings in an Australian corporation. </para>
          <para class="block">Some doubts have been raised whether transactions in contravention of section 26 would be valid. There is no reason to raise doubts about these transactions. Clause 10 will see that there is no question of invalidity resulting from decisions that might have been made unwittingly in contravention of section 26. That amendment will be retrospective to 1 January, the date on which the Act commenced, so that anybody who may have been technically in breach of the Act will not in fact suffer any consequence as a result of that action. </para>
          <para>It is very much a machinery Bill. As the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out, it is not a compelling piece of legislation. I think the House has agreed unanimously with the initiative of the Treasurer in bringing forward these matters for amendment. I believe that my Party, the National Country Party, is completely behind the Government and the Treasurer, as the Opposition is fully behind the Treasurer on this question. I think there is no point in extending the debate other than to say that the whole area of foreign investment in Australia is one about which everybody in this Parliament shares a significant concern. The measures we are debating will seek to improve the control that the Government has and also to see that the intention of the Act which was introduced last year and which is now being amended will in fact be implemented. I commend the Bill. </para>

There has been a bi-partisan debate in which we deliberately did not go into the subject of foreign investment.

              <para>-Regrettably, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> is unable to be in the chamber tonight. A very pleasant opportunity was pressed upon me and gladly accepted by me to state the Government's attitude and the fact that we welcome enormously foreign investment in Australia. I thought it quite proper that I should draw some comparison between the attitude of the present Government and the attitude of the previous Administration. If the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford),</inline> the shadow Treasurer, gets sensitive about these sorts of things he will just have to live with it. A Foreign Takeovers Bill is obviously concerned with the question of foreign investment in Australia. I cannot imagine that even the honourable member for Adelaide cannot recognise that simple fact. All foreign investment widens and deepens our economy. Therefore we are very conscious of the overall responsibilities we have in the conduct of all aspects of foreign investment, including those of a technical nature which are the subject of the Bill before the House. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>It is important that foreign investment strikes a balance between what we need for capital structure and what are the aspirations and desires of the Australian people at large. So any Bill of significance with regard to foreign investment is one in which this Government takes pride for the encouragement it is giving to foreign investment in various areas. I refer again to the tremendous damage that was done by the Labor Administration. It discouraged foreign investment throughout Australia. The Government has now set out, as outlined by the Treasurer in a statement to the Parliament flexible guidelines that will be followed as the Government does all that is possible to encourage the greatest possible investment consistent with national aspirations. </para><para>I regret my inability to be in the chamber and listen to the entire debate. The Bill is a technical one. It provides for the screening of foreign takeovers of Australian businesses and the prohibition of such takeovers where they are determined to be against the national interest. That is what the Government's policy is all about- the national interest. That is what makes it different from the policies which are encouraged by the previous Administration. The Bill provides for amendments to the Act which were foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement to the Parliament on 1 April when he set out quite clearly for the benefit of honourable members and the electorate the policy on foreign investment in Australia. This Bill retrospectively corrects certain technical deficiencies which have become app a rant since the Act's commencement on 1 January 1976. The main amendments concern the compulsory notification requirements of section 26 of the Act. The amendments will ensure that proposals which were approved but not effected prior to 1 January 1976 need not be re notified, that a proposal notified under section 26 may be proceeded with as soon as the Government approval is given and that conditional agreement to acquire shares may be entered into without attracting a penalty. </para><para>In addition the Bill also removes the link between the foreign takeovers legislation and the trade practices legislation. This was the link which enabled foreign takeover proposals to be granted automatic authorisation under the trade practices legislation. Its removal will ensure the same treatment for both Australian and foreign interests under that legislation. The Government welcomes the opportunity for this Bill to be discussed. It thanks all those who contributed to the debate, for the interest taken in it and generally for the interest, sensitive though it may be, of the Opposition. We believe that the passage of this legislation is desirable. It will form an integral part of the Government's overall attitude to foreign investment and its overall concern to see that there is a fair minded approach. Particularly important is that the Bill now breaks the link with the trade practices legislation. On behalf of the Government I thank all honourable members who took part in the debate. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech>

            <para>-The Opposition supports the Bill. The Bill is directly related to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances adopted at Vienna on 21 February 1971. The text of the Convention is set out in the schedule to the Bill. The Bill is of small content and virtually adopts only one segment of the Convention which I notice is in Article 12 3(d) which states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Consignments entering or leaving the territory of a Party not accompanied by an export authorisation shall be detained by the competent authorities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The fact is that where a consignment enters the country from a consignor who obviously is outside the country addressed to a consignee who is also outside the country- the consignment is merely passing through- we have decided that we can interfere to the extent of examining the goods, and unless there is an export authorisation those goods can be confiscated. That is the only penalty. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> quite properly referred to the fact that there are other conventions, in particular the Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 to which we are also a party and about which legislation has been passed. </para>
          <para>This Bill gives an opportunity to talk about what we as a national government can do in respect of international conventions and whether we can enter the whole field to try to perhaps control and regulate the abuse of narcotics and, of course, the use of other drugs. I am advised by many medical advisers, including those in this House, that there is quite a difference between the States as to what is deemed to be appropriate prescriptions for the use of certain substances. For example, I understand that some of the substances in Schedule 2 could not really be prescribed in New South Wales but could well be prescribed in Victoria. Cases can be found in New South Wales of addiction to one of those substances because of a prescription originally prescribed in another State. We now get the situation of the addiction being treated in New South Wales where perhaps the drug would never have been prescribed in the first instances. </para>
          <para>I mention this on the basis that Australia as a nation has a constitutional power to enter into international conventions and by so doing obtain a legal power by which it might be able- I say this with respect- to use the power more intelligently than perhaps to have this disparity of use between various States. One of the matters now mentioned is that the illicit international trade in psychotropics requires a co-ordinated, international response if it is to be controlled. The trade in narcotics is persistent and extensive because the substances are grown in relatively few regions of the world. I know that at this stage I am talking about narcotics which are, of course, a little different from psychotropic substances; nevertheless the addiction is there. </para>
          <para>One of the problems in Australia at present in regard to narcotics is that the legislation ought to be more embracing than it is now. For example, I understand that there has been a major increase in the use of heroin in Australia. The addiction is there. The substance is imported; it is not manufactured here. There is no doubt in the minds of members of the medical profession that there is a very high-powered international organisation making very substantial profits from the use of heroin by getting pushers to promote it amongst our young. This is quite a tragedy because I understand that anybody addicted to heroin has to have a financial resource of about $60 a day. Honourable members can understand the sort of crime potential there is if a financial resource of that sort is necessary. The matter that we have been discussing not only in this legislation but also in other legislation is important. </para>
          <para>I feel it is worthy of comment when looking at this Convention- I make no criticism of the Government but I understand there is some sensitivity in the States- to address our minds to the fact that the Bill does not give effect to the requirement that countries shall require certain substances to be supplied only on a medical prescription, as outlined in Article 9. Article 10 requires each country to insist on certain warnings on packages and to prohibit advertising. The BUI does not mention this. The BUI does not deal with the matter of records referred to in Article 11. That Article contains detailed requirements on countries to insist on the keeping of records by virtually all persons handling psychotropic substances. As I said before, the only provision of the Convention given effect to by the Bill is that contained in Ankle 12. Ankle 15 requires the establishment of a system of inspection of manufacturers, distributors, exporters and importers. The Bill does not give effect to this. </para>
          <para>Article 20 requires action to be taken in relation to treatment, education and rehabilitation of persons who abuse psychotropic substances. The BUI does not deal with this, but this and other matters obviously may not require legislative action. Article 21 specifically refers to action against illicit traffic at the national level. This, it would seem, would justify action under the external affairs power. Article 22 makes elaborate provision about penalties and allows treatment as an alternative to punishment. This is to apply to acts contrary to a law adopted in pursuance of the Convention. By not adopting such a law, the requirements about penalties are avoided. Article 32 of the convention limits the reservations that a country may make when ratifying the convention. Clause 3 of this Ankle, however, permits reservations beyond these limits in certain circumstances. </para>
          <para>In summary, the Bill implements only one of the numerous obligations imposed on countries which are parties to the convention. The Bill authorises Australia to ratify the convention and thereby become a party to it. Some of the obligations of the convention may be implemented by other Commonwealth legislation or may be implemented by State or territorial legislation. In some areas the convention requires action of a non legislative character. Under the external affairs power most if not all the stipulations of the convention could be given effect to. Apparently at this stage the Government does not wish to take that approach. The alternative is to ensure that the total law of Australia- Commonwealth, State and territorial- accords with the convention before the convention is ratified, unless it is proposed to ratify with reservations, an approach which the convention itself discourages. </para>
          <para>It is doubtful whether the law in Australia fully accords with the convention. To say whether it does or not would require examination of laws dealing with licensing of persons who handle psychotropic substances, laws about packaging and advertising, laws dealing with records to be kept in relation to psychotropic instances and laws controlling the availability of these substances among others. I think that this legislation is a step in the right direction. Let me take this opportunity to refer generally to the world scene. The Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances are significant examples of the kinds of successes for which the United Nations Organisation is rarely praised. Often criticised for its inability to eliminate the military excesses of its members, the United Nations does have some good- in some cases, spectacular- success stories to its credit, especially in the field of health and social care. They are examples of the kind of concerted international co-operation which, if produced in other fields of international relations, could yield significant easing in international tensions. </para>
          <para>As the convention says in its preamble, it is a convention concerned with the health and welfare of mankind. It notes with concern the public health and social problems resulting from the abuse of certain psychotropic substances. The idea of the convention is to prevent and combat abuse of such substances and the illicit traffic to which it gives rise. The Bill goes a substantial way towards that idea. Accordingly, the Opposition supports the measure. </para>

            <para>Australia has long been an active supporter of an international approach to the suppression of drug trafficking and abuse. This Bill, although it is short and has an esoteric title, is an important Bill in the sense that it will contribute to blocking the trafficking in these substances. I think it is worth while to define them, as the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> did in his second reading speech. 'Psychotropic substance' is a term used to refer to substances that have the capacity to produce a state of dependence and central nervous system stimulation or depression resulting in hallucinations or disturbances in motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception or mood and in respect of which there is evidence of a likelihood of abuse so as to constitute a public health and social problem. The hallucinogens or psychotropic substances are drugs which interfere with a person's mind. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill seeks to block the transport of these substances through Australia to other countries. Our existing legislation does not allow for the control of drugs falling under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances which enter Australia in transit to another country. This Bill is designed to fill that gap. There is a compelling need to answer the increasing challenge of drug traffickers operating into Australia both as a market and as a transit point for trafficking to New Zealand. Drug intelligence to date indicates that Australia has emerged as a market worthy of inclusion in regular smuggling routes and as a transit point, especially to New Zealand; that there has been an alarming rise in the traffic of extremely dangerous drugs such as heroin, morphine and synergic acid; that there has been a resurgence in the popularity of the hallucinogens, particularly synergic acid, because the makers have corrected dosage purity deficiencies thus eliminating unfavourable side effects; that there is evidence that organised crime is involved in trafficking; and that increased resources are being used by organised crime further to refine methods of the actual process of smuggling. For example, there are more sophisticated methods of concealment especially of large shipments in cargo and vehicles, and the presence of professional couriers carrying expertly forged documents. </para>
          <para>In recent years films have been made about drug trafficking into the United States of America from France, where the laboratories are situated in Marseilles. Opium from Turkey and the Golden Triangle is shipped to clandestine laboratories in France and from there the heroin passes to the prime market, the United States of America. As I indicated, there are sophisticated methods of concealment in cargo and even in vehicles. Couriers are passing drugs in increasing numbers and are using Australia as a transit point for carrying drugs to New Zealand. </para>
          <para>Two things emerge form the current legislation: There is increasing sophistication in the methods of concealment of the drugs, and it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate and identify the couriers even with the help of computer technology. It is germane to look at some of the figures of drug seizures in Australia from 1972 to 1975. In 1972 2746 grams of opium were seized. This increased in 1975 to 4816 grams, a 200 per cent increase. In 1972, 2019 grams of heroin were seized. This almost trebled to just under 6000 grams. There was also a significant change in the amount of synergic acid seized. As indicated, with increasing purity of the synergic acid and the fact that the people in the local drug scene and in New Zealand are becoming more sophisticated about the types of drugs they need on which to get high, more people are turning to hallucinogens for trips. It is no accident that people like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Timothy</inline> Leary, the guru of the hallucinogen users in the United States, have become popular in the underworld and the peripheral fringe of this country. </para>
          <para>I think it is important to understand that this Bill helps to cut down and isolate the people who are using Australia as a transit point. It is also important to note that Australia will be acting quickly to fulfil completely its obligations under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. As one of the originating nations of the convention, Australia must soon ratify its terms so as to maintain credibility as a nation vitally concerned with the eradication of drug abuse. At this stage about 30 countries have ratified the convention. It requires the ratification of 40 countries to become operative. Therefore it is desirable that Australia should ratify the convention before it becomes operative as we have long been an active supporter of an international approach to the suppression of drug trafficking and abuse which the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> described. It is important to note philosophically that drugs of this type interfere with and cause problems in the community amongst the people who are most susceptible to them. I refer to people who are perhaps inadequate; people who may need medical care; and young people in the capital cities of Australia who are so susceptible and vulnerable to these drugs which usually are introduced to them in gradations. The drugs they start on may not be the hard drugs they mainline on. </para>
          <para>As drug traffickers and users become more sophisticated they tend to use increasingly dangerous drugs which shorten alarmingly the time from initial use to degradation and destruction. I refer, of course, to synergic acid and cocaine. It is important for the community at large to note that in the United States of America more people are now turning to cocaine, or 'mush' as it is known, for their kicks and that this is causing alarming problems in that country. It is important that this BUI be passed speedily. All members of this House, all members of the Parliament, should understand that it just closes one basket in the hope that we can prevent trafficking and the transit of these substances to New Zealand and other countries, and thus cut down on the mental degradation and anguish that use of these drugs causes. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> ) is to be congratulated for bringing the Psychotropic Substances BUI before the Parliament. It is one thing to recognise national conventions; it is another to ratify them officially. As was mentioned by the Opposition spokesman on this subject, the honourable member for Kingsford Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> this BUI covers only one aspect of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances but nevertheless it is a step in the right direction. The BUI seeks the approval of Parliament to the ratifying of that Convention. I trust that the remainder of the Convention Will be looked at at some time in the near future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Tonight I want to draw the attention of the House to two or three matters relating to drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country. In speaking about the importance of this Bill I particularly want to mention a report produced by a Senate Committee. Probably little is known in this Parliament or indeed in this country about this report on drug trafficking and drug abuse. I believe that the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse produced it after some two or three years of deliberations. It points up the problems that exist in this country. In passing this BUI relating to a particular section of the international convention I believe we are tightening up just one other loophole that exists or could exist. LSD, or synergic acid diethyl amide as it is correctly known, is a drug which, as stated by the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Tangney <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Richardson),</inline> can be brought into this country in small containers. It is a very powerful drug, as was mentioned by the previous  speaker  who is a medico. Its ease of concealment means that it is very easy for it to be introduced into this country. </para>
          <para>The report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse is worthy of the attention of every honourable member. It deals not only with the abuse of drugs that are readily available in this country but also touches on the important aspect of the over-supply of drugs by the medical profession, and this is a real problem. The hard drugs that are mentioned are coming mainly from SouthEast Asia, India, the United States of America and parts of Europe. </para>
          <para>I understand that the Minister wants to get this Bill passed through the House before it adjourns. I have much pleasure in supporting its passage but I want to refer briefly to the excellent work of the men of his Department. In my capacity as  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation I have had some contact with these men. I know of their dedication and of the excellent work they are doing in the drug detection area. I trust that the Minister will give them every encouragement in the future to rid Australia of the scourge of drug trafficking that is so detrimental to the health of an affluent nation such as we have in Australia. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I would like to thank the House for the bipartisan approach adopted to this legislation. As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> rightly points out, it only ratifies a section of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. I will take into account the comments he made about other sections of the Convention. I do not think he would mind my saying that this Government takes a slightly different approach to the external affairs power under the Commonwealth Constitution from that adopted by our predecessors. Indeed, the Government takes the view that of the matters covered by the Convention it is only in the area relating to trafficking that the Commonwealth is directly and indisputably involved and that other matters are more appropriately matters for the States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should mention that recently there was a meeting of a standing body on the control of drugs. That body is chaired by the Permanent Head of my Department and it includes State officials. Arising out of that discussion the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> is entering into correspondence with the State Premiers on questions relating to drug penalties and drug abuse. I would like to mention to the House that the decision taken by this Government to ratify this Convention follows such a decision taken by the previous Government in 1973. To that extent there is a completely bipartisan approach by the Government and the Opposition. I appreciate the remarks made by the honourable member for Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodges).</inline> As this is the first piece of legislation relating to drugs that I have dealt with since becoming responsible for the Narcotics Bureau which is within my Department, I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the work of the Bureau. It is extremely difficult work, as the honourable member for Tangney <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Richardson)</inline> mentioned. Criminal methods in this area are becoming increasingly sophisticated. I think all honourable members would be aware that in recent days the Narcotics Bureau has achieved success in tracking down the smuggling of a large quantity of drugs. I would like personally to take this opportunity of recording my appreciation, and I am sure that of all honourable members, for the extremely difficult work undertaken in connection with an extremely difficult problem. Drug abuse is nowhere near the problem in Australia that it is in other countries but nonetheless it is a very serious one, particularly in the larger cities of Australia, and it is not going to be overcome overnight. </para>
          <para>There is no single piece of legislation that a government can pass that is going to cure the drug problem but this Bill that the House is about to pass will add yet another weapon to the armoury that we have with which to fight this problem. I take up the remarks made by the honourable member for Tangney. The Bill will indeed strengthen the capacity of the Commonwealth authorities to prevent trafficking in drugs. To that extent I appreciate the support given to it by the Opposition thus facilitating a speedy passage of the legislation through the House. </para>

          <para>- I rise to deal with one of the most serious abuses of the privilege of this House in recent times and to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to consider this matter and to consider a reference to the Committee of Privileges. On 29 April of this year the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> raised certain matters and dealt with a previous court proceeding in New South Wales in 1974. In respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Rofe, who is a Queen's Counsel to whom the honourable member for Hunter has referred in this House before, he said that apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rofe's</inline> knowledge of libel laws was pitiful because in 1974 he acted for a John Giles Bourke in a defamation action against the then New South Wales Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran.</inline> He said that the basis was flimsy and that the evidence that was tendered in the action against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> was nothing more than a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reference from the New South Wales Legislative Assembly covering comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> about the plaintiff. Then there was a statement that in effect schoolboy lawyers would know better than to do this and naturally the case was swiftly dismissed. The facts are not as was stated by the honourable member for Hunter. It is extremely important that even in this day and age when we see scurrilous allegations being made without foundation by members of Parliament at least there be some accuracy or no total inaccuracy; at least there should not be the manifest deceit that we have seen in this particular instance. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I withdraw. There is a matter however that I shall be putting to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in relation to a conspiracy to deceive the House, but I shall come to that in a moment. I have had communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rofe</inline> about this matter. To substantiate the matter I have obtained certain of the court documents. The facts that appear to be clearly established are that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bourke</inline> brought an action against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> without at that time having the advice of counsel. Subsequently he sought the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rofe,</inline> who provided a written opinion. I have a copy of that written opinion. The written opinion was to the effect that the action could not succeed and should therefore be withdrawn. Subsequently, on 2 December 1974, the court ordered that by consent the proceedings be dismissed and that the plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs. No evidence was tendered; there was no hearing; the action was not dismissed and the ensure version, let alone the specific words used, given by the honourable member for Hunter is totally inaccurate and totally wrong. I have the documents here. The question that arises is how this came about. It is of considerable interest to note that obviously one could not have assessed these matters by perusing documents, because a statement that there was a hearing, a statement that evidence was tendered, is not supported by the documents, as there was no hearing and as no evidence was tendered. One would have to get that version from some other source. When the documents are examined, when one sees the notice of motion by the defendant to have the claim struck out, one sees that the solicitor for the applicant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran,</inline> was none other than David Paul Landa, the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, who has been described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> as a brilliant lawyer. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Landa</inline> would know what he was talking about. Where did the information come from that the honourable member for Hunter was talking about? It could have come only from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Landa.</inline> It is totally wrong and it is deceitful information. I refer you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to the 18th edition of May 's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> page 137, dealing with a conspiracy to deceive either House by giving evidence or in some other manner.

          <para>-On a recent evening in this chamber, namely the evening of 5 May, I attempted to make a speech in relation to the activities of Australia Post. Regretfully that night the Opposition was involved in a frivolous exercise and I was subjected to frequent interruptions. That night I made 2 attempts, the record of which ranges from page 1978 to page 1983 <inline font-style="italic">of Hansard,</inline> to complete that speech. I know that we have only 5 minutes in which to speak on the adjournment, and it is very rare for a 5-minute speech to be spread over 5 pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but that was in accord with the tone of that evening. So tonight I should like to start stage 3 of my episode. I do not have very much more to say, but I wish to refresh the minds of honourable members on the last words I said that night before I was interrupted by the clock- and I shall say that this must all be considered in conjunction with what I said as recorded on those pages I mentioned. I said: </para>

          <para>I am also reliably informed that Australian Post drivers have been instructed to watch and report the activities of private couriers. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Here starts stage 3. The Commission is making its drivers become travelling spies and pimps on private enterprise. Big Jim Kennedy, the refrigerator and tourist island king, who heads the Commission, I am sure never used these methods to build his big empire. He commands respect because he did it the legitimate way. I appeal to him to intervene. Section 85 of the Act presently gives the Commission wide powers to stamp upon any emerging competitor. That section should be repealed or changed. At present there are approximately 3500 owner-drivers and 570 employees engaged in the courier industry. It is estimated their turnover for the financial year ending 1975 was $73m. The rate they are going, this year that figure will reach $100m. If these couriers survive the onslaught in 1976 they will carry 50 million articles. With 35 000 clients using the service it is obvious that Australia was in dire need of an alternative carrying service. In Brisbane alone approximately 70 vehicles are in operation servicing banks, private companies, law firms and a host of other companies and industries. I am told that Australia Post is saying that all a business house needs to do is to say what it is prepared to pay for a courier service. I notice the intense interest of the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Kingsford Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> who was at one time a Postmaster-General and who was responsible for setting up this Commission. Australia Post is prepared to ask the firms what they will pay for the service and will provide it at that rate. </para>
        <para class="block">I suppose if an operation is getting away with charging 18c to deliver a lousy letter that provides the kind of money to allow it to indulge in unfair business tactics. </para>
        <para>In the minute I have left I repeat the policy of the Liberal-National Country Parties, as enunciated prior to the last election, in relation to the private courier service, and to draw to the attention of the House the fact that we are contravening our own promise in allowing this to continue.

        <para class="block">I do hope that people read my speeches on this subject, which almost constitutes a Blue Hills serial and continue over 2 editions of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> will step in as a Liberal and invoke the views which members on this side of the House possess, that is, that the private courier should be given a go. The only reason he has emerged in recent years was that the Post Office, as it then was, could not come up with a reliable service. I repeat what I said when I last raised this matter although Australia Post is going through a comparatively better period its past performance is such that nobody can rely on improved performances being continued in the future. </para>

            <para>- He probably knows you too. The honourable member for St George also said that I made a wrong accusation, that I said that the case was dismissed. He said that the case was withdrawn. I suggest that he is trying to escape a suggestion of mine that the case was thrown out. If he wants me to alter my words as to whether the case was dismissed or withdrawn I will say that the case was thrown out. It was a weak attempt by a weak member, a weak barrister who is showing his allegiance to his legal fraternity in a way that some legal men usually do. He is doing this in anticipation because he is a oncer in this Parliament. He will probably have to depend on other members of the legal profession to throw him a brief occasionally to get a livelihood. </para>

I ask that he withdraw those remarks that he used in his speech earlier tonight before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I believe that your impartiality will see, as you insisted that I withdraw my remarks, that he withdraw those remarks against me. Otherwise, I did not consider his remarks tonight worthy of any reply. </para>

          <para>- Last week, as honourable members will know, there was an announcement by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> of the extension of unemployment benefits to certain primary producers. That announcement was made in the light of great and pressing problems in the primary sector of this country, problems that involve people who were existing and still are existing at a financial level less than that of the dole. It has been a recognised factor in the Australian society over many years that people who cannot look after themselves and who are in the short term in terrible and destitute circumstances should rightly be looked after in those circumstances- again I say in the short term- to a certain extent by the Government. Most of the media applauded the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry last week and there were editorials in the national newspapers which supported aid. However, unfortunately there was a snide and cheap comment in an Australian Broadcasting Commission commentary made shortly after the statement which has caused great dismay in the primary sector of Australia. I shall quote from the comment which was made by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Negus. He stated: </para>

          <para>This week's Press is filled with 2 kinds of stories, one giving graphic, in fact gruesome detail of the lengths to which some men on the land are having to go to protect themselves and their industries, the other an almost daily retinue of announcements of some form or other of Government aid. </para>

        <para class="block">He went on: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>But the decision most likely to precipitate comment is that to grant unemployment benefits to farmers facing financial hardship. As the proposal stands farmers, beef, wool or dairy, who have a net annual income of less than a year on the dole, that is, some $3,562, will be eligible for unemployment benefits themselves. On available figures from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, this would mean that somewhere in the vicinity of 50 000 farmers could front up for $68.50 a week, or  $3 and a half m  a week, or if you like, $ 1 50m a year. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>I put it to you that this is just another case of one section of the Australian work force being put on by cheap commentary. It seems to me that if worthy members of the Australian work force such as shipbuilders- there has been commentary in this House tonight about the benefit- at times deserved benefit given by the Government to support the shipbuilding work force- can get due consideration from the Government in time of hardship any other section in similar circumstances also deserves consideration. </para>
        <para>Over several weeks in this House there has been a continued stream of abuse from the Australian Labor Party about any suggestion that this Government give lc to the primary producer. In fact the level of support for primary production given by this Government or by the previous Government is minuscule compared to the level of support given in obvious or in hidden ways to manufacturing industry, including the shipbuilding industry. I deplore the attitude of the ABC and I deplore the fashionable attitude of trendy, cosmetic journalists who single out the man on the land for special consideration and for special jibes when they know that the man on the land has to act, in large degree, independently and cannot act in large and organised groups as can other groups in other industries. I feel that I am echoing the sentiments of many honourable members when I appeal to members on both sides and to the Press to give the man on the land- the worker on the land- as fair a go as we want to give people in other industries in this country. </para>

          <para>- I want to draw attention to the proverbial paper tiger of this Parliament, the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> There are honourable members in this House, including the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James),</inline> who will recall an incident that occurred on 10 October 1963. At that time only one vote divided the coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party. If I remember rightly, the numbers were 61 to 60. At that time the honourable member for Mackellar had circulated an amendment to the Disabled Persons Bill. Day after day in the pages of the newspapers he was being reported as saying how, if the Menzies Government did not give in, he would vote against it. Of course, as there was only one vote between the Government and the Opposition he would have defeated the Government had he voted against it. The former honourable member for Grayndler, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly,</inline> in the committee stage of that Bill moved the amendment which appears at page 1732 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 10 October 1963. The honourable member for Mackellar had been extolling the virtues of this amendment in the Parliament. Then in came the great white father himself- the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. He sat on the front bench. The honourable member for Mackellar was sitting in the same seat as he now occupies. The Prime Minister looked back at him and grinned. All he had to do was to grin at the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member caved in. On page 1 735 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he made the point - </para>

            <para>-Look it up, brother. That is not hard to do after one has been here for a little while. When the honourable member has been here for a little longer he will be able to handle those matters. The honourable member for Mackellar finally caved in and agreed to vote with the Government. This was the man who time and time again had stated that he would oppose the Government, if necessary, would vote against it and, if necessary, would see his Government defeated. He went to the brink of the precipice. He was speaking to the Bill when in came <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. All he had to do was to smile sweetly at the honourable member for Mackellar who caved in and withdrew from the precipice. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record he said that he would not put the matter to the vote. He appealed to the Prime Minister, as he put it, 'at this late hour' to accept his wisdom but the Prime Minister did not see any wisdom. It is said that he actually threatened the honourable member privately that unless he voted with the Government and stopped the defeat of the Government his endorsement would be withdrawn. </para>

        <para>I thought it appropriate tonight in view of some of the statements that the honourable member for Mackellar makes in this House about communists under the bed and that type of thing, and in view of the way he waxes so strongly on these issues, the attention of the Parliament should be drawn to this paper tiger- this man who has such a desire to hit the Labor Party at all times. He tries to present an image of being a great rebel but he is a paper tiger who at the appropriate time caves in. If the honourable member for Mackellar does not agree with what I am saying- I remind him that on the night in question he sat in the very same seat he now occupies and the Prime Minister sat on the front bench- or if he wants his memory refreshed he can cross the chamber to me, or I will cross the chamber to him, and show him the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record which is a witness to his infamy. </para>

I am a member of a Party which, it is true, allows some freedom of vote to its members in this House.

            <para>- They are not words I would ever want to apply to the Chair or to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. It</inline> is important to look to first things first. I regard the Labor Party as a disaster. I regard its members as enemies of Australia and I would not want to put them in power. Surely this is something which honourable members on both sides of the House would realise. Sure, members of the Labor Party have some responsibility on minor matters and on particular provisions within Bills but when it comes to putting this disastrous pro-communist party in power that is a different matter. I say that because I know that it still maintains these communist links and one of the reasons that its members hate me and fear me is that for 25 years in this House I have tried to show the links in the Labor Party with the Communist Party. I have tried to show, and I believe I have shown, that although there are many members in the Labor Party who are opposed to communism, although there are many people in the Labor Party who are neutral on that matter, nevertheless inside there is a small controlling communist core which works through the trade unions and conducts a reign of terror over the members of the Labor Party because it controls their pre-selection. Many of them who come from industrial areas know that in those areas the organisation and branches of the Labor Party are controlled by undercover communists. They know that they have to toe the communist Une. I know it is very difficult for a member of the Labor Party. He has to make up his mind whether he will stay in the Party and try to cure it of communism- many honest people could take that decision- or go outside the Labor Party because of its communist infection. The fact that there is a communist infection stands clearly on the record. In the old days there were unity tickets. </para>

            <para>At the same time, it often happens that before a specific project is officially started certain associated research has already been carried out by interested scientists and, consequently, it is difficult to provide accurate estimates of the full expenditure incurred for that project. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The Australian Statistician advises that expenditure on travel or tourism in Australia is expenditure on the products of several industries, but only on part of their products. These industries include restaurants, hotels and accommodation, transport, and travel agencies. Official estimates of the products of these industries going into expenditure on travel and tourism are therefore not made. However, a survey of domestic travel conducted by the Australian Travel Research Conference estimated that, in 1 973-74, Australians spent $736m on travel within Australia. In addition, overseas visitors spent $ 1 62m making a total of $898m spent on travel within Australia. There is evidence to believe that the domestic component of this estimate considerably underestimates the value of domestic travel expenditure, as the survey on which it was based relied on the respondents' abilities to recall travel undertaken over a considerable period. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The estimated $898m spent on travel within Australia in 1973-74 represents 1.77 per cent of Gross Domestic Product for that year. This figure under-estimates the contribution of the tourist industry to Gross Domestic Product, because of the under-estimation in domestic tourism expenditure and because no estimate is available of gross fixed capital expenditure in the industry. </para>

              <para>Because of the reasons outlined in my answer to the first part of the question no official estimates are made of the workforce employed in the travel/tourist industry.

          <para>Since the original announcement that my Department would not be able to fund the publication of further research reports at the original cost, I have been giving consideration to the whole question of how to ensure that the material in the reports can be made available. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Administrative Services and I have asked officers of my Department, the Australian Government Publishing Service and the Secretary of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty to discuss possible economies in the publishing program for research reports. Since that meeting, figures have been prepared which show that the remaining research reports can be published at a total cost of $70,000, a saving of $62,000 on the previous estimate. This saving can be achieved by reducing the number of copies available for free distribution, by increasing the sales price on each volume and by public tendering for printers instead of using standard forms of contract. The production standards of these reports will not be affected. </para>
          <para>On 30 April 1976 I wrote to the Treasurer requesting an allocation of $70,000 to publish the remaining reports.

              <para>1 ) and (2) I am advised that office studies have been carried out by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to determine whether it would be possible to provide a television service to the unnerved areas of the Eyre Peninsula at a per capita cost which comes within the economic guidelines to which the Board must adhere. The result of this investigation has indicated that the only town which might be able to be served within the economic guidelines is Streaky Bay, but even in this case, the conclusion is by no means firm and a field survey would have to be carried out by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to accurately establish the situation. Consequently, the Board has included Streaky Bay on the list of areas approved for survey. However, due to the large program of field work to which the Board is already committed throughout Australia, the Board's limited staff resources and the current expenditure constraints, it is not possible to advise a firm date by which these studies will be completed. It must be reiterated that the conduct of this investigation does not guarantee that a National Service will be provided to Streaky Bay as the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> cost may be found to exceed the economic guidelines. </para>

              <para>1 ) Within the past six months the Prices Justification Tribunal has approved a number of notifications from companies seeking wholesale price increases for farm machinery.

          <para>Although it is the usual practice for the Tribunal to allow a manufacturing company to apply a price increase to some part or all of its inventory of finished products, depending on whether the inventory has attracted some or all of the increased costs which nave led to the price increase, such approval would not normally extend, as in the case of farm machinery manufacturers, to equipment delivered at earlier dates to dealers and held by them on bailment or consignment. </para>

              <para>Whatever the outcome of its current inquiries, it is likely that the Tribunal will make a special point of informing farm machinery manufacturers and dealers who come within the notification provisions of the Prices Justification Act that unsold equipment held by dealers on bailment or consignment must not be regarded as part of the manufacturing company's inventory of finished products and is therefore ineligible for any later price increases approved by the Tribunal for the same or related equipment. </para>

          <para>The Prices Justification Tribunal cannot directly prevent dealer companies which by virtue of their annual turnover levels are not subject to the notification provisions of the Act from increasing the prices of machinery on hand. The Tribunal would need to be aware of any such practice before it could take appropriate action under Section 16 of the Act. Non-corporate dealerships are, of course, completely outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. </para>

If the unencumbered value of the interest in the matrimonial home does not exceed $35,000 a deduction equal to the value of that interest is allowable. The deduction decreases by $7 for every $10 by which the unencumbered value of the interest exceeds $35,000 so that it ceases to apply when that value is $85,000 or more.

If the net value of the estate exceeds $40,000 but is less than $200,000 a deduction is allowable on a sliding scale. The deduction commences at $40,000 for estates valued at $40,001 and reduces by $2 for every $8 by which the net value of the estate exceeds $40,000. If no part of the estate passes to the widow, widower, children or grandchildren of the deceased, the estate is exempt from estate duty if the net value of the estate does not exceed $20,000. If the net value exceeds $20,000 but is less than $100,000 a deduction is allowable on a sliding scale commencing at $20,000 and reducing by $2 for every $8 by which the net value of the estate exceeds $20,000.

          <para>Financial support from public funds was regularised and given its present form by the Parties Law of 1966. Subsidies from public funds now constitute, on average, one-third of the budget of the political parties in the Federal Republic of Germany. Originally, subsidy was fixed at 2.50 DM per voter for all parties who polled at least 2.5 per cent of total vote in the previous Federal election. In a later decision, the Federal Constitutional Court reduced to 0.5 per cent the percentage of votes needed to qualify for subsidy, and in early 1974 the subsidy itself was raised to 3.50 DM for each vote polled. The subsidy is distributed among parties according to the number of votes polled, and is distributed at the rate of 10 per cent in the first year after the election, IS per cent in the second year, 35 per cent in the third year and the remaining 40 per cent immediately after the general elections.

        <para>The Electoral Expenses Act 1974 imposed ceilings on expenditure by both political parties and individual candidates. A political party may spend a maximum of Can$0.30 for each voter in constituencies where that party fields a candidate. A candidate may spend Can$1.00 for each of the first 15 000 voters in his constituency, Can$0.50 for each of the next 10 000 voters and Can$0.25 for each additional voter. Hence, in a constituency of 50 000, the maximum permissible expenditure by a candidate would be Can$26,250. </para>
        <para>Parties and candidates are required to send an audited return of expenditure to the Chief Electoral Officer. A party which exceeds the limit may be fined up to Can25,000. A candidate who exceeds the limit may be fined up to Can 1,000. All limits are to be reviewed by the parliament after each general election. </para>
        <para class="block">United Kingdom </para>
        <para>Section 64 of the Representation of the People Act provides that a candidate may not spend more than £1,075 and an additional 6p. for every 6 electors in a county constituency, and f 1,075 and an additional 6p. for every 8 electors in a borough constituency. </para>

        <para>The maximum expenditure that a candidate for the House of Representatives may incur is $NZ2,000. </para>
        <para class="block">United States of America </para>
        <para>The Federal Election Campaign Act 1974 provided that a candidate for the Senate could spend a maximum of US$150,000 or US$0.12 per voter, whichever was the greater. In the case of a primary election the limits were US$100,000 or US$0.08 per voter, whichever was the greater. A candidate for the House of Representatives could incur expenditure no greater than US$70,000 in respect of a primary campaign and a further US$70,000 in a general election. However, on 30 January 1976 the U.S.A. Supreme Court struck down the provisions limiting campaign expenditure. </para>

            <para>The composition of Australian aid programs to recipient countries is determined after consultation and by agreement with those countries. Australia is not in diplomatic relations with the Government of Cambodia, the Australian aid program for Cambodia was suspended when Australian representation was withdrawn in 197S, and there has so far been no discussion of its resumption. In these circumstances it would be inappropriate to initiate discussions with the Australian Dairy Corporation regarding the milk recombining plant in Phnom Penh in which it has a 20 per cent equity interest. Indeed, any such discussions would presuppose knowledge of the state of that plant- such information as would be needed is not, however, currently available. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1) to (3) The questions asked reveal a misunderstanding of the situation. This is understandable in view of press reports about an amendment recently made to the City Area Leases Ordinance. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Ordinance was first introduced in 1936. It enables leases in Canberra to be granted for specific business and/or residential purposes. It makes it an offence for land to be used for any purpose other than that authorised under the lease. The honourable Member will recall the importance his party has always attached to leasehold and to regulating and use through the purpose clause of a lease. </para>
          <para>The 1976 Ordinance amendment was promulgated to correct a legislative deficiency which inhibited the Department in its proper administration of the Ordinance. </para>
          <para>Recent publicity has suggested that the Department would use the provision to put small businessmen out of business. Particular reference was made to those businessmen operating from their homes. </para>
          <para>These statements ignore the fact that the Ordinance provides separately that bona fide residents may seek and obtain approval to carry on their profession, trade, occupation or calling from their home, provided a nuisance is not caused to neighbours and the activity is not against the public interest. </para>
          <para>A large number of residents conducting minor businesses have sought and obtained such approvals which are given conditionally upon them complying with specific conditions intended to control the impact on neighbours. Any other applicants whose activity is acceptable would obtain a similar approval. In a small proportion of cases only, where neighbours would be adversely affected, has approval been refused. </para>
          <para>However any business which is established on a site in defiance of the lease conditions and without such foregoing approval would face possible legal action. I make no apology for this in view of my Ministerial responsibility in regard to the leasehold system under which planned land use is maintained in Canberra. </para>
          <para>The Ordinance also contains a procedure for seeking a permanent change of lease purpose by application to the A.C.T. Supreme Court. </para>
