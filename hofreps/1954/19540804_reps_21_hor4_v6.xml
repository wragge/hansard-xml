                    <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr, HAYLEN</inline>
                    (Parkes) [11.11]- Thu side of the House has great pleasure in nominating
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmonds</inline>
                    for the post of Speakership because he is an impartial gentleman with a wide understanding nf the- Standing Orders. He comes from the north of Queensland where the winds of liberality still blow and where he is known as a man who believes that what one is sent to Parliament to say .should be said.  His  training and .his application to the work of chairmanship in this chamber in the past gives him the right to apply for this post in. this honorable House. I do not .require to say anything else :except to add that, in the past, it has become apparent to all honorable members that the Standing Orders, which have been evolved to .ease and facilitate deliberations in this House have been used as though they were a flail and a knout on honorable members on "both sides of the chamber. Those who have fought in defence of their country are aware of the deadly nature of the .303 rifle and know of its effectiveness in big game hunting, hut in the subtleties of Parliamentary debate such a weapon should he used less frequently, if at .all. In my view, .the feeling of honorable members on both sides of the House should be that we must -return to a free and liberal interpretation of the Standing Orders.
                    <inline font-style="italic">~For</inline>
                    that reason I commend to all honorable members sitting in this new Parliament, with fresh minds I hope, the capacity and standard which would be brought to the post of  Speaker  by the honorable mem'ber for Herbert.

                    <para>. - The acceptance by the House of the nomination 'of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmonds</inline> for the post of  Speaker  would mean that once again this House would be ruled by loving kindness instead of by fear. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmonds,</inline> the House is presented with a candidate who enjoys the respect -and affection of every one of his colleagues -on both sides of the chamber. That cannot be said of the nominee of the Government parties. Unfortunately, it is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> while he possesses qualities which, I .believe, render him eminently suitable to be once again a. back bench .critic of this Government, stirring it into action, lacks the quality of fairness which is primarily necessary in the occupant of the Chair. While. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> possesses a certain rough humour he does not possess, .in my opinion, the qualities necessary for calm adjudication in this House. During his term as  Speaker  the standard of conduct in. this House has fallen notoriously. The remedy is for honorable members to elect to the Chair a member such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmonds</inline> who is capable of governing this House because of the affection and respect in which other honorable members hold him. If there were no other ground for refusal to continue <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie</inline> Cameron as the  'Speaker  of this House, it would be .his utter misuse of Standing Order 303. Every .honorable member knows, and you. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clerk</inline> of the House, in particular, know, that Standing Order 303 was adopted so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would have an emergency power summarily to reject an honorable member from the eli amber, but ' that standing order, as <inline font-style="italic">every</inline> honorable . member acquainted with the situation that led to the adoption of it is aWare, was to be used only in a condition of emergency inside this 'chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie</inline> Cameron, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> has both perverted and twisted the purpose of that Standing Order, with the result tha't: the power of the House to control honorable members and finally decide who shall sit here or who .shall be ejected, has .been taken from it. That was never intended. Such an interpretation of Standing Order 303 is a complete misuse of the intention that led to the adoption of it. &gt;On that ground alone, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie</inline> Cameron does not deserve any longer to be the  Speaker  of this chamber. But I can assure the House that we .shall have, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmonds,</inline> -a  Speaker  who will not misuse any of the great powers that are associated with that office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmonds,</inline> with a calm and judicial mind,, will administer justice to honorable members on both sides of the chamber. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The second defect which should (disqualify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie</inline> Cameron for the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Speaker</inline> is that, with all the goodwill in the world, he lacks an essential sense of fairness for this office. He does not :give a consistent interpretation of any of the Standing Orders, and the House will agree with me when I say that one- is never sure from day to. day what will ' be his interpretation of any standing order. Even when, the Opposition has succeeded in having its point of view upheld by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Cameron, it has nearly always been the wrong point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie</inline> Cameron, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is almost incapable of being right. </para>

                        <para>Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Representatives : </para>
                        <para>Yon have been called together to deliberate on matters of importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>When last I addressed von, Australia was looking forward to the first visit to these shores of  Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second and  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. </para>
                        <para>The visit is past; but it has taken its place among our most stirring memories. It hag strengthened, if that were possible, the deep devotion to our Sovereign which is one of the glories of our membership of the British Commonwealth. In a speech on her return to London Her Majesty spoke words which are au enduring challenge to every one of her subjects. She said : " . . . . We return with our faith in the high destiny of our Commonwealth and Empire even stronger than when we set out. For in this and in every one of its countries men and women are looking not to the past, but to the future, and as they go forward together the efforts of each nation give added strength to the whole ". </para>
                        <para>My advisers regard their responsibilities during the life of this Parliament to be the strengthening of Australia's security, the maintenance of a healthy economy, the development of our national resources, and the social welfare of the Australian people. </para>
                        <para>The conduct of Australia's external relations over the last three years has been a complex task. The course of world events gives ground for concern that this task will be no less difficult during the life of the 21st Parliament. </para>
                        <para>In applying its policy, my Government cherishes and has sought to strengthen the links of the British Commonwealth. It has given full support to the United Nations. It has developed close and friendly relations with the countries of the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas. Our relations with the people of Asia and with the United States are deeply important for Australia's future. Our special association of trust and confidence with the United States and New Zealand is symbolized in Anzus. </para>
                        <para>It was in pursuance of United Nations aims that Australia participated in action to maintain collective security against aggression in Korea. The Geneva Conference on Korea, failed to arrive at a permanent peace settlement which might replace 'the existing armistice arrangements in Korea. My Government will continue to support such a settlement on terras which are just for the Korean people. </para>
                        <para>Events in the Associated States of IndoChina have been a matter of grave concern. Communist aggression in South-East Asia clearly affects Australia's safety. My Ministers, by advice and consultation, have sought peace, national justice, and a common protection against the spread of hostile power They support the organization of regional collective security in the South-East Asian area. It is their hope that the people most directly affected will wish to join together with one another and with other countries in defence of their common interests in the spirit and within the framework of the United Nations Charter. Such defence, so far from being a derogation from the sovereignty of South-East Asian countries, would afford inter-national protection to that sovereignty. </para>
                        <para>Mindful of the serious international tensions and conflicts, especially in Asia, my Minister for External Affairs has, since the last Parliament, paid visits to Indo-China, India and Pakistan, has participated in the Geneva Conference, and has visited London and Washington. </para>
                        <para>My Government will continue, with other nations, its practical contribution to the welfare of the South and South- East Asian area through the Colombo Plan. Such measures of help encourage sympathetic understanding and good will. </para>
                        <para>My Government proposes to continue the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliament and hopes that in the 21st Parliament ali parties will participate. </para>

                            Government is undertaking a reorganization of the defence programme to achieve the maximum security that the country can provide for a long period, having regard to the needs not only of defence but also of economic stability, a steady development oi population and resources, and high levels of production and employment.
                        </para>
                        <para>The changes in policy certainly do not provide for reduction in the size and urgency of defence preparations; but there will be some adjustments both between and within the armed services, including adjustments to improve the balance between equipment and manpower. </para>
                        <para>In the field of research and development Australia is making a notable contribution through the long-range weapons establishment, which is a joint United KingdomAustralian effort for the testing of guided weapons. </para>
                        <para>Our forces abroad demonstrate our cooperation in collective defence as a member of the British Commonwealth and the United Nations. </para>
                        <para>The national service training scheme is building up the reserve forces of each of the services. </para>
                        <para>My advisers report a general and continuing state of prosperity throughout the Australian economy. The number in civilian employment is the highest ever recorded in this country; and the output of goods and services is correspondingly high. Prices have remained remarkably steady. </para>
                        <para>At 30th June, 1954, Australia's international reserves stood at £570,000,000, an increase of £0,000,000 over the previous twelve months. During this period, my Government progressively relaxed its emergency import restrictions, and now, for the greater part of Australian imports, no limitations are imposed on the quantity that may be admitted. </para>
                        <para>The budget for the financial year 1954-55 will be among the first of the matters submitted to Parliament during this session. It will be designed to help to consolidate our present prosperity. </para>
                        <para>In the field of Commonwealth-State financial relations, my Government will introduce three measures. The first will provide for special financial assistance to the States to supplement the amounts payable under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946-48. This measure will increase the total tax reimbursement payments to the States in 1954-55 to £150,000,000. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The second relates to Commonwealth payments to the States for roads purposes. Thu Commonwealth Aid 'Roads Act l'95'O is not due to expire until 30th June, 1.955; but, because of the effect of the increasing .production of locally-refined petrol in Australia -on the payment of petrol tax proceeds to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> States, my Government has undertaken .i complete review of the existing legislation. The new legislation will provide for a -new basis and a very substantial increase in the Commonwealth aid roads payments. </para>
                    <para>The third will, after the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission have been received, provide for the payment of special grants to the States of South Australia, West Australia and Tasmania. </para>
                    <para>World economic changes have their effect on Australia's export commodities. Though wool continues to be in a sound position and the prospects in the United Kingdom foiquality meat are favorable, wheat is selling slowly, despite lower prices. Through the Australian Wheat Board, all possible markets arc being actively explored. For many other commodities the market circumstances point very strongly to the clear need for reducing our -costs of production - if such exports are to be even maintained. </para>
                    <para>The tobacco industry, after a prosperous season, has excellent prospects. </para>
                    <para>In the period of transition from bulk purchases by Government to free market operations in the United Kingdom my Government has been giving every possible assistance to the industries affected. Moreover, the need for an expanded programme of overseas trade publicity has become fully apparent, and the Government is -taking the -necessary steps to meet the need. It will continue to give .serious attention to marketing problems as they arise, and, through the continuance of .'its various grants in aid to State authorities, wi1 assist the industries concerned in the task of .bringing about a more competitive cost structure. </para>
                    <para>It is a fundamental part of 'the policy of my Government that the development of Australia should proceed at the highest practicable rate. 'This requires an adequate supply -of labour and materials-; sound policies for encouraging private investment and an inflow of capital; close financial collaboration with the States, who are responsible for most public works; the encouragement of savings by monetary stability; and a carefully selected and vigorously executed programme in the Commonwealth's own field. My advisers will continue, -in respect -of all these matters, the policies already applied. In particular., in discharge of its special responsibilities, my Government is pressing on energetically with the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric and irrigation scheme, which, in the provision of power and water, will contribute to great development both an primary and secondary industry in south-eastern Australia. </para>
                    <para>Tt has also agreed .to the recommendation -' the 'River Murray Commission, that the Hume Reservoir should be enlarged to 2,500;000 acre feet, the Commonwealth to contribute a quarter of the cost of the works. </para>
                    <para>My Government will closely examine the extent to which additional transport links, including rail 'links, are desirable .for the development of beef production in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. </para>
                    <para>The manufacturing .industries -of Australia., it is hoped, will continue their 'development, so vital .to the national strength. My Government wall continue to accord adequate protection to efficient and economic Australian industries. In doing so, it will , relY for advice on the Tariff Board. </para>
                    <para>My Government regards it as -essential, however, to the healthy and permanent development of manufacturing industries in Australia that there should .be a continuing drive by all concerned to increase efficiency and production and reduce costs. All the techniques &lt;of modern management need to be brought to bear on the problem ; concurrently the trade unions must realize that higher standards of .living will .be achieved through greater productivity, which will come from greater team work between employers .and employees. There are welcome signs of increasing -co-operation between management and labour. </para>
                    <para>There is now a great .expansion of the oil refining .industry. When the present programme is completed the total output -of local refineries will be substantially equal to "the Australian demand. My advisers will continue to encourage the search for oil, 'both on the Australian mainland and in Papua and New Guinea. </para>
                    <para>It is also most important that the search for minerals should be pursued energetically and that our production of minerals should be as high as possible. In particular my Government will press forward with uranium exploration and development in the Northern Territory. It will also collaborate with the State 'Governments in the search for this important mineral. 'The participation of private prospectors, both companies and indivi-duals, in the search for "uranium is gratifying. At Rum Jungle -intensive investigations 'have confirmed the existence of substantial bodies of ore and the erection of a large and complex treatment plant is virtually complete. Production should commence next month, well ahead of the original schedule. </para>
                    <para>In the field of atomic energy, research in Australia is being expanded as also is the training of Australians in research establishments, in the United Kingdom. </para>
                    <para>Australian gold .production adds 'considerably to this country's earnings of oversea funds. This industry has been adversely affected .by a relatively .static price for gold and high local costs. My Government will, therefore, introduce, during this Session, legislation for the provision of financial assistance to the gold-mining industry. </para>
                    <para>The continued growth in Australia's economy has brought in its train a  steadliy  increasing demand for workers of all kinds. </para>
                    <para>The immigration programme for 1954-55 will be based upon Australia's ability to absorb migrants as permanent settlers without disruption of the existing economic pattern, Slaving regard to the contribution that migrants can make to national strength, to development, and to primary and secondary industries. </para>
                    <para>In the Territories of thu Commonwealth, on the foundations la'id in the past three years, further progress may be confidently expected both in the advancement of the welfare of the people and in -the development of resources. </para>
                    <para>In Papua and New Guinea the rate of investigation and classification of land and water resources and agricultural output will be increased. Expanded services will improve the health, education and social status- of the natives. </para>
                    <para>My Government will continue to undertake h large housing programme both directly and in conjunction with the States. The provision of war service homes will be vigorously pursued. </para>
                    <para>My Government now proposes that it should be made possible under the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement .for tenants to purchase on liberal terms the homes in which they live. Negotiations have been commenced with the State Governments to reach agreement on what those terms will be. When agreement has been reached with the States legislation will be introduced to amend the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement to put my Government's plans into operation at the earliest possible date. </para>
                    <para>My Government will continue its policy of improving Social Services and easing and liberalizing the provisions of the means test. To this end, the limits of .permissible income and property for age, invalid and widow?' pensions will be substantially raised. </para>
                    <para>These modifications of the means test will remove from retirement some of the anxiety with which thrifty nien and women have in the past been so greatly concerned. </para>
                    <para>My 'Government recognizes that there is no greater human -problem affecting old people than that of care and housing. Very valuable work has been done by the Churches and charitable bodies; .but their financial difficulties in finding the necessary capital are great. My Government will, therefore, provide on a poundforpound basis -money towards the capital costs incurred by churches and recognized charitable bodies and institutions in building homes for the aged up to a total Commonwealth contribution of £1,500,000 a year. </para>
                    <para>Further development of the Government's health plans will be continued. Voluntary insurance to provide for medical and hospital treatment will continue to receive the utmost encouragement and support. The Government's scientific and medical advisers will press on with their research work .aimed at bringing about .continuous improvement in the .standards of public health throughout Australia. </para>
                    <para>My Government is considering the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Television and will submit its policy to Parliament. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to continue the policy of development of Canberra as the centre of Commonwealth administration. it is intended to submit to Parliament a comprehensive measure to replace the existing legislation relating to the acquisition of land for Commonwealth purposes. </para>
                    <para>My Government will continue its programme of reviewing and bringing up to date the law' of the Commonwealth on industrial property and other matters affecting industry and commerce. In particular, it is reviewing the laws relating to trade marks, designs, copyright, and bankruptcy. </para>
                    <para>It also has under preparation proposals to relieve the pressure of judicial business in the High Court of Australia. </para>
                    <para>The Government will submit a bill to put beyond doubt the authority and powers of the Boya] Commission on Espionage, and the protection of its proceedings. </para>
                    <para>A proposal will be submitted to the Parliament for the appointment of a committee of the Parliament representing both Houses and all parties, to review certain aspects of the working of the Constitution, and to make recommendations for its amendment. </para>
                    <para>Among other matters which it is hoped that committee will consider is the method of ensuring in the future some coincidence between the dates of elections for the -House of Representatives and of elections for the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I direct a question to you, Mr. Speaker, arising from proceedings this afternoon in another place at which members of this House were present. Will you confer with your colleague who presides over the other House of this Parliament in order to see whether the reasonable needs of the press to use flashlights for the taking of photographs could not be reconciled with the still more reasonable need for silence and decorum in the Senate while  Her  Majesty's representative makes his Speech? Would it not be reasonable to insist that photographs be taken in the first minute, or half-minute, of the Speech, so that the remainder of it may be heard in silence? </para>

                        <para>- During the last four years of office of this Government, the number of rural automatic exchanges in operation has been, increased from about 150 to 600. We are still endeavouring to meet the demand for rural automatic exchanges in country districts, but in this respect we are limited both financially and by the number of such exchanges that are procurable. I think that, at the moment, the condition mentioned by the honorable member for Wimmera still obtains, that is to say, only the two types are available. </para>

                            <para>- Some four years ago I pointed out to the Parliament, and the country, the stupidity of the arrangement that had been made by the previous Labour Government with regard to mental diseases. I suggested to the then State Labour governments that they should cancel that particular agreement and confer with me about a proper agreement. They refused to do that, and finally, last June, that agreement was dissolved by effluxion of time. Six or seven months ago I suggested through the Prime Minister to the State Premiers that we were anxious to have a complete examination of this whole matter, so that we could make certain that the position would be dealt with in accordance with the facts. I suggested that Dr. Stoller, who had had wide psychological and psychiatric experience throughout the Commonwealth, should be appointed to conduct that examination. The suggestion met with approval, and that gentleman was so appointed. He was carrying out the work for which he was appointed until about two months ago, when the Premier of Victoria suggested that he be permitted to attend a very important psychiatric conference in America. As I myself considered that his visit would be of some value, I agreed that he should go. However, my agreement was on one condition - that the States would not blame me for any delay that resulted through my acquiescence in this request. </para>

The only regulation that has been gazetted within the last three months was gazetted on the 12th May, which was nearly three weeks before the election. Although several Labour speakers have stated and have deluded various pensioner organizations into believing, that the regulation reduced the number of the benefits that are available, it increased it. Although I have received complaints from various organizations and from various honorable members opposite, I have not received one complaint from a pensioner that a drug was not available. </para>

                        <para>- The Australian Government has been kept well and continuously informed by the United Kingdom Government and also by our own Australian legation in Cairo over the last year, and even longer, about all aspects of the negotiations in respect of the Canal zone establishments! I do not believe that the United Kingdom Government or- this- Government puts less value than previously on the security of thecanal and the. canal zone. However, methods of waging war vary, and the methods of coping with' the defence of a particular place or area vary similarly. We know very well that those matters have been taken into account by the United Kingdom Government. The agreement that has been reached bears in mind the necessity, in. the view of the United Kingdom Government and, I think, of ourselves, to get and maintain the co-operation of the Egyptian Government in respect of the security of the Middle East as a whole. The honorable member for Angas doubtless knows that, under the agreement, United Kingdom troops which have been, and still- are, in the canal zone are to be re-deployed and used in various ways, and decentralized in various other areas in the Middle East, with the security of thegeneral area in mind. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the Rum Jungle treatment plant will be opened by the Prime Minister on. the 17th September. This will be an. historic event, and I think it proper that members, of this House should have an opportunity to witness it. It is proposed that an all party delegation of, I think, about ten members, representing both the: Government and the Opposition, shall go. to Rum Jungle for the event.. </para>

                        <para>- Various elements affect the situation at Townsville and Mount Isa and I assure the honorable member that the Government is closely examining the problems that have developed there. Some of these problems are common to all northern Queensland ports, where there is heavy seasonal traffic in sugar and meat. The shipowners themselves have established certain priorities for cargoes and, generally speaking, they give a high priority to sugar and meat and lower priorities to general cargoes, including consignments from Mt. Isa which appear at the bottom of the priority list. The Government has initiated discussions with the shipowners in relation to the size of the labour quota at the port of Townsville. In fact, the registered port strength is at present above the- quota level prescribed for the port, and the shipowners have indicated their, reluctance to increase it. If the quota is increased as a result of the present discussions, additional labour will he made available specifically for Mt. Isa products. At the moment, I understand that about four pangs have been allocated to shipping in tire port. Wo are- trying to improve on that situation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Trade Promotion Division of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is, in accordance with Government policy, very active at present in helping Australian exporters to find new and wider markets. The recent trade mission to South Africa was highly successful, and very substantial new business connexions were made. Consequently, the Government recently approved the organization of a similar trade mission of Australian businessmen, who will be assisted by one officer of the Trade Promotion Division of my department, to visit selected countries in South - East Asia. In addition to that, a publicity drive is being organized in the United Kingdom, and a special publicity officer has recently been posted to Australia House. Moreover, we are coordinating the activities of the statutory marketing boards. I believe that a meeting is taking place to-day, which is one of a series of meetings, between the permanent head of my department and the chairmen of the statutory marketing boards in connexion with publicity drives in the United Kingdom. "We have also been sponsoring trade exhibitions in Montreal and other places. All those matters are indicators of the activity of the Government in its drive for additional Australian trade. </para>

Is he in. accord with the omission of the portrait of the ruling monarch from those notes? Does the fact that the notes seem to be following the pattern of the paper currency of the United States of America mean that, in the future, notes, instead of showing the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, will carry the portrait of the Prime Minister? </para>

                        <para>.- The office of  Chairman  of Committees is exceedingly important, but the honorable member for Fisher <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees in the last Parliament, did not appear to acknowledge the importance of his office, except insofar as it benefited members of the Australian Country party. I am confident that many members of the Liberal party in this chamber, if they were honest, would entirely agree with me. I propose the honorable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Galvin)</inline> because he possesses qualifications for the office that the honorable member for Fisher lacks. The honorable member for Fisher, by his actions as  Chairman  of Committees, has proved conclusively that he is not qualified to occupy that high and important position. It would be bad enough if the honorable member's failure properly to discharge the duties of  Chairman  of Committees resulted only from incompetence in interpreting the Standing Orders. But the matter goes much further, as I can testify from my own experience. I believe that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and I are the only members ever to be suspended from the service of this chamber merely for interjecting. Honorable members will recall that the honorable member for Fisher demanded an apology from me on the occasion to which I refer. I cite that as an example of the vicious manner in which he carried out his duties as  Chairman  of Committees. On one occasion he demanded of me an apology but could not tell me why . I. should apologize to the Chair. Finally, all he could say was that I had failed to obey an order of the Chair.  His  action on that occasion was typical of his con duct throughout the period that he was  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Kingston has had wide experience in public affairs. He has shown that he possesses the quality of tolerance which the honorable member for Fisher does not, and, apparently, will never possess. The members of the Liberal party are inclined to make a great joke of my remarks, but I recall occasions in this chamber when the same honorable members did not think that treatment that they received at the hands of the honorable member for Fisher, when he was in the Chair, was so funny ; and those honorable members did not hesitate to air their views in that respect not only in this chamber but also outside. </para>

                    <para>.- As the mover of the motion for the appointment of the honorable member for Fisher <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, I welcome the opportunity that the remarks of the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Edmonds)</inline> has provided for me to mention to the House some of the qualifications possessed by the honorable member for Fisher that fit him eminently for the position of  Chairman  of Committees. This is the third occasion on which the honorable member for Fisher has been nominated for that post; and I have no doubt that it will be the third occasion on which he will be elected to that position. That fact in itself is an indication of the appreciation of honorable members of the qualities which he has in the past brought to his task as  Chairman  of Committees. The honorable member for Herbert voiced disapproval of some of the actions that were taken by the honorable member for Fisher in his capacity as  Chairman  of Committees. Honorable members generally are highly appreciative of the work that the honorable member for Fisher has performed in that office, but it is inevitable that individual honorable members, like the honorable member for Herbert, should disapprove of some of the Chairman's actions. However, every honorable member who has had any experience whatsoever of duties of a judicial nature, such as those that devolve  upon the  'Chairman  -of .Committees, recognizes that that post calls for the application of the principles of impartiality and firmness and a determination to preserve basic dignity. Inevitably, some honorable members to whom such principles are applied by the  Chairman  will disapprove of the treatment that they receive. At the same time, it is .self-evident that on such occasions the .fault lies, not with the parson administering the Standing Orders, but with the honorable members who transgress them. Therefore, when exception is taken to -the application of these principles, the critics should first look to their own actions and bring their conduct into line with the dignity of the Parliament. If the critics took that advice they would have no need to criticize the  Chairman  of Committees for carrying out the duties of his office. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member for Fisher has invariably brought to his task as  Chairman  of Committees all the qualities for which he has been noted since he was elected to this chamber and which were responsible for his nomination originally for election to the post of  Chairman  of Committees. I refer to the high principles by which he has always been actuated in his activities on behalf <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> those whom he represents in the Parliament, particularly his qualities of moderation and fairness which he has invariably displayed both in debate and in his administration of the Standing Orders. One quality for which he has always been noted and which 'he has demonstrated time and time again while he has been a member of this House is his innate gentlemanliness. I suggest that his critics could well emulate his conduct in that respect. </para>

                    <para>.- Having listened to the flights of fancy of the honorable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Davidson)</inline> t suggest that the House should get down to facts. The position of  Chairman  of Committees is second only in importance to that of the  Speaker  because, sir, if you have not an efficient  deputy  the business 'of this House cannot be conducted in a proper manner. During the two preceding Parliaments in which the honorable member for Fisher <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> occupied the post of  Chairman  of Committees, the business &gt;of the committee was not carried out in the way in which it should have been. On many occasions, the honorable member completely lost control of proceedings in this chamber; and the dignity of this assembly suffered accordingly. The honorable member for Dawson did not say that the honorable member for Fisher is conversant with the Standing Orders. [ do not say that the honorable member tor Fisher is completely lacking in knowledge of the Standing Orders; but I say definitely that he is incapable of applying them. He has shown conclusively time after time that while he has occupied the chair he has been incapable of acting without bias. On every occasion on which a debate of a party political nature took place while he was in the chair, he invariably adopted a partisan attitude. He refused to permit members of the Opposition to criticize members of the Australian Country party or the utterances, or actions, of members of that party. The Standing Orders were in no respect designed to prevent honorable members of one party from criticizing honorable members of another party. On a number of occasions, the honorable member for Fisher, while he occupied the chair in committee, prevented me from criticizing policies of the Australian Country party or individual members of the Liberal party, not because my criticism offended against the Standing Orders, but simply because he disagreed with views that I expressed. On such occasions, the honorable member for Fisher acted, as the honorable member for Dawson has said, with firmness in that he prevented me from expressing mv opinions. On one occasion, when I endeavoured to vindicate my right -as an honorable member, be ordered me to leave the chamber, ostensibly under Standing Order 303. That standing order was adopted at a comparatively recent date. Why was it included in the Standing Orders? The interpretation of Standing Order 303 by the  Chairman  of Committees has been entirely different from the intention of those honorable members who drafted it. Indeed, Standing Order 303 has been used to protect members of the Australian Country party and the  Chairman  *&gt;f Committees from criticism. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Ibelievethatthe honorable member for Kingston, whose nomination for the office of  Chairman  of Committees I am supporting, hasa sound knowledge of the Standing Orders, and can interpret them wisely. He has had experience of the control of meetings of various kinds, and has shownthat he can control a meeting in accordance with the rules of the organization concerned. I am jealous of the high standing and dignity of this House, and I believe that we must have in control of our proceedings officers who can uphold that dignity. But I know, after more than four years' experience of the honorable member for Fisher as the  Chairman  of Committees, that the dignity of this chamber is disappearing. </para>

                    <para>In moving this motion, I should like to say that I am indeed appreciative of the twofold honour which has befallen me in that first, the people of the Division of Flinders have seen fit to give me their confidence and elect me to this Parliament; and, secondly, that the duty of moving and speaking to this motion has been entrusted to me. I am particularly happy to fill, on this side of the House, the seat that was held by my kinsman, the late Rupert Ryan, whose death so shocked all of us, and of whom I have heard nothing but praise. I trust that I shall be able to carry out my duties to the best of my ability, and in a like manner to that in which he carried out his duties here, for the good of both Australia and its people. This Twenty-first Commonwealth Parliament may well prove to be one of the most historic parliaments in our history. During the last Parliament we celebrated our fiftieth year as a nation. In this Parliament we may be said to be celebrating our coming of age. I believe that these two events will make us more fit to carry out the duties that lie ahead of us. Since we won World War II. nearly ten years ago, an even darker shadow has been moving closer to us and to all lovers of freedom in the world. In the past, any such threat to us has come from Europe, and we have had time to prepare against it. But let us not lose sight of the fact that the time is rapidly coming when  we  might easily feel the first impact from </para>
                    <para class="block">Asia. The pattern of current events is following closely the pattern that we have read about, heard about and even lived through. South-East Asia is being swallowed up bit by bit, and finally we might even be threatened. We saw the same pattern in the days of our late adversary, Adolf Hitler, who first took Austria, and later Czechoslovakia, in his march of conquest. Mussolini followed in his footsteps by taking Albania and Abyssinia. To prevent a similar pattern of conquest, we, together with others, may eventually be compelled to take a firm stand - even if there should be a risk attached to it. Individual strength and collective security will probably prove to be the solution of the important problems that I have outlined. Therefore,  we  have a double obligation to ourselves. First, we must lay a sound foundation for our future security, and, secondly, we must remember that we have grave matters to handle and that perhaps slight sacrifices may be asked of us to ensure a successful handling of them. One of the greatest statesmen in the world at present stands at our head. He is not only <inline font-style="italic">persona grata</inline> to the Throne, which symbolizes the British way of life, but also to the United States of America without whose friendship and unlimited resources the free world would be fettered. </para>

                        has rightly touched on the recent visit of  Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second and of  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh to this island continent. I did not have the honour, as did most honorable members present, of seeing the Queen in this House, but I saw her frequently in the streets during her visit. Therefore, J believe that I can rightly say that her radiant personality has given us a greater strength of will than we have ever had before, and that, as the first reigning monarch to visit these shores she has, by her. charm and kindness, knit us all even closer to the Throne. Let us, therefore as a rising nation, help the cause of freedom by showing the same solidarity that we exhibited when she was here among us. Australia to-day shows promise of future greatness which possibly even the pioneers could not imagine, although they, by their hard work, laid the foundations of our present life. Nobody can deny that we have one of the highest standards of living in the world to-day. First, gold was found in our semi-desert regions, and now we have a good prospect of bringing to reality our glittering dream of oil. Unquestionably, uranium is at present being mined in Australia in large quantities, and that element may ultimately even be the means of bringing water to our vast dry inland areas. If it should do so, those areas will be able to carry an even greater population than we could ever imagine. All this and much more is our heritage, and it  i3  therefore our bounden duty to preserve and develop this nation.

                        ascribed certain responsibilities to this Parliament in his Speech. He stated that they were thestrengthening of Australia's security, the maintenance of a healthy economy, the development of our natural resources and the social welfare of the Australian people. Much has been done recently, as the international situation has worsened, to make friends with our neighbors abroad, and to build up our defences at homo. However, much more remains to be clone. In the past the Australian taxpayer has grumbled because high ranking ministers have travelled overseas, but lately his opinion has changed because he has come to realize the value of such visits. Indeed, it has recent been stated that even the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline>
                        overburdened as he is with other duties, might travel to foreign countries in order to exercise his statesmanship abroad. If he should do so, I am sure that the taxpayers will realize that through his influence overseas, and because of the great knowledge that he will be able to bring to the affairs of government, the efficiency with which we deal with international problems will he greatly increased. As our influence abroad grows, and our defence power strengthens, our economy will benefit because incentives will be given for the necessary overseas capital to flow in and develop our resources, and attractive conditions will be developed for workers who will come from the vigorous youngsters now pouring out of our schools as well as from immigrants. In my electorate there are many many people who would be only too willing to work in nearby light industries. There are others who waste much time each day by going from the suburbs to the city.
                    </para>
                    <para>Our programme in respect of social services is well-known. The easing of the means test is now possible, and that will prove a great incentive to thrifty people to be even more thrifty. I trust that although much has already been done by this Government by way of taxation relief to lower income earners, perhaps it will consider raising the basic age pension for those who .are absolutely dependent upon the pension, particularly those drawing the single unit. Perhaps in the past they have had no incentive to save, or they may have found it too difficult to do so. At the same time, let us not forget that it was their indomitable spirit which enabled them to lay the foundation of the position in which we find ourselves to-day. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I repeat that I am very proud to be a member of this Government which has done so much for Australia, and I shall do my utmost to attain the goal towards which any Christian nation aspires. England owes much to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Winston</inline> Churchill, and realizes it. We owe a great deal to our Prime Minister, and we recognized it by re-electing him for what I hope will prove to be a record and historic term.. He has the confidence of the people. He has the confidence of his party. May God be with him and with all of us. </para>

Like the honorable member for Flinders, I am a newcomer to this House. I am taking the place of a man who, in the fulness of his life, thought that it was time for him to leave the public stage. Although all public men experience sadness when they leave public life and a lon&lt;* association with other men, I am  sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bernard</inline> Corser carries with him into retirement the goodwill not only of the members of this House but also1 of thousands of people in Queensland who1 appreciate his public service to that State.

Many of us thought that he would not be as- well as he is to-night when the Parliament assembled.

There can be no doubt that the confidence of the people of Australia in- the leadership of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Prime Minister was reflected in the confidence of the people of Queensland. If I were asked for my impressions to-day, I should say that the freedom of outlook that is expressed in the faces of honorable members on this side of the House far surpasses the outlook of socialism to which honorable members opposite are dedicated. There can be no doubt that freedom; of industrial life its opposed to socialism must play a. very important part in the future of this country. </para>
                        <para class="block">It was gratifying to hear  His Excellency  the Governor-General, at the opening of this Parliament, indicate th-n-t the Government will carry out the promises- that, were made during the election campaign. If, during the life of this Parliament, the Government strengthens: Australia's security, maintains ahealthy economy, develops our- natural resources', and. attends, to- the social welfare of the people, it. will have justified public confidence. It is; time that defence plays a very important part in the life, of Australia. I- agree with the statement of the honorable member for Flinders that, in view of events, in South-East Asia, we must safeguard the defence of our country. I am pleased to note, also, that the Government proposes to retain th': Foreign Affairs 'Committee and that it is hoped that all parties will participate in its deliberations'. There can be no division in relation to defence matters- in w democratic country like Australia. <inline font-style="italic">J</inline> have no doubt that the people of: Australia are more prosperous than they have ever been and that' that is due to the policy of the Government over the last four years. For many years I have listened to the claim that this country owes its prosperity to the wool industry. The Government recognized that the wool industry means so much to the security of our economy and that the export industries were so important that it decided to develop them. Consequently, Australia's exports have earned manymillions of pounds.. </para>
                        <para>It was pleasing to hear in the Governor-General's Speech to-day that our overseas funds are in credit to the amount of £570,000,000'. This indicates that the. Government has worked actively in the interests1 of the producers and the people of this country. But more should be done to assist the wool-growers. This Government's action in maintaining the auction system of marketing wool has afforded the wool industry a measure of protection and has done much to enable it to maintain its high position in the export trade. Though governments throughout Australia are ever ready to- acclaim- the wool industry as the basis of the nation's economy they have done little to help graziers in the fight against the blow-fly and other fleecedestroying pests. I trust that this Government will realize that the wool industry may have t'o pass through tryingtimes' with depressed prices, and' that it will help this industry as it has helped others. The wool industry may find itself in a position similar to that of the wheat industry, which has been of immense benefit to Australia and now finds itself short of markets. It is alarming and pitiable to learn that wheat-farmers' organizations in New South "Wales are advising growers to limit wheat acreages and to turn to other crops. This country lives largely by bread, and wheat is important. Production has been far greater than the total of our domestic requirements and our export quota under the International Wheat Agreement, and the position of the industry is now uncertain. But if anything happens to reduce our income from wool and to weaken the position of the wool industry, wheat will be of immense benefit in helping to maintain the stability of our economy. </para>
                        <para>This Government has done much tj assist the food-producing industries to achieve prosperity and to attain the production targets set for them by the Australian Agricultural Council. Those who might now be concerned about the position of some industries can take heart from the Government's fulfilment of its election promise to continue its good work. It has again guaranteed to the butter industry, another great food producer, a price of 49.29d. per lb. The cost of production in this industry to-day is 51.5Sd. per lb. The Government's response to the appeal of the dairying industry to continue the guarantee so that it may carry on under the present difficult conditions is an encouraging indication to all Australian food producers that this Government is watching their best interests and will 'do its utmost to help them to prosperity. Some of our great food-producing industries have not yet attained the production targets set out for them by the Australian Agricultural Council, but this Government's policy should ensure that they will do so by 1957-58, which was the target .year originally decided upon. The production targets in wool, wheat and .sugar have been achieved, and the target for beef has almost been attained. Producers of these commodities will need all the assistance that governments can give them in marketing their produce. I was pleased to learn to-day from the proceedings of this House that the trade missions ito South Africa and Sou.th-East Asia were highly successful and that Australia will continue to send .abroad missions of this sort. They are .good for the country., and the fact that banking institutions are sending representatives with them indicates that our financial institutions have confidence in the Government's policy. </para>
                        <para>It is essential that we find markets for the commodities that have been overproduced as a result of a clear policy that was endorsed by this Parliament. The Government acknowledges its obliga tions to many primary industries, and I may be pardoned for mentioning one that has been of great importance to Queensland in particular and to Australia in general for many years. I refer to the sugar industry of Queensland and northern New South Wales, to which the Government and this Parliament have given close attention. Australia is now the fourth largest producer of .sugar in the world. This position has been attained only by the assistance of Australian governments. The Liberal and Australian Country parties have never sought to take the full credit for the development of the sugar industry, for they acknowledge that the Labour party has helped greatly in the development of this industry. In all sugar-producing countries governments have had to take a leading part in the development of the industry, and in Australia a peculiar form of assistance to the industry has been adopted for many years. The judgments of the past were sound and other sugarproducing countries now look to the Australian sugar industry for a lead in solving their difficulties, particularly in disposing .of the over production of 'sugar. The industry in Australia has developed considerably .since 1949, when the Government led by the late Right Honorable J. B. Chifley sent the Queensland Premier of the time, the late <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr.. E.</inline> M. Hanlon, to London to negotiate an agreement with other British Empire producers for a larger quota of sterling sugar, which was then in short .supply on the world's markets. Under the new agreement Australia secured a market for 200,00.0 tons in addition to the quota of 400,000 tons which it had .been allotted under the former agreement. That meant that Australia had to supply 600,00 tons under the Empire Sugar Agreement. Whereas in 1948-49, we exported 444,000 tons, valued at approximately £13,000,000, last year we exported 740,000 tons valued at £28,325,000, the latter figure being 140,000 tons in excess of our sterling target. That expansion of the sugar industry resulted from the policy that was deliberately adopted by this National Parliament. There oan be no question that the Government has continued the Australian Sugar Agreement in a manner that is entirely satisfactory to the industry. To-day, with the exception of South African sugar, Australian sugar is the cheapest in the world. The Government has also been responsible for obtaining more favorable terms for the industry under the Empire Sugar Agreement which provides for a price of £46 a ton, an amount equal to the domestic price in this country. Recently, the Government sponsored an agreement among all the exporting and importing countries. I pay tribute particularly to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gair,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, for the manner in which they handled those negotiations. This Government has given considerable thought to the ramifications of the international sugar agreement. It recognized that Cuba, which was not a combatant in World War II., had produced 5,000,000 tons of sugar, and that because that country was unable to find a dollar market, over 2,000,000 tons of that quantity had been left to rot in the fields. The Government recognized that the price must be a figure which Great Britain and other sterling countries could afford to pay. Last year, sugar exported to Canada from this country earned for us a total of 10,000,000 dollars. Thus, it is a very handy commodity. </para>
                        <para>I compliment the Government upon its success at the recent general election. I acknowledge the outstanding benefits that it has conferred upon our primary industries, and I have no doubt that it will continue to pursue similar policies which will be in the best interests not only of our primary producers, to whom every encouragement should be given to increase production, but also of the people of this country as a whole. </para>

                            <para>.- First, I express gratification at my re-entry into this Parliament. I acknowledge the confidence and goodwill which the electors of Sturt expressed in choosing me as their representative here. At the recent general election I obtained the greatest majority that has been recorded since that constituency was formed. It is, indeed, a happy experience for me to renew my acquaintance with this Parliament in such circumstances. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I congratulate the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lindsay)</inline> and the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brand)</inline> upon their maiden speeches that they have just delivered. I have no doubt that all honorable members were keenly interested in the subjects with which they dealt and I believe that all of us will be happy to hear those honorable gentlemen whenever they participate in the deliberations of this House. If they felt somewhat nervous in making their maiden speeches, they did not reveal that fact. All honorable members who have undergone a similar ordeal fully appreciate the feelings which these newcomers to the House must have experienced in addressing this assembly for the first time. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members will be well advised to get straight certain facts about the result of the recent general election and to appraise accurately the degree to which the Government really represents the people of this country. This Government is a minority government. It does not enjoy the confidence of the majority of the electors, and honorable members opposite would do well to recognize that fact. The total polling figures provide clear proof that the majority of the electors do not endorse the policies which this Government seeks to implement. Recently, the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Eric Harrison),</inline> by some remarkable mathematical process, attempted to prove that a majority of the electors had voted for Government candidates. He made a statement to that effect practically at the very moment that the Chief Electoral Officer in Canberra, on the 16th June last, when the counting of votes had been almost completed, announced that candidates of the Government parties, that  is, both Liberal and Australian Country' party candidates, had polled a total of 2,117,669 primary votes whereas candidates of the Australian Labour party had obtained a total of 2,256,164 votes, or 138,000 more. Having regard to those figures, it is clear that the Government parties were returned to office solely because of the disproportionate distribution of voting strength in the various electorates caused by the growth of new housing areas and the movement of population. For that reason, although Government candidates polled a minority of total votes, the Government obtained a majority of seven seats in this House. Consequently, honorable members opposite cannot justify their claim that the people have again given them a mandate to govern. Further proof of the truth of that statement is the fact that the Government's majority of seats in this House was actually reduced at each of the last two general elections. Therefore, to-day, not the Government parties, but the Australian Labour party, speaks for the majority of Australian voters. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> should take great encouragement from the fact that the majority of the people so clearly endorsed the policy that he enunciated during the last general election campaign. Their endorsement would have been even more emphatic but for the fact that many people regarded Labour's policy as being a little too progressive or somewhat in advance of the times. Evidence is not wanting that those people have, since the 29th May last, realized the mistake that they then made. I have not the slightest doubt that the great majority of Australians are now concerned that this Government, being capable of implementing every pledge that the Leader of the Opposition gave to them on behalf of the Australian Labour party during the recent general election campaign, has not the power to govern. Tn these circumstances, Government supporters should not preen themselves upon the fact that they enjoy a majority of seats in this House. If the number of voters had been spread more equitably throughout the various individual electorates, not the present Government parties, but the Australian Labour party would now occupy the Treasury bench and a Labour government would be implementing its policy, fashioning a better way of life for out people, and advancing the welfare of this nation by enabling it to defend itself adequately and to exploit its magnificent natural resources. </para>
                        <para>I am astounded that the Government did not consider it necessary to summon the Parliament before to-day. During the last few weeks, grave international problems have arisen, and the public has been deeply concerned about the seriousness of the situation. The general election was held on 29th May. To-day U the 4th August. I believe that the Parliament should have been summoned at least three weeks ago because honorable members, as the elected representatives of the people, wore entitled to information about the international position. However, we had to rely upon the newspapers for information -about a number of grave matters. The Government admits that the .international situation is complex. .  His Excellency,  in his Speech to the Parliament this afternoon, said - . </para>
                        <para>The conduct of Australia's external relations over the last three years has been a complex task. The course of world events gives ground for concern that this task will he no less difficult during' the life of the 21st Parliament. </para>
                        <para class="block">If that statement reflects the view of the Government about the seriousness of the international situation, why was not 'the Parliament summoned earlier in order that the honorable members might be informed of the position? The Parliament has a right to information about the situation. The Prime Minister, in answer to a question this evening, indicated that he would make a statement' to the House to-morrow on this subject. The statement will be three weeks late. The Parliament should have been given information about those matters when the vital negotiations were in progress, so that it could have expressed its views about the policy which should be adopted by the Government in the interests of the people of Australia. </para>
                        <para>National defence and the present international situation are inseparable subjects. We have reason to feel concern about, our defence position. In the dying hours of the, last Parliament,, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Philip McBride).</inline> enunciated, a policy for. the defence, of Australia. I remind the House, in passing, that the statement was made more than, four years after the 'Government had assumed office. When the policy was disclosed to the world, even some supporters of the Government felt gravely concerned about the inadequacy of it. The london <inline font-style="italic">Time:</inline> described it as a poor policy and asked, hi effect, "Is this- another instance of too little too late?". Undoubtedly, that statement by the Minister for Defence aroused considerable apprehension in the minds not only of Australians, but also of the people of countries close to us in these matters. They saw Australia as a country that was only starting to determine a policy. </para>
                        <para>What has the Government done, and what does it propose to do, to strengthen our defences? I believe that this House, before it considers the budget, should have debates on international affairs, and national defence. The Minister for Defence should initiate a debate on defence matters by making a statement on that subject, laying the paper on the table of the House, and moving that it be printed. In that way, the House would be afforded an. opportunity to review fully these questions. Only in that way can. we be completely assured. I was one of the Labour ministers who were requested to take up the loose ends that a government of a similar political complexion to the present Government left when it was incapable of carrying on the war effort at the most serious period in the history of Australia. When we investigated the position, there was not a single fighter aircraft in this country, the last 30,000 rifles had been sent away, and the best of our trained men were in the- Western Desert. At that moment, we weise threatened with invasion by an enemy force. The anti-Labour Government had failed in its responsibilities to this: nation, and it was: left to the Curtin Labour Government to provide leadership and drive for the organization of the national, resources, which helped, in a large measure, to safeguard this country and other countries adjacent to it. That being so, I consider that- members, of the Government will need to- be- much more convincing in their general expressions, and. will need to provide additional proof to this. House before we shall feel satisfied they have fulfilled their obligations to Australia. I shall not prolong this debate,, because I. consider that it. should be concluded reasonably early; so. that honorable members may devote their attention to the vital matters of policy that I have mentioned. I thank the House for its indulgence and for the attention that it has paid to my remarks. I trust that many of the fine and happy associations that I have had in this Parliament in the past will be. renewed while I. represent the- Division of Sturt in this chamber.. </para>

The honors able member sought to gain some consolation from his theory about the number of votes cast for the Labour party at the last general election. That is a very dry store- indeed and he cannot expect to extract any nourishment from it. Irrespective of the number of votes cast for the Australian Labour party at the previous election, the fact remains that the Menzies- Government continues to occupy the treasury bench.. The people have spoken. They have returned to office the political parties that have given them the sensible form of government that they have enjoyed, since they took, the reins of government from the socialists and anti-Liberals in 1949.

I inform the honorable member for Sturt that his- quarrel in that matter is with the honorable member for Melbourne, who played a&gt; major part in the redistribution of electorates in 1949. The honorable member for Sturt was singularly modest in his claims about votes cast for the Australian Labour party, because he dealt only with primary votes. An overwhelming majority of preference votes of Communists were cast for the Labour party, and that fact would boost his figures a little. But the fact still remains that we are in- office, and continue to be the advisers of his  Excellency  the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>The success of the Government's plans, which were dealt with in the Governor-General's Speech, depends largely upon  co-operation between the Australian Government and the State governments. Such co-operation has been remarkable for its absence in the last few years. This has been due largely to the attitude of anti-Liberal governments in various States which have sought to make political capital out of the good deeds of this Government. No real effort has been made by State governments to work cooperatively for the advancement of our national welfare. The Governor-General's Speech contained an. interesting reference to plans for the extension of rail links and other transport systems for the purpose of developing beef production in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. </para>

                                <para>- Such references were notably absent from Governor-General's Speeches while the Labour party was in power. Valuable results could be achieved if the Government could obtain the cooperation of the Queensland Government in this work. It is all very well to talk of sending commissions into northern Queensland and the Northern Territory in order to consider the best way to develop the beef industry, but the files of various Commonwealth and State authorities have become choked with the reports of such commissions. ' There is an urgent need to increase beef production in the great breeding areas of the Northern Territory. A representative of one meat company told me in Queensland last week that his organization had planned to bring 30,000 head of cattle from the Northern Territory to its killing works at Rockhampton during 1953-54 but, because of the shortcomings of our transport system, had been able to move only 10,000 head. We must provide means of transport that will enable the industry to make the best use of the breeding areas of the Northern Territory in conjunction with the fattening areas of Queensland. Beef production can be increased vastly by that means. Unfortunately, the Queensland Government's attitude to such plans is unco-operative. </para>

                            member of the executive of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party is a representative of Queensland or the Northern Territory. So much for their protestations of interest in Northern Australia! The truth is that they entirely ignored the Queenslanders in their ranks when they selected the membership of their controlling body. Why did they not choose a Queenslander or the honorable member for the Northern Territory if they were honestly concerned for the welfare of northern Australia? They tell one story with their mouths, but their votes tell a different story. We want to know where the antiLiberals stand in relation to the development of the great open spaces of northern' Australia. I hope that some member of the Opposition will take the opportunity before this debate concludes to explain why his party neglected the representatives of Queensland when it elected its executive last night.

                        <para>The problems of northern Australia are real and pressing, and there is scope for co-operation in their solution between all political parties represented in this House. This Government would welcome honest and constructive criticism of its policies by members of the Opposition, and therefore I hope that the Opposition will ask those of its members who know and understand conditions in northern Australia to apply their minds to the subject. It is of no use for any honorable member who represents an area south of the " Brisbane line ", which the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> invented some years ago, to attack the Government on this issue. We on this side of the House want the Opposition to obtain the advice of members who come from northern Australia before it attacks the Government's plans for the development and the defence, of that vast region. These are dangerous times and we should work as a parliament, not merely as a party political institution in which opposing sides gibe and jeer at each other. We should be able to co-operate as Australians to solve Australia's problems. We can achieve great results if we put Australia's interests first and set aside our differences. All honorable members should be given fuller and freer opportunities to travel around Australia in order that they might acquire a complete understanding of the country's problems. If we were enabled to travel extensively through the country, we should be far better equipped than we are at present to grapple with the problems of the nation. I ask the Government to consider the advisability of making provision for organized tours to all parte of Australia by members of this legislature. The whole nation depends upon us for its development. Therefore, we should be properly equipped to discharge our responsibilities to it. </para>
                        <para>Greater co-operation is also needed between employers and employees. Fortunately, this Government has enabled great progress to be made in this direction and, as a result, it has attracted to itself the support of most of the trade unionists and working people of the community. In fact, the Government is in power to-day only because it has been able to foster far greater co-operation in the industrial sphere than existed previously. We are here because of that fact. We on this side of the House represent the majority and honorable ' members opposite represent, the minority of the electors, and I believe that each of us, using his influence, which is not inconsiderable, could promote some greater degree of good relationships between employer and employee. I believe also that there exist in Australia not only room for greater pride in workmanship, but also a need for greater pride in management. Management and labour should co-operate more closely. We, in this Parliament, have a direct responsibility to use our influence wherever possible to see that this is achieved. </para>
                        <para>We also have responsibilities towards people in the community who are poor, distressed and in need of the help that perhaps governments alone can give them. I was pleased to note that the Governor-General stated in his Speech that plans are afoot to relieve still further the disabilities suffered by some people in the community. A lot remains to be done in the field of social services, but I am proud that this Government has done more in the way of extending social services benefits to the community than any previous Government has done, irrespective of the duration of its term of office. </para>
                        <para class="block">However, as I have said, there is more to do. One of the things that. I should like , to see done is an extension of courses in rehabilitation work so that we may be able to give more people self-respect by restoring them to the working community as wage earners. In order to do so we require more trained and experienced social workers. I do not know the figures that apply in other States, because I have been unable to have them collated, but I know that in Queensland there are onlynine trained social workers for the Australian Red Cross and other similar organizations. They play a vital part in the rehabilitation of incapacitated people, and I believe that the Government would do a great service to the community if it were to initiate means whereby people in Government employment, and other people who so desired, could receive training in the field of social work. Such training would enable them to rehabilitate and restore to the wage-earning field people who are in need of such rehabilitation because of physical incapacity, who need all the sympathy and practical help we can give them. They are receiving a goodly amount now, but a great deal more could be achieved by increasing the number of trained and experienced social workers. In this way the problems of many of the distressed people in the community could be better understood, their way back to society and into the working community be made smoother, and their approach to their problems generally be made easier.. I leave it to the House. I believe that this desirable objective can be achieved and that the Government can do a. great deal towards the achievement of it. I am proud that the Government has again earned the overwhelming confidence of the people, and has been returned with a good majority. I believe that it will set out with vigour to implement the programme outlined in the Governor-General's Speech. That programme has been presented to us as one that will be for the good of the community, and I trust that, instead of receiving abuse from the Opposition, we shall receive from it encouragement and co-operation in meeting the problems that lie ahead. </para>
