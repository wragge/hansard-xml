I wish to report to the House that I have received a copy of the message from Her Majesty the Queen and the speech of His Excellency the Governor-General, delivered earlier today in the Great Hall to mark the inaugural sittings of the two Houses in this building.

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR NINIAN STEPHEN GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA ON THE OCCASION OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE PARLIAMENT IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA ON MONDAY, 22 AUGUST 1988</PARA>
<PARA> I begin with a message from Her Majesty the Queen, sent on this historic occasion:</PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted to learn that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia today begins its work in its new home. I have happy memories of the opening ceremony which, for me, was a highlight of the bicentennial year. I take this opportunity to send to the people of the Commonwealth of Australia my heartfelt wishes for their prosperity and happiness and am confident that the deliberations of the Parliament in this building will be directed to that end.</PARA>
<PARA>Elizabeth R.</PARA>
<PARA>22 August, 1988</PARA>
<PARA> Nations, like people, take their shape, their style and character, from their inheritance and from their environment. If today is, for Australia, historic, it is because this occasion, today, in the nation's capital, is the outcome of all that has shaped Australia over the past 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA> For thousands of years the first inhabitants of this then isolated continent lived their lives free of the need of principles for the governance of a nation in the modern world. But from the first day of that landing of the First Fleet in Sydney Cove 200 years ago, perhaps in all history the most curious of beginnings of any nation, a policy has been evolving: from governor's rule of a penal settlement, through stages of representative and then responsible government, first colonial and then federal and national, to this day; the day when, for the first time, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will sit in its own permanent home in the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA> Today when the members of this Parliament take their seats in the two chambers of this Parliament House they will know that in doing so they mark a momentous milestone in the long history of Australian democracy. That spirit of democracy asserted itself in colonial days and was the sure foundation upon which our federal nation was created. It has been dear to us ever since. This is the third home of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Our Constitution makes short work of Parliament's place of sitting; almost abruptly it declares, in section 125, that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of Government.</PARA>
<PARA>And sit in Melbourne it did, in borrowed splendour, for a quarter of a century, in that great palace at the top of Bourke Street, Victoria's own Parliament House, while the seat of government was duly determined and a provisional Parliament House built there, in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> It sat in Melbourne from its first day of sitting on the afternoon of 9th May 1901, until late in the afternoon of 24th March 1927. Then, both to the intensely emotional strains of Auld Lang Syne and to the no less intense relief of long dispossessed Victorian legislators, it adjourned; to meet next, in May 1927, in Canberra in that much more modest, white stuccoed brick building down the hill which, to the minds of at least three generations of Australians, has been the symbol of our federal parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, some sixty years on, Federal Parliament moves again but Australia's long traditions of democracy continue unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA> As the measure of these things goes in the world community of nations, Australia is among the most enduring continuous democracies that the world has known, even if we reckon only from the time of Federation, which, incidentally, does scant justice to our own vigorous colonial democracies of the second half of last century.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from Britain, from which our free institutions spring, and the two great democracies of North America, no one of the now many nations of Asia, Africa or the Americas, and only two, I think, of all the nations of Europe can count a similar uninterrupted span of over 87 years of democratic government-years of governments which have come to power by the free vote of the people and which have at all times held themselves effectively accountable to the people.</PARA>
<PARA> This great new Parliament House is itself a celebration of our democracy, of the success on this continent of what, in the heady days of Britain's reform bills of the last century, was thought to be a too hazardous experiment: the giving of the vote to all of the people. We inherited from Britain the traditions of parliamentary democracy; we took from the United States its own bold experiment in federalism. Then, bolder still, we combined the two and produced a federal and parliamentary commonwealth of which this building now becomes the symbol.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we Australians haven't in the past been very strong on symbols; at least away from the sporting field. We like to think we don't place much store by them or by the titles of office. That has always been the style of our democracy. But here on Capital Hill, we now have a symbol we can't ignore, one that will remind the Australian people of the weight of responsibility that rests on those it elects to Parliament, that will affirm to all who are elected to represent the nation in this House of the Parliament that it is upon the quality of their deliberations and the wisdom of their decisions that this nation's future and the welfare of all Australians, now and long into the future, will depend.</PARA>
<PARA> May the splendour of this building inspire them, and the nation, to high achievement and to noble goals.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House expresses its thanks and appreciation to the Parliaments, Governments and peoples of those countries, States and Territories and to those organisations which have so graciously presented gifts to Australia's new Parliament House and extends a warm welcome to those Presiding Officers and representatives who are present today. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, on the historic first sitting day in this building, I should like to take the opportunity to express the appreciation of the Parliament, the Government and the people of Australia to the parliaments, governments and peoples of those countries, States and Territories and those organisations which have generously presented gifts to Australia's new Parliament House. It is particularly pleasing that representatives of many of those donors, including the presiding officers of other parliaments, are able to be with us in the House today. The internal spaces of the building now display the embroideries, tapestries, paintings, maps and other gifts sent here from the four corners of the world and the four corners of Australia. They are already part of this building's own history. And, of course, outside the building we see sculptures, benches and trees presented by our friends to add to our enjoyment when we escape our duties within these walls. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that I make special mention of the gifts located within this chamber. The chamber table, made in Australia to the Parliament House architects' design, was sponsored by the Canadian House of Commons, and the Hansard table is a gift from the State of South Australia. All these gifts will remind us and future generations of parliamentarians of our international ties, our bonds with the Australian States and the responsibility that we owe to the Australian people to cherish and preserve our system of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In expressing my thanks to those who join us for this special day and to those who have presented gifts, I believe that they share our pride in this great building. Their generosity indicates the respect in which Australia's system of parliamentary democracy is held and which will prosper in these new surroundings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal and National parties join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the members of the Government in expressing thanks to people in Australia and around the world and organisations and nations that have contributed gifts to mark the opening of the new Australian Parliament House. They will over time add to the character and history of this building. The enormous number of countries which have presented gifts clearly demonstrates the enormous impact and interest that this building and its completion, scope and size have created around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A wide range of organisations, including such Australian bodies as the Country Women's Association, the National Australia Day Council, the Returned Services League of Australia, the War Widows Guild, the Embroiderers Guild of Australia and many other organisations representing ordinary Australians going about their ordinary lives, have presented gifts. The Opposition joins in thanking those people for the contributions they have made. </PARA>
<PARA> As we are talking about gifts, there is one gift that I regret we cannot talk about today in a positive sense. That is the gift of the United Kingdom Parliament on the establishment of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. It is a matter of very great regret that it is not in this place; but in time, I can assure the House, that gift will be returned to its rightful place in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, this is a House in which we all still need to settle. It is a forum where some will survive and others will not. The important part about the institution and the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is that the institution itself is a gift from another country. We have inherited the parliamentary system of the United Kingdom. Our Constitution translated that into the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Within this Parliament, the third House of the members of the Australian Parliament, it will be translated into interpreting the will of the people on behalf of the people in the democratic system to which we belong. The first and most significant thanks that I extend, in supporting the Prime Minister's motion, are to the British nation for having passed on to us the traditions of parliamentary democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that over the last few months so many people have contributed to making this building something more than just an architect's dream. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) have listed some of those who have made specific contributions. The important thing about those contributions is that they are reflections of the way in which the people of the world and the people of Australia are brought together through this place. This place is a forum where we can express, on behalf of all Australian people, the views and attitudes we have to international affairs and the views and attitudes we have to affairs within our own country and where we interpret and listen to those views that might be sent to us from abroad. People around Australia and people from abroad have contributed to making this House what it is. All of us say thanks to them. Perhaps in turn we can give thanks by continuing to be a positive member of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> This House will never be memorable and it will never be a place within which a positive contribution can be made towards good government in Australia unless we are prepared to interpret to those gifts and to our own gift of democracy to other countries some of the hope and opportunity that are essential within Australia. We are fortunate in so many aspects of our democracy; others sadly are not. Perhaps in thanks for what has been given to us we can pass on to others some of the hopes for freedom, including freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and those essences that came to us from Great Britain. By doing that no doubt we will be able in the best way to say thank you to those who have been generous to us. On behalf of the National Party I share totally in the sentiments of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House extends its sincere thanks to the following persons and organisations associated with the planning and construction of the new Parliament House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Mitchell/Giurgola and Thorp Architects who designed it;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the Parliament House Construction Authority, Concrete Holland Joint Venture and all contractors and workers who built it;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the artists, craftsmen and craftswomen who advised on and assisted in its furnishing and decoration; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the members of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, all past and present members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, officers of the National Capital Development Commission, Parliamentary and other staff,</PARA>
<PARA>for their endeavours in providing a magnificent permanent building for the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, the care and dedication that have gone into the construction of this building give us a lasting debt of gratitude to all those men and women who have been involved. To the architects, Romaldo Giurgola and Richard Thorp, we say thank you for your vision in designing a building of which all Australians, present and future, can be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA> We thank also the Chairman, members and the Chief Executive of the Parliament House Construction Authority and their staff for their hard work and dedication throughout the construction phase of the building. To Concrete-Holland Joint Venture, the construction manager, and all the other contractors and workers involved in the project who, by the labour of their minds and bodies, have made it the remarkable reality it is, we also express our gratitude. We also recall the work which has been done by the members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, officers of the National Capital Development Commission and parliamentary and other staff in the building. The Clerks must feel relief today that, after so much planning, these ceremonies are taking place at last. The new Parliament House embodies the work of over 10,000 men and women with contributions from individuals and manufacturers from every State and Territory. It is a national showcase demonstrating the skills and energy of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, the integration of Australian art and craft into the new Parliament House is a key part of the building's architectural expression. The artists, craftsmen and craftswomen have created significant works now displayed throughout the building. The meeting place mosaic, designed by Papunya artist Michael Nelson Tjakamarra and fabricated by masons William McIntosh, Aldo Rossi and Franco Colussi, stands in the centre of the ceremonial pool at the heart of the forecourt and is, appropriately, the first work of art visitors see when approaching this building. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Great Hall the tapestry, by 14 weavers of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, dramatically depicts an Australian coastal landscape created from paintings by Arthur Boyd. In the first floor public gallery, the embroidery, designed by South Australian artist Kay Lawrence and produced by more than 1,000 members of the Embroiderers Guild of Australia, narrates the history of Australians' involvement with the land. </PARA>
<PARA> The marquetry, designed by South Australian Tony Bishop and interpreted by Sydney craftsman Michael Retter, can be found in the Cabinet entry waiting room, the Cabinet Room itself, the formal entrance foyer and in your chair, Madam Speaker. There are many more craftspeople and artists who have contributed to the national character of the new Parliament House. Tasmanian woodworker Kevin Perkins and others have handcrafted tables and desks for the use in principal suites. Other important works of Australian woodcraft include the King table in the reception hall and display cases in the foyer exhibiting constitutional documents. </PARA>
<PARA> We could continue enumerating at length for, wherever we look, we see work worthy of praise. I am sure, Madam Speaker, that for many months to come we shall continue to discover new delights as we move around the new building. To all those who worked to give us this home for our Parliament I express my sincere thanks. I hope that many Australians will have the opportunity to share our gratitude-and, indeed, excitement-when visiting this Parliament House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I again join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in expressing our thanks to all those who have been involved in the original concept of the design and construction of this new Parliament House. More than 10,000 people have been involved in the construction of the Parliament House. It has been the largest construction work in the Southern Hemisphere. It is, as the Prime Minister said, a tribute to the workmanship, skill and vision of Australians from many walks of life. We owe a lot to the original design concept. It is worth recalling the words of the former Prime Minister who said in November 1978:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It will be the centrepoint of modern Canberra, the peak of the Parliamentary triangle, the hub of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, a place in which the affairs of the nation can be conducted in a more efficient way . . . The new Parliament House symbolises our unity as a nation and as a people and is an expression of our joint pride, faith and confidence in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those words would represent the views of all honourable members in this chamber, particularly on this opening day in the new parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us-and there are many-who served through the middle 1970s when the debate was raging over whether we should have a new parliament building will remember the intensity of that debate, and at various stages many would have imagined that this day would never come about. All of us would have to be honest and concede that there was an enormous range of opinion, varying from those who were dedicated with unremitting zeal to having a new Parliament House to those who were utterly committed to the preservation in some form or another of the old building. It has to be said that whatever the merits of that argument, what has been produced and what we are now in is a remarkable Australian achievement. It is a remarkable compliment to the architects; it is a remarkable compliment to the Parliament House Construction Authority; and it is a remarkable compliment to the men and women who worked on this site. On behalf of all members of the Liberal Party of Australia, I express our thanks to all those people. I also, on behalf of the Liberal Party, express the hope that the aspirations and confidence of the people of Australia about the quality of government and opposition in this building will, over the years ahead, be fulfilled and that in time this building will generate and transmit the feeling of affection and nostalgia that three generations of Australian politicians developed for the building down below us. On behalf of the Liberal Party and the Opposition, I warmly endorse the Prime Minister's remarks and thanks to those associated with the building. </PARA>

<PARA> The important aspects of this building have been its concept, its funding and the people who built it. I think we have a few Australian taxpayers out there who should share the sense of pride in the achievement of this building. It is truly a tremendous complex, and we all need to thank them for providing the funds from which it was built. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we thank all those who through your office, Madam Speaker, and that of the President, have been instrumental in making sure the decisions of the various authorities have been put in place. To the Clerks and Deputy Clerks and to Don Piper, who is the Director of the New Parliament House Secretariat, I give particular thanks and congratulations. Certainly, they have been instrumental in trying to translate the wishes of a disparate group of senators and parliamentarians into reality in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The architects have certainly had an enormous challenge. We all have views about some of the things that we like and other things that we do not like about this place, but individually they have come up with one of the largest buildings-in area at least-in the Southern Hemisphere. It is a tremendous concept and it has been described as one which will serve this nation and its people well, subject to the performance of those of us within it. They have provided the framework and it is now for us to carry out our duties in the same exemplary manner that they have displayed. We then move to the constructor: the Concrete Holland Joint Venture, David Chandler as the construction director, and the 10,000-strong work force-the subcontractors and the workers themselves. Rod Driver, Peter Berry and all of the members of the Building Workers Industrial Union have made an enormous difference to this place. It has been built on time, opened as scheduled and, in our bicentennial year, is a tremendous accomplishment. All of us pay them due tribute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament House Construction Authority, the original board-Sir Bernard Callinan, Sir John Overall, Bob Ling, Tony Powell and Neil Macphillamy-the second board under Alex Morokoff, and the members and executives who served with them have contributed enormously to translate the concept into reality. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have spoken briefly of the artists and the craftsmen: Michael Tjakamarra Nelson, Arthur Boyd, David Upfill-Brown, Bernie Koker, Gordon Andrews, Rob and Rhyl Hinwood, Peter Travis and Paul Harvey. I could go on. All, within their responsibilities, have made this place a reality. While I think each of us see some parts of it that perhaps we might have liked to do differently, they have produced a magnificent Parliament House. We pay them due tribute and only wish that those of us who live and work within this place can maintain the same high standards of excellency as we perform our duties. </PARA>

Increased doses of radiation for all Swedes have resulted from external radiation as well as internal radiation arising from the intake of food contaminated with Caesium-134 and Caesium-137 from the Chernobyl fallout. Food stuffs such as reindeer meat and lake fish can give a relatively high radiation dose to a person with a high consumption of these products. In order to map the doses from internal radiation, whole body measurements have been performed on a random selection of individuals as well as on individuals belonging to affected groups including the Sami people. The whole body measurements are performed in Stockholm (National Institute of Radiation Protection), in Gothenburg (Department of Radiophysics) and in Umea (Department of Radiophysics at the University in collaboration with the Research Institute of National Defence). These measurements are supported by grants from the National Institute of Radiation Protection.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no deliberate exposure of humans to increased radiation levels. The National Food Administration, moreover, has issued special cautionary diet recommendations for people with a high consumption of own-produced food stuffs such as reindeer meat and lake fish, which include a large proportion of the Sami population.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As cautionary advice has been issued by the Swedish authorities, it would not be appropriate to lodge a protest.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr Barry Jones</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and its predecessor, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC), have conducted research and development programs into radioactive waste management for some years in areas such as:</PARA>
<PARA> Development of the Synroc concept in conjunction with the Australian National University and Griffith University. The Synroc program is a significant contribution to international efforts to develop an improved solution to the storage and disposal of high level radioactive waste. Construction of a Synroc demonstration plant was completed during 1987. The facility will be fully commissioned in 1988, with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of fabricating, on a commercial scale, Synroc containing simulated (non-active) radioactive waste. This research is being pursued in collaboration with establishments in the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy.</PARA>
<PARA> Analogue studies of radionuclide migration to improve understanding of the possible behaviour of radioactive waste disposed of underground. These studies will involve examining the geological and hydrogeological processes acting on uranium ore bodies in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory which may resemble those processes acting upon a high level radioactive waste disposal facility. The project will be carried out under the auspices of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency. The three-year program will involve participants from Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> Uranium environmental studies concerned with the formation, detection and characterisation of pollutants and their geochemical fate and toxicity. These studies focus on low level waste materials and cover research on topics such as uranium mining and milling practices, leaching characteristics of Australian ores, alternative treatment processes, neutralisation of mill effluents, reduction of radon release from tailings dumps, determination of pollutant sources from open-cut mining, transport of contaminants by ground and surface waters, soil-solute interactions, toxicity of heavy metals and the uptake of pollutants by flora and fauna.</PARA>
<PARA>The only other research on the storage of radioactive waste in Australia is the work being undertaken by CSIRO on the thermosyphon loop concept for high level waste disposal. This is a way of cooling down the waste (in whatever form it may be, including Synroc) by circulating water over it using a thermosyphon-the system of water circulation that naturally occurs in solar water heaters. This creates a local hydraulic short circuit which confines the groundwater in the near vicinity of the waste, so preventing the waste from being transported away from the site and back towards the surface.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The main type of waste which is being considered for immobilisation in Synroc is the high level liquid waste resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear power reactor fuel. A typical 1000 MWe nuclear power station produces about 30 tonnes of spent fuel per year. After useful nuclear material is recovered for future recycling as reactor fuel, about 1 tonne of high level liquid waste remains, which contains almost all of the radioactivity originally in the spent fuel.</PARA>
<PARA>Mill wastes from uranium mining operations contain low levels of radioactivity from radium and other daughter products of uranium and radon. Most of the radioactivity present in the original orebody remains in the mill tailings.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Research conducted in Australia into high level waste storage and disposal has involved simulated (non-active) radioactive materials. ANSTO's collaboration with other countries is expected to extend the research in the future to the use of active materials.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) ANSTO recently initiated research into certain aspects of rare earth processing following an increase in interest by a number of companies in establishing a rare earth processing plant. Several companies (including Allied Eneabba PL, Rhone Poulanc and Currumbin Minerals PL) have undertaken feasibility studies and prepared Environmental Impact Statements in support of development applications for rare earth processing plants. The main areas of ANSTO's research are:</PARA>
<PARA> Treatment and management of radioactive wastes generated in the rare earth extraction process.</PARA>
<PARA> Investigation into the behaviour and fate of radioactive materials in various stages of the rare earth extraction process.</PARA>
<PARA> Research into the solvent extraction process.</PARA>
<PARA> Environment aspects of rare earth processing plants.</PARA>
<PARA>The results of research in these areas would have a bearing on the design and construction of rare earth processing plants.</PARA>
<PARA>The proceedings of a conference entitled ``Rare Earth Horizons 1987'', which was jointly organised by the CSIRO Division of Applied Physics and the then Department of Science, were published in September 1987 by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. A copy of this publication is held by the Parliamentary Library.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Where a person carrying on a business of primary production on land in Australia incurred capital expenditure on or before 23 August 1983 on certain land improvements, including land clearing, the expenditure is deductible in equal instalments over ten years under section 75a of the Income Tax Assessment Act, commencing with the year the expenditure was incurred. The annual deduction remains available as long as the person who incurred the expenditure uses the land in a business of primary production or derives rent from the land while it is used in a business of that kind by a tenant. Capital expenditures incurred after 23 August 1983 on such activities are ineligible for deduction under s75a. Recurrent land clearing expenditures may be deductible in the year incurred under s51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act (the general deduction provision of the law).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is insufficient information available to accurately estimate the cost of introducing full deductibility in the year of expenditure for land clearing expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The benefits and costs arising from immediate deductibility in the year of expenditure of land clearing activities from changed tax treatment would be very difficult to assess. This is because the value of such a concession is dependent on the tax position of the individual primary producer-a primary producer in a loss position, for example, would not be able to take advantage of immediate tax deductibility.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that any kind of business activity, including land clearing, is dependent on the future financial returns from that activity, which are only partially determined by the tax treatment applicable to it. It is not practicable for me to determine the impact of granting immediate deductibility on the total financial returns from this activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Benefits from increased land clearing will initially be dependent on the value of resultant increase in agricultural output. However, to the extent that land clearing activity would have been undertaken anyway, concessional taxation treatment would involve a net cost. Environmental considerations might also need to be taken into account when considering the net benefits of taxation concessions for land clearing. The section 75a provisions were abolished in order to discourage indiscriminate land clearing, as well as for revenue reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>TERTIARY ASIAN LANGUAGE</PARA>
<PARA>COURSES/STUDENTS</PARA>
<PARA>*In 1987 the Asian Studies Council carried out a telephone survey of higher education students successfully completing an Asian language unit in 1986. Institutions participating were advised that the information collected would be `aggregated and presented on a national and maybe state basis, by sector, but individual institutions will not be identified or compared'. The extracts provided (Tables 1 and 2) do not, therefore, provide information about individual institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>*Table 3 lists those higher education institutions which offered Asian language courses in 1986. No consolidated list is available for either 1987 and 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>*In 1988 the Asian Studies Council will establish an inquiry into the teaching of Asian studies and languages in higher education, the purpose of which will be to review the current situation in higher education and to define what changes are necessary in order to meet Australia's requirement for Asian studies into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry will also consider whether a national language institute is needed to service the immediate needs of government and industry.</PARA>
<PARA>*A separate inquiry into TAFE provisions will be conducted at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA>*In 1988 the Asian Studies Council will commence work on a data base of all formal tertiary Asian languages and Asian studies courses plus non-formal, adult education courses.</PARA>
<PARA>SECONDARY ASIAN LANGUAGE</PARA>
<PARA>COURSES/STUDENTS</PARA>
<PARA>*In 1987 the Asian Studies Council commissioned a nationwide survey into the study of Asia and its languages in Australian schools. One of the purposes of the study was to compile available data relating to the teaching of Asian languages. The most recent data available have been included in the following tables:</PARA>
<PARA> TABLE 4-Number of secondary students studying an Asian language by State/Territory and System in 1986 or 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> TABLE 5-Secondary schools offering an Asian language, 1986 or 1987. (School numbers are available for all States but names of most schools are not available.)</PARA>
<PARA>*Information about students presenting Asian languages at matriculation level, 1986, is contained in Table 6. This information was extracted from `National Policy on Languages', Commonwealth Department of Education, 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>*In order to improve the availability of Asian studies/languages statistics, the Asian Studies Council will encourage educational systems to collect more comprehensive and compatible information on an on-going basis.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and allocated to its members as a supplement to existing reserve assets. Members of the IMF are required to pay amounts not exceeding 25 per cent of their contributions (ie, of their quota) in reserve assets specified by the Fund (SDRs or usable currencies), with the balance of quotas to be paid in members' own currencies.</PARA>
<PARA> All member countries of the IMF are participants in the SDR Department and are eligible to receive SDR allocations. They may use SDRs in transactions and operations among themselves, with the IMF itself and with official entities prescribed by the Fund. The category of prescribed holders currently comprises four central banks, three intergovernmental monetary institutions, and nine development institutions as follows: the African Development Bank, Abidjan; the African Development Fund, Abidjan; the Andean Reserve Fund, Bogota; the Arab Monetary Fund, Abu Dhabi; the Asian Development Bank, Manila; the Bank of Central African States, Yaounde; the Bank for International Settlements, Basle; the Central Bank for West African States, Dakar; the East African Development Bank, Kampala; the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis; the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Washington, DC; the International Development Association, Washington, DC; the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Rome; the Islamic Development Bank, Jeddah; the Nordic Investment Bank, Helsinki; and the Swiss National Bank, Zurich.</PARA>
<PARA> Prescribed holders can acquire and use SDRs in transactions and operations with other prescribed holders and with any of the IMF's 151 member countries. Prescribed holders have the same degree of freedom as IMF members to buy and sell SDRs, both spot and forward; to borrow, lend, or pledge SDRs; to use SDRs in swaps and in settlement of financial obligations; or to make donations (grants) with SDRs.</PARA>
<PARA> It follows that, as far as the IMF requirements are concerned, the institutions listed above are free to receive contributions in SDRs rather than national currencies, if they so wished.</PARA>
<PARA> Besides the IMF, my Department is aware of the Arab Monetary Fund and the East African Development Bank having accepted SDRs for payment of capital subscriptions from some of their member countries. Furthermore, my Department understands that the IMF is not aware that other prescribed holders would object if their member countries wished to make their contributions in SDRs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since the first allocation in 1970, SDRs have been used in a wide variety of transactions and operations. I am informed that the African Development Bank and the African Development Fund have been considering the use of SDRs in their operations, and have expressed interest in receiving contributions in SDRs.</PARA>
<PARA> For institutions using the SDR as their unit of account, the use of SDRs for donations, capital subscriptions and loans has the advantage of avoiding exchange rate exposure. The adoption of the SDR as the unit of account, and in particular as the denomination of capital subscriptions, may provide more stable values than obtained from the use of individual national currencies. SDRs earn a market rate of interest and as such could form part of the prescribed holders' short-term investment portfolios. For these purposes, a prescribed holder may need to acquire SDRs with currency or may need to sell SDRs already held to obtain currency. These purchases or sales may be made by entering into transactions by agreement with another holder of SDRs. The IMF can arrange those transactions on request.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) What were the principal arguments for and against the FAO Budget.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Four countries voted against the Appropriation Resolution 1988-89 for the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) budget. These four countries were: Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and the USA. Seven countries abstained and the other members of the FAO supported the Resolution. (See Attachment).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Countries which voted against the FAO Budget claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA> it did not fully meet their objective of zero growth.</PARA>
<PARA> there was no inclusion of an appropriate contingency plan, nor adequate provision for member input into realigning programme priorities in the possible event of a shortfall in financial resources in the forthcoming biennium.</PARA>
<PARA> Members' proposed assessed contributions represented a sharp increase in assessments for many countries in terms of local currencies. Assessments should have been kept at a level to encourage payment and to avoid the possibility of increasing the extent of arrears.</PARA>
<PARA> the Programme of Work and Budget did not provide clear guidelines to the Secretariat for priority setting among substantive programmes.</PARA>
<PARA> the budget failed to contain growth in a responsible manner by clearly identifying and ranking programme priorities to enable cost containment through rational programme cuts and further streamlining of administrative procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> the increase in assessments, especially those related to the Working Capital Fund and the Special Reserve Account, was not compatible with Members' national objectives of restraint in public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> the proposed budget expenditure (US$492m) was too high in view of the actual expenditure of only US$412m out of the authorised budget of $437m for the previous biennium.</PARA>
<PARA> the budget lacked transparency especially on cash spending.</PARA>
<PARA> Countries which supported the FAO Budget at the 24th Conference advanced the following main reasons to justify their positions:</PARA>
<PARA> the organisation plays an important role in assisting developing countries and the budget represented some of the aspirations of the developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> FAO shoulders immense responsibilities in meeting the needs and requirements of member countries and this should be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA> a real growth rate in the budget was acceptable as it was in accordance with their governments' policy of giving priority to rural development and the FAO's leading role in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> they supported the general principles and objectives of the organisation (ie. it stood as a valued institution in the multilateral system).</PARA>
<PARA> it was necessary to adopt the budget as a whole to facilitate the proposed Programme of Work.</PARA>
<PARA> the general organisation and administration of the FAO deserved approval.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Significant progress was recorded during the 1987 session in the negotiation of a Chemical Weapons Convention. The `rolling text' of the draft convention, which was produced at the end of the session, constitutes a highly developed document. Main developments during 1987 were:</PARA>
<PARA> agreement that past transfers of chemical weapons should be declared</PARA>
<PARA> the further elaboration of provision for verification arrangements including the monitoring of existing chemical weapons stockpiles after entry into force of the Convention, and provisions for the destruction of those stockpiles, and for the declaration, closure and elimination of chemical weapons production facilities</PARA>
<PARA> intensive consideration of how toxic chemicals produced commercially should be dealt with under a convention</PARA>
<PARA> comprehensive preparatory work on the powers, functions and inter-relationship of the various organs of the International Organisation to implement the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia plays a very active role in the negotiations, through its membership of the Conference on Disarmament, the body in which the Convention is being negotiated. The Australian delegation to the Conference is supported by experts from the Department of Defence's Materials Research Laboratories. The delegation participates in the work of the various working groups of the Chemical Weapons Committee of the Conference and has contributed a number of working papers. Australia has given particular attention to facilitating the development of a regime to verify that chemical weapons are not produced in the civilian chemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has also been active outside the Conference in seeking to resist the spread of chemical weapons while the Convention is being negotiated. This activity has included the successful negotiation and arrangement of a resolution at the 1987 United Nations General Assembly to secure consensus to authorise the Secretary-General of the United Nations to undertake investigations of experts of the use of chemical weapons. Australia has also contributed expert manpower and other resources to such investigations. In addition Australia has undertaken consultations bilaterally with some fifty countries on the question of export controls on chemicals capable of being used for the manufacture of CW. The number of countries applying such controls has expanded and some twenty of them have met at approximately half-yearly intervals for policy consultations organised and hosted by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The major conceptual items of the Convention appear to have been resolved but a vast body of technical detail remains to be settled. This will require a sustained effort by all forty countries participating in the Conference on Disarmament negotiations and is not likely to be completed in 1988.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="54" SPEAKER="Hayden The Hon W.G." NAMEID="RK4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NORTH SYDNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I did not make any such request. What I made, was an offer that Mr Grey could leave Mozambique on my flight if the Mozambican Government decided to release him rather than bring him to trial.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Mozambican Foreign Minister told me that Mr Grey would have access to legal representation and I understood him to say that Mr Grey's case would be brought before the courts during the week following our discussion.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The President of Mozambique told me that he would take a personal interest in Mr Grey's trial. He said he did not have authority to release him and he undertook to have the status of the case clarified quickly. He also gave a guarantee that Mr Grey would receive adequate medical attention.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I have not made any public release on what I had been told in relation to Mozambique's established legal procedures but the President of Mozambique did tell me that his country had a legal system whose procedures would be followed in relation to Mr Grey's trial, including the right of appeal. In addition to what the President told me we know that Mozambique's legal procedures fall broadly into two categories-trial by a civil court for regular civil and criminal matters and a military-run court relating to security-type cases. The procedures provide for legal representation and this was confirmed to me by the Foreign Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I expect Mr Grey to be tried under established Mozambican procedures. The Mozambique Minister of Justice has told our Ambassador-designate that an Australian Government representative will be free to attend the trial.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have indicated that there are established legal procedures in Mozambique. I am aware that those procedures and Mozambique's judicial system differ in many respects from our own.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Since our discussions in Maputo the Mozambican Foreign Minister has stated that there was a misunderstanding over what he said to me in Maputo. It was the papers concerning Mr Grey's case and not Mr Grey himself which were to be brought before the courts during the week following our discussion. The Attorney-General has confirmed that he received the papers on 26 February.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Mozambican authorities have stated that Mr Grey will be brought to trial when their investigations are complete. Substantial delays in bringing people to trial occur in judicial systems throughout the world including our own. I am continuing to press the Mozambique Government to bring Mr Grey to trial at the earliest possible date, and our understanding is that our representations in this regard are likely to be successful. We have an Embassy officer in Mozambique to ensure that Mr Grey receives full consular protection.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) for public relations: $186,904</PARA>
<PARA> (c) for opinion research: $25,850</PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional Commission has budgeted as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> $250,000 for promotion and advertising; and</PARA>
<PARA> $290 for consultants</PARA>
<PARA> This budget was not subdivided into the categories listed in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Actual expenditure (excluding salaries) from 1 July 1987 to 31 December 1987 has been:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for advertising: $474,799</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for public relations: $180,135</PARA>
<PARA> (c) for opinion research: $29,729.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Expenditure is expected to be in accordance with budget, with the following exceptions:</PARA>
<PARA> The advertising budget for the High Court of Australia is estimated to be $8,000 over budget due to the unexpected retirement of the Clerk of the High Court in March 1988 and the necessity to advertise the vacancy in all major metropolitan Australian newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Commission's advertising expenditure is expected to be $6000 under budget because advertising costs associated with filling the position of Chairman have been paid by the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The advertising expenditure for the Law Reform Commission of Australia is expected to be $12,000 under budget due to a lower than anticipated level of recruitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The NCSC is expected to be approximately $5000 over budget because high staff turnover has required greater advertising than anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bankruptcy Division is approximately $30,000 over budget estimates due to the increasing number of bankrupts and increased advertising charges.</PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is $60,000 (approx) under budget estimates. This is the first full year of operation for the Commission and some programs have not been fully established.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure for the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs for advertising is expected to be under budget by $15,200. The Information Co-ordination Branch in the Department of Administrative Services advised against using the funds for buying advertising time on radio nationally and a more restrictive program was devised.</PARA>

<PARA> Australian Federal Police Recruitment. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) participates in a number of information/public relations campaigns, for instance Police 7, Junior Police 7, both of which are relayed by the local Canberra TV Station, road safety campaigns at Christmas and Easter, and Police Week. In respect to these campaigns no advertising agency was used, as the campaigns are run in conjunction with the local Canberra media and/or the shopping centres who cover the majority of cost involved. The main cost of the campaigns to the AFP relates to salary costs of members partaking in them.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) $28,478.21.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Given the very wide ranging commercialisation opportunities presented by the world class research, skills and facilities available within the Defence Science and Technology Organisation I considered that it would be inappropriate for an advisor with the breadth of commercial experience of Mr Graham Spurling to be unnecessarily restricted by detailed terms of reference. While Mr Spurling's primary role is to advise me on the establishment of a commercial cell within DSTO he will be able to provide me with advice, as I need it, to develop the full range of DSTO's commercialisation opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have yet to establish any companies. However, as I advised the House on 19 May 1988, DSTO will participate in a joint venture company established to commercialise the infra-red technology developed at DSTO Salisbury. The company is to be set up by the Adelaide Innovation Centre. Arrangements for this participation are close to conclusion following discussions on equity and licensing arrangements with the industry involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To obtain maximum value from DSTO commercial opportunities it is my intention to use the most appropriate commercial mechanism in each case.

<PARA> (18) The delay between Mr Grey's arrest on or about 3 November and the visit from the High Commission in Harare on 14 January was in the first place due to difficulties in establishing what precisely had happened to him and whether he had in fact been arrested. Because of the dislocation in Mozambique resulting from widespread attacks by Renamo rebels, communication between Maputo and provincial centres is not as efficient as it might be. Secondly, there was difficulty in confirming Grey's precise whereabouts, whether in Tete Province or in Maputo. Lastly, there was delay in the procedures for getting permission to visit him. As soon as this permission was received on 28 December, the Acting High Commissioner made arrangements to visit Maputo as soon as he was able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) No.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The UN Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) was established in 1971 by resolution of the UN General Assembly to develop and implement short and long term narcotics control programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The purpose of UNFDAC are to plan, implement and monitor multilateral and country programs designed to reduce the global production of narcotic raw materials such as opium (for heroin) and coca leaf (cocaine), and to restrict the processing, distribution and consumption of refined narcotic products.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) UNFDAC works by providing resources for projects to overcome specific narcotics related problems in countries or regions. These projects normally involve the provision of technical assistance and personnel training programs to increase the capacities of individual governments in areas such as</PARA>
<PARA> expansion of research and information facilities of drug control organisations;</PARA>
<PARA> law enforcement and drug control administration;</PARA>
<PARA> crop substitution and rural development; and</PARA>
<PARA> the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) There is no assessed scale of contributions for UNFDAC. All contributions are made by donors on a voluntary basis. Australia contributed $400,000 for the 1988 calendar year, representing in part a catch-up payment for 1987 when the contribution was reduced from the previous years' figure of $200,000 to $50,000 due to budgetary constraints. No commitment has been made to UNFDAC for 1989 at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The benefits to the Australian anti-drug campaign flowing from our participation in and contributions to UNFDAC derive principally from overall reductions in the global production and trafficking of narcotics, which should lead to lower quantities of drugs being available for illegal import into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is also recognised internationally as a nation in the forefront of the campaign to reduce drug dependency and ameliorate drug related social problems. Contributions to the Fund allow for direct Australian input and involvement in developing global drug control strategies. Membership also promotes an increased knowledge and awareness of international drug issues within Australian government agencies, non-government organisations and the general community.</PARA>

<PARA> Given the great variety of royal commission and the complexity of the issues addressed, it is not proposed to attempt to summarise those of their recommendations which have been implemented or the cost to revenue of those recommendations. Such information is not readily available and I am reluctant to authorise the considerable time and effort which would be required to be expended in order to obtain it.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Statistical information in regard to prosecutions is not generally kept in a form that indicates how particular prosecutions arose. As a consequence statistical information in relation to the number of persons prosecuted as a result of a particular royal commission is not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of inquiries of the Director of Public Prosecutions and an examination of records relating to the former Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department it can be said that at least 59 prosecutions have resulted from royal commissions in the period specified, 46 relating to the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union and 13 relating to the Royal Commission into Australian Meat Industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There was no formal agreement by the various staff associations to the Western Australian country districts amalgamation. However, several concerns, including the impact on staff levels at Telecom's Bunbury Office, have been the subject of continuous review and consultation with the relevant staff associations and staff concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. However, staff reductions are expected to be minimal and will occur through voluntary transfers to Perth, natural attrition or redeployment within the Bunbury Office.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The country districts amalgamation policy itself is not expected to involve any forced relocations or redundancies. However, separate arrangements for closure of the Bunbury Office of the Engineeering Department have led to one Telecom officer being directed to relocate to Perth. Discussions are still proceeding with a view to a suitable alternative placement of that officer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 24 March 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What evidence is there that South Africa is backing the (Renamo) resistance forces in Mozambique.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="80" SPEAKER="Hayden The Hon W.G." NAMEID="RK4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="PARKES">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that RENAMO continues to receive assistance from external sources. Only recently, on 26 March, Mr Ian Grey, the Australian missionary who was charged with various offences in connection with his assistance to RENAMO, provided some information indicating support from South Africa (and elsewhere) for that organisation. The Mozambican Government says that there can be no question but that South Africa is supplying RENAMO. For example, an attack by three to four hundred insurgents in February on the Mozambican town of Moamba was launched from a training camp at Phalaborwa in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> Observers in Mozambique have said that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that South Africa, at the minimum, allows its territory to be used as a base for RENAMO activities. This would amount to material assistance which South Africa, in the 1984 Nkomati Accord, undertook to cease.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems possible that, while official South African assistance to RENAMO may have ceased with the 1984 Nkomati Accord, unofficial assistance continues through clandestine means. It is partly for this reason that concrete evidence of South African support is hard to find.</PARA>
<PARA> An exception was in 1985 when Zimbabwean troops in Mozambique captured a RENAMO base at which documents were found which showed continuing South African support for RENAMO after the Nkomati Accord. Some of these documents were published and the South African Foreign Minister conceded ``technical'' violations of the Accord.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also refer the honourable member to the 4 March 1988 issue of Africa Confidential, which contains further information on South Africa's links with RENAMO. He might also wish to consult the testimony of US Assistant Secretary of State Crocker before the US Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs on 24 June 1987.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="81" SPEAKER="Morris The Hon P.F." NAMEID="HI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GOLDSTEIN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based, in part, on information provided by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA) has provided a cash grant of $2.5m following application by Imparja. The grant application was independently assessed by the ABA and approved by them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment, Education and Training has provided $3.2m to CAAMA for the technical training of 35 people to work for Imparja.</PARA>
<PARA> Total funding provided by the Aboriginal Development Commission to Imparja Television and its main shareholder, CAAMA, is $2.0m. This was partially in the form of a loan at call to CAAMA for $34,554 for legal costs to fight the appeals against the granting of the RCTS licence to Imparja Television. The remaining funds have been used to purchase 1,965,646 $1 ``B'' class Preference Shares from Imparja Television Pty Ltd. The funds from this share issue have been used for the purpose of:</PARA>
<PARA> fitting out an interim studio for satellite broadcasting services;</PARA>
<PARA> consultancy and other establishment costs; and</PARA>
<PARA> satellite and other uplinking equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the figure of $2.0m has been supplied by the Aboriginal Development Commission and exceeds the $1.8m that was put forward as evidence to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry for Imparja's licence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also owns the present site and buildings occupied by Imparja Television and leases these premises to Imparja.</PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations are in progress for the Commission to purchase a site near Alice Springs and for Imparja Television to lease this for its future broadcasting and production studio.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Sum: 1987-88-$545,650</PARA>
<PARA> Purpose: To operate 8KIN-FM to service Alice Springs, Ali Curung, Hermannsburg and Santa Teresa. To produce relevant videotape material for distribution to Aboriginal communities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Also see (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No effort was made to purchase a shareholding in NTD-8 in Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department of Aboriginal Affairs did not obtain a valuation of Territory Television.</PARA>
<PARA> The ADC did not arrange a valuation of Territory Television.</PARA>
<PARA> Imparja Television applied for the central zone Remote Commercial Television Service. I understand that it did not apply to take over Territory Television.</PARA>
<PARA> I am unable to comment on whether or not CAAMA sought or obtained a valuation.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) A detailed check of Departmental records has not revealed such a request.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See (6) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (a) The Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) was established under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to receive and distribute mining royalty equivalent incomes derived from Aboriginal land. The ABTA is not a body corporate and, therefore, could not purchase a controlling interest in Territory Television.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Officers of the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs arranged a meeting in Alice Springs between Imparja and principals of Capricornia Television with a view to discussing the possibility of the two organisations forming a joint venture to operate the RCTS service. This meeting took place in Alice Springs prior to the second hearings for the central zone RCTS.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) In the course of the discussions noted in (8) above, the principals of NTD-8 made some offers of a part holding by Imparja Television in NTD-8 but this was rejected by Imparja. The ABT adjourned its licence hearings pending the outcome of the discussions which resulted from (8) above but, when agreement could not be reached, the inquiry and public hearings proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to comment on whether or not Aboriginal ownership of NTD-8 would have been a satisfactory alternative to the RCTS.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Files are held for all clients with the exception of those under the Disadvantage Persons Scheme whose records are batch stored. The information recorded on files is that which is necessary to assess a person's eligibility for a pension or benefit and the amount of payment. The information consists of personal details such as age, marital status, name of spouse (where necessary), names and dates of birth of children, income and asset details, rent paid and medical information where applicable (e.g. Invalid Pensions and Sickness Benefit).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) All client files are destroyed except cases where:</PARA>
<PARA> administrative action is outstanding such as overpayment recovery action;</PARA>
<PARA> the unusual nature or special features of the particular case have resulted in change to legislative or administrative policy. Such files may be used for research or reference purposes and are regarded as having permanent value.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) These files are destroyed because there is no further administrative need to maintain the information and the Australian Archives has determined that the records have no permanent value.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Files which have been selected for destruction are stored in sealed classified waste bags and bins. These are collected by security companies or the Department of Administrative Services for destruction under supervision.</PARA>
<PARA> In areas where the security companies or Department of Administrative Services do not operate, arrangements are made by Regional Offices for the local destruction of files. This involves, under close supervision by Departmental officers, the use of hospital incinerators or other secure destruction facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The vast majority of clients' files are destroyed 12 months after the date of their last payment. Cases that are retained for longer periods fall into the categories set out in (3).</PARA>
<PARA> Lists of terminated/cancelled cases are produced at regular intervals by computer. This culling action removes the clients' records from the data base and the list is used to cull files from holdings in Regional Offices. The files are examined to ensure that all action has been completed. Destruction takes places as described in 4 (b).</PARA>
<PARA> The disposal of these records is authorised under the Archives Act 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) See answer to 3.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If a file is considered to have permanent value, it is transferred into the custody of Australian Archives. Access to these records is restricted by the exemption provisions of the Archives Act 1983. Files which relate to cases involving the recovery of money, i.e. overpayments, compensation and assurance of support payments, are held by my Department for 6 years after write off. Some overpayment case files are held for longer periods if the overpayment is very substantial and there is some possibility that the debtor might have a subsequent social security entitlement that may enable all or part of the debt to be recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department does not keep specific records of the number of files destroyed for each category of benefit or pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Precise figures on files held on previous Social Security clients are not kept. The files held are in three distinct categories, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> those held in the department that are awaiting the elapse of 12 months from the date of last payment before they are destroyed;</PARA>
<PARA> those considered to have some permanent value warranting transfer to the custody of Australian Archives; and</PARA>
<PARA> those related to outstanding overpayments where the pension or benefit is not current and recovery action is in progress, or subsequent entitlement to a social security payment may aid in recovery of all or part of the debt before it is written off as irrecoverable.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Archives hold approximately 3458 shelf metres of Social Security client files. I am advised that the bulk of these files are not considered to be of permanent value and that arrangements have been made to begin destroying most of them.</PARA>
<PARA> The files not considered to have any permanent value are the result of two administrative decisions taken in the early to mid 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA> The first decision related to the department's decentralisation programme in New South Wales which resulted in large numbers of non-current files being transferred to Australian Archives for subsequent culling and destruction. Unfortunately the culling and destruction did not go ahead as planned at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> The second decision was when a pilot project to test the viability of changing the Department's records-keeping strategy from a paper based file to microfilm for Family Allowance and Pensions files was undertaken in South Australia and Tasmania. Paper files held in those States were transferred to the custody of Australian Archives to be held on a temporary basis until such time as they were due for routine culling and destruction. The department did not proceed to extend the microfilm concept and has reverted to paper files in all States.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Department has no administrative requirement to know the number of files held and it would take considerable resources to maintain this information if it were required.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Department has some 4.5 million current paper files. A sub-set of the information on client files is also held on computer for enquiry, assessment and payment purposes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr Humphreys</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The amount paid to the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services for the provision of transport (both Commonwealth cars and taxis) for veterans and other patients utilising facilities at RGH Heidelberg for the period 1 April 1987 to 31 March 1988 is estimated to be $3,821,489.</PARA>
<PARA> This reflects the high rate of use of the RGH by entitled persons both as in-patients and out-patients. In Victoria most patients requiring in-patient treatment, who live in country areas, are admitted to RGH Heidelberg. In most cases this is seen as having some cost advantages when compared with the cost of obtaining treatment at local facilities. In cases of medical emergency or where continuity of care is medically desirable, patients may be treated in their local areas.</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria patients requiring specialist out-patient treatment are also generally referred to the RGH rather than to private specialists as there is no direct referral to metropolitan specialists as occurs in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) These figures include Commonwealth cars and taxis:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Brisbane $1,784,406</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Hobart $320,919</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Perth $997,274</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Sydney $2,324,177</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Adelaide $935,924</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Wherever possible, veterans attending Repatriation hospitals should use public transport. Car transport may be authorised by an entitled person's Local Medical Officer where there is no public transport available, and the person does not have access to a private vehicle, or there are medical reasons which prevent the person from using these forms of transport.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The sum spent on reimbursement to patients for arranging their own transport to RGH Heidelberg either by private car or public transport for the period 1 April 1987 to 31 March 1988 is estimated to be $189,305.</PARA>
<PARA> Note-The Department is currently reviewing beneficiary transport arrangements. This review was announced in the 1987-88 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The review will not affect entitlement to travel for treatment purposes. Those beneficiaries whose use of Commonwealth transport cannot be justified on medical grounds will still be entitled to reimbursement of transport costs if they drive their own vehicles or use public transport.</PARA>

<PARA> this will make a total of 88 professional and 80 general services posts vacant by the end of 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Total estimated savings US$2,419,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Budget Part 3-General Services:</PARA>
<PARA> changes to security arrangements at ICAO headquarters</PARA>
<PARA> publication of the ICAO Bulletin quarterly instead of monthly</PARA>
<PARA> reduction of paper and printing supplies, postage, etc. as a result of reductions under Parts 1, 2 and 5 of the budget.</PARA>

<PARA> (f) 1988 expenditure estimates (before economy measures) were US$417,000 less than the 1988 appropriation of US$32,105,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Estimated savings US$417,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Grand Total Estimated Savings = US$4,002,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Tasks in the ICAO work programme which are being adversely affected in the air navigation field include airworthiness, search and rescue, aircraft operations and communications. Air transport matters in the field of facilitation and air transport studies will also be adversely affected. Approximately 50 out of a total of 129 air navigation tasks and 33 out of a total of 39 air transport tasks will either be delayed in 1988 or postponed to 1989 or beyond.</PARA>
<PARA> With the objective of stimulating Contracting States to pay their 1988 contributions early and to reduce any arrears, Council passed a resolution which was sent to States in January 1988 strongly urging all States which have not yet done so to meet their financial obligations on an urgent basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The ICAO Council will review the economy measures in June 1988 in the light of the existing and expected income circumstances at that time. Australia's assessed contribution for 1988 of US$514,746.00 was paid in full on 23 December 1987.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Arising out of discussions between the TPC and TNT/News interests, agreement was reached regarding basic principles for the divestiture of certain parts of the operations and assets of East-West Airlines. Details of these principles were published by the TPC in a media release dated 10 November 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In its media release of 10 November 1987, the TPC expressed the hope that Australian Airlines would be the purchaser of the Western Australian and New South Wales operations and assets to which the divestiture agreement related and indicated that if Australian Airlines did not agree to acquire these assets and to assume relevant routes within an agreed period, the TPC and the interested parties would discuss the question of an alternative purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA> It was agreed that Australian Airlines would have one month in which to decide whether or not to acquire the relevant operations and assets.</PARA>
<PARA> (3), (5) and (6) In accordance with the agreements announced by the TPC on 10 November 1987, there have been ongoing discussions between the TPC and TNT/News interests concerning the sale of the relevant operations.</PARA>
<PARA> The TPC has advised that, as at 1 June 1988, the situation in relation to the divestiture of relevant operations and assets is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> several routes previously operated by East-West Airlines in New South Wales have now been allocated by the NSW Government to Eastern Airlines (those being Grafton, Taree, Kempsey, Inverell and Glen Innes).</PARA>
<PARA> East-West Airlines shareholding and associated interests in Eastern Airlines have been sold, the buyer being Australian Airlines.</PARA>
<PARA> the Port Macquarie and Armidale routes have yet to be divested and are still being examined by NSW authorities and the TPC. Several parties, including Eastern Airlines, have expressed interest in acquiring these two routes.</PARA>
<PARA> Hazelton Airlines is negotiating with Australian Airlines to move from Ansett hosting to Australian Airlines hosting (which involves on-carriage and associated arrangements such as reservations and ground handling).</PARA>
<PARA> no sale has yet been arranged for East-West Airlines routes in Western Australia, but East-West Airlines has closed its regular public jet transport services to the Pilbara and WA authorities are considered likely to licence other operators (The TPC understands Australian Airlines is interested in flying the Pilbara route when the airport at Karratha has been upgraded). The TPC has held discussions with WA authorities and with some other possible entrants in respect of the other commuter routes in WA which continue to be operated by East-West/Skywest.</PARA>
<PARA> The TPC has also advised that the Albury and Tamworth routes may also be taken up by a second operator (in addition to the current East-West operations).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Minister for Transport and Communications has advised me that the decision by Australian Airlines not to purchase East-West Airlines routes identified for divestiture was made on commercial grounds by the airline.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) to (8) The TPC will continue to take necessary action to ensure that the divestiture is completed at the earliest possible date and will keep the honourable member informed of progress.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="90" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WAKEFIELD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The dairy marketing and assistance arrangements which were introduced on 1 July 1986 have as their main objective the development of a more efficient and profitable dairy industry able to respond as quickly as possible to changing market conditions and technology. Among other things, this involves the progressive reduction in domestic price support to a level no higher than the price level at which New Zealand products could be sold in Australia on a fair trade basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Under these arrangements, domestic prices for manufactured dairy products are underpinned by a system of market support payments on exports of all dairy produce, funded by a levy on all milk produced. The market support levy is subject to a ceiling of 45 cents per kilogram butterfat produced (or 2c/litre milk). The rate of market support is 30 per cent of the estimated average export price, unless insufficient funds were to be available from the market support levy.</PARA>
<PARA> To assist the industry in the adjustment to the new marketing arrangements, a system of supplementary market support payments on exports of all dairy produce was also implemented. The supplementary market support payments are funded by a product levy on domestic sales of butter/butteroil and certain cheeses. These product levies are currently being phased out, together with the supplementary market support payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The assistance level to an industry can be measured by estimating the nominal assistance (NA), as used by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). The NA is the amount by which gross returns to manufacturers are raised above the world price. The rate of nominal assistance is obtained by expressing the nominal assistance as a percentage of world price.</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of nominal assistance to the dairy manufacturing sector for 1986-87 was approximately 40 percent and is expected to fall to approximately 38 percent in 1987-88. With average export prices expected to increase significantly in 1988-89, current estimates suggest that the rate of nominal assistance for that year will fall further to approximately 28 percent.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the above assistance, the market milk sector receives assistance via consumer transfers as a result of State regulations. For example, estimates made by the Industries Assistance Commission indicate an effective rate of assistance to the market milk sector in excess of 250 percent in 1985-86.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The levels of assistance to be provided in 1993 and 1998 depend on Government policies at these times. The Commonwealth legislation for the current dairy marketing and assistance arrangements expires on 30 June 1992. It is envisaged that the arrangements to apply after that date will be determined after an enquiry by the IAC. It is not possible therefore to predict levels of assistance to the manufacturing milk sector to apply in 1993 and 1998. Just as it is not possible to predict levels of assistance to the manufacturing milk sector it is not possible to predict assistance levels to the market milk sector which result from State arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The current marketing arrangements appear to be working well, with industry taking up the challenge of exploiting new opportunities which have opened up under the arrangements. However, for the reasons outlined above, it would be premature to indicate any course of action at this time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Legal aid for the master and owner of the vessel was provided by the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia. Aid was provided ``in-house'' by a solicitor employed by the Commission. The master was charged under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 20 as well as sub-section (1) of section 29 of the Quarantine Act 1908; section 28 of Migration Act 1958. I should point out, however, that the grant of aid in a particular case is a matter for the Legal Aid Commission itself to determine. I have no power to intervene in the day-to-day decisions of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The master and crew were returned to Indonesia in February 1988 together with the masters and crews of 5 other vessels and a seaman stranded from an earlier episode. A total of 103 people were returned over a two day period on two chartered aircraft. The cost was $58,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The ``Rahmat Ilahi'' was suspected of illegal fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone and was boarded by a naval patrol vessel on 20 November 1987 approximately 50 nautical miles north of Mermaid Reef (17* 6'S, 119* 38'E).

<PARA> (4) Yes. Original cost $70,000. There is a programme partly completed of exhibiting the collection at numerous galleries around Australia. The cost of transporting the collection from gallery to gallery since 1 July 1987 has been $7,740.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) For many years, the Commission has made a point of acknowledging its Commonwealth-wide status and responsibilities, and its obligations of reporting to its shareholders, the Australian public. One of the means of doing this was by conducting meetings in one or two cities other than Melbourne each year, followed by mixing with local representatives at a social gathering. Typically, those attending have included the State Ministers for Health and Agriculture, and representatives of the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Veterinary Association, the Australian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, the Medical and Science Faculties of local universities, the pharmacy profession and the pharmaceutical industry. With the proposal to mark CSL's 70th Anniversary in 1986, no such interstate visits were made for several years before 1986, with a view to making visits to all capitals during 1986. At the 1986 events, reference was made to the 70th Anniversary theme, but in practice, the visits were substitutes for those which would otherwise have been made over a four or five year time span. In this sense, the expense involved was not `additional' as like expenditure would have been incurred over a longer term. The cost of the functions in 1986 was $26,449.98.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Various investigations have been conducted by the ABS, and also two by the Australian Federal Police, into alleged leaks of balance of payments figures. The particular ABS study to which the question apparently refers examined exchange rate movements on the day of release of monthly balance of payments figures.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is an independent statutory authority within the Transport and Communications portfolio and has not been issued with any guidelines by the Government as characterised in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has no guidelines concerning Australian content of music broadcast by radio stations.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 requires broadcasting stations to make an undertaking to use, as far as possible, the services of Australians in the production and presentation of radio programs. It also requires that no less than 5 per cent of the time occupied by a radio licensee in the broadcasting of music shall be devoted to the broadcasting of works of composers who are Australian.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Broadcasting Act empowers the Tribunal ``by instrument in writing, to determine the standards to be observed by licensees in respect of the broadcasting of programs and in respect of programs to be broadcast'' Pursuant to this power, the Tribunal has a Radio Program Standard (RPS4) which requires radio licensees to ensure than not less than 20 per cent of the time occupied in the broadcasting of music each day by a licensee shall consist of performances by Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> This standard has recently been reviewed by way of a public inquiry. As a result of that inquiry, the Tribunal has determined a new standard to take effect on 1 July 1988. The new standard will require radio licensees to ensure that 20 per cent of the time spent in broadcasting music, or 20 per cent of musical items, between 6.00 a.m. and 12.00 midnight, is given to music performed by Australians unless during that time a licensee plays less than one hour of music in which case the quota will not apply.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Tribunal, when it renewed the licences for commercial radio stations 6NW and 6KA in December 1987, imposed the following condition on the licences:</PARA>
<PARA> The licencee shall engage a journalist and use the services of that journalist, full-time, in connection with the provision of local news and information programs to be broadcast on 6KA and 6NW from 1 July 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for imposing this condition were detailed in the Tribunal's report nos. 610/87 and 611/87 released on 15 December 1987. The Tribunal's News Release no 67/1987 dated 18 December 1987 summarised that part of the report relating to the station's local news bulletins as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the limited resources devoted to the local news service, local news items are often poorly written for broadcast and appear to rely too heavily and too often on press release material supplied to the station . . . Northwest is the only company licensed to use the commercial radio medium in the Pilbara region. Yet the limited resources it is prepared to commit to its local news service means that it is not of a standard which the audience in this region deserves. Northwest is under-utilising the scarce public resource allocated to it.</PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry, the licensee, Northwest Radio Pty Ltd, claimed that a condition to engage a full-time journalist could not be justified on the grounds that it would not be economically feasible. However, having considered all the evidence before it the Tribunal decided to impose the condition because it felt confident that the scope and quality of the local news service would improve markedly as a result.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the likely financial impact of the condition the Tribunal concluded, at paragraphs 99, 100, 102 and 103 of its report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I accept the licensee's evidence that a condition requiring the engagement of a full-time journalist is likely to require an expenditure of $55,380 per annum. It may be though that means can be found by management to secure the services of a journalist for its local news service for less than this amount.</PARA>
<PARA> Northwest did not contend that such a condition would render 6KA and 6NW no longer commercially viable. I am satisfied that notwithstanding the imposition of this condition, the stations will remain commercially viable.</PARA>
<PARA> During the financial year 1986/87 Northwest outlaid $299,614 in an unsuccessful attempt to acquire another broadcasting licence. Notwithstanding this expenditure Northwest said that its stations remained commercially viable . . . and that it could meet various capital expenditures planned for the next three years form its own resources.</PARA>
<PARA> There is of course nothing unusual or improper in a licensee company attempting to obtain additional stations. However, in this case, it is clear that the funds used to support Northwest's application for the Mandurah licence are no longer available to improve the service to the Pilbara in the way this condition will require. The business interest of licensees must at all times be subordinate to the principle that the possession of a licence is a public trust for the benefit of the community. The community which is entitled to expect to receive the benefit of the proceeds of 6KA/6NW's broadcasting operations is the community in the Pilbara. The Pilbara should not be expected to subsidise or be disadvantaged by Northwest's licence application in Manduah. I have taken these considerations into account when evaluating Northwest's submission that the condition contemplated in this report would not be justified or economically feasible.</PARA>
<PARA> The licensee has lodged an appeal against the imposition of the condition in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The matter is due to be heard in Perth, commencing on 14 June 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> A copy of the ABT's report on the renewal of the licences, has been forwarded to the honourable member for his information.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr Humphreys</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As at 15 May 1985 there were about 20,700 disability pension claims from veterans and 11,000 applications for increased pension remaining to be finalised by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is assumed that the question refers to sub-section 7 (3) of the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Amendment Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> In general terms, sub-section 7 (3) provides that, after 22 May 1986, a Repatriation determining authority cannot assess a degree of incapacity as a percentage of the general rate less than the existing pension rate paid to the veteran, unless the actual incapacity has decreased or the previous incapacity assessment was based on a false statement or misrepresentation. The intention of the sub-section was to protect existing pension rates from reduction by application of the ``Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions'' (the Guide) which was promulgated from 22 May 1986. The sub-section applies only to the assessment of the degree of incapacity for deciding the rate of pension payable and not to the issue of acceptance or otherwise of a new condition as war-caused.</PARA>
<PARA> From 22 May 1986 to 22 April 1988 sub-section 7 (3) has applied to the incapacity assessment in 1,756 claims and 2,767 applications for increased pension, i.e. 16% and 34% respectively of claims or applications decided by the Repatriation Commission where the Guide has been used. Figures are not available for the Veterans' Review Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to tell how many of these Commission decisions, where sub-section 7 (3) applied, were of claims and applications outstanding as at 15 May 1985, although some of them would have been in respect of that group of claims/applications. Most of the sub-section 7 (3) decisions would have been made on claims and applications lodged after 15 May 1985.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commonwealth War Graves Commission advised the Director of War Graves on 24 May 1988 that it is committed to the maintenance of the cemeteries and memorials on the Gallipoli Peninsula and will continue to ensure that they are so kept as to honour fully the memory of those who died there. The Commission maintains a staff of 14 Turkish gardeners and stonemasons under the supervision of one of its Commonwealth-based staff on the Peninsula and these resources are carefully matched to the work required.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government will continue to contribute to the maintenance costs of the Commission. It will also continue to monitor the condition of the Australian war graves throughout the world, including Gallipoli. The Director of War Graves visited the Peninsula in September 1987 and was satisfied as to the standard of maintenance. The Director also receives regular reports from visitors to the area.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The area is well served by a network of all weather roads which permit access to all cemetery sites and the more important lookout points. The commission has an arrangement with the Turkish National Park Authority that trees may be felled on certain viewpoints to enable visitors to see across the old battlefields. It would be extremely difficult to provide access to all areas of the battlefield and the funds presently available to the Commission would not permit the cutting of trails through the scrub in the gullies of the area. At present, the vistas from the high ground still permit a good view across the area.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In accordance with its agreement, the Commission will arrange for necessary felling of trees to permit observation from selected viewpoints. My Department has an allocation of funds to maintain the war cemeteries and memorials but these would not stretch to the clearing and maintenance of tourist trails.</PARA>

I draw the honourable member's attention, however, to Regulation 4 (2) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which, together with Item 2 of the Third Schedule to those Regulations, requires articles to which there is applied any marking in a language other than the language ordinarily used by the people of the country of origin of the article, to bear a statement in English indicating the country in which the articles were made or produced. This requirement came into effect on 14 December 1956 (although a similar requirement had been in place since 25 January 1935) and has, I am advised, been interpreted to cover publications. Hence a book in the English language printed in Japan would be required to indicate that it was printed in Japan. However, a book printed in the United States of America would not be required to indicate where it was printed.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that, with the exception of South Australia, each State and Territory has legislation requiring printers in the State or Territory to print their name and address on publications which they produce. As a general rule, this legislation would not apply to printers operating outside the particular State or Territory and thus would not extend to publications printed outside Australia. The relevant legislation is:</PARA>
<PARA> N.S.W.: Printing and Newspapers Act, 1973, s.3</PARA>
<PARA> Vic.: Printers and Newspapers Act, 1958, s.5</PARA>
<PARA> Qld.: Printing and Newspapers Act, 1981, s.6</PARA>
<PARA> W.A.: Newspaper Libel and Registration Act, 1884, s.16 (newspapers only)</PARA>
<PARA> Tas.: Printers and Newspapers Act, 1911, s.4</PARA>
<PARA> N.T.: Printers and Newspapers Act, 1984, s.4</PARA>
<PARA> A.C.T.: Printing and Newspapers Ordinance, 1961, s.15</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations are administered by the Australian Customs Service. The ACT Printing and Newspapers Ordinance 1961 is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The honourable member could obtain information about the administration of the State and Northern Territory legislation referred to above from the relevant State and Territory Governments.</PARA>

The Embassy understands that the detainees did not select a lawyer from the list of law firms provided, but chose another lawyer on the basis of other contacts in Indonesia. I understand that the Embassy has been in constant contact with the lawyer selected; reports received from the lawyer together with the court decision of 2 June 1988 when it was held that the prosecution case, at that time, had failed would suggest that adequate legal assistance is being provided to the 3 Australian detainees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the May Expenditure Statement 1987 I announced that from 1987-88, Telecom's exemption from sales tax and customs duty would be removed. I also announced that Telecom would be entitled to a refund of up to $100 million, for any sales tax and customs duty paid in excess of $360 million in 1987-88. It was agreed that the refund would be paid in instalments. A first instalment of $20 million was paid in October 1987. The second and third instalments, payable in January and April 1988, related to expenditures actually incurred in the September and December quarters 1987, respectively. A final instalment, based on an audit of Telecom's accounts for the whole year by the Australian Audit Office, will be paid in December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> It was estimated in the 1987-88 budget that $80 million would be refunded in 1987-88 and the remaining $20 million in 1988-89. In the event, Telecom's expenditures in the September and December quarters 1987 were below expectations and as a consequence only $29,140,838 has been paid in 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has advised that it expects its capital expenditures in the second half of 1987-88 will be much higher than in the first half, and that it will be entitled to a refund of the balance of the $100 million in December 1988. For this reason, the Government has budgeted on the basis that it will be required to refund the remaining $70,859,162 in 1988-89.</PARA>

<PARA> I assume this question is seeking information about the possible improper release of Medicare data.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In October 1986 the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party established a Prices Task Force under the chairmanship of Mr George Gear, the member for Canning, to oversee a limited operation of community-based Price Watch Committees in Labor held electorates. In March 1987 I announced the Government's intention to build upon the Labor Party's system of Price Watch Committees and involve the broader community in the surveillance of the prices of consumer items. The resulting National Prices Network currently oversees local price action groups operating throughout Australia. The price action groups are solely dependent on the volunteer efforts of community groups for the collection and collation of data at the local level. In this regard, members of consumer organisations and pensioner groups have been the most enthusiastic participants. The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and the Australian Pensioners' Federation, jointly co-ordinate the operation of the National Prices Network. The National Prices Network has been encouraged to pass on information on significant instances of overpricing to the Prices Surveillance Authority.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="107" SPEAKER="Hayden The Hon W.G." NAMEID="RK4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NORTH SYDNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, like its predecessor Departments for many years, has maintained a policy of updating recruitment practices in conjunction with the then Public Service Board and its successor, the Public Service Commission, so as to ensure that its annual graduate intake is of the highest attainable quality. These procedures are reviewed in detail each year to ensure that they conform with best selection practice. An important consideration has been the elimination of procedures which might result in the unintentional undervaluing of the merits of applicants from the four groups designated under the Public Service Reform Act (1984), that is Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disabilities, people with a non-English speaking background, and women.</PARA>
<PARA> It would not be feasible to set out in detail the incremental procedural changes which have been introduced since 1 March 1983. I can assure the honourable member, however, that, as I said in a statement on 25 May 1987, selection will continue to be based on merit.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Requirements for appointment to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its predecessor Department have maintained conformity with those which apply to all Departments of the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to overseas service, the integration from different Departments of officers with diverse career expectations has made it necessary to modify the requirement that officers be willing to serve overseas as directed. It is now required that officers be willing in principle to serve overseas at a mutually convenient time. I consider that this will meet my Department's need to have well-qualified officers both overseas and in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) AUSTUDY benefits are available to students undertaking approved courses of study (i.e. courses which attract Government funding). Five non-Government teachers' colleges and fifty-five non-Government business colleges attract funding under the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987, or in the case of the teacher's college in the ACT, in line with that Act. In addition one agricultural college (Marcus Oldham Farm Management College) receives Government support through departmental appropriations and as a consequence eligible students attending it receive AUSTUDY benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commonwealth recognises that higher education institutions, including certain non-Government teachers' colleges, need to purchase equipment in order to provide for growth in enrolments and new academic developments, to replace worn out or obsolete items, and to keep abreast of technological progress. It provides grants of financial assistance specifically for such purchases in response to expenditure proposals by institutions. It is a condition of the provision of equipment grants that the sums concerned be fully expended in respect of each calendar year in which they are made available.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance for approved courses of teacher education in certain non-Government teachers' colleges and the advanced Diploma in Farm Management course at the Marcus Oldham College is made on the condition that the courses concerned are taught at an appropriate standard in that they meet the various requirements of the approval process, including currency of accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing eligibility of non-Government business college courses for assistance under Section 25 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 the quality of facilities and the standards of the course are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) None.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) TAFE is the major provider of off-the-job training, but off-the-job training may also be provided in other approved training centres, including employers' premises.</PARA>
<PARA> Private (i.e. non-TAFE) training providers have to be approved by the relevant State Training Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> State Training Authorities are responsible for approving training arrangements in the States and Territories and for monitoring the quality of training provided, including ensuring that private training providers have the capacity to provide adequate training.</PARA>
<PARA> The (Australian Traineeship System) ATS is administered and funded by Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth outlays include payment to employers of $1000 per trainee, with an additional $1000 for each disadvantaged employee, and payment of training fees to off-the-job training providers. State and Territory Governments make available to trainees accommodation allowances and travel subsidies to attend off-the-job training. In most cases, they also provide payroll and workers' compensation concessions to employers of trainees.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Under the approved Commonwealth/State Territory Agreements for the operation of Traineeships the endorsement of training arrangements and the monitoring of traineeship delivery arrangements is a State/Territory Government responsibility. The assessment of non-Government business colleges in receipt of grants under the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 is undertaken in the State Offices of my Department and by an advisory committee appointed by me.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. It would be inappropriate to apply the same criteria to both schemes because their purposes are different.</PARA>
<PARA> Courses funded under the Non-Government Business Colleges Scheme concentrate on shorthand and typing and are full-time pre-employment courses.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Traineeship System is a new vocational training system which provides a combination of on- and off-the-job training for young people entering the workforce. Its aim is to achieve long-term fundamental improvements in training arrangements for young people in non-trades employment, thereby improving both the long-term employment prospects of young people and the national skill base.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes. In a small number of cases, non-Government business colleges in receipt of assistance under Section 25 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 have been assessed as not meeting the requirements for the Australian Traineeship System.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, the West Australian Aboriginal Legal Service (WA ALS) receives Federal Government funding. The Federal Government is providing a total of $2,241,700 to the WA ALS in 1987/88.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This sum is calculated on the basis of annual financial budgets detailing the recurrent and capital costs of operating the WA ALS.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Funding is provided through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as a Grant for Aboriginal Advancement.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Aboriginal Organisation Training (AOT) funds were provided in 1986/87 to purchase three caravans as part of a TAFE mobile instructor project to train Aboriginal supervisors, on site in CDEP communities. The caravans were to provide mobile accommodation for instructors to move from one community to another to carry out the training.</PARA>
<PARA> TAFE Aboriginal Access negotiated construction and purchase of the three caravans with a WA caravan firm known as Luxury Caravans. Luxury Caravans arranged the construction through a Victorian based caravan builder, Condor Caravans.</PARA>
<PARA> Although TAFE Aboriginal Access were to use the vans as part of the mobile project, the legal owner of the vans was the Aboriginal Legal Service. This arrangement would ensure that at the end of the project the caravans would be owned by an Aboriginal organisation for training purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. On initial inspection the caravans appeared satisfactory, delivery was taken and final payments made. However, in towing from Perth to the Kimberleys where they were to be used, the caravans proved to be totally unserviceable for remote, rugged conditions and faulty workmanship became evident.</PARA>
<PARA> The vans could not be used in remote Aboriginal communities, requiring towing over rugged roads, because of their flimsy and poor construction.</PARA>
<PARA> The ALS, in conjunction with TAFE Aboriginal Access and DAA decided to sell the vans, in situ in Broome, to prevent deterioration during the Wet season.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The funds from the sale are currently held by the ALS. They, in conjunction with TAFE Aboriginal Access and DAA are currently negotiating with other caravan makers in WA to construct two more caravans specially designed for outback conditions. The funds from the sale will be used to purchase the new caravans.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Once advised by TAFE Aboriginal Access that the caravans showed poor workmanship and were totally unsatisfactory for use in rugged outback conditions the ALS immediately cancelled orders for further caravans from Luxury Caravans.</PARA>
<PARA> The caravans ordered were to be used for a similar purpose to the original one purchased.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) South Africa was an original signatory of the Antarctic Treaty which it ratified in 1960. It is also a signatory to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972) and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) (1980).</PARA>
<PARA> In June this year South Africa also signed the Final Act of the Antarctic Minerals Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) South Africa has operated a scientific research station on Marion Island since 1948. The station is supported under the South African National Antarctic Research program.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has no evidence that South Africa has carried out or plans to carry out any nuclear or military activities on or near Marion Island.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Antarctic Treaty does contain provisions prohibiting nuclear explosions, weapons testing and other military activities, Marion Island (which lies north of latitude 60 degrees South) is in fact outside the area covered by the Treaty. Marion Island does lie within the CCAMLR area, but that Convention contains no provisions of its own regarding nuclear and military activities. If South Africa were to engage in such activities on Marion Island, it would therefore technically not be in breach of its obligations under the Treaty or under CCAMLR.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Because Marion Island lies outside the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty, neither Australia nor any other Antarctic Treaty Party has a right to inspect South Africa's activities there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are currently no Australian requirements for matches, either locally made or imported, to be treated with fire retardant.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is currently no Australian splint strength requirement for matches sold in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As previously mentioned, there are currently no Australian minimum requirements with regard to the standards referred to in parts (1) and (2) and therefore there is no basis for comparison with world standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) According to the National Injury Surveillance Prevention Project (NISPP) data base, there have been 18 recorded accidents involving matches causing injury to children since late 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> This comprises approximately 0.04% of the total number of injuries that NISPP has on its data base. However, it is not possible at this stage to pinpoint the percentage in relation to products which are hazardous to children.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The two major official sources of information regarding the quantity of matches imported into Australia each year are the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Customs Service (ACS). The ACS will not release any information at all in relation to quantities of imported matches, on the grounds of confidentiality, and the ABS will not release information relating to the quantity of matches manufactured each year in Australia, for the same reason.</PARA>
<PARA> The major portion of matches imported into Australia come from 8 countries (Sweden, Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, USSR, Korea, Czechoslovakia, and Hong Kong), with negligible amounts being obtained from other countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Data on the type of school last attended by higher education students are not collected in the Commonwealth's annual collection of higher education student statistics. Thus, there are no comprehensive data available on this subject. However, there are a number of other sources which provide some partial information-</PARA>
<PARA> The 1984 survey of full-time tertiary student finances, conducted by the then Commonwealth Department of Education, revealed that of the higher education students surveyed, 60% had last attended a government school, 20% a Catholic school and 19% other non-government schools. In the same year, some 64% of Year 12 students were attending government schools, 22% Catholic schools and 14% other non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> A longitudinal survey conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research traced the educational and labour force experience of a national sample of young people from the age of 14 (in 1975) to age 21 (in 1982). This study found that, by 1982, only 15% of persons who had attended government schools had participated in higher education, compared with 23% of students from Catholic schools and 55% of students from other private schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey report ``Transition from Education to Work, Australia'', May 1987, shows that of those persons aged 15-24 who had attended school in 1986 and were attending a higher education institution in 1987, some 58% came from government schools and 42% from non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The Discipline Assessments of Law and Engineering conducted in 1986 and 1987-88 provide some information (based on survey data) on students in those particular fields of study:</PARA>
<PARA> 41% of law students surveyed had last attended government schools, 23% Catholic schools and 32% other non-government schools; (the balance of 4% is not explained but is assumed to be due to non-response)</PARA>
<PARA> 61% of engineering students surveyed had last attended government schools, 21% Catholic schools and 18% other non-government schools. (These percentages exclude overseas students.)</PARA>

The objective of the study was to enable the Department to best utilise its resources for publicity activities associated with the introduction of UHF television in regional Australia. Information for this study was gained via questionnaires.</PARA>

<PARA> (j) Peter Steidl and Associates were commissioned to gauge the effectiveness of the ``Right Rider'' video, concerned with motor cycle safety, at a cost of $8,100.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The former Bureau of Transport Economics (BTE) conducted surveys of bus and rail passengers over Sydney-Canberra and Sydney-North Coast NSW, as part of an Intrastate Bus Service (Trial Entry Liberalisation) study undertaken by the NSW Department of Motor Transport (DMT). The cost of the surveys is estimated at $27,300.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) ABC: The objective of the opinion polls conducted by the ABC's Television Audience Research section was to measure the audience for ABC Television in areas where regular ratings are not available. A survey covering rural Australia had the additional purpose of measuring audience attitudes to the service provided by ABC Television. Polls carried out by the ABC Television News and Current Affairs sought comment on specific issues with the intention of being used as program material. Tasmanian Opinion Poll Research, McGregor Darwin Omnibus Survey and Newspoll were commissioned to undertake the opinion polls.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) SBS: The objectives of opinion polls and ratings surveys conducted on behalf of the SBS were to gauge audience viewing and reaction as well as consumer needs and attitudes. Audience surveys were undertaken by McNair Anderson and Frank Small and Associates.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) ABT: The objective of opinion polls commissioned by the ABT was to discover public opinion on the amount of advertising on commercial television. Reark Research was commissioned to undertake an opinion poll.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of individual surveys in (v), (vi) and (vii) above is agreed between parties and is considered Commercial-in-Confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The results from studies conducted for the Department are not available from the consultants concerned, but can be made available on request from the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The results of the surveys conducted by the BTE for the NSW DMT are detailed in the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics Occasional Paper 85, titled `Intrastate Bus Services in New South Wales: Trial Entry Liberalisation'.</PARA>
<PARA> The results of each opinion poll undertaken on behalf of the ABC are not publicly available; like ratings surveys, they are used to schedule television programs in a highly competitive market. For the SBS, the results of the Frank Small and Associates surveys are available only at the discretion of the Service, while the results of the McNair Anderson surveys are not publicly available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commissioner for Taxation has advised me that there are no specific arrangements for overseas visitors who have a valid work permit to pay the Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA> A person visiting Australia for a short period whose usual place of abode is outside Australia and who does not intend to take up residence in Australia is treated as a non-resident for income tax purposes. In these circumstances, the visitor is not liable for the Medicare levy and generally is not eligible for Medicare cover. However, where a person comes to Australia for an extended period with the intention of residing here, in the ordinary course of events, he or she is considered a resident of Australia and liable for the Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the visitor's approved length of stay is more than six months or the visitor is a foreign student undertaking a course of study in Australia, the visitor is eligible for Medicare benefits in respect of services, treatment and care covered by the Medicare scheme. Whether the visitor is liable for the Medicare levy, however, turns primarily on whether he or she is a resident of Australia. The entitlement to Medicare benefits does not establish liability to the levy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Overseas visitors who are permitted by law to remain in Australia for more than six months, are eligible for Medicare benefits and free treatment in public hospitals from the date of arrival in Australia. Medicare eligibility for such long term visitors is thus based on duration and not purpose of visits. There is no qualifying period for such eligibility nor is eligibility dependent on payment of the levy although it should be added that most of these visitors would be in employment and therefore liable for payment of Australian taxes and the Medicare levy. Short term visitors who are entitled to remain in Australia for six months or less, and these represent by far the greater proportion of overseas visitors to Australia, are not generally eligible for Medicare benefits or free hospital treatment, unless they come from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement (currently the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Malta).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) An Australian resident's liability for the Medicare levy is not generally related to the extent to which a person has access to benefits under the scheme. Medicare is a universal scheme and liability to pay the levy is based solely on an individual's capacity to pay, as measured by his/her taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA> As such, it is a progressive health insurance scheme, and an important component of the social wage. This is in marked contrast to flat rate insurance, which, because it ignores the income of the family or individual, is regressive.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Under the terms of the Australia/UK comprehensive taxation agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, each country may tax salary or wages and other remuneration for personal services performed in that country by a person who is a resident (and not necessarily a citizen) of the other country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under the Joint Rolls Arrangement with New South Wales the Commonwealth is responsible for the preparation, alteration, revision and maintenance of Joint Electoral Rolls. These tasks are done through the updating of a computer file which contains the names of all persons enrolled for either Commonwealth or State purposes; the names of persons enrolled for Commonwealth but not State purposes, or vice versa, are specifically flagged on the file.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the March 1988 State election, the State Electoral Office was provided by the Australian Electoral Commission with magnetic tape copies of the computer file referred to in (1), from which ``Commonwealth only'' electors had been deleted. The roll close date as of which the copy of the file was taken was 25 February 1988. Itinerant and provisional enrollees were included in the copy of the file. Steps were subsequently taken by the State Electoral Office to exclude from the printed certified lists provisional enrollees who had not reached the age of 18. Itinerant provisional enrollees were entitled to vote at the State election pursuant to section 5 of the State Parliamentary Electorates and Elections (Amendment) Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Since the 1987 general election the Australian Electoral Commission has undertaken objection action to remove names from the roll following non-voter follow-up and normal changes to rolls resulting from receipt of electoral enrolment forms, notifications received by Divisional Returning Officers pursuant to section 102 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 of transfers of electors to another State, notices received pursuant to section 108 of the Act of deaths of electors, and advice from electors regarding changes in relevant particulars. Since the roll is a joint one, these alterations automatically apply for State as well as Commonwealth purposes, without any explicit exchange of information between the Commonwealth and the State.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The taxation affairs of particular taxpayers are strictly a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation and the taxpayers concerned. It is therefore not possible for me to comment on the particular taxation circumstances of the companies listed in the question. There are, however, some observations that can be made on issues relevant to average tax payments by companies generally.</PARA>
<PARA> The percentages quoted from the annual reports of companies usually reflect tax expense, rather than actual tax payments. This distinction is important as tax expense for reporting purposes is calculated in accordance with accounting standards, and may vary from the tax assessed on taxable income measured under the income tax law. Average tax rates based on a reported measure of income tax expense do not necessarily reflect the current tax position of a company; tax expense does not, for example, reflect the actual amount of tax paid in a given year because it is not adjusted for items which alter the timing of tax payments from year to year. A notable item here is 5/3 depreciation, which accelerates depreciation deductions for tax purposes relative to those provided for in the accounts, and so provides a deferral of taxation. Tax payments in any particular year may therefore be higher or lower than reported tax expense, depending on the particular circumstances of each case.</PARA>
<PARA> A major factor reducing the average tax rates of particular companies below the company tax rate is the intercorporate dividend rebate, which effectively frees from tax dividends received by one company from another. This rebate prevents company income, which may have already been taxed in the hands of the company in which it originated, being taxed over and again as it passes from one company to another before being paid to its ultimate recipients. The rebate can, therefore, give rise to reductions in the measured tax rate of any selection of companies, particularly those receiving large amounts of dividend income, without implying any overall shortfall of company tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Many other factors may also influence the ratio of tax to reported profit, including the nature and scale of capital gains, the jurisdiction of the source of the income, the use of tax concessions, and the extent of non-deductible expenses.</PARA>

<PARA> As the Honourable Member would be aware, that report was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration under the Chairmanship of Mr S.P. Martin, M.P.</PARA>
<PARA> In evidence given before that Committee, officers of the Australian Taxation Office indicated that the Auditor-General's figure of 40,000 entities being in a position to possibly shift profits away from Australia seemed excessive. According to recent estimates it has available, the Taxation Office believes that the number is between 12,000 and 18,000. However, it should not be assumed that all taxpayers with related entities overseas do in fact engage in profit shifting practices.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation commented that companies with international transactions, including those with related entities in tax havens, are identified by special schedules lodged with tax returns.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr Staples</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, complaints about the length of nursing home waiting lists in some regions of some States have been received.</PARA>
<PARA> Services are being developed which meet the needs of many frail aged people more appropriately than do nursing homes. These include hostels for older people, where the Government is committed to gradually increasing the provision from 37 places per 1,000 persons aged 70+ years to 60 per 1,000 persons 70+ years, and the Home and Community Care Program, where some $218 million of Commonwealth money will be spent this year on providing support services for frail and disabled people living in their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA> Regionally based multidisciplinary assessment services are being developed across Australia to ensure that the frail aged needing help are referred to the services that best meet their needs. Assessment services have, in most cases, been able to achieve drastic reductions in nursing home waiting lists, sometimes by as much as 70 percent. At the same time, assessment services have enabled many people who otherwise would have been admitted to a nursing home to have access to a range of alternative care services.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is committed to maintaining the current national average provision of 100 residential places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over. A maximum 10 percent of new approvals in any one year will be for nursing home approvals, in order to effect a gradual change in the current mix of 63 nursing home places to 37 hostel places nationally to a ratio of 40 nursing home places to 60 hostel places.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with this commitment the Department of Community Services and Health has estimated that in the three years from 1988-91 the number of new places required to provide nursing home and hostel care for those who are assessed as needing it, is 1409 nursing home places and 12,296 hostel places nationally.</PARA>
<PARA> I announced on 15 July 1988 that the Government is prepared to approve and support the establishment of these 13,705 new residential care places, and that the distribution of places to each State and Territory would be as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> The Government's approach to planning of residential care services is consistent with the findings of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review which concluded that there are a number of indications that present provision in Australia is sufficient for current needs, particularly given the relatively high level of provision when compared with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> A key element of the Government's planning strategy is to increase the range of both residential and community-based care services for the care of the aged. On this basis a complementary service-planning model for the new Home and Community Care Program is currently being developed in conjunction with the States and Territories. This work will eventually facilitate regional needs-based planning profiles across both the Residential and Home Care Programs for all regions within Australia. Until this work is completed, there are no specific planning targets for home nursing or domiciliary care facilities, nor for the balance to be struck between residential and community based care.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) &amp;(2) Interim arrangements applied from 1 August 1987 following passage of legislation in 1986 which addressed known difficulties in the pathology areas. Further policy consideration was necessary to address problems arising from legislative requirements that approved pathology practitioners must personally supervise pathology services. My Department has been considering these issues since then.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There had been an expectation that mechanisms to address these problems would have been in place for application by the end of the interim arrangements on 31 July 1988. However, that has not been possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Section 3aaa (not yet proclaimed) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As part of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986 which received Royal Assent on 24 June 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) &amp;(7) Section 3aaa is not yet proclaimed, because of the concern that certain laboratories which are not yet able to comply with the requirements of the Act would be forced to close resulting in dislocation of services particularly in country areas and loss of jobs for laboratory staff; and because of the need to negotiate alternative funding mechanisms to ensure that the objectives of the legislation could be met without reducing patient access to necessary and prompt services.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) &amp;(9) Officers of my Department have had preliminary discussions with State and Northern Territory health authorities, members of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia in all States and union and professional bodies representing medical and scientific groups.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No. It is desirable to further develop the issues to identify options, before further consultation.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) A number of matters dealing with the administration of the pathology benefit arrangements are under review. This is part of the normal, ongoing policy and administrative review processes.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) While I am not aware of any such American Supreme Court decisions, I am aware of a 1983 ruling by the US District Court of the District of Columbia.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Court's decision in that case, which was brought by the College of American Pathologists against the Department of Health and Human Services, supported the view that the practice of clinical laboratory science is not the practice of pathology and that clinical laboratory tests do not constitute the practice of medicine.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to assess the scope of the Court's decision or whether the United States experience is directly translatable to all situations in Australia. However, as the question involves matters of constitutional law and the applicability of United States Court decisions as precedents in the Australian Court System, I have asked that clarification be sought from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) The Health Insurance Act provides for payment of Medicare benefits for services for which the costs are incurred for medical treatment provided by or on behalf of a medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) The provision of a pathology service involves the undertaking of laboratory tests, which is mostly done by a scientist or technical officer, and the interpretation of the results and reports, as necessary, which may involve medical input.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Yes</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Accreditation standards recognise control by pathologists, general practitioners, senior scientists or scientists, depending upon the category of laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) The Health Insurance Act is aimed at providing Medicare benefits for pathology services provided by or on behalf of approved pathology practitioners who must be medical practitioners; with clinical responsibility for the patient. Accreditation relates to acceptable standards for pathology testing and not to clinical responsiblity.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) &amp;(20) Amendments to the Act may not be the only course of action. Other measures such as development of alternative means of funding to Medicare benefits for services provided by certain laboratories may be considered. The interim arrangements have been extended from 1 August 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Representations have been received over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) &amp;(c) Responses have referred to the Second Report of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee 1986 which concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The current cost of pathology is so vexed that there is no way in which we could recommend fee-for-service for medical scientists on the same basis as pathologists with the same fees and with the same risk of possible abuse and overservicing. Medical scientists have, we believe, the potential capacity to put forward proposals which would result in current pathology services being provided for less cost, but no such proposals were forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, to provide fee-for-service for medical scientists would only be remunerating medical scientists by way of public funding in lieu of the present remuneration of pathologists by way of public funding, at the same rate. This would mean merely a shift in the recipients of the funding.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in the area of medical scientists in hospitals, we could see that the equity argument, that they should be remunerated on fee-for-service simply because pathologists were, would similarly apply to technicians in the laboratory or, indeed any other employees in the public hospital system.''</PARA>
<PARA> I have also advised that the changes arose out of the concerns of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its Report 236 ``Medical Fraud and Overservicing-Pathology''. That report clearly identified the need to increase the accountability of pathology providers under Medicare. In introducing the new legislation, the Government had not departed from the long-standing policy of benefits for medical services only being payable where they are provided by or on behalf of medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) Medical scientists have sought an end to the apparent discrimination against them because of Commonwealth insistence that medical supervision is an essential requirement for the payment of Medical benefits. There is particular concern that the requirements will lessen the career prospects of senior scientists in the public hospital sector in that to retain revenue from Medicare benefits for services provided on a fee-for-service basis, hospitals will recruit pathologists over scientists.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) I have not been willing to comply with requests by some medical scientists to extend Medicare benefits to services provided by them without any medical professional involvement. However, other financing mechanisms which do not require medical professional supervision or participation are being considered.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) A discussion paper with this title has been prepared by the Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The paper observes that in Australia many Commonwealth services are already contracted out. It states that the efficiency of contracting out has not yet been carefully evaluated in Australia, and refers to evidence from the United States and Britain which suggests that in some instances there may be higher costs, poorer services, lack of flexibility and corruption associated with contracting out. The paper also states that Australia is already one of the half dozen most highly privatised economies in the Western world and gives specific examples of industries which are nationalised in Europe and North America, and are privately owned in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The paper was published by the Australian Government Publishing Service, which chose to use a private printer in Queanbeyan, N.S.W. I understand that AGPS first offers printing work to the Government printer. If the Government printer is unable to handle the work, AGPS then chooses a private printer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Uranium, as it occurs in nature, consists of three isotopes; uranium 238 (U-238), uranium 235 (U-235) and uranium 234 (U-234). The isotope ratios in uranium ore deposits are constant. For example the present day isotopic ratio of U238/U235 is 137.88:1.00.</PARA>
<PARA> The only time this ratio varies is if the ore deposit has been affected by a natural chain reaction. The only uranium ore deposit in which this phenomenon is known to have occurred is the Oklo uranium ore deposit in Gabon, West Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> The chain reaction took place some 1800 million years ago and much of the ore from the fossil reactors at Oklo now contains anomalously low concentrations of U-235 relative to U-238.</PARA>
<PARA> The isotope ratios of other radioactive elements and lead in uranium ore deposits are not constant. These ratios will vary considerably throughout the one ore deposit and from one ore deposit to another depending upon the particular geochemistry and age of the deposit.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The uranium isotope ratios for yellowcake are the same as for the original ore.</PARA>
<PARA> see (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no plutonium in uranium used as nuclear fuel or in nuclear weapons. Plutonium is produced in a nuclear reactor from the capture of neutrons by uranium-238. In the reprocessing of irradiated uranium, plutonium is recovered separately from the uranium.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final report of the April meeting of the FAO Committee on World Food Security is yet to be circulated but the following information has been taken from the draft of the report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expressed its deep concern and regret that the world food security situation continued to be characterised by the contrast of ample supplies at the world level and of millions of people remaining undernourished in the developing countries. It noted that staple food production had declined by 4 per cent in 1987, mainly due to weather conditions but also to policy measures. As a result, production had fallen below consumption for the first time in four years and closing stocks of cereals in 1987/88 were expected to decline to about 22 percent of forecast consumption. The Committee expressed concern at the anticipated large decline in stocks held by developing countries. It noted that international prices of cereals, particularly of rice, had risen but were still low compared with the levels prevailing in the early eighties. It also noted that FAO's first preliminary forecasts of world grain production in 1988 suggested that, while output was expected to increase, it would probably again be less than consumption so that stocks would be further drawn down in 1988/89, possibly to a level not much more than the minimum level that is considered necessary by FAO to safeguard world food security.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee deeply regretted that the food security situation had deteriorated seriously in many low-income food-deficit countries in 1987/88 and the per capita food consumption in many countries was at or below the level of 15 years earlier. The Committee expressed concern at the serious threat of desert locust damage in North and North West Africa, and urged immediate and extensive international assistance to combat this plague. The Committee expressed its appreciation for FAO's role in co-ordinating the campaign against locusts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expressed its concern that, because of a widespread decline in domestic staple food production and inadequate foreign exchange resources to finance sufficient imports, aggregate food aid needs of the low income food deficit countries in 1987/88 were substantially higher than in the previous year. The Committee also expressed its serious concern at the declining trends in per capita food production in a large number of developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee underlined the necessity to reverse these unfavourable trends and to achieve food security, and urged that the highest priority be accorded to the development of the food and agricultural sector of the low-income food-deficit countries and to the formulation of a suitable policy framework to achieve it. In this connection, the committee stressed, inter alia, the need to apply technological improvements to raise productivity; to provide price incentives, extension and training; to strengthen co-operative and credit facilities; to support women farmers; to improve marketing institutions as well as physical infrastructures such as transport systems. While it was emphasising that the primary responsibility for achieving national food security rested with the countries themselves, the Committee urged the international community to support the efforts of developing countries with adequate technical and financial assistance. It was also pointed out, in this regard, that the financing of development, and stable conditions for a growing and liberalized trade, are indispensable conditions for sustained economic growth and are also preconditions for food security. The Committee also recognized the important role of regional and sub-regional cooperation in increasing food production and achieving food security.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee agreed that the food security situation in developing countries was seriously affected by adverse external economic factors, particularly restrictions on access to markets, the heavy burden of external debt servicing, low prices for export products, deteriorating terms of trade, as well as the development of products based on substitutes, particularly artificial substitutes. As a result, many developing countries were not able to finance the food imports they needed nor to provide adequate support to domestic food production. The Committee urged that appropriate action be taken to ensure that the debt service payments of developing countries did not hamper the development of the food and agricultural sectors and the performance of the overall economies of these countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Most delegates were concerned that protectionist policies adopted by a number of developed countries continued to be detrimental to global economics growth and food security. The Committee considered that major issues relating to agricultural trade adjustment remained unresolved. It urged concerted action (a) to bring the cereals market into a better balance in the long-term interests of both producing and consuming countries and (b) to enhance export market access in order to improve the foreign exchange earning ability of developing countries. The Committee hoped that Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations would be successful in leading to increased discipline and greater liberalization of agricultural trade.</PARA>

The Soviet Union can, as a consequence, be in no doubt about the extent of Australian concern should it undertake any activity going beyond normal diplomatic, commercial and other relations, and which might adversely affect the peace and security of this region. To this point, we have no evidence that Soviet undertakings in this regard have not been met.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Administrative Services is responsible for ensuring that the Commonwealth gets maximum economic return from its land. The Department enlists the cooperation of Commonwealth agencies which use land to ensure that they regularly review their activities to identify land no longer required. The Department of Defence keeps Defence properties under scrutiny to ensure those it retains are essential for defence purposes. In this regard, a Ministerial Consultant recently completed a review of Defence property. Otherwise, the Department of Defence has not instituted any inquiry into Defence land.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Anzac Rifle Range at Malabar is surplus to Commonwealth requirements. It was advertised for sale by public tender in January 1988. Subsequently the N.S.W. Rifle Association obtained a Supreme Court injunction effectively preventing the Commonwealth from accepting any tender. All tenders have since been rejected and the matter will be further considered by the Court later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) See (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (2) above. Subsequent to tenders being rejected, Citistate Corporation Limited has been advised that when the legal dispute is resolved or the Commonwealth is in a position to take further action on the future of the property, any disposal to the private sector would be through full and open competition.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No. However, there was press speculation concerning a tender submitted by Citistate and its association with Club Mediterranee (Australia).</PARA>
