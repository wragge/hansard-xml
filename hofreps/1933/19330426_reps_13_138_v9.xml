                                <para>- The proposed body will not be an Interstate Commission, mainly for the reason that the duty of an Interstate Commission is primarily, not to safeguard the rights and privileges of States, but to supervise the administration of federal law. The decision of such a body might, for instance, have the effect of vetoing a State law, but not a Federal law. Therefore, it could not give any real protection to the States. The object of the Government in setting up this body is to investigate the difficulties of the smaller States, so as to arrive at some satisfactory and permanent method of meeting their disabilities from year to year, instead of throwing upon the State Treasurers the responsibility of going, almost cap in hand to the Commonwealth for assistance, and at the same time encroaching upon the security of the Commonwealth Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Whilst a very large percentage of wireless listeners are in areas in which reception from one or more stations may be regarded as reasonably satisfactory, a considerable number of listeners are not well served, and a still greater number of people have refrained from taking out licences because, in the locations where they reside, the broadcasting service is almost ineffective. It is admitted that there is cause for dissatisfaction, and that special efforts must be made to remedy the existing deficiencies of the broadcasting services. The extension of the service areas was checked solely by the nation&#39;s economic disabilities. The Government of the day found it necessary to cancel work which had already been embarked upon and, since that time, the financial position has made it impracticable to allocate large sums of money for development purposes. This Government has, however, decided that an expansion of these services must take place at the earliest possible moment, and the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is revising the studies on which the future technique of Australian broadcasting will be based. The amount of money to be invested in the ultimate plan, the great economic influence which a particular policy might exert in the broadcasting sphere, and the far-reaching effects upon listeners, emphasize the need for moving with the greatest caution and in conformity with the best scientific knowledge which the world has to offer. </para>

                    <para>Naturally, there are differences of opinion as to the best course to pursue, and the time now being occupied in a final  impartial survey of an exceedingly complex problem in the light of the most modern development, will undoubtedly be justified. The ground work has been completed, and all that remains to be done now is to sum up the pros and cons of the relevant factors. This review will take a few weeks, but when it is completed, there should be nothing to retard progress to the construction stage. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that an attempt was made to get behind the Ottawa agreement in connexion with the export to Great Britain of Argentine beef, bagged and frozen, but effective and appropriate steps have been taken to stop it. Such a practice, however, could not apply to the major exportation of Argentine meat, which is chilled. The Ottawa agreement is specific in respect of bagged chilled beef. </para>

                        <para>- The circumstances of today are such that it would not be wise at this juncture to make any alteration in the control of the Commonwealth Bank. The conference which is taking place at present between the Prime Minister of England and the President of the United States of America is only a preliminary to the great world conference which is to be held in London. The holding of these conferences shows the necessity for acting with caution. It would not be wise to do anything hurriedly in the direction suggested by the honorable member. This Government will do whatever may be necessary to be done after the world conference has been held, and I hope that something will be done at that conference in the direction indicated by the honorable member - to co-operate with other governments with the object of improving the position of the world. </para>

                        <para>.- The duties in this item have been severely reduced: from1s. 3d. and 2s. 6d. and 35 per cent. and 50 per cent. for over 5 oz. per square yard to 6d. and1s. and 20 per cent. and 40 per cent. per square yard, and the new duties apply to all cotton tweed of over 3 oz. in weight. This represents a cut of approximately 50 per cent. in the fixed rate of duty on cotton tweeds of over 5 oz. in weight. The cotton piece goods industry, which is engaged in the manufacture of cotton tweeds, has developed largely in Australia during the last two or three years and, in fact, since the protective duties provided in the Pratten tariff were imposed in 1926. Those engaged in this industry have never availed themselves of the high duties to exploit the Australian public. On the contrary, the price of Australian cotton tweed has been steadily reduced. This industry is not confined to one State ; it is carried on in both New South Wales and Victoria. The Victorian mills alone, for the year 1931-32, turned out 654,267 yards of cotton tweed valued at &#163;102,000. They employ 185 persons, and distribute about &#163;30,000 in wages annually. Their capital outlay is &#163;90,000, while their buildings, plant and machinery are worth &#163;33,000. There are also three large mills in Sydney, in which the capital employed is &#163;85,000. Their lands, buildings and machinery are valued at &#163;50,000, and the number of their employees is 112, the wages paid totalling &#163;17,000 a year. The industry uses large quantities of cotton yarns which are manufactured in Japan and the United Kingdom, and I am assured by those who are in a position to speak authoritatively on the matter that the plant employed is thoroughly up to date. A new cotton-spinning mill was recently established in Sydney by Bradford Cotton Mills Limited, which company has also a cotton-weaving mill, the object being to meet its own requirements in coloured cotton yarns for the manufacture of cotton tweeds. The rates of duty now in operation are, I recognize, those recommended by the Tariff Board on the 30th September last, after it had made inquiries into the matter. Of course, it is useless to ask this Government to raise the duties above the rates recommended by the board, for it has already tied its hands in that regard by the Ottawa agreement, which, if carried out to the letter, would prevent the Government, unless it appointed a different board, or amended the act altogether, from increasing the duties over the present rates. The Ministry will adhere to its present line of action, notwithstanding the employment position in these industries. I fear the huge importation of goods from eastern countries, notably Japan, which is to-day paralyzing the secondary industries of many European countries, causing the partial closing of their factories.

                        <para>Cotton and artificial silk goods from Japan on the Australian market are a menace to the Lancashire manufacturers, because the competition is one that cannot be met. We have had samples sent home illustrating quite clearly that Japan&#39;s prices beat us by more than 75 per cent. ; in fact, the raw materials used in the manufacture of some of these particular Japanese goods could not be purchased even by Japan for the price at which the manufactured goods are landed in Australia. Therefore, it goes without saying that Japan must be losing heavily on the transaction, and it is reasonable to suppose that the mills of Japan are heading for disaster. But, unfortunately, in the meantime, many legitimate traders are forced out of business. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but I am assured that the Japanese manufacturers are able to produce tweeds even lighter than that. When the tariff protection applied to tweeds over 5 ounces to the yard, the Japanese at once reduced their weights, and secured a market formerly supplied by Australian manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>The cotton tweed industry is linked up with the cotton yarn industry. While coloured cotton yarns for the manufacture of cotton tweeds are allowed to come in from Japan, and to be sold to the Australian weavers in competition with the coloured yarns turned out by the Australian spinning mills, the Australian weaver who wishes to spin his own yarns and use them in his own weaving mills is placed at a distinct disadvantage. The Bradford Cotton Mills in Sydney have installed a plant which cost &#163;60,000, and they give employment to a large number of persons in making yarn suitable for the manufacture of tweeds; but their competitors in other States are buying coloured yarns from Japan at low prices, with the result that the Sydney company is forced to import coloured yarns from Japan and allow its own spinning mills to remain idle. The following figures indicate the large quantities of cotton yarns that have recently been imported :  - </para>

                            <para>- The statement made by the Minister referred only to mercerized yarns. The Bradford Cotton Mills have lying idle a large plant that could be utilized in the spinning of cotton yarns, yet the Minister will not make those yarns dutiable. By-law admissions are far too numerous. If adequate protection were afforded against imported yarns and cotton tweeds, the Bradford Cotton Mills alone could employ 500 persons by working a double shift. This firm was given to understand by the last Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> that if it were able to supply the demand for all kinds of cot.ton yarns it would be given adequate protection. That protection, however, has not been forthcoming, although these mills can supply all the yarns required for cotton tweeds and other purposes, except possibly the very fine counts of over single fifties, with the result that the imports are increasing, and the local plant is partially idle. Naturally, it is desired that the by-law should be cancelled. The Minister ought to give favorable consideration to this request. Some Sydney mills at one time manufactured and sold for 3s. 9d. a yard a very popular cotton tweed that is dutiable under this item. To-day, however, ?. Japanese cloth of this type, on which a duty of ls. and 40 per cent, is paid, is being imported, and is competing with the Australian article. Those w!&#62;o have studied the question will admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fish</inline> knew his book when he stated that the Lancashire firm on whose behalf he spoke cannot possibly compete with the Japanese product. It is said by representatives of the farmers, and by some persons who profess to represent the workers, that any degree of protection means higher prices to the consumer. That, however, has not been the experience in Australia. A comparison of the prices ruling to-day, with those that operated eighteen months ago, will show that there has been an all-round decline of approximately 30 per cent, in the prices of manufactured goods. Nine months ago, the Bradford Cotton Mills, Sydney, an offshoot of an English manufacturing company, had on the market a popular, line of tweed at 2s. 6d. a yard. To-day that tweed is being sold for 2s. a yard. I ask the Minister to take into consideration- the anxiety of this enterprising firm to spin all the cotton yarns required for the &#39;manufacture of cotton tweeds. The Government should see that it is adequately protected against the importation of cheap yarns from Japan. </para>

                    <para>The weaving mills in Australia have also applied for a duty on denims, drills and dungarees, and cloths in the grey. An inquiry into this matter was held by the Tariff Board about two years ago, but at that time it did not feel justified in making a favorable recommendation. I remind the Minister, however, that in the intervening period these factories have undergone considerable development, and have installed a good deal of additional plant. To-day they are able to manufacture the whole of Australia&#39;s  requirements  of denims, drills and dungarees, and cloths in the grey. </para>
                    <para>I warn the Minister not to give rulings in regard to these matters that permit of the importation of goods at lower rates of duty than those specified in the -tariff schedule, to the detriment of Australian manufacturers. The Minister recently ruled that a certain cloth was a gabardine, and was not suitable for manufacture into outer clothing. A mill that had commenced to manufacture this material was obliged lo discontinue that operation,  because  the ruling of the Minister enabled the article to be imported at a lower rate of duty that it was understood would apply. </para>

They have the necessary plant to make this material. They had an inquiry for 3,000 yards of it from George Morgan and Company Limited, Sydney, but as soon as that company found that it could import the cloth at a lower rate of duty it lost interest in the Australian article. Thus the Minister&#39;s interpretation proved detrimental to Australian workmen. Quite a number of other orders would have followed this had the Minister not given a decision which enabled the imported article to be brought in at the rate of 5d. and 25 per cent, under item 105a <inline font-style="italic">la,</inline> instead of at the rate of 6d. and 20 per cent., and ls. and 40 per cent., under item 105a <inline font-style="italic">lb.</inline> I am  assured by the Australian manufacturers that the making of these denims and drills in Australia would not lead to substantial increases in prices.

                    <para class="block">I take it that that provision means that, in the event of our imposing a duty in excess of 55 per cent. against Great Britain, the maximum foreign duty still remains at 75 per cent., in which case there is not a margin of 20 per cent. between the duties on British and those on foreign goods. But it means more than that; it means, also, that in no instance can we have a. foreign duty in excess of 75 per cent. ad valorem. It must mean, therefore, that in no instance can we have a duty exceeding 75 per cent. against Great Britain. If we make the duty 75 per cent. British, the foreign duty cannot exceed that rate. I am concerned to know whether sub-items 105a1b and 105f1 conform to the undertaking entered into at Ottawa. The British preferential duty on cotton piece goods under item 105 a1b is a fixed rate of 6d. per square yard, plus 20 per cent. ad valorem. Only to-day I was informed that certain lines of British cotton piece goods, which are dutiable under this item, cost the equivalent of10d. per yard or less f.o.b. in the United Kingdom. If my information is correct - and I have no reason to doubt it - the duty represents 60 per cent. on the value, and the additional 20 per cent. ad valorem brings it up to 80 per cent. If we add the 10 per cent. on f.o.b. rates, in order to find a basis for the duty, we bring the rate up to 82 per cent., to say nothing of primage, exchange, and other charges. I take it that schedule F, part 1, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the Ottawa agreement compels us in no instance to exceed a duty of 75 per cent. against Great Britain, in which case, if the prices I have mentioned are accurate, it would appear that in this item we are infringing that agreement. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> that we should seriously consider whether in these duties we are not infringing the Ottawa agreement. In this item we are dealing with a double-barrelled duty; it is 6d. per square yard British, and 20 per cent, ad valorem. As I pointed out in this chamber previously, many of these duties amount to from 100 per cent, to 150 per cent. The schedule also provides &#34;or ad valorem 35 per cent, and 55 per cent.&#34; What is the object of setting out different ad valorem rates ? Is it to deceive honorable members? As things are, it  i3  impossible to know what the duties really amount to. It would be better to have no flat rate, but only an ad valorem duty, for then we should know how matters stood. We ought to strike out the ad valorem duties of 35 per cent, and 55 per cent. If it is the intention of the Government that the duties shall not exceed 35 per cent. British and 55 per cent, foreign, why not say so clearly? At the present time the local manufacturer has, in addition to the natural protection, the advantage of 25 per cent, exchange and 10 per cent, primage. These cotton piece goods are used for making the cheaper clothing bought by the poor. Of course, it is possible that the manufacturers may be allowed to import goods duty free. According to a return furnished to me recently, &#163;6,000,000 worth of goods was admitted in 1930 under by law, free of duty, and duties to the value of &#163;1,750,000 were remitted. The Ottawa agreement prescribes a maximum duty of. 75 per cent., and I ask the Minister to give the committee an assurance that that provision of the agreement will not be vitiated. </para>

                        <para>.- Are we to understand that the 75 per cent, prescribed in schedule F, part 1. paragraph c of the Ottawa treaty, applies only to ad valorem rates, and not to fixed rates? If that is so, the Tariff Board could drive a coach and horse through the agreement by merely recommending fixed rates in lieu of ad valorem rates. To my mind the fixed rates of duty must conform to the same general principle  a3  applies to ad valorem rates. Will the Minister postpone the item in order that further consideration may be given to this, aspect of it? </para>

                            <para>- British manufacturers are complaining that their goods are being displaced in the Australian market by cotton piece goods from Japan. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has referred to huge admissions of goods under by-law. That is an old obsession on his part. The fact is that the goods thus admitted free of duty were the raw materials used by manufacturers, and machinery required for rural and other industries. Calico, the largest item of cotton piece goods, is admitted free from the United Kingdom, and is subject to a duty of 15 per cent, under the general tariff. The rates proposed in this schedule are an increase on the rates imposed by the Scullin tariff on cotton piece goods weighing from 3 oz. to 5 oz. per square yard. Undoubtedly serious Japanese competition is being experienced in many industries. Even in India where  labour is cheap, action against the dumping of Japanese goods is contemplated, and the United Kingdom is considering means of preventing the dumping of Japanese gum boots. Recently, when the the Premier of Queensland referred to gum boots, and the risk that some workers might lose their employment, I stated that this item would be referred to the Tariff Board with a view to the adoption of anti-dumping measures. When a similar situation arises in connexion with cotton piece goods, the Government will take prompt action. </para>

                    <para>No time need be lost; invoices can be loaded to a reasonable extent so that Japanese goods will not compete unduly with those from the United Kingdom. The Government is concerned, not only to protect Australian industries, but also to retain trade within the Empire, as far as possible. We have no hostility to Japan, which is one of our best customers, buying annually about &#163;7,000,000 worth of Australian wool, but when competition from overseas is likely to displace labour in Australian factories, the Government will consider the adoption of anti-dumping measures. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> stated that cotton piece goods are being manufactured to a large extent in Australia. The Tariff Board&#39;s report, which is of recent date, shows that cotton piece goods weighing less than 5 oz. per square yard are not yet being made in Australia. Preparations are being made to produce the lighter weights, but until the capacity of Australian mills to do this is proved to the satisfaction of the Tariff Board, any further increase of duties would he premature. The fact that the Government has increased the duties on weights from 3 oz. to 5 oz. shows that it is alive to the need for protecting local industries, but the weights of piece goods principally used by the manufacturers of apparel are not yet being produced in Australia. I am aware that a mill in Sydney has installed the essential machinery for the production of the lighter weights of cotton tweeds, but this machinery is not yet in operation. If light-weight cotton tweeds were made dutiable, other mills which use this material for the manufacture of clothing would be penalized. The committee should rest content with the fact that the Tariff Board has exhaustively investigated this item, and that the Government is on the alert to prevent dumping. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> regarding the importance of the cotton manufacturing industry, its development to date, the employment it affords, and the necessity for maintaining effective protection of it. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has raised a very interesting point which will have an important bearing on the Ottawa agreement. I believe that schedule F goes even further than the honorable member indicated. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently the intention is that no duty against&#39; British goods shall exceed 75 per cent., but, as drafted, the provision means that no duty on any goods, British or foreign, may exceed 75 per cent. In applying the 20 per cent, preference, the draftsman has inserted a proviso that in no circumstances shall the margin be secured by imposing duties exceeding 75 per cent, ad valorem. The use of the word &#34; ad valorem &#34; might be construed legally to exclude  flatrate  duties, but if that is the intention the drafting is the loosest I have ever seen. I hope that such an opportunity for the protection of Australian industries has been left, but  having  watched ths operation of the Ottawa agreement from day to day, I believe that honorable members will soon come to the conclusion that it is unworkable. If the provision in schedule F, that there shall be no duty exceeding 75 per cent, ad valorem, does not extend to flat-rate duties, the whole agreement can be rendered abortive. I think the intention was that no duties should exceed 75 per cent. The honorable member has referred to British piece&#39; goods costing lOd. per yard f.o.b. The lowest price of which I have heard is ls. 6d. a yard. If British piece goods are being sold at lOd. per square yard f.o.b., and the Ottawa agreement prevents us from imposing a duty exceeding 75 per cent., clearly the agreement is thwarting our protectionist policy, and must be amended at an early date. The honorable member for Gippsland has served a  useful purpose by drawing attention to another of the many anomalies in the agreement. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> is afraid that Australian manufacturers may not be able to compete with a maximum protection of 75 per cent., which, with the surcharge, amounts to 82&#189; per cent. In addition, there are primage and exchange, and the natural protection of freight, insurance, &#38;c. I have obtained some figures relating to British dress pieces. The materials that we are now discussing can be used as dress pieces. Those figures show that in 1931 the duty on materials costing 3s.11d. a yard in England was 8s.11d. a yard. On materials costing 4s. 3d. a yard, the duty was 9s.11d. a yard. On materials costing 2s.11&#189;d. a yard, the duty was 8s. 6d. a yard, and on materials costing1s. 11&#189;d. a yard, the duty was 6s.11d. a yard. The importer does not know where he stands in respect of these double-barrelled duties. These materials are cotton goods, fashioned to represent woollen goods. Why should the people of Australia pay for them three or four times the price at which they are obtainable in other parts of the world ? I move - </para>

                        <para>. - Schedule F of the agreement specifically mentions 75 per cent. ad valorem. I understand that specific duties were not discussed at Ottawa. We cannot protect our industries by the imposition of ad valorem duties alone. How could we expect to protect our industries if goods could be dumped into this country at prices much below their real value, and subjectonly to ad valorem duties? Would such a thing be fair to the Australian manufacturers? The amendment which was moved, doubtless in all sincerity, by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> may be misunderstood by the people outside. They may believe that the Government, in voting against it, voted against a provision of the Ottawa agreement. It did nothing of the sort. This Government stands for the review of the tariff by the Tariff Board, and any decision on a snap vote taken on an amendment providing for an ad valorem duty not in excess of 75 per cent. could not be regarded as in opposition to the Ottawa agreement. A proper survey of every Australian industry is being made by the Tariff Board. It has inquired into the manufacture of cotton piece goods, and the Government is accepting most of its recommendations. The report of the Tariff Board, at page 7, shows that the lowest price for cotton piece goods, f.o.b. material, is ls. 4d. a square yard. The ad valorem rate and the rate specified represent infinitely less than a duty of 75 per cent on the cheapest material mentioned by the Tariff Board. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister has attempted to place on part of the Ottawa agreement an interpretation which I hope will not be put forward as the considered decision of the Government, because it would mean purely and simply a repudiation of the spirit of that agreement. The agreement provides for a maximum duty of 75 per cent, ad valorem. The meaning of that is perfectly clear. &#34; Ad valorem &#34; means &#34; according to the value of the goods.&#34; We shall not carry out the spirit of the agreement if we impose fixed duties which do, in fact, exceed the, percentage of 75 per cent, ad valorem, that is, according to the value of the goods. The Customs Department is not obliged to accept any fictitious value placed upon goods by importers. It has authority to review values, and to fix what it considers to be true values. To that extent, it can always give proper protection to Australian industries, at the same time keeping within 75 per cent. as provided for in the Ottawa agreement. The interpretation placed upon the agreement by the Minister is one which I am sure its context will not allow, and I hope that that interpretation will not be accepted by the Government as a whole. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot refrain from emphasizing the fact that, although we have just begun the discussion of the group of duties which provides for any substantial tariff amendment, this committee, including every member of the Government, has now defi nitely voted against the Ottawa agreement. I welcome the action of the Government, because it bears out our contention that if proper protection is to be given to Australian industries this agreement will be found to be unworkable. I agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> as to the interpretation of the agreement. It definitely provides for a maximum ad valorem duty of 75 per cent., and if we impose, say, an ad valorem duty of 50 per cent.,and a fixed . rate equivalent to 50 per cent., on a square yard basis, we shall not he carrying out the letter of the agreement. The action of the Government in respect of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan has shown that these duties, lowas they are, conflict with the Ottawa agreement. The Minister, in his difficulty, has placed on the agreement an interpretation which no one else could give to it. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan was absolutely in accordance with the Ottawa agreement, yet this committee voted against it. I welcomed the opportunity to cast a vote in order to show the impracticability of the agreement as it at present stands. That vote emphasizes the wrong that was done to this country when the Government applied the guillotine in order to rush the Ottawa agreement through Parliament. That agreement was supposed to have been drawn up with considerable care and skill. No doubt there was skill on the part of those who wished to take advantage of Australian industries! It is significant that in the first item that we should deal with to-day - and one of the first of the really contentious items of this schedule - a vote should be cast against the Ottawa agreement. The honorable member for Gippsland has drawn attention to this fact, and the Minister for Trade and Customs has given an explanation of it which will not bear examination. The statement of the Minister and the vote of this committee strike the first real blow at the Ottawa agreement, and reveal the necessity for a definite amendment of this agreement to restore to this Parliament the right to determine the duties which shall be imposed upon goods entering Australia. It is improper to attempt to fix duties by the general method applied in the Ottawa agreement. In dealing with tariff preferences, specific duties should be fixed on definite items, just as they are fixed in any properly made trade agreement, and they should be determined on a sound and honest basis. To adopta general formula, as was -done in the Ottawa agreement, is to tie the hands of Parliament, and to make impossible the proper determination of tariff duties. </para>

                        <para>. - Whatever may be said on the merits of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> I suggest that it is difficult indeed to argue that the amendment itself was directed towards the carrying out of the Ottawa agreement. It is true that the words &#34; 75 per cent. &#34; appear in that agreement; but they must be considered in the connexion in which they appear. The amendment of the honorable member contained the words &#34; Provided that no duty or combination of duties be imposed against British goods in excess of 75 per cent. ad valorem.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I understood that the honorable member moved his amendment with the object of having the principle it contained applied in all cases. I propose to consider whether that principle should be applied to the sub-item now before the committee. The principle was to be expressed by the interpolation of a proviso that no duty or combination of duties should be imposed against British goods in excess of 75 per cent., and it was suggested that the Ottawa agreement provided that the maximum rate of duty on British goods should be 75 per cent. But is that the case? The only reference to 75 per cent. in the Ottawa agreement is contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of part I. of schedule F, which reads - </para>

                        <para>When goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom are liable to duties of customs exceeding twenty-nine per cent. ad valorem, the difference between the British preferential tariff rate and the rate upon similar goods from the most favoured foreign country shall be at least twenty per cent. ad valorem, provided that in no case shall this margin be applied so as to result in a rate of duty exceeding seventy-five per cent. ad valorem. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That provision relates to , a margin of preference; and, in the circumstances set out, it is provided that the margin shall not be applied so as to result in a rate of duty exceeding 75 per cent. ad valorem. Honorable members must bear in mind that the Ottawa agreement is an agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Commonwealth, and while it imposes certain obligations and confers certain rights, it does not prevent either party from giving more than the minimum that is specified. When, for example, it is stated that there shall be a 17&#189; per cent. margin, this Parliament is at liberty to give a 20 per cent. margin. That would be a performance, and more than a performance, of the undertaking. This Parliament is not limited to 15 per cent., 17&#189; per cent., or 20 per cent. These are minima as to which there is an obligation under the agreement. In the case of this proviso, 75 per cent. is specified as the maximum of the obligation which is binding upon this Government and Parliament. In the application of the margin,we are not bound to go beyond 75 per cent. It is not an obligation of the agreement to provide the margin if it would result in a rate of duty of more than 75 per cent. Suppose, for example, the duty on certain British goods were 60 per cent., that duty, being at a higher rate than 29 per cent., would fall within paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> If the duty were 60 per cent. we should not be bound to go to 80 per cent. If it were 70 per cent., we should not be bound to go to 90 per cent. With deference to those whose opinion is different from mine, I suggest that the whole point is in the  well-understood distinction between a substantive provision and a proviso to a substantive provision. If there were a substantive provision in the agreement that no duty in the tariff schedule should exceed 15 per cent, it would be quite plain; but this proviso deals with the application of margins. In the application of margins we are not bound to raise our duties above 75 per cent. I point out to the mover of the amendment that the 75 per cent, refers rather to foreign than to British duties. That the application of the margin is not to result in a duty higher than 75 per cent, plainly refers to the higher of the two duties. In this paragraph, we have a provision for the application of a formula in the case of duties exceeding 29 per cent., but the fact that there is a proviso does not prevent us from giving a greater preference if we wish to do so. When paragraph c is interpreted as a proviso to a substantive provision, it becomes clear that there is nothing to prevent us from providing duties of 30, 40 or 100 per cent., if we wish to do so. The matter is entirely within the control of this Parliament. This is a &#39;safeguard inserted by those who drafted the agreement to ensure that in applying margins we shall not be forced to go to a figure above 75 per cent. But this Parliament legislates in respect to matters affecting tariffs generally, and not only in respect of those involved in the carrying out of the Ottawa agreement. I can easily visualize a case in which we have a British duty of, say, 20 per cent. In that case there ought to be a margin of 17&#163; per cent, under the terms of the agreement, and the duty would be made at least 37&#163; per cent. I can also visualize this Parliament deciding that in the case of certain countries that have traded with us generously it would leave the duty at 37&#163; per cent., but that in the case of other countries it would increase it to 50 per cent. These margins are those which we have agreed to give to Great Britain. But there is also a further provision; that we cannot be forced to impose a duty above 75 per cent, against foreign goods; we are at liberty to do so, but are not bound to do so. </para>

                            <para>- It is easy to see the reason for that provision.&#34; While we were prepared to give margins of 15 per cent., 17&#163; per cent., and 20 per cent, to Great Britain, provision was made that we should not be forced to go above a duty of 75 per cent. We are at liberty to go above that figure if we desire to do so; but we cannot be compelled to exceed it. This provision also meets the British point of view. It is easy to understand that Great Britain might be pleased indeed to have some limit upon the effect of the agreement in raising the level of duties generally. Paragraph c of part 1 of schedule F must be understood to be a proviso dealing with the margins on the duties stipulated in that schedule. It allows this Parliament full liberty to give more if it thinks proper; but the Government implements its obligation if it observes the various margins, with the limit, in the third instance, of 75 per cent, as the highest duty. The two important points which I suggest should be borne in mind, are the distinction between being bound to do a particular thing, and being at liberty to do more, and also the essential distinction between a substantive provision and a proviso to be applied in the course of the application of a substantive provision. It is no use talking generally on the subject. The interpretation depends on the specific words used, and upon a recognition of the point that there is a proviso in cases where the margin is being applied. But this Parliament is able to legislate on tariffs apart altogether from applications of margins. It would be able, without infringing in any way the Ottawa agreement, to decide that all foreign duties should be raised by 100 per cent. There is not a word in that agreement which would prevent that from being done, if this Parliament thought it a proper thing to do. I hope that the Parliament would not do it, but I use an extreme instance for the purpose of illustration. </para>

                            <para>- No. I draw a distinction between action taken by this Parliament in applying the margin, and other action which it is at liberty to take. The obligation of applying the margin is subject to this limitation. That is why I made the final point that the Parliament is at liberty, independent of the Ottawa agreement, to increase the foreign duties as much as it likes ; that is entirely an independent consideration. For example, suppose a certain foreign country imposed prohibitions against the entry of all Australian goods. This Parliament would be at liberty, if it thought proper, to prohibit the entry into Australia of all goods from that country. The provisions in the agreement, for example, about the removing of prohibitions, are limited to goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. In the case of the supposed foreign country which prohibited the importation of our goods, we should be at liberty to put on a duty of  200  per cent, on everything imported from that country. I suggest that no doubt exists upon that point. But in so doing, we should not be acting on the application of a margin. In applying a margin, we fulfil the requirements, even if we do not go above the  75  per cent, mentioned in paragraph c of schedule F. We cannot be forced to go above that rate; yet we are at liberty to give Great Britain further benefits if we think proper. We are. also at liberty to impose obstacles or. impediments to the trade of foreign countries with Australia which are greater than those involved in the application of the provisions of the Ottawa agreement relating to margins. </para>

                        <para>.- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has taken pains to assure the committee that this Parliament is entitled to give greater preferences than those- stipulated in the Ottawa agreement. Paragraph c of schedule F of the agreement provides for a minimum preference on British goods of  20  per cent., and, of course, Australia is entitled to grant a preference of  100  per cent, if it chooses to do so. It is at liberty to give what preference it thinks proper, provided it is not less than the minimum stipulated in the Ottawa agreement. The interpretation given by the right honorable the Attorney-General is one that I cannot follow. I notice that this is one of the undertakings of the Commonwealth Government as set out in article  8  of the first schedule of the agreement. Certain undertakings are given by the British and Commonwealth Governments respectively, and this is one of the obligations undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. The obligation seems to be very plain. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of schedule F reads as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- It means that in the result the rate of duty shall not exceed  75  per cent. That must be read in conjunction with the earlier part of the paragraph, which states that the minimum preference which shall be given to Great Britain is  20  per cent. It is hard to reconcile the interpretation given by the Attorney-General that this part of the agreement would be carried out if the duty against British goods amounted to.  70  per cent, and that against foreign  goods to 75 per cent. In the net result the preference to .Great Britain would then be only 5 per cent. </para>

                            shall try to throw some light on this point, which has become somewhat controversial. An attempt was made at Ottawa on behalf of Australia to show as much consideration as possible to those foreign countries which are good customers of ours. That&#39; is indicated in a number of cases in the agreement. For instance, with reference to the remarks just made by the honorable member for Perth
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline>
                            I may say that the formula df preference does not apply at all to British goods which are already mainly in possession of the Australian import market. If Great Britain is shown, for instance, to have already 70 per cent., 80 per cent., or 90 per cent, of the Australian trade, the formula will have no application. If Great Britain cannot show capacity to manufacture certain goods, the formula, again, has no application. Coming to the point now before the committee, we stated at Ottawa that&#39; we did not wish to carry any ad valorem duty above 75 per cent, against the foreigner, and, as -the Attorney-General
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline>
                            has pointed out, we said that, if that were threatened, we should not be required to apply the formula. That was accepted by the British delegation, and is clearly expressed in the agreement itself. To me the agreement is a perfectly simple one; the limitation of 75 per cent, has no bearing at all on the level of the British duty which this Parliament may impose; it really has no application to the level of the foreign duty that may be imposed by this Parliament. Out of consideration to foreigners, where the duty is very high, the agreement merely reserves the right to the Government to say that here the formula shall not have application. I am somewhat surprised that our friends of the Country party, and other honorable members, by their vote this afternoon, have indicated their desire to have the formula enforced in a way which would have the effect of making the foreign duties even higher than they now are.

                        <para>.- The duties provided for under , sub-item aa - piece goods, knitted - represent a reduction of the duties introduced by the Scullin Government, which were 2s. 6d., 3s., and 4s. per lb., with the addition of ad valorem rates of 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 50 per cent., which duties have operated since the 21st November, 1929. Under the 1921-28 tariff, the actual rates of duty were similar in all respects to those now in force, except that they operated upon an alternative and not composite basis, as at the present time. The actual increase, therefore, in tariff protection afforded the industry by the Scullin Government, consisted of the supplementary duty of 30 per cent, ad valorem in respect of imports of British origin, and 50 per cent, ad valorem upon import&#39;s not entitled to preference. This is a very important industry. In the State of Victoria alone, there are thirteen knitting mills, the output of which for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1931, was 2,800,000 lb., valued at &#163;610,000. Those figures were increased in the eleven months ended the 31st May, 1932, to 3,500,000 lb. and &#163;675,000 respectively. In Victoria employment is given to approximately 2,000 persons, and the total amount drawn in wages during the twelve months ended the 31st May, 1932, was &#163;237,000. </para>

                    <para>This is one of the subsidiary industries that assist the Australian wool and cotton  spinning mills, as well as the wool-growers and cotton-growers. During the eleven months ended the 31st May,&#39; 1932, it used cotton yarns valued at &#163;161,000, and woollen yarns valued at &#163;113,000. The amount of capital invested in the industry in Victoria is &#163;1,059,000. As has been the case with other secondary industries, tariff protection has had the effect of reducing the prices of the articles manufactured by this industry. Since November, 1929, that reduction has amounted to 35 per cent. The present rates of duty are absolutely necessary to the industry as a whole, to enable it to secure stability of employment as well as continuity of factory operations - a very important consideration. Any person who has made a study of the industry knows that in it a very high state of efficiency prevails, and that the public obtains its varied requirements at very reasonable prices. A factor that has to be borne in mind is that a big section of the industry is carried on in country centres, such as Bendigo, Ballarat and Maryborough in Victoria, where no other kind of employment is available for our young people. The Tariff Board states, in its report, that the industry can be rated as efficient, and that, as far as can be judged, it is providing the public with knitted piece goods and garments at reasonable prices. As that report was made only last year, I trust that the Minister will not be in a hurry to have the industry further investigated with a view to conforming to the terms of the Ottawa agreement, under which the British manufacturer must bc given equal opportunities of competing in the Australian market. The industry provides employment for a large number of our growing boys and girls. Whatever the personal views of the Minister may be in regard to the necessity for continuing this protection, it is known that since the Ottawa agreement was made the fiscal outlook of the Government has undergone a change, and that in many cases it feels that it cannot continue protection which twelve months ago the Minister would consider was deserved. Frequently the honorable gentleman himself is overruled, because it is represented by the British Government .that the spirit and the letter of the Ottawa agreement are not being observed. This industry may suffer as the result of further representations to the Commonwealth Government by British manufacturers. </para>
                    <para>The total value of Australian woollen yarns used in the production of these knitted goods during 1931-32 was &#163;113,000, while the value of cotton yarns used in the same period was &#163;161,000. The purchase of raw wool on the Australian market in competition with overseas buyers results in a higher price being obtained by the producers of that commodity. It is important, therefore, that no action should be taken that might jeopardize this large labour-employing industry. </para>

                        <para>. - No complaint having been received from any manufacturer regarding this duty, it may be assumed that it is regarded as satisfactory. The industry made great progress under the 1921-28 tariff. I agree with the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> concerning its efficiency. The only change made is that there are now alternative rates in substitution for the cumulative fixed and ad valorem rates imposed by the last Government. &#39; This is one of the 214 industries to which I have previously referred that have been investigated by the Tariff Board, and been given  it3  approval. There is an increase of 5 per cent, in the general tariff rate so as to conform with the Ottawa formula. </para>

                            <para>- In Sydney. I hope to be able to supply the de.tails later. This is one of those industries that may be carried on in most of the States, and in the different States advantage has been taken of successive tariffs to build up gradually a tremendous output of knitted goods. But proposals such as this have a definitely adverse effect. The manufacturers have been reduced to such a state that they can now do nothing but pray fervently that the Government will not be so harsh as to put them completely out of business. This is not only a direct blow at the knitted goods section of the textile industry, but it also gives effect to the declared policy of the Government to implement the Ottawa agreement. It looks as though that implementation is to be made at the expense of knitted goods. I protest against these continual attacks on Australian industries which, prior to the advent of this Government, were established on a sound basis and were providing congenial employment at fair wages and under good conditions for Australian workers. Under such a policy one can readily visualize the dismissal of many thousands of those who to-day are employed in this industry in Australia. Work will be provided in other countries in the production. of goods that should be made by our own people. </para>

                        <para>. -  I challenge the statement of the honorable member that unemployment has been created in this industry. He promised to supply the details at a later stage; but his case would be strengthened if he produced them now. The Tariff Board publicly advertised the fact that it proposed to hold an inquiry into this industry, yet no manufacturer appeared before it to object to the present duties. The British fixed rate has been reduced by 6d. per lb., while the foreign rate has been increased. It is foreign competition that has to be guarded against. The constant throwing of stones at Ottawa may be popular in some quarters; but frequently the assertions made are gross exaggerations. </para>

                            <para>- There are many reasons for the transfer of employees from one industry to another, or from one section of an industry to another. The official figures show that unemploy ment is less to-day than it was in March, 1931. Silk and artificial silk compete with this knitted line. There has been a change in the industry, and some dislocation has been caused at different times, principally during 1929 and 1930; but the industry is now holding its own, and is thoroughly efficient. The Tariff Board investigated its operations in accordance with the terms of the Ottawa agreement, and so far the Government has not received any complaints from the manufacturers themselves. </para>

                        <para>.- The Tariff Board has recommended the- reduction of the duty imposed by the Scullin Government on sub-item  f,  paragraphs 1, 2, 4  -  piece goods, woollen or containing wool - for which relief, much thanks. But, having regard to many of the expressions that are to be found in its report, I am inclined to believe that it would be disposed to recommend a further reduction if the matter were again considered by it. In its report of &#39;September, 1932, the board admits that the amount of duty recommended is in excess of the protection necessary to secure to the Australian manufacturers an overwhelming proportion of the trade. In its report issued in September last, the Tariff Board stated - </para>

                        <para>The rates of duty recommended by the board are higher  than are considered necessary to secure the Australian manufacture of an overwhelming proportion of the market in woollen piece goods for men&#39;s wear. The ad valorem equivalents of the rates vary considerably, but they represent an average duty of 44 per cent, on men&#39;s suitings, &#38;c, as set out in Table A given earlier in this report, and an average of 84 per cent, on woollens of the lighter weights as shown in Table B. Apart from the duties recommended by the board, there exists at present abnormally high landing charges due to primage and exchange. The average cost of landing the lines above referred to under existing charges, including duty, is 120 per cent, on the f.o.b. value. However, the board, in making its recommendation, has indicated the rates of duty which it considers adequate without the added protection at present afforded by exchange and primage duty. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Since that report was published the Tariff Board has undertaken an inquiry into the effect of primage and exchange and the extent to which these charges should be .taken into account when fixing duties. It is unfortunate, that the result of its investigations is not yet available; I understand from the Minister that the report will be available shortly. The report from which I have quoted, however, makes it clear that the board did not take into consideration primage and exchange when fixing the duties on this item, so that although the  present recommendations of the board involve a reduction of the previous duties, they still provide for a higher protection than is necessary to secure to the Australian manufacturers an overwhelming proportion of the Australian market. It is doubtful whether the board is adopting a correct principle in recommending duties of this character, for one effect of the duties is that the Australian consumers pay more for the goods they require than would be the case if the duties were more moderate. </para>

                        <para>The imposition of unreasonably high rates of duty imposes serious disadvantages on the community, this being particularly  so  in the case of materials, like women&#39;s dress goods, where the range is so wide. The range of fashion goods in demand is too wide to be met by any one country. Although the Australian manufacturers have produced an excellent variety of woollen dress goods, evidence makes it clear that there remain numerous lines, many of which are only in small demand, but in the aggregate, represent a considerable proportion of the requirements which the local manufacturers by reason of limited output could not commercially produce. </para>

                    <para class="block">That paragraph is an effective reply to those protectionists who claim that high duties should be imposed on these goods in order that the Australian market may be reserved to the Australian manufacturers. Such a policy is unreasonable, because it means either that desirable goods are excluded, or, if allowed in, are subject to almost prohibitive charges. If we adopt a policy of excluding goods made in other countries, our Australian manufactures will never imbibe new ideas. I hope that we shall soon get beyond that stage in which Australian manufacturers have continually to be coddled. I hope that some day they will be able to export something, and so render some real service to this country in the way of bringing in money from outside. Notwithstanding  that we have assisted them with high tariffs and bounties, Australian manufacturers are almost incompetent to -export anything. If we continue to give them a closed market, by removing all competition from them and preventing them from gathering new idea&#39;s, they will  remain  in their present state. We should realize that it is necessary for our manufacturing industries .to develop in the face of competition. Is it right that Australian consumers should pay so much more than their fellow consumers of Great Britain pay for similar goods? It may be a fine thing to have factories established in this country, and no doubt it is regrettable that 150 employees have been dismissed by Bond&#39;s Limited. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they were maintained by bounties paid by the Australian community as a whole. That policy may suit Bond&#39;s and find favour in Sydney where the money is distributed; but such advantages are given to the few at the expense of the consuming public of Australia who have to pay for the privilege of keeping these establishments going. I am npt opposed to reasonable protection, but surely a protection which increases the costs of goods by 90 per cent, is not reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- Whenever, mention is made of reducing labour costs, some honorable members fear&#39; that their constituents will think that they have advocated a reduction of wages. The higher costs in Australia are not due solely to the higher wages paid in Australia compared with other countries; there are also overhead expenses, including rent and interest, to be taken into account. Many Australian factories were established when prices were at their # peak, yet the protectionists in this House seek to maintain the conditions which then prevailed, notwithstanding that money is now much scarcer. We cannot fairly maintain those conditions; costs must come down. As I have said, the Tariff Board admitted that the rates of duty which it recommended were in excess of the protection necessary to secure to Australian manufacturers an overwhelming proportion of the Australian market. I do not think that the present duties are economically sound. I understand that the Tariff Board is to reconsider these items, and I hope that when it does so, it will reduce the protection to a level which, while giving reasonable protection to Australian industries, will not impose an undue burden on the consuming public. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the wish expressed by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> will not be realized, and that the Tariff Board will cease to meddle with the protection afforded to a fine Australian industry. If there is one industry which is natural to Australia, it is the wool industry. If there is one anomaly more than another in this country, it is that we produce in Australia the finest wool in the world, and then send it 12,000 miles to be manufactured into clothing for our own use. My regret is that the present Government has interfered with the duties on this item which the previous Government imposed. The proposal before us now is that the duty on British goods shall be ls. per square yard, and 30 per cent, ad valorem, compared with 2s. per square yard and 35 per cent, respectively under the Scullin Government&#39;s tariff, while the duty on foreign goods is 2s. per square yard and 50 per cent, instead of 3s. and 50 per cent, respectively under the tariff schedule which it supersedes. The duties on men&#39;s suitings proposed in this schedule are practically the same as those which were in operation before the Scullin Government introduced its tariff schedule. At that time, there were heavy importations of woollen goods into Australia. In 192?-28, the importations of woollen piece goods, including flannels, worsteds, wool and cotton, and other woollen goods, were valued at &#163;2,483,000. In 1931, the imports fell to &#163;173,000. That would be due to some extent to the reduced- purchasing power of the community, but it was largely the result of the increased protection given to local industries. In that regard, the Tariff Board stated; - </para>

                        <para>The increased duties, by virtually preventing the importation of all woollen piece goods except very special lines, gave the local manufacturers practically the whole of the Australian market. The increase in local production was, however, not in keeping with .the fall in importations, partly owing to the contraction of purchasing power of the community, and the resultant accumulation of stocks of goods previously imported and also locally made, and partly to the inability of local manufacturers to supply immediately the variety of light weight materials in demand. Gradually, however, as the market has been cleared of accumulated stocks, and as the local mills have developed in the production of light weight goods, output and employment has increased. </para>

                    <para class="block">Clothing manufacturers have complained that they could not get immediate delivery of a wide range of goods, particularly light weight materials. That was partly due to the fact that they were not prepared to place their orders for Australian materials as far ahead as they wore compelled to place their orders for  imported goods, but when the duties were increased, they found it practicable to place their local orders in advance, with the result that local mills were able to supply them. Any honorable member who has visited the Australian mills, particularly in New South &#34;Wales and &#34;Victoria, must have been impressed by the increased activity displayed by them subsequent to the imposition of really protective duties. Instead of some mills being idle and others working only a few days weekly, all were working full time, and some were working two shift&#39;s daily, and employing a large number of hands. The woollen textile industry is one of those that respond to the impetus of protection, and did not take advantage of the higher duties to raise the price to the users. As a matter of fact, the evidence shows that, since the increased duties were imposed, the average price of woollen goods has been reduced 30 per cent. A statement was submitted to the Tariff Board from 28 mills that since the increase of duties, 8,000 new types or designs of cloth, and 200,000 patterns had been produced. That is a complete answer t&#39;o the statement of- the honorable member for Perth that manufacturers cannot get from local mills a wide range of goods. The honorable member said that the range of ladies&#39; materials was not wide.

                    <para class="block">It is easy to condemn generally Australian products, and to say that a person would sooner pay a higher price for a good imported article. People who speak in that strain retain the prejudices of twenty years ago. No one will deny that in the early stages of the Australian industry its products were not comparable with imported suitings, but to-day if a person is prepared to pay a reasonable price he can purchase a local article as good as any imported, and certainly good enough for any person to wear. One of the difficulties with which Australian manufacturers have had to contend is this prejudice against Australian products. Those who are ready to buy an Australian cloth want it at half theprice charged for the imported article, and, in order to meet that demand, manufacturers have been obliged to reduce the quality of their goods. A person who is prepared to pay a reasonable price can get an Australian article as good as any produced in other countries. The honorable member for Perth emphasized the prices charged for Australian cloths. According to the Tariff Board&#39;s report, the highest price for heavy-weight twills and tweeds, black and navy-blue, is 10s. 6d. a yard. From <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> to 3&#163; yards is required to make a suit for an average man; therefore, 34s. will purchase a length of one of the best suitings a person can desire. Comparable imported material without duty costs 8s. a yard, so that the difference in the price of a suit is only 8s. in favour of the imported cloth. Is that too big a price to pay for woollen mills which employ over 12,000 of our people throughout Australia, mean prosperity to many  country towns, and provide another competitor at the wool sales for Australian raw material. The percentage of the total clip that they buy is not large, but their demand has some influence on the price of wool. I am amazed that the Government has interfered with the duties imposed by my Government. I admit that while exchange and primage continue  to  give indirect protection the danger  to  local woollen mills is not great; but they will suffer  to  some extent by the reduction of duties, and mill-owners are apprehensive because they know that the aid given by exchange and primage may be only transient. A return furnished  to  the Tariff Board shows that, in 1930, 27 mills were employing 6,200 persons, and were working only part time. In 1932, those mills employed8,900 persons on full time. That is a remarkable improvement in two years. In the same period the output rose from 3,770,000 yards, valued at &#163;990,000,  to  5,870,000 yards, valued at &#163;1,190,000, whilst the average price had fallen by about1s. a yard. According  to  a very interesting report prepared by the Victorian Government Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawton,</inline> the textile mills in that State, including others than woollen, employed in 1931, 14,700 persons. In the following year the number employed was 17,100, an increase of over 2,000 in one State only. The wages paid annually in woollen mills alone is &#163;2,000,000, and the raw material used is valued  at  about &#163;4,000,000. I repeat that whilst the local mills have increased their output and employed more people, they have reduced the charge to the user. The honorable member for Perth quoted a portion of the Tariff Board&#39;s report referring  to  the range of materials. I draw attention to the following passage which I am surprised  to  find in the report of a responsible body claiming  to  have an Australian outlook :  - </para>

                            <para>- The range of lowweight materials produced in Australian mills has amazed everybody. Is it any wonder that the lady expert whom I have quoted expressed amazement at the growth of the industry ? A few years ago, we were under the impression that the production of a wide range of materials, in particular, light-weight materials, was not possible under the method of developing the Australian textile industry, yet within one year the industry by its wonderful expansion entirely removed that impression. It is strange that the Tariff Board should now tell us that it would be unwise for the industryto attempt to manufacture certain weights of materials when it is at present manufacturing them successfully. According  to  the evidence given before the Tariff Board the industry isusing some 200,000 patterns, and if that number is not sufficient to coverour requirements, we must be mighty fastidious. </para>

                            <para>- There is not much in that argument, because it could be used in respect of every industry that we are likely to establish. If we make the prices of our manufactures prohibitive, we shall, of course; force the consumers to buy something else. But present prices are not prohibitive, and there is no complaint about the local article. The Minister well knows that cotton manufactures are not likely to displace woollen manufactures. In a little over twelve months the Australian industry has provided 8,000 new classes of materials. Surely that is a marvellous development. I regret that the Government has seen fit to reduce these duties. There has been no proof of exploitation on the part of manufacturers, but there has been plenty of proof of the efficiency of the industry, the increasing employment of our own people, and the increasing use of our own raw materials. I hope that the Government will not accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> that the Tariff Board should review this industry and make further reductions of duties. Such an action would be calamitous to the industry, because it would mean closing up many of our mills and throwing out of employment many thousands of our workers. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to support the remarks of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> in connexion with this sub-item, because the duties imposed are excessive. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has rightly declared that the woollen industry is one of the great natural industries of this country, and that we have a monopoly of the finest wool in the world. In view of that fact, our people should be clothed with woollen manufactures as cheaply as the people of other countries; but strange to say, that is not the position to-day. . Last week, while in Sydney, I decided to visit the Blue Mountains, and, therefore, to purchase some warm underclothing. The price quoted to me for a Crimean shirt was 22s. 6d., yet the garment did not contain more than ls. 6d. worth of ,wool. In the interests of the woollen industry and of those employed in it, the Government should make every endeavour to reduce the price of woollen goods so as to bring them within the purchasing capacity of the people generally. Woollen garments are very necessary during the cold winter months, and suitable garments should not be denied to our people&#34;&#34;. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that at one period, the industry employed 8,000 workers, but that the number had now been reduced to 6,000. </para>

                            <para>- The high prices ruling for commodities in Australia today constitute one of the greatest handicaps to our wool industry. The price of wool is low, labour costs have been reduced, and the exchange is favorable to the producer. Yet because of the high tariff, the people of Australia are denied the use of reasonably priced woollen products. The high tariff makes for less work, less wool, and lower consumption. This Parliament should make some effort to reduce prices, in view of .the reduced purchasing power of the people of Australia. The cost of tweeds made in Australia is 3s. 6d. a yard at the mill. The cloth is sold by the warehouses at 6s. 6d. a yard, and by the tailors at from 10s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. a yard. There has been little alteration in the price of suits within the last few years. Present-day prices preclude the extensive use of Australian tweeds, and that, of course, has a detrimental effect upon the wool industry. The Government should do everything within its power to reduce the price of woollen manufactures. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the Government will not reduce these duties; I should prefer it to increase them. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has suggested that we should concentrate upon the development of our natural industries, and, in particular, the woollen industry. I would point out to him that the textile industries are part and parcel of our great woollen industry, and, therefore, to be consistent, he must be prepared to protect the woollen textile industry with which we are now dealing. The war gave this industry a great stimulus. The Government and the military authorities, instead of purchasing imported woollen materials, decided to manufacture their own requirements. The result was that our soldiers were better clothed than any others in the  field. The Government, by taking that action, saved millions of pounds. The duties imposed are not too high, although I admit that there is too great a margin between the price charged by. the manufacturer and that charged by the tailor or shopkeeper. But that evil will arise whether the material is imported or locally manufactured. The woollen mills of this country are not exploiting the people. All my life I have been fastidious about my clothes. For many years I wore suits of imported material,but during the last four or five years, I have worn suits of Australian material. I myself cannot distinguish between the imported and the local material, and I am quite certain that many thousands of people in Australia to-day are under the impression that they are wearing suits of imported material when actually their suits are of Australian material. There is, unfortunately, among the community, a prejudice against Australian commodities, and our manufacturers and workmen generally do not get credit for the excellence of the materials that they produce. The manufactures of the Geelong &#34;Woollen Mills are equal to the imported materials. The Geelong &#34;Woollen Mills supply materials to some of the largest tailoring establishments in Melbourne, and I have been informed by the manager and the secretary that those establishments buy the materials only on condition that the public remain ignorant of the fact that they are manufactured in Australia. Suits made of materials manufactured by the Geelong Woollen Mills are sold in city shops at from &#163;12 12s. to &#163;14 14s., just because the purchasers believe that they are made of English materials. I would not dare to make such a statement if I were not certain of its truth. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the honor. able member knows why we cannot do so. Are not the British textile manufacturers to-day demanding protection against Japanese goods, the Czechoslovakians against Indian goods, and the Americans against the cheap products of other countries ? The honorable member must know that it is foolish to expect our manufacturers to export their products to  coun-  tries which are regarded as dumping grounds by the manufacturers of cheaplabour countries overseas. Everybody knows that half the world&#39;s machinery is running at only half capacity. In all the circumstances, I hope that these duties will not be reduced, and that the Minister will reconsider the position. The woollen textile industry provides employment for a large number of people, both men and women, under decent conditions, and it has been so successful in securing the local market that thousands of our people are wearing Australian materials who think they are wearing imported materials. </para>

                            <para>- An export trade is already beginning, in a small way. This is one of the few secondary industries to which we can look with some hope for a future export trade. It can be said with truth of the Australian woollen textile industry that it has not made any attempt to exploit the people because of its advantageous position by reason of the tariff, exchange and primage, and other factors such as the reduced purchasing power of the people, which have tended to exclude imported materials. Importations of woollen textiles have practically stopped, and the Australian industry now has almost complete control of the local market. In spite of this fact, prices have actually declined by from 25 to 30 per cent. This industry affords a most striking example of reasonable charges being made by an Australian industry which has practically complete protection against importations from overseas. </para>

                    <para>In brief terms, the situation of the textile industry of Australia is this: In and before 1929 the Australian mills supplied the bulk .of the Australian market with men&#39;s suitings, flannels, blankets, and cheaper overcoatings, but with practically none of the light-weight women&#39;s materials or more expensive men&#39;s suitings. Now, our mills supply, not only the textiles which they formerly supplied, but also a very large percentage of lightweight and. other classes of materials for women&#39;s apparel. I have taken some trouble to analyse the figures relating to our importations of woollen piece goods. I found that in the pre-depression years, which were, roughly, the last four years of the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, no less than 75 per cent, of our total importations of woollen piece goods consisted of light-weight materials for  women&#39;s  apparel, whereas now Ave have secured practically the whole local market for our own products in these materials. In 1928-29,  which  was the last pre-depression year, the Australian mills provided 68.28 per cent, of the total consumption of woollen textiles, or more than  two-thirds  of them. In 1930-31, which I hope Ave can call the mid-depression year, the percentage of the products of the Australian mills to the total consumption had risen to 90 per cent. For the year ended June, 1932, the percentage of the Australian market supplied by the Australian mills Was 97.5 per cent. - a most extraordinary figure. In other words, by the end of last June the Australian mills  were  able to supply practically the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements. The total value of our production in 1931-32 Was &#163;4,852,216, whereas . in the predepression year of 1928-29 it Was &#163;4,779,814, but, taking into account the drop in price, I am satisfied, though I  cannot  support my statement with actual figures, that the yardage production of Australian material Was 25 per cent, greater in 1931-32 than in 1928-29. I have also attempted to analyse the import figures for the eight months of the current financial year to the end of February, 1933. I find that, while the imports in that period were rather greater than in the corresponding period of 1931-32, the difference was only slight. It can be said quite definitely that the imports are negligible compared with the production of the Australian mills. In 1932-33 our Australian mills will probably supply 95 per cent, of our total requirements in textiles. In these circumstances, I contend that the reduction of duty from 2s. and 35 per cent, to ls. and 30 per cent. British, which was made last September, has not injured our woollen textile industry. </para>

                            <para>- The action of the Scullin Government is only one factor in the situation. The statement that the duty now applies to textiles weighing more than 3 oz. per square yard whereas the figure was formerly 6 oz., and that this is wholly responsible for the encouragement of the manufacture of lightweight materials for women&#39;s clothing must be considered in the light of the fact that importations of these goods had dropped from a value of &#163;2,115,000 in 1927-28 to &#163;685,000 in 1928-29, by reason of the depression beginning to make itself felt, and remained at practically the same figure- &#163;683,000 in 1929-30- after the alteration from 6 oz. to 3 oz. had been made, and has since dropped to a very small figure owing to the exchange, and primage factors and the lack of purchasing power of the people. </para>

                    <para>For the benefit of honorable members who are not familiar with this item, I point out that woollen textiles are principally dealt with under two items in the tariff, namely, 105f, 1 and 2, and the weight per yard is the criterion as between the two sub-items. Item 105f 1 is the principal item, and has always carried the higher duty. Until 1929 material weighing 6 oz. per square yard came under item 105f 1, and paid the higher duty. In 1929; material weighing as low as 3 oz. was brought into the higher duty item. As practically no material under 3 oz. per square yard is made in Australia, or, indeed, imported into Australia, the effect was to make item 105f 1 the real protective item and to make item 105f 2 practically inoperative. </para>
                    <para>There were practically no men&#39;s suitings coming in under the Bruce-Page tariff. In these circumstances, I contend that it is quite wrong to say that the duty is now virtually where it was under the 1921-28 tariff. No one wanted a higher duty over those rates for the heavier material, for we had obtained practically the whole market. </para>
                    <para>I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> in regard to the impetus that has been given to the manufacture of light-weight material for women&#39;s use. I have ventured, with the the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Library Committee, to place upon the table of the Library a fairly complete range of samples of women&#39;s materials of light and other weights. </para>

                            <para>- The Australian textile industry deserves the highest praise for the rapidity with which it has responded to the demand for light-weight women&#39;s materials owing to the necessity for restricting imports for the purpose of correcting our adverse trade balance. In diversity of range, designs, and quality, I think that the articles produced in Australia bear favorable comparison with any similar imported goods. I hope that honorable members will take this opportunity to inspect the samples of women&#39;s materials made in Australia that I have been allowed to display in the Library. They should note the diversity and the range of colours and designs, and; above all, the quality. </para>

                    <para>It is important to compare the degree of effective protection given under the Lyons and the Scullin tariffs to textiles of various prices. I have worked out the landed cost of imported materialsat London invoice prices ranging from 3s. to 12s. 6d. a yard, and have had my figures checked by an importing house, an Australian manufacturer, and the Department of Trade and Customs. They apply to cheap, medium, and expensive lines. Material invoiced in England at 3s. a yard is landed in Australia at the present time at about 5s. 9d. a yard, without taking exchange and primage into account. With exchange and primage added, the cost of this 3s. material becomes 6s.10d. under the Lyons tariff, or an increase of about 125 per cent. Under the Scullin tariff it became 8s.1d. a yard, or an increase of about 167 per cent. That includes packing, freight, insurance, exchange, and primage duty, but not sales tax. It is the price into the warehouse of the Australian merchant. Taking a medium price material invoiced in England at 7s. a yard, the price increases under the present Lyons tariff to 11s. 7&#189;d., or an increase of 65 per cent. without taking exchange or primage into account. Allowing for exchange and primage, it becomes 14s. 2d. a yard, or an increase of just over 100 per cent. Under the Scullin tariff, it became 15s. 8d. a yard, or an increase of about 125 per cent. Expensive material invoiced at 12s. 6d. a yard in England, becomes 19s. 9d. under the present Lyons tariff, or an increase of about 60 per cent. without exchange and primage. With exchange and primage, theprice increases to 24s. 4d., or an increase of about 90 per cent. Under the Scullin tariff, it would be 26s., or an increase of about 110 per cent. Taking an approximate average over the whole range of prices from 3s. to12s. 6d. a yard, the position is that the effective protection given under the Lyons tariff is 106 per cent. compared with 134 per cent. under the Scullin tariff. Under the Lyons tariff, the average effective protection, leaving out exchange and primage, is 71 per cent. To give a rough and ready figure, it may be said that a 4s. article is landed at about 8s. 9d., and is sold by the importing wholesaler at 10s. 6d. Before it reaches the Australian consumer it probably costs three times as much as it would cost the consumer in Great Britain. </para>
                    <para>And now as to the criticism offered by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> there are factors adverse to the Australian industry that cannot be expressed in quantitative terms. It is interesting to find that the Tariff Board has given due weight to them in arriving at its recommendations to Parliament. I refer to theunfortunate tendency of certain sections of this community to give preference to imported materials to the detriment of local goods, even when price and inherent quality make the local goods better value. This is a relic of the old days that is not yet dead. </para>

Another factor is the importation - I hesitate to use - the term &#34; dumping &#34; - of endofseason goods at low prices due to the seasonal difference between the two hemispheres.

                    <para>The real menace to the industry at the present time is the very cheap women&#39;s material that is coming into Australia from certain foreign countries. The negligible prices at which these materials are being sold can mean nothing less than that dumping is being practised in an extreme form. I know that the Government is aware of this, but I take this opportunity to direct its attention again to this problem in the interests of the light-weight section of the Australian textile industry, the future of which is definitely menaced from other than British sources. I have in my hand a sample of material from a foreign country. If is under 3 oz. to the square yard, and it is coming into the merchant&#39;s warehouse at ls. 4d. a square yard. That is a price which barely pays the cost of the material and overhead charges, and certainly does not cover the cost of labour at the rates which we pay in Australia. * </para>

One hears a great deal of woollen tweeds and other woollen materials from Japan,- but I am assured by wholesalers that the only material that is competitive with the Australian article at present is that to. which I am referring. It cannot be made in Australia at less than a price which is considerably above that of the article imported from Japan, and it would be purchased solely by persons who pay regard only to the question of price. </para>

                    <para>Criticism is contained in the report of the Tariff Board, and has been voiced in other directions with reference to the deliveries by Australian manufacturers, but I point out that Australian merchants are getting deliveries from Australian mills at a considerably better rate than they could ever have expected from British mills. Through having a source of supply on the spot merchants are tempted to hold back the placing of their orders until they are certain of being able to sell the goods. I make no apology for the deliveries, because the figures that I have seen over a fairly wide range are really very satisfactory. The business is to a large extent seasonal and the orders for the winter season come in during the first four months of the year. The rush in the local mills during the last four months has been phenomenal, and the mill managers have been making Herculean efforts to cope with the rush. The textile industry in Australia is organized on a different basis from that of the industry in England. Here, the mills attempt to produce a wider range of materials, and therefore they desire to know three months ahead what their orders will be in order to arrange their programme on an economic basis. However, apart altogether from the percentage of protection that the Australian textile industry enjoys at the presenttime, the gist, of the position is that the Australian mills have, practically speaking, secured the whole business under existing conditions of tariff and exchange. </para>
                    <para>Fears have been expressed that, if, and when, the exchange runs off the situation will alter in favour of imported materials. This, I think, is taking a jump before it is reached. I do not think that any one sees an early downward movement of the exchange rate, but even if that- happens Ave have the ready remedy of the resubmission of this item to the Tariff Board. I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that, in the event of a sudden decline in the exchange rate through world conditions, to the detriment of the Australian woollen textile industry, he will re-submit this item to the Tariff Board. </para>
                    <para>I should like to discuss other aspects of this matter, but time will not permit of that. However, in the short time that  remains to me, I should like to put forward a tentative proposal to the Minister. This item covers a very wide range of types and qualities of textiles, and as it is quite impossible to fix a rate of duty that gives fair and reasonable protection to every article within that wide range - some would be under protected and others over protected - I suggest to the Minister the possibility of subdividing the item so that the protection given might be more scientific and less by-and-large. </para>
                    <para>Before I finish this part of my speech I should like to say that the mills at Geelong, which I think are representative of all the woollen mills of Australia, are open to inspection, and the manufacturers welcome inspection by any responsible person, desirous of seeing how the industry is conducted. </para>
                    <para>I desire to refer to the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> that certain men were discharged from one mill in Geelong, because of the Ottawa agreement. This was not a chance remark, because it was repeated after being replied to, and the honorable member exulted in the statement. I give a direct denial to any possibility of 90 men having been put off by reason of the Ottawa agreement. They were undoubtedly put off. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly they were put off, but it was for a variety of reasons, none of which had any connexion with the Ottawa agreement. The particular mill referred to makes a medium grade of material, of which there is practically no importation from abroad, and the 90 men concerned were employed on that class of work. I am sure that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is aware that the usual practice in the great majority of the woollen mills of Australia is to work one shift only. This is due to technical reasons dealing with dyeing and with other aspects of the process of manufacture. This mill, however, was working a night shift to enable it to cope with a particular order, and when that order was completed these 90 men were dismissed. There is no suggestion that their dismissal was due to the Ottawa agreement, or was in any way connected with the tariff. I should like to hear an explanation by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition as to how he connects the matter with the Ottawa agreement. If figures were available dealing with the hiring and engaging of labour in the textile industry generally, they would show no diminution today in the average number of men engaged. Under present conditions, the tariff assures to the Australian mills the vast bulk of the trade. They enjoyed 97i per cent, of it last year, and this year they will probably have 95 per cent, of it. The industry is thriving, and never in the history of this country was employment in the textile industry so high as it is to-day. The present duty is adequate. No harm was done to the industry by the reduction of duty made in September last. We have not gone back to the level of the Bruce Page tariff. Any lower duty, in certain lines at least, would probably not help Britain, and would, probably, help the foreigner. I am quite sure that this industry is perfectly safe in the hands of the Government, and that the Government realizes its importance to this country from many points of view. </para>

                        <para>.- The woollen textile industry is one of the big natural industries of Australia, and I believe that the majority of honorable members, apart from those who are ardent freetraders, are interested in its progress and development. There is in Australia to-day sufficient plant to meet the whole of the Australian demand for all the goods that come under this item. .An important point that must not be overlooked is that the establishment of this industry in Australia has been most beneficial to Australian wool producers, because the competition of buyers from the Australian mills with those from Japan, Belgium and other continental countries at the periodical wool sales, has had the effect of forcing up prices. On numerous occasions the increased price paid as a consequence of this competition has amounted to at least <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb. The purchasers of Australian -wool for use in the Australian mills have increased from 66,000 bales in 1906-07 to 136,000 bales in 1915-16, and to 252,000 bales in  1931-32. This great woollen textile industry, in which is invested approximately &#163;6,000,000, which uses &#163;4,000,000 worth of raw material, employs directly 12,000 persons, and pays in wages &#163;2,000,000 per annum, is entitled to adequate and effective protection. I make no apology for having been Minister for Trade and Customs in a government that gave a degree of protection that was tantamount to prohibition against the importation of such goods as can be efficiently and economically manufactured in Australia. Although the mills are at present busy on account of seasonal demands, and the execution of orders or contracts that were entered into between July and December last, there exists in the industry to-day a real apprehension that these reduced duties may result in increased imports from Japan, Great Britain, and other countries. Those who are engaged in the manufacture of these worsteds and lightweight dress materials, already have in their possession evidence of the fact that many buyers &#39; are negotiating for imports, and are refraining from ordering in the quantities that they ordered last year. The only way  in  which the existing state of employment in the industry may be maintained is by the continuance of adequate protection. The industry should not be dependent upon the protection afforded by exchange and primage duty, that is not a lasting protection, because, in three or four months, it may be non-existent. .The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has suggested that, in the event of the loss of the protection afforded by those two factors, the matter should be referred to the Tariff Board. That board, however already has before it a couple of hundred items, which will  keep it fully occupied for at least nine months, and there WOUld be unavoidable delay that might have disastrous effects upon the employment provided by this great industry. </para>

                    <para>In a speech that he delivered last October, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> claimed, on behalf of his Government, that no protective duties had been reduced. We are now told that the reductions in regard to woollen  piece goods are not in any way due to the Ottawa agreement. Let us examine the facts. The Ottawa Conference ended on the 20th August, 1932; and on the 1st September, only twelve days later, the then Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> tabled in this committee a tariff schedule that made drastic reductions in 34 items. The protection afforded to woollen  worsteds weighing 6 oz. and over was reduced by one-half. It may be claimed that that was merely a coincidence. It appears to me, however, to have marked the inauguration of a policy of tariff reductions, upon cabled advice from the Australian representatives at Ottawa. We were informed that the Government </para>
                    <para>Was  in direct cable communication with those representatives, just as it was said recently that daily cable communication  Was  being maintained  Avith <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> who,  on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, conducted certain negotiations Avith the New Zealand Government. I cannot believe that the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs had not received cable advice from the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> and from the Resident Minister in London <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Bruce),  that they had agreed to substantial reductions of duties in the case of woollen piece goods, and that it would be good diplomacy to include those reductions in the tariff schedule that was to be brought down on the 1st September. At about the same time one of the British delegates, referring in the House of Commons to what the Australian representatives had agreed to, said - -Australia had expressed a willingness to reduce tariffs until our manufacturers were able to compete. </para>
                    <para class="block">This, doubtless, was one line in which they hoped to be able to compete as the result of the reductions promised by the Australian representatives. The present duties reduce the protection from 2s. and 3s., and 35 per cent, and 50 per cent;, to ls. and 2s., and 30 per cent, and 50 per cent. With respect to weights over 6 oz. a square yard, that is a reversion to the Pratten duties. In regard to  weights  of from 3 oz. to 6 oz. greater protection is provided than Was given by the Pratten tariff, but it is only about one-half that afforded by the duties  imposed by the Scullin Government. When the Scullin administration came into office it was approached by numerous deputations from the woollen manufacturers and the workers in the industry, and was informed that the mills were only working half time. I visited the mills at Geelong, Ballarat and Melbourne, and went into the case very carefully. I found that the representatives of the industry and of the employees in it had stated the facts correctly. A statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> H. Jones, the representative of the workers at Geelong, is typical of the reports that were furnished in 1930 by practically all the big centres in which woollen mills were operating. It is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The trade at Geelong is still feeling the depression, and the outlook is anything but promising. The Albion Mills are working full time. At the Federal Mills, members in some departments are losing a great amount of time. Hirst&#39;s Mills are in a very bad way; one of the mills is closing down this week. The Valley Mill is working overtime in some departments, and three, four, and five days weekly in other departments. Collins Brothers arc on short time, and are reducing hands. </para>

                    <para class="block">The duties imposed by the Scullin Government were intended to afford adequate protection. Less than effective protection would have been useless at a time when it was necessary to stem the tide of imports and to rectify our adverse trade balance. It was satisfactory to that Government to find that the number of employees in 27 mills in Victoria rose from 6,238 on the 1st December, 1930, to 8,901 on the 1st May, 1932- all of whom were working at least full time, and some of them overtime. Unfortunately, owing to the apprehension that exists in the industry to-day, and to the falling off in the forward orders that were received from six to twelve months ago, there will be a declining rate of employment. The mills are busy to-day because they are meeting orders that were placed from six to twelve months ago. I have here a letter from the manager of one of the big mills, dated as late as the 4th April last. It reads - </para>

                        <para>In regard to trade generally : At the moment, we are rushed with immediate orders, but we are not booking very well on forward orders. Competition from Japan is growing daily, and the attitude of the Government in reducing the foreign tariff will have a strong rebound on Australian industries shortly. The reduction on British goods brings us into keen competition with the Old Country, particularly if exchange and primage is tampered with. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is typical of the fear and the apprehension that exist in the minds of the leaders of this industry. They do not know what is going to happen next. The honorable member for Corio suggested that, should the exchange drop, the matter should be referred to the Tariff Board. I urge the Minister not to waste time by referring the matter to that body, but to investigate the circumstances with the assistance of the experts in his department, so as to ensure the maintenance of the effective protection that is given to the industry. In 1929-30 the increased rates under the Scullin schedule - 2s. and 3s. plus 35 per cent. and 50 per cent. - operated. In 1930-31, the 3-oz. minimum came into force, with the increased rates of British 2s. and 35 per cent., foreign 3s. and 50 per cent., and, n.e.i., British 45 per cent., foreign 60 per cent. Consequently, the position in regard to importations can be judged only by taking the figures for 1928-29. The statistical figures in relation to importations are as follow :  - </para>

                        <para>The local production of materials for men&#39;s suits and overcoats compares favorably with the imported cloths both as regards quality and price over a large proportion of the range. Furthermore, the variety of design and qualities produced is adequate to&#39; supply a very substantial proportion of the demand. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Australian industry is efficiently conducted, and both the quality and the price of its goods are satisfactory to ali but the most prejudiced persons. Unfortunately, the effective tariff protection granted to the woollen industry by the Scullin Government is being whittled away, and those engaged in the trade view with apprehension the reduction of duties in the present schedule. The position is somewhat less serious than it would be were it not for the .assistance of the exchange and the primage duty. I hope that those factors will not be taken into consideration by the Minister when determining whether or not the protection afforded to this industry is adequate. During 1927-28, woollen piece goods to the value of &#163;2,483,413 were imported. Of that amount, &#163;396,474 represented worsted piece goods as ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear; &#163;1,163,756 represented piece goods made wholly of wool, and &#163;676,419 represented woollen piece goods mixed with cotton or other materials for similar wear. Other woollen piece goods imported were valued at &#163;180,535. That such heavy importations took place after the Pratten duties came into operation shows conclusively that those duties were insufficient to protect the Australian industry. When the Scullin Administration assumed office, millers and millworkers adduced evidence to show that many of the Australian mills were working half time. Since the present Government came into power, the importations of woollen piece goods have increased. That fact the honorable member for Corio attempted to brush aside lightly. </para>

                            <para>- I was pointing out the development that has taken place in this industry, with a view to showing the necessity for a continuance of the policy of protection. In New South Wales, however, the absence of a continued policy of protection caused investors to be unwilling to invest their money in the industry. Under federation, with its uniform fiscal policy for all Australia, the industry improved. The value of the plant and machinery used in the manufacture of woollens and worsteds in 1930- 31 was &#163;3,567,000, and during the same year, the output of the mills, including the value of the raw materials at sundry stages, was valued at nearly &#163;7,000,000. If the value of these raw materials is deducted, it will be seen that the productive processes applied by skill and industry represented &#163;2,700,000, of which &#163;1,633,000, or approximately 60 per cent., was paid in wages, which were distributed among 12,000 employees, of whom 5,500 were males, and 6,500 females. During the year that I have mentioned, Australian woollen mills used 18,300,000 lb. of scoured wool, representing about 50,000,000 lb. of greasy wool, which is equal to the clip of nearly 8,000,000 sheep. That consumption of wool shows an increase of over 30 per cent. on the wool used in 1924-25, before the Pratten tariff gave to the industry a fair measure of protection. </para>

                    <para>There is no justification for importing into Australia any blankets, flannels, woollen piece goods or light-weight dress materials. Before the Scullin Administra tion extended the protection given to lightweight dress materials, many of the woollen mills of Australia were working only half time. Credit is due to those engaged in this industry for the variety of dress materials which they now produce. That their quality is equal to the best that the world can produce, one can realize examining the samples left in the library by the honorable member for Corio. Although about eighteen months ago I was able to show honorable members a wide assortment of Australian dress materials, that range has increased considerably in the meantime. On the grounds that we produce the best wool in the world, that this industry gives employment directly to 12,000 persons, and indirectly to at least 50,000 persons, I submit that the Government should hesitate before doing anything which may jeopardize its future progress. I fear that the pressure of freetrade advocates and the desire to comply with the Ottawa agreement, by giving British manufacturers a better opportunity to compete with Australian woollen mills, may lead to a further reduction of duties. The action of the Scullin Administration in imposing effective protection had most beneficial results in this industry, but, unfortunately, since that Government went out of office, the importations of these goods have increased. I hope that if the Minister sees any substantial increase of these importations, he will&#34; take immediate action to stop them in the interests of this great Australian industry and those engaged in it. </para>

                        <para>.- Will twaddle of the sort to which we have just listened build up Australia industrially? Can the Australian worker and manufacturer do nothing in competition with their rivals in other countries? Are we to continue protecting them by increasing the artificial barriers when we know that, even at the present time, discussions are proceeding in the United States of America between the governments of three of the leading nations with a view to retrieving the world from the dreadful economic position into which it has drifted through nationalism carried to extremes? The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has admitted that the protection enjoyed by the manufacturers of woollen piece goods is. fully 100 per cent., yet the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> asks that higher duties be imposed. Is Australia supported wholly by the factories in the large centres of population ? Do not honorable members realize the existing depression throughout the country, and the reduced purchasing power of the people? In each State are large numbers of unemployed. Yet honorable members would ask the people to pay fictitious prices for every article they wear or use. The honorable member for Corio painted an attractive picture of the prosperity of the woollen manufacturing industry at Geelong, but I again remind him that under the Ottawa agreement the Commonwealth undertook that - during the currency of this agreement the tariff shall be based on the principle that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production, provided that in the application of such principles special consideration may be given to the case of industries not fully established. </para>

                    <para class="block">If protection up to 100 per cent, is needed to maintain manufacturing industries in this country, what hope have we of building up a great nation? To-day, not one article manufactured in Australia can be sold commercially in any other country. The honorable member for Capricornia said that the higher protection of %the manufacturers of woollens is needed to help the pastoralists. Recently, I had to pay 16s. for a singlet. Such prices, instead of helping the wool-grower, drive the public to substitutes. The &#34;use more wool&#34; campaign becomes futile when, by excessive prices, we force the people to buy substitutes for wool. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> recently published a letter relating to the duties on woollen piece goods signed by Buckley and Nunn Limited, Myer Emporium Limited,  Craig Williamson Proprietary Limited, Ball and Welch Limited, and Hicks, Atkinson and Sons Proprietary Limited. I quote a portion of it- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">We, as representing the leading retail organizations, whose prosperity depends upon Australia&#39;s prosperity, are strong advocates of the protectionist policy. We believe, however, that protection imposed without adequate investigation and thought as to the consequences can do incalculable harm. In the case of the item mentioned and certain other items of recent schedules it is our considered opinion that Australian industries will lose infinitely more than it will gain. We ask, therefore, that full investigation be made into the effects of this and certain other excessive tariff increases before&#39; the schedules become law. Further information will be gladly given as to other items, if desired. It is our considered opinion that in the great majority of cases the manufacture of the light woollen goods affected by the new duties could not be attempted in Australia. To a great extent such goods have been produced by overseas manufacturers in a special effort to meet the menace of the growing popularity of artificial silk and other substitutes for wool. Their success is one of the few bright spots in the outlook for a recovery in wool prices. By the Government&#39;s action any assistance that the Australian consumer might be able to give to the &#34; use more wool &#34; movement by using these fabrics is rendered out of the question. It will now be beyond the purse of the public, however patriotic, to buy these attractive light woollen materials any longer. </para>

                    <para>An honorable member told me recently that when he attempted to buy Crimean shirts in Sydney he was asked to pay 25s. each. These high prices press very hardly on the poorer sections of the community. There must be something seriously lacking with Australian manufacturers and workers when they ask for protection of 100 per cent., and, in some instances, over 300 per &#34; cent., against foreign competition. </para>

                        <para>At the Sydney inquiry you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> remarked that you had often wondered why 14 oz. of wool can be bought for 8d. or 9d., when it costs a guinea for a piece of tweed; presumably you were referring to high grade suitings. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westmore</inline> also referred to a fall of more than half in wool costs, conveying a suggestion that manufactured materials should also fall half. Firstly, the 14 oz. of wool in the cloth would be the result of treating about <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> lb. of wool as shorn from the sheep, the balance of the weight being made up of unsuitable oddment wools sorted from the shorn fleece, grease and dirt taken out in scouring, and noils and waste taken out in combing and spinning. The value of the byproducts referred to is, of course, allowed for, but with wool at 9d. per lb. would not represent more than about IS per cent, of the cost of the <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> lb. of greasy wool. Additional  materials, such as soap, soda, dyes and chemicals are used in the manufacturing processes, and before wool reaches the cloth stage it has to pass through about 45 to 55 processes, each entailing expense in the form of labour, supervision, machine and overhead charges, &#38;c. After the manufacturer comes the distributor, who has to cover his own expenses and risk of loss in bad debts, &#38;c, so when a guinea is spent on cloth, not only is wool bought, but a contribution is also made to the livelihood of an army of workers. This particular portion may not be regarded as relevant to the matter under consideration, but it may help to remove some misconceptions regarding the costs of the products of the industry. </para>

                            <para>- The livelihood of the wool-grower is involved in the local manufacture of the raw material he produces. I am afraid that sometimes the Tariff Board is guilty of a dereliction of duty in not conveying to Parliament, through its representatives, vital information. For instance, I know that sworn testimony was submitted to the board that prior to the local manufacture of light woollen materials the prices of imported piece goods were much higher. Subsequent to the commencement of local production the prices of some materials were reduced by 5s. a yard. </para>

                            <para>- Only partly. Often local manufacture is followed by a reduction of prices, and, when that occurs, the board should inform Parliament. Some honorable members would have people believe that all imported woollen goods are the product of Australian wool. I remind the committee that South Africa, the Argentine, and other countries also grow and export fine wool, and that at least a proportion of imported woollen goods is of foreign origin and foreign material, whereas the fostering of local manufacture means that all processes from the sheep&#39;s back to the wearer&#39;s back are carried out in Australia to the benefit of the local wool-growers, manufacturers, and workers. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> called attention to the fallacy of always quoting the f.o.b. price in England against the retail price paid in Australia for local products. The c.i.f. prices would be fairer, but the only real comparison is between the prices of the importing warehousemen and those of the manufacturers. Such a comparison would show only a fractional difference in the charges paid by the consumer. Only a few days ago attention was called to the fact that the purchases at the wool sales by Australian manufacturers had considerably influenced the prices of several grades of wool. An increased demand for wool is arising from the manufacture of articles not previously produced in Australia. Many mills are making beautiful woollen ties which the public should wear in preference to ties produced from imported silk. Owing to the demand for these woollen ties and light dress materials local manufacturers are able to bid more vigorously at the wool sales, and this in turn helps the pastor alists. A pleasing feature of the woollen textile industry is its wide distribution throughout Australia. I know of no other secondary industry that plays so important a part in the industrial support of country towns. In Victoria woollen mills have been established at Wangaratta, Sale, Warrnambool, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Stawell and Geelong. Geelong holds the premier position in respect of both the number of mills and the quality of the materials produced. A number of mills have been established in the country areas of New South Wales and Victoria, and that is a fine thing for Australia generally. The proprietors of these mills have incurred considerable expenditure in developing the industry. They have imported textile machinery from the Old Country, and that, of course, has given a certain amount of trade to Great Britain. From the 1st January, 1929, to the 1st of July, 1932, 25 woollen mills expended &#163;324,000 on the installation of modern machinery, and seventeen mills expended &#163;185,000 on the manufacture and improvement of materials. It is expected that an additional &#163;49,000 will be expended by other mills. This expenditure has had the effect of providing more employment and of increasing the use of Australian raw materials. </para>

                    <para>I hope that if this industry is at any time faced with danger in respect of either loss of employment or depression of trade consequent upon the competition of foreign countries, the Minister, instead of adopting the slow process of instructing the Tariff Board to review the industry, will take immediate action in this Parliament to prevent this industry, which provides so much employment in the community,, from being destroyed. Some honorable members, including the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> do not refer so frequently as they did before, to the tariff policy of Great Britain, for the simple reason that Great Britain has, in a measure, adopted a protective policy. English journals which at one time had freetrade ideas - the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> - are now advising the British Government to impose immediately duties of up to 100 per cent., so as to protect British industries from competition that is likely to ensue, because of the action of the United States of America in going off the gold standard. When I was in England some years ago, most of the members of the British Labour Party were advocates of freetrade, but the greater number of parliamentarians were in favour of a protective policy to prevent the dumping in Great Britain of foreign commodities. England has to-day adopted a moderate protective policy, and that, of course, will place it upon a better trade footing when bargaining with other nations. We should have no hesitation in passing this sub-item. Honorable members generally are conversant with the ramifications of the industry, and are desirous that it should prosper. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> can at least console himself with the fact that he started this discussion. I hope that he will rid himself of his delusion that the only good material is imported material. We should do everything in our power to encourage this industry, which is providing employment for many of our own people. </para>

                    <para>The advocates of the textile industry have seriously contended that the price of Australian wool has appreciated because of the competition of Australian buyers in the local market. The proportion of Australian wool used locally is about 5 per cent, of the total output. The figure quoted by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> was 7 per cent., and I shall accept his figure. It would be difficult to convince any person other than a protectionist that the buyers of 7 per cent, of any commodity could set the market as against the buyers of the remaining 93 per cent. It is obvious that the smaller buyers follow the market set by the larger buyers. When the textile industry becomes as efficient as its advocates seem to think it is now, it will perhaps be able to compete in the markets of the world. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> did give us some information on which reliance could be placed. He showed that even under the reduced tariff proposals of the Government, the effective protection is 106 per cent., and that the industry is thriving. What industry would not thrive under such conditions, when it is a national industry, producing goods which are required by the community  generally? Any industry which enjoys such a large measure of protection must thrive, but only at the expense of the  people who are using its products. Honorable members speak of this as a national industry; but I ask them to compare its position with that of the great national industry of producing wool. Whereas the smaller national industry enjoys a protection of 106 per cent., the larger national industry sells its goods in the markets of the world without any protection at all. There is no element of fairness in the protectionist scheme. It has been pointed out that, in respect of some woollen goods, the price in Australia is three times that in England. This gives us some idea of the excessive price which the people of Australia are paying for their woollens. Some day the workers generally will awaken to the fact that they are being exploited by the manufacturers and their fellow employees in the textile industry, and will force them to supply commodities at a price more compatible with that ruling overseas. </para>

                        <para>.- No one will deny that the woollen textile industry is one of our great natural secondary industries. It is also agreed that it is efficient, and that despite the high duties that have been imposed, it has never attempted to exploit the community. Surely, then, it is an industry which is well worthy of adequate protection. During the last few years it has developed considerably. To-day it has captured 95 per cent, of the Australian market, as against 66 per cent, which it held a few years ago. We cannot expect it to capture 100 per cent, of the local market. So many people have a prejudice against Australian goods, and will buy only imported materials. There has, however, been a change in their attitude lately, because the expansion of this industry has had the effect of breaking down to some extent the barriers of prejudice which were at one time erected against it. A fortnight ago I walked into a large city house and asked to be shown some suiting materials. A large range of materials was placed before me, at prices ranging from 11 to 13 guineas. In every case the material was imported. The price of one, a serge, was 11 guineas. I asked what was the price of a suit of similar material of Australian manufacture, and was told that it was 9 guineas. The salesman considered that the quality of the Australian article was equal to that of the imported articleTaking the actual difference between the costs of manufacture as 8s. or 10s:, it will be readily seen that an additional 30s. or 35s. is charged those persons who are prejudiced against Australian goods. The - particular firm to which I refer did not show me any Australian goods until I specifically asked for them. I believe that this is a common practice with many of the bigger houses. </para>

                    <para>I regret that the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> should have criticized the quality and range of Australian manufactures. This, I believe, is to be taken, not as prejudice, but as lack of knowledge on his part. The next time the honorable member visits Sydney I shall invite him to visit one of the mills in my electorate, and I think that he will then be satisfied that his remarks were unwarranted. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> also complained of the degree of protection provided for this industry, and said that the cost of distribution was far too great. I do not think that the cost of distribution should be a factor in determining the degree of protection which an industry needs. A good deal has been said during this debate about the present state of this industry. The Globe Mill, in my electorate, has increased the number of its employees by 100 in the last four months. The plant is being worked at the maximum overtime permitted by . the .State laws. The manager informed me recently that the factory could be extended, but that he was not satisfied with the degree of security that was being given to the industry.  I  join with the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> in requesting the Minister to give this industry adequate assurances that it will be- fully safeguarded. If this is done, increased employment will be provided, even with the existing duties. </para>

                        <para>.- After hearing so many honorable members extol the value of the woollen textile industry to Australia, I begin to fear that we shall kill the patient by too much kindness. We all hope that this great industry will develop to such an extent that it will be able to use a good deal more of our Australian wool than at present.. In the latest <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh</inline> that is available, the figures indicate that the local mills used less Australian wool in 1930-31 than in 1926-27, the respective figures being 45,435,185 lb. and 52,127,351 lb. This reduction is not due to the shortage of supplies, for the export figures show that, in 1926-27, 688,000,000 lb. of wool was exported, while, in 1930-31, 768,000,000 lb. was exported. It appears, therefore, that, although the Australian mills are being given substantial protection and much encouragement, they are not manufacturing as much Australian wool as they did four or five years ago. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has told us that the Statistician&#39;s figures are the final authority. I agree with him, and ask the Minister if he will be good enough to explain why there has been this reduction of consumption by the local mills. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has pointed out that it is a poor policy for us to impose heavy duties on goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia, for the only result is an increase of price to the public. Surely the Government and this Parliament have a duty, not only to the people of Australia, but also to the producers engaged in this and other great Australian primary industries! I should like to know whether the Minister has any figures to show that the situation indicated in the figures which I have quoted has altered, or whether he can explain why these woollen mills, which are being praised so highly, are using less Australian wool than formerly. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members who decry our great Australian industries and dogmatize on the desirability of removing all duties might well ask themselves what would happen to our great primary and secondary industries if all duties were discarded. We cannot afford to look at these subjects from the purely selfish point of view, seeing that in this great country, with its 6,500,000 people, our largest aggregations of populations are in our capital cities. If we abandoned our protective policy, could those engaged in primary industries absorb the artisans who would be thrown out of employment, and would it be possible for us to pay our old-age pensions and maintain our other social services without customs revenue? I think I have given the honorable member enough to think about, but I also remind him that, in 1930-31, which was one of the years lie quoted, we were in the depth of the depression, and that the purchasing power of our people declined seriously in that year. I think the honorable member should have been able to do something better than quote the figures he used. </para>
                    <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> in discussing this item, suggested that there had been such a serious reduction of duties as to jeopardize the industry, and he also had something to say about the reduced duties causing more unemployment and about whittling away thetariff protection hitherto accorded to this industry. But the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has shown conclusively that the textile mills of Australia, and particularly those of Geelong, in his own electorate, are busier than they have ever been. Sub-item 105  f  1 covers woollen outerwear fabrics weighing more than 3 oz. per square yard, and sub-item 105  f  2 covers woollen outerwear fabrics weighing 3 oz. or less per square yard, and woollen piece goods of any weight for underwear. The duties in respect of the first item have been slightly reduced, but it has not been suggestedthat those  provided for the other sub-item are inadequate. The most significant alteration that&#39; has been made is the reduction of the weight limit of the fabric covered by sub-item f 1 from 6 oz. to 3 oz. per square yard-. Actually, the duties are higher now than they were under the 1921-28 schedule. This has had the effect of enabling the local woollen mills to secure a large volume of the trade in light weight fabrics which previously was held by the importers. Inquiry recently by the Tariff Board in regard to the duties on these goods showed that in 1928-29, the local manufacturers had been successful, under the duties then in operation, in meeting 65 per cent, of Australia&#39;s requirements. On page 9 of the board&#39;s report, the details of the production of 24- woollen mills for the years 1926 to 1931 are given. In 1931, there was actually a drop in the quantity and value of the goods produced weighing over 6 oz. It will be seen, therefore, that the Scullin tariff did not have the effect which has been claimed for it. The previous duty was adequate to protect the manufacturers of the heavier weight material, and figures have been quoted during this debate to show that the present rate of duty is more than sufficient to enable the Australian industry to give employment up to its full capacity and yet protect the consumers of these goods. </para>
                    <para>Women&#39;s light-weight woollen fabrics, which generally weigh less than 6 oz. per square yard, are in a somewhat different position. The demand covers a very wide range, and while quite a number of lines can be supplied by the local manufacturers at a reasonable price, there are others which, by reason of the small demand, are not a commercial proposition to those manufacturers. In such instances, the high duties imposed by the previous administration were in the nature of a burden on the consumers. The board set out in table B of its report a number of instances in which manufacturers can produce many light-weight fabrics at the present time at a price approximately the same as, and in some instances actually lower than, the landed price of comparable imported cloth, including duties at the proposed rates, but excluding primage and exchange. As the Australian manufac turers&#39; costs are based on the higher cost of wool due to the exchange position, it naturally follows that if the exchange between England and Australia falls, then the price of wool in Australia will be reduced as compared with the price in the United Kingdom, and the relative position will thus be more favorable to the Australian manufacturer than table B of the board&#39;s report indicates. The proprietor of a wool-scouring firm in Geelong told me that he now found the best market was the local one, and that he received better prices in Geelong than by shipping overseas. We all know that the wool-growers and other primary producers are having a very hard time at present, but we must look at this subject from the point of view of all sections of the people. Every man on the land knows that his prices are controlled by world conditions. There has been a catastrophic fall in. world prices, but I point out to the honorsable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),,</inline> who deplores the fact that we are protecting local industries to the extent that we are, that Australia is in a happier and better position than any other country in the world. </para>

We have an expert Tariff Board that takes evidence from both sides, and arrives at an equitable and judicial decision.

                    <para>The point was raised by the local manufacturers that a higher protection was needed than that accorded by the 1921-30 tariff to overcome the preference of some buyers for imported goods, and to provide adequate safeguards against the importation of end-of-season goods at low prices. The Tariff Board has taken this factor into account, and the duties proposed are considered to be sufficiently high to meet this eventuality. An important point made by the board is that unreasonably high duties would result in the demand swinging away from woollen piece goods towards silk and artificial silk piece goods, dutiable at low rates of duty. The Deputy leader of the Opposition said that certain goods - gabardines - had been allowed into Australia under by-law instead of a certain rate of duty being charged. It is provided under the tariff that the goods must resemble woollen piece goods, but gabardines do not resemble them, and for that reason, were admitted free. </para>
                    <para>Light-weight woollen piece goods are largely the product of the United Kingdom, and, as Britain is our greatest purchaser of Australian fine merino wool, the use of silk or artificial silk piece goods in place of woollen goods would mean the substitution of foreign fibres for Australian raw materials. </para>
                    <para>The Government recognizes that the woollen manufacturing industry in the Commonwealth is a very important one, and provides employment for a large number of persons. It may be said that the industry is efficient and competitive. The product&#39;s manufactured are satisfactory, and in the lines in which there is sufficient demand the prices are competitive. The review made by the Tariff Board shows that under the protection granted by the 1921-30 rates, the industry commanded practically the whole of the trade in the heavier-weight fabrics. The importations of woollen piece goods in 1927- 28 were valued at &#163;2,483,413; but an alteration of the item in 1928, in order to repair certain loopholes through which importers were defeating the object of the duties, resulted in importations during 1928- 29 falling to &#163;1,448,105. </para>
                    <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that &#163;8,000,000 odd worth of textiles were imported yearly into Australia, and one would infer from his remarks that they were coming in surreptitiously, or that their importation might be stopped by the applicationof proper duties. For the first eight months of this financial year, textiles to the sterling value of &#163;8,700,804 were imported, but &#163;7,647,000 was in respect to goods not made in Australia. These importations covered carpets, linoleums, and piece goods, such as canvas and duck- </para>

                            <para>- No. Victoria was a protectionist country before the States federated. At Castlemaine and Geelong, the mills were turning out rugs and blankets comparable in quality with the best produced in any other part of the world. The reduction in the weight limit under sub-item f, 1 to 3 oz., has enabled the local industry to make further inroads into the market for the lighter-weight materials previously supplied by overseas manufacturers. The Government feels confident that the rates of duty proposed on woollen goods will enable local manufacturers to secure that proportion of the market for which economic production is possible, and at the same time will not impose an undue burden on the users of those classes of materials for which there is a small demand. </para>

                    <para>The cause of the unemployment that may take place in the industry on occasions has been explained by others; it may be due to changes in shifts ; building operations may cease, and there are frequent staff transferences between sections and factories. For instance, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that a mill in Geelong had not been employing a large number of men formerly engaged, and the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> said that Bond&#39;s mill had dismissed about 150 hands in the knitting section. I point out, however, that another mill not many miles distant from Bond&#39;s - the Lustre Hosiery Works - is working shifts and putting on hands. The fact is that, in the textile industry as in others, management and efficiency must be taken into account. Transfers of labour should not be used as an opportunity to cast a stone at the Ottawa agreement. Generally speaking, unemployment in Australia has diminished, and it is a matter for regret that by a section of the press the Government&#39;s policy should be condemned on unfair and misleading grounds. In conclusion, I would quote the words of the Tariff Board with regard to the future of this industry - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The future extension of the industry will depend, not upon securing still higher duties, but rather upon development in sufficient production in those cloths which can be produced most competitively, leading ultimately to the establishment &#39;of a considerable export trade. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire  to  add my protest  to  that of the Minister regarding the statement made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> about importations of textiles. He claimed that the value of our importations ran into millions, and I am afraid that persons reading that statement in the press may be misled.  It  is well to remember that the import classification &#34; Textiles &#34; includes carpets, linoleums and other floor coverings, cosies, cushions, doyleys, handkerchiefs and serviettes, piece goods, hessian and other jute piece goods, lace for attire, goods of silk or containing silk, velvets, quilts, table covers and towels, &#38;c. &#39; I remind the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the committee is discussing item 105  f  1, which is strictly confined  to  woollen textiles over 3 oz. in weight. The value of the imports of woollen textiles under the item that we are discussing amounted in Australian currency  to  &#163;59,000 for the year 1931-32, as against approximately &#163;4,750,000, which was the value of the goods of local production. The imports were negligible no matter in what form the Deputy Leader of the Opposition presents them, in order  to  make them look formidable.  At  another stage the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition chose the year 1928-29 in analysing the imports into this country. I chose the four years preceding the depression period, and averaged them at 75 per cent. But in the year 1928-29, 50 per cent, of the imports were of goods other than women&#39;s wear. If the honorable member had chosen the year 1926-27, he would have found that only 5 per cent, and in 1927-28 only 10 per cent, of the goods imported were other than women&#39;s light wear. In 1928-29, the total imports had gone down, and the imports of women&#39;s light wear had dropped slightly more in proportion. I think that the fairer way to quote these figures would! be to average them during the four predepression years. </para>

                    <para>I listened with attention to the honorable member hoping that he would makesome retraction in respect of his statement regarding the Ottawa agreement having been responsible for the dismissal of a number of men from a certain mill at Geelong. I understand that he suggested that he had been misreported. If that is the case, it is due to the people of Geelong that the honorable member should say so specifically in this chamber. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> quoted something that I had said, in a way that led me to believe that he thought I had referred to local prices as being unduly high. I do not think that that is so. The reduction of the prices of Australian woollen textiles over the last three or four years has been progressive, and to-day it can be said that they are about 30 per cent, cheaper than they were three or four years ago. That in itself is sufficient to show that they are fairly reasonable. I have gone through typical price lists, and that is the view which I hold. I do not consider that the Australian public is being exploited in the manner suggested by certain honorable members from Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>I was considerably astonished when I heard the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> urge that the reports of the Tariff Board should be rather fuller than is now the case, and that&#39; they should contain more evidence on each side. I feel sure that the honorable member is aware that he can purchase in typescript the full text of the evidence given before the board. If the whole of the evidence were printed, the reports of the board would make bulky volumes, and be of little interest to honorable members. The gist of the evidence is selected and extracted, I think, fairly and without bias. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> referred to the consumption of wool in Australian mills in the year 1930-31.

                    <para>The bogy of exchange approaching parity with sterling has been raised by several speakers. Personally, I cannot see that there is any danger in the situation. There is no hint of any return towards parity ; if anything, the prospects for the next twelve months are possibly in the other direction. I should hot be at all disturbed if sterling came back towards parity, because that very fact would indicate an early return to prosperity, which would mean a much greater purchasing power within Australia, and a larger consumption of woollen textiles than exists at the present time. </para>

The representatives of certain newspapers immediately interviewed a number of mill managers, and published denials of the accuracy of my statement. I received several telegrams, one of which was sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schofield,</inline> the general manager of the Returned Soldiers Mill. It read as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- What I said in regard to Ottawa was identical with- what I said to-night - that twelve days after the conclusion of the Ottawa Conference the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> brought down a tariff schedule which reduced the duty on woollen piece goods, because the Government did not wish those reductions to be directly connected up with Ottawa in Parliament when a later schedule was brought down. I did not say that the dismissals at Geelong were the direct outcome, of Ottawa, although the reductions were made fourteen days after the Ottawa Conference concluded. &#34;I referred to the uncertainty and instability that were caused by interference with the protectionist policy of the last Government, which gave these big manufacturers adequate protection. I said that those manufacturers were witnessing the spectacle of many items being referred to theTariff Board so as to make them conform to the terms of the Ottawa agreement, and that they did not know when the circumstances in their case would be reviewed. I also alleged that big retailers, such as those mentioned by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> to-night, were already placing orders overseas for worsteds and light dress materials, and that Australian manufacturers were not getting the forward orders that they previously received. My statement that 95 men were dismissed at Geelong was absolutely correct, and it was substantiated by those concerned. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> - a freetrader at heart, who is masquerading as a protectionist - will receive his quietus in the Corio electorate at the next federal elections. </para>

May I also say that it is only the country people who are preventing Australia from collapsing, and that, consequently, it is essential that their position shall be studied from every angle. We are anxious to learn the full facts. I consider, therefore, that the Minister might have dealt with the matter in a more courteous fashion. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member may have a gentle voice, but his attacks are none the less subtle on that account. I furnished him with definite information which I am astonished that/ as a wool man, he did not possess. He cast a slur on an Australian secondary industry, and asked in what way the local wool-grower was being assisted. In 1926-27, he said, Australian mills used, 52,000,000 lb. of wool. I admit that those &#39; figures appear in the latest book to which he has access; but I thought that he would have read the reports of the wool companies, which contain later information. According to the honorable member, the weight of wool used in Australia in 1930-31 was 45,000,000 lb. This year the quantity is 250,000 bales, and the wool companies have paid a tribute to those who have purchased it for. having helped to raise the price. The honorable member knows better than I do the weight of a bale of wool. A simple arithmetical calculation will show him that the weight of 250,000 bales is 75,000,000 lb. That quantity, which is more than half as much again as was purchased in the year that he quoted, has been secured in the first eight months of this year. He accuses me of rudeness. It is nothing to the rudeness that is shown to me by some honorable members; but I am not worried by it, because I give the facts. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has asked whether the Government will watch carefully any dumping that may make the present foreign duties ineffective. The Industries Preservation Act empowers the Government to refer such a matter to the Tariff Board for a ruling; but should a quick judgment be necessary, the Government could so load an invoice as to bring the value to a reasonable figure. The trouble is caused by currency depreciation, and it is worldwide. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Corio also asked whether there might be additional classifications, in view of the large number of items produced by the woollen mills. If the manufacturers are able to suggest additional groupings, the matter will be considered. </para>
                    <para>Whatever the party views of honorable members may be, I ask thiem to attempt to co-operate in putting through what is a most comprehensive tariff. If it will not bring about fiscal peace, it will at least let industry know where it stands. Criticism of the carping kind, and attacks of a political or a personal nature, do not assist in the conduct of business. Let us get this immense schedule through as quickly as possible, so that the industrial and commercial community, and the man on the land, may know where they stand. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not consider that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> was justified in-suggesting that the Country party is hostile to secondary industries. I recognize that this secondary industry, the manufacture of woollen textiles, is of great importance to Australia. It gets the best raw materials in the world at its very door, and at the lowest price in the world, and it ought to be successful. Recently I went through one of the Australian woollen mills, and was convinced that it is equipped with up-to-date machinery, and is efficiently conducted, and that throughout the workmanship is of the best. Any complaint of exploitation in regard to prices is not directed against the woollen mills. During my inspection I was careful to ask the prices of the different materials, of fingering wools, and of the cloth used in the various manufactured goods; and I found that compared with similar imported goods, there was not much to complain about. -But by the time these goods pass through the wholesale warehouses of York-street, and then through the retail warehouses and tailors&#39; establishments, a piece of first quality tweed which costs 8s. 3d. a yard at the woollen mills, or 26s. lOd. for a suit length, costs <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 15s. when made into a suit. The excessive charges added to the cost of the material after it leaves the woollen mills tend to reduce the consumption of wool in Australia. The Country party welcomes this small reduction of duties. It is not in favour of imposing duties higher than are necessary to protect even efficient industries. The woollen industry is safe at the proposed rates. They may seem high, but, while there is reasonable competition between the Australian mills and no exploitation of the public, we have not much reason to complain. The Country party is pleased that this secondary industry already employs 12,000 workers, and is expanding, and so long as efficient mills in Australia are in competition, and do not form themselves into combines in order to exploit the public, it does not complain of the industry being granted reasonable protection. </para>

                        <para>. - It was pleasing to hear the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> admit that in this natural secondary industry of manufacturing woollen textiles there is an ever-present market for the wool grown by our primary producers. This is a highly technical industry, involving, .not only the weaving of the wool, but also its spinning, as well as various finishing processes. Those engaged in the trade are not greatly concerned with the reduced duties on suitings, but they are concerned with the duties on ladies&#39; dress materials, for this is a comparatively new departure in Australia. It is a phase of the work which requires a little more protection until greater efficiency has been obtained and the mills are better able to compete with the product of other countries. In matters of dress women are more fastidious than men. Their dress designs change more frequently. Great Britain and continental countries combine to establish fashions, but as we in Australia must more or less anticipate fashions we must have our own I. designers. The failure to realize this in the early days of the industry caused a reaction against the Australian material, because the manufacturers could not supply the desired range of patterns or variety of materials. Obviously, we have not the same market that our competitors have; but that we are. doing well in providing .a wide range of goods, the samples left in the Library by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> give ample evidence. Nevertheless, Australia still falls short of older countries in the range of goods available for selection. It is good to know that there is a prospect of an export trade in these goods, for an extension of the market should tend to widen the range of goods and to reduce prices. The demand for some classes of goods is limited ; the small quantities required necessitate the weaving, of special lengths. In the early stages &#39;of the Australian industry the dyeing of the cloth was not all that could have been desired. Plain materials are generally dyed in the piece when they come off the loom. The dyeing process involves skill in order to obtain an even shade and the necessary finish. Our early efforts in those directions were not highly successful, due largely to the absence of the proper machinery and the necessary experience. Only recently I made representations to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> in regard to the importation of certain machinery required for the dyeing of yarn for cotton piece goods. Dyed cotton yarn costs considerably more than dyed woollen yarn, chiefly because we have not the machinery or the demand necessary to produce it at the required cost. Until this branch of the industry becomes more effective, a higher protection is justified, as was the case in the early days of , the woollen industry. Protection given to this natural secondary industry will help not only one of our great primary industries, but other secondary industries as well. </para>

                        <para>. - The outstanding feature of this debate is the laudatory speeches in regard to the woollen textile industry. I was glad to hear the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> say that it is a valuable secondary industry because of the assistance it renders to one of our great primary industries. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. J. Harrison)</inline> also had a good word to say for it. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> made an interesting speech, with ninetenths of which I heartily agree. The speeches which have been delivered during this debate have contained no word of complaint against the way in which the industry has been conducted. Speakers on both sides of the chamber have admitted that the materials used axe equal to the best imported material, that the prices charged are reasonable, that there is fair internal competition, as well as reasonable competition from overseas, and that the industry has not exploited the public. Yet many honorable members have concluded their speeches by saying that the duties, the imposition of which made it possible for the industry to detvelop, should now be reduced by one-half. Why are men, who by practical experience and searching examination have learned how this industry has developed without exploiting the public, prepared to risk injury to it by a reduction of duties ? </para>

Why should we unnecessarily run the risk of destroying the industry, or even checking its progress? </para>

                            <para>- The duties of 3s. and 2s., which operated for three years, produced those wonderful results to which the honorable member and others have testified. With that protection the industry has grown out of proportion to the development in other industries ; while the quality of materials has improved and the range of patterns has extended, prices hit Ve  been reduced. There has been no suggestion that any danger might lie in the continuance of those helpful duties, yet honorable members are prepared to reduce them by one-half and one-third respectively. What will be the opinion of the people of those districts in which the mills are situated? </para>

                        <para>- The communication referred to on page 10 of the board&#39;s report, asking what rates of duty the board would have considered appropriate if the protection afforded by exchange and primage duty had not been taken into consideration, was a verbal one. The only letter in the matter was alluded to in my speech on the 5th April last when I said that the matter had been referred back to the board for further information as to costs, but the board was not prepared to reopen the case, and I therefore tabled the report. </para>
