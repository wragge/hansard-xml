                        <para>- The wheat confer-, encc yesterday discussed the proposals of the Government for the implementing of the International Wheat Agreement. That conference endorsed the principles underlying the Government&#39;s scheme, but suggested certain variations of it which were readily assented to. The principal variation relates to the method by which export quotas for licensed exporters shall bo fixed. The proposal of the Government, as outlined in this House, was that the allocation of quotas for exporters this year Should be based on the transactions of exporters during the last three years. The conference suggested that the quantity of wheat received by shippers and pools this year should form the basis, the quota to be fixed at the earliest moment when it was ascertained how the wheat was being received by exporters. </para>

The Government is endeavouring to make favorable trade agreements with a number of countries, particularly those like Belgium with which Australia has a favorable balance. It is hoped that when the tariff debate is finalized, negotiations will be entered into with Belgium, as well as with Japan,France, Italy, Norway, and other countries, for agreements which will help the cattle industry as well as other primary and secondary industries. </para>

If a speed of 120 miles or 150 miles an hour were stipulated, Australian pilots would probably be excluded. The Government desires to give those pilots an opportunity to tender for the service. However, when the tenders have been received, that aspect will be considered along with other matters. </para>

                        <para>- This subject is now under consideration in the department. Originally, it was intended to construct a three.-storied building ; but, as the result of representations made, it was thought that it might be advisable to construct a seven-storied building, to cost the same amount of money as the proposed threestoried building, but to face a different direction in the square. A letter has lately been received from Brisbane offering the Government a certain building at a considerably lower price than the estimated cost of the new building, and consideration is now being given to the question whether it would be advisable to purchase this building or proceed with the erection of a new building. It seems to me, at this jiuncture, that the Government is committed to the construction of the new building. </para>

I have since reviewed the official file of correspondence in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department on this subject, and desire to supplement the information then given by my colleague, the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins).</inline> For some time an arrangement has existed between the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments, under &#34;which patients suffering from leprosy in the north-west of Western Australia are admitted to the Darwin Leprosarium for treatment. Payment is made by the State to the Commonwealth for the services so rendered. The Government of Western Australia has entered into a contract with the Port George Mission, near Broome, Western Australia, under which the mission has undertaken to transport patients from that centre to Darwin. </para>

                <para>In July last, when a batch of aboriginal leper patients was about to be transferred from Beagle Bay to the Darwin lazaret in the mission lugger, the Commonwealth navigation authorities pointed out that it was necessary that  a  certificated master be employed, as the journey extended beyond the waters of the State. The Premier of Western Australia asked that the requirements of the Navigation Act be waived to enable the skipper of the mission lugger, who, he stated,  Was  thoroughly competent and experienced but not certificated, to remain in charge of the vessel for the journey from Beagle Bay to Darwin, a distance of 600 miles, in order that the additional cost involved - later stated to be &#163;75 - might be avoided. The Commonwealth Government was unable to see its way to comply with this request. </para>
                <para>Statements that the accommodation and sanitary arrangements were unsuitable came to the notice of the Commonwealth navigation authorities, in  consequence of which clearance of the vessel from Broome was withheld and the reports were communicated to the State Premier, who replied that the Broome harbourmaster considered that the lugger could carry fifteen native passengers comfortably and that it was intended to convey twelve only. In view of the assurance of the State Government that the accommodation was sufficient and suitable, authority for the clearance of the vessel was granted. Some weeks later, in reply to my telegraphic inquiry in regard to reports published in the press that the conditions under which these lepers were being transported had caused adverse comment, the Premier informed me that a committee composed of the manager of the Harbour Department, who happened to be in. Broome, the manager of the Aborigines. Department Native Station, and the Broome harbourmaster, had made an investigation, as a result of which all were satisfied that the boat was seaworthy and not overcrowded. The Premier added that the captain of the vessel, Captain Scott, was also perfectly satisfied with the equipment.. In a letter to me, dated the 12th August, the Premier stated - </para>

The department is also satisfied that it has been made the victim of -a certain section of interests, and that the difficulties and complaints that have been raised have been due, not so much as to the solicitous care for the aboriginal patients as to the fact that the department is pursuing its own policy and transferring these patients to Darwin by means of one of the mission&#39;s luggers. </para>

                        <para>- It is inadvisable that questions relating to the parliamentary staff should be asked in the House. Such inquiries should be made through the Joint House Committee, on which all sections of this House are represented. A meeting of that committee will be held on Thursday of next week. If the honorable member makes his inquiry then, and is not satisfied with the information he obtains, he can bring the matter under notice in the chamber when the parliamentary estimates are being discussed. </para>

                <para class="block">Owing to the limited time at my disposal, I shall be forced to omit a number of details, but I desire to focus the attention of the Government, and the people of Australia, on police matters as affecting native affairs in the Northern Territory. I have received numerous telegrams from settlers in the Gulf of Carpentaria country, beseeching me to request the Government to intercede in order to save them from the natives in the locality who are adopting a threatening attitude. So far the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> has not replied to those telegrams. I shall deal with that later. Honorable members know of the tragic death of Mounted Constable McColl recently at Woodah  Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In the execution of his duty, he was speared through the heart by a native, and other persons in the party escaped death by a mere fraction of an inch, the spears of the natives actually tearing away the _ puggarees from their hats. The survivors of that small, ill-equipped party are lucky to be alive to-day. Those who are in a position to know, attribute the death of Mounted Constable McColl more to the defective ammunition with which the expedition was supplied than to any other cause. The other police in the patrol party were also in the unenviable position of being unable to defend themselves because of the defective ammunition supplied to them in accordance with the suicidal policy of economy followed by the Northern Territory Administration. In other ways, also, the party was badly equipped for the mission on which it was sent. It was not given the services of a sufficient number of native police to carry out the duties expected of it. The expedition asked for twelve policemen, but because of the expense involved, only four were provided. Moreover, the party was split into two sections - a sea party and a land party - against the advice of the patrol officers who knew the country. The land party was forced to take horses - again, contrary to the advice of the officers who knew the country - some of which were police crocks of no value whatever to the expedition, and had to be left by the wayside to perish. The small party had to cart tons of wood to corduroy the tracks to enable the horses to cross over the quagmires and swamps which had to be tra versed. The patrol &#34;foot-slogged&#34; for 300 miles, the horses being more a hindrance than a help. I repeat that all this hardship was due to the Administration having disregarded the protests of the men who were charged with carrying out the mission. The members of the patrol say that the horses supplied to them were about as useless as would be a motor car without petrol, and that because of their horses they had to travel 100 miles to reach an objective only ten miles away. </para>
                <para>The sea section of the patrol was sent out similarly ill-equipped. It put to sea in a crazy craft which was unseaworthy, and consequently the lives of all in it were threatened time after time. Had anything happened to the sea party, the land party which was to meet it at an appointed place on the coast, would have fared even worse than it did. At times the launch nearly foundered; it was incapable, under full pressure, of overtaking a canoe dug out of a tree and paddled by a native. The Administration refused the request of those who were competent to give advice on all matters affecting the expedition. I, therefore, charge it with having displayed gross incompetence and a callous disregard for the lives of the members of the patrol, by ignoring the advice of those who knew the conditions and had to execute this dangerous mission. I charge it with having endangered the lives of all the officers of the patrol, as well as the missioners in this hostile area, and with having caused the death of Constable McColl by failing to despatch a properly equipped expedition. </para>
                <para>The natives in the area in which the murder took place have been responsible for murdering 21 Europeans and Asiatics over a period of years, besides numerous aboriginals belonging to other tribes. Aboriginals of the kind found in the Gulf of Carpentaria country are not found any where else in Australia. They are a mixture of Japanese and Macassars, and combine the cunning of the Japanese with the strength of the Macassar and the barbaric savagery of the wild aboriginal. They are pursuing their fetish of murder far beyond their tribal boundaries. There are now four policemen stationed at Groote Eylandt to protect the missionaries from the onslaughts of the natives. Telegrams which I have received from settlers in the gulf country have informed me that the friendly natives have advised them that the natives belonging to the  Ballamoona  tribe, which murdered Constable McColl, have threatened to wipe out the whole of the members of the police party, as well as the missionaries and settlers in the district. The settlers have pleaded with me to make strong representations to the Government in order to protect the white population, but so far I have npt received any advice of the Government&#39;s intention. </para>

                        <para>- Their numbers are not known, because no white man has ever passed through their country. I say that advisedly. The intention of the natives to destroy the mission, and to kill any police who might be sent against them, was known to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> authorities twelve months ago, but no action was taken. These natives far exceed in cunning and savagery any of the other tribes on the coast. For a long time past, they have been prepared to receive any parties of missionaries or police who may visit the locality. The foreshores in that area are covered with dense scrub, through which the natives have cut tracks so as to entice parties of white men to- walk intoan ambush and be speared. That is what happened to Constable McColl. Knowing these things, however, theauthorities yet allowed the police party to go out with poor equipment, the whole party consisting only of four white police and four native boys. The cunning of the natives may be realized from the fact that they send their  lubras  down to&#34; the foreshore to entice unsuspecting strangers into the jungle where they may be speared. I have here a letter from thebrother of Constable McColl, who was murdered by the blacks. It is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Dealing with the matter of my brother&#39;s death at  Woodah  Island, Gulf of Carpentaria, during August last, I, on behalf of the  whole  of my family (those of the late Albert Stewart McColl), desire yon to bring certain matters connected with the above before the House in order that they might receive attention which wo consider is overdue. I ani aware that my late, brother&#39;s body is still lying&#39; at  Woodah  Island. Our desire in this matter has been made known - that we require his body brought into Darwin without delay. Any hesitation in this matter may mean the dismembering of the body for ceremonial purposes by the natives connected with the murder and finally result in our not being able to locate any of his remains. This is a serious phase of the matter to our family and one that demands prompt action by the police. It appears that certain members of the Northern Territory force are now stationed at Groote Island and we hope that the authorities can make immediate arrangements for their dispatch on this mission. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I would have spared the family the knowledge of what might happen, but, seeing that they are already aware of the fact that the body will probably be exhumed, and the&#39; bones used for ceremonial purposes, there is no reason why I should not mention the matter here. I trust that the Government will take immediate action to fulfil the wishes of the murdered man&#39;s family. </para>
                <para>As I have said, this tribe has been responsible for the murder of 21 outsiders, apart from numerous tribal murders. I should like honorable members to understand what happens when murders of this kind take place. One can visualize the tribe gathered together for a grand corroboree in celebration of the event. Around the warriors are gathered the  lubras  and piccaninnies, and all the pantomime of stalking the victim, culminating in the final act of spearing, is realistically gone through. This stage is greeted with a final yell of triumph that rends the night, and every piccaninny in the tribe who witnesses the spectacle is longing for the time to come when he, too, can emulate the. bravery of his elders. For this reason, the Government should not delay too long action designed to place this tribe under control. </para>
                <para>Now it is intended to send a peace mission to talk matters over with the members of this tribe, and the expedition has the blessing and approval of the Minister. Experienced patrol officers have had the greatest difficulty in travelling through this country in the dry weather, and, as the wet season is now starting, what chance have the members of the peace mission to achieve anything in the same territory after 50 to 60 inches of rain have fallen? The Minister cannot escape responsibility for the disaster which seems likely to befall this unfortunate party, because he has authorized its despatch. </para>
                <para>It is not likely that the mission will be able to inspire confidence in the breasts of the natives ; the memory of the occurrences at the Roper River Mission are too fresh in their minds. At the present time, a police constable is standing his trial on a charge of having ill-treated a native. The authorities say that the law must be vindicated; but they attempt to do so only so long as the accused is not a missioner, or attached to a mission. If he is, the authorities, including those iu Canberra, connive to defeat the ends of justice. That is a strong statement, but I shall give my reasons for making it. A little while ago a committee was set up to inquire into the conduct of the  missioner  who was in charge of the Roper River Mission. The  chairman  was the Reverend Nash, and the other members were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cook.</inline> So revolting was the evidence tendered that it was heard <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> with the exception that Archdeacon Herring, and the secretary of the Church Mission Society, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Long,</inline> were present at the hearing for three days. The evidence included charges of rape, immorality, abortion, and the spreading of venereal disease, and evidently the charges were sustained, because the missioner was relieved of his position. I do not know whether the evidence was for.warded to the Governor-General and the Minister for the Interior, but I know that the findings of the committee reached them. Nevertheless, the whole matter was hushed up, and nothing was made public, nor were criminal proceedings instituted. </para>

                <para>It is a fact that all mention of this vile and brutal treatment of the natives by their reputed protector, who professed to be a. disciple of Christ, was suppressed by the Government, and its action in thus suppressing the truth is interpreted in the north as meaning that it condones the offences. Why is the Government discriminating between Constable Stott, who is standing his trial on the charge of having illtreated a native, and representatives of a mission, against whom similar charges have been made? The missioner concerned is the same man who brought tears to the eyes of southern audiences by relating stories of the brutal treatment to which the. natives were subjected by settlers and others. Afterwards concluding, no doubt, with an invitation to his hearers to pray, but, in  his own mind, spelling the &#39; word &#34; prey &#34;. A settler informant, who knows the facts, has likened this man to a maggot feasting on the festering corpse of Christianity. He is worse than Judas Iscariot, because he would work for half the price. He has violated all the laws of the Church and Slate, yet he is allowed to go scot-free, even though the authorities, including this Government, have been informed of his offences. This is the man who drove husbands away from the mission so that he might rape their wives. He laid false information to the police against natives so that he might be afforded opportunity to indulge in an orgy of immorality. This is a man who had devoted mission  women sent away from the station because they knew of his criminal doings. The women missioners prayed with his his victims that the latter might be spared by this man, who had violated his sacred trust. While this person is protected by the authorities, other alleged offenders have  to  experience the rigour of the law. How can people respect an administration which, for political reasons, covers up guilt? </para>
                <para>I challenge the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> to  lay  on the table of the House all the evidence and findings in connexion with this revolting inquiry. What legal and moral grounds can be advanced for the suppression of this degrading evidence? Why did not the Administration prosecute for this diabolical offence, which was committed in the name of the Church by the senior officer of the mission? Knowing these facts, I plead with the Government not to sanction the peace expedition until such  time  as the mission has rehabilitated itself in the eyes of the natives whom it has betrayed, shown that it is not established for immoral purposes, restored its name,  and  expiated the shameful conduct of its superintendent. It will be the duty of  the Government  to protect the mission  from  the rightful revenge of an outraged people. Let the patrol teach the natives  that  all white men are not evil, that the Government will protect them against  the  fiendish immorality to which they  have  been subjected, that the white man&#39;s law must he respected by them, and also that the Government will protect white settlers against atrocities by aborigines. <inline font-style="italic">&#91; Leave to continue given.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -  I listened with interest to the remarks of the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson),</inline> who has a wide knowledge of North Australia affairs, and always puts his case fairly and squarely before the House. The matter to which he has directed attention has received the serious consideration of the Government, and the best advice available as to the wisest steps to take in connexion with the unfortunate killing of Constable McColl has been obtained. In September, 1932, five Japanese resident in the Northern Territory were murdered by aborigines in Caledon Bay. The Japanese were engaged in trepang fishing; but whether they were carrying out those operations legally or otherwise, I am at present unable to say. About the time of the murder, the district in which the tragedy occurred was declared a special reserve for the aborigines, and in consequence of the atrocity the authorities in Darwin despatched an expedition consisting of three or four police officers, who were armed in the same way as were thetroopers who followed them later. They returned to Darwin without having arrested the murderers, but they made no complaint regarding their ammunition and equipment, or as to the strength of their party. They returned merely&#39; for further supplies, and later they set out again for the scene of the atrocity. If these police officers had any complaint to make regarding their equipment, one would naturally think that they would have made it known upon their return. In June, 1933, at the end of the wet season, they continued their search for the murderers. Their number was, probably, augmented by one or two others, and they also had the &#39;assistance of a number of aborigines. It is unfortunate that the party was divided when contact was made with the blacks, and Constable McColl  was speared. Evidence appears to be forthcoming regarding Constable McColl&#39;s weapon having misfired, because I believe that when his revolver was found it was noted that the cap of a cartridge had been struck by the pin of the weapon but had not been exploded. Yet no complaint was made that the party was too small, or that it was improperly equipped. Of course, it had to take the risk of attack by the natives, because it was searching in jungle country. One or two policemen have told me that the size of the party was ample, it is sheer ill fortune that Constable McColl was not sufficiently experienced in bush life in the Northern Territory to avoid being separated from his companions. The practice adopted in this case was not different from that followed on previous occasions. It must be admitted that, having to go in search of wild natives in scrub country, the members of the expedition took their lives in their hands. </para>

                <para>The Administration at Darwin considered that it should send out a bigger expedition, and it then proposed to equip a party of twelve or thirteen white men,, assisted by a similar number of natives. A communication to that effect -was sent to me at Canberra, and the department was asked to forward a further supply of ammunition for the purposes of the expedition; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> the secretary of the department, was then leaving Canberra for Darwin, I requested the Administration not&#39; to despatch the party until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> had arrived and considered the matter on the spot. In the meantime we sent the ammunition *and supplies asked for, so that if it were considered necessary to despatch the party, no delay would occur. When the press was advised of the proposal, it immediately announced that a punitive expedition was to be sent. No such expedition was ever contemplated by the Government. Refutation of the suggestion that a punitive party was being organized was repeatedly denied, and I think that honorable members will agree that in this matter the press blundered in not accepting the Government&#39;s assurance. Careful inquiries were made by the department as to the best course to follow, and in the meantime the missionaries in various parts of the Northern Territory, and former missionaries in other parts of Australia, suggested that a peaceful expedition be sent to Caledon Bay. It was. said that a few missionaries could best undertake the task. A police constable who had lived in the Northern Territory for 20 or 30 years declared that he was prepared to go alone. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly would not have been foolish enough to undertake it. An outcry was raised throughout the Commonwealth, and the press rendered good service, in that it directed public attention to affairs in the Northern Territory. Most people were surprised to know that in that part of Australia are large numbers of aborigines. The Government has received advice from all directions. Many missionaries wrote to the newspapers on the subject, and the following proposal was submitted to the Government by the Victorian branch of the Church Missionary Society - </para>

                <para class="block">The suggestion was strongly supported by the Rev. H. E. Warren, who interviewed me in Melbourne. I did not give an immediate answer to the project, pre- ~ferring to make inquiries concerning the capabilities of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren.</inline> I discovered that he had been instrumental in founding the Groote Eylandt Mission Station, and had had considerable experience of the Caledon Bay aborigines, and that, in every respect, he was a most reliable and experienced man. At  the time when the Groote Eylandt Mission was established, the aborigines thereabouts were just as savage as they are at present at Caledon Bay, but, as a result of contact with the mission station, they have become tractable and friendly. </para>
                <para>The Government has accepted the proposal of the Victorian branch of the Church Missionary Society, &#34;with certain qualifications. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dyett,</inline> a capable man who has had a long experience of native affairs in the Territory and probably possesses a greater knowledge of the Caledon Bay tribes than does any resident of Darwin, declared that the mission would be successful and offered to accompany <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Warren.</inline> The two men were eager to proceed to Caledon Bay immediately, but the Government suggested that it would be advisable to postpone the trip until after the wet season. The Government also kept in mind the fact that &#34;the blacks in the neighbourhood are flushed with their recent victory, and, therefore, are in a more dangerous mood than they will be after a couple of months have elapsed. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that presently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dyett</inline> declared that they were so familiar with conditions in the territory that the wet season would not interfere in any way with their plans, and that they would set off, provided the Government gave them the necessary permission. They also indicated that they did not want financial assistance from the Government, but would undertake the task as part of their mission work. It has been said by some that if the Government were to send an armed police expedition, blood would be shed, and it is claimed by others that if the peace expedition goes to the territory, blood will also be spilled. In each case, apparently, . the blood&#39; will be upon my head. As I desire to have as little bloodshed as possible, I approve of the sending of the missionary party. </para>

                <para>Undoubtedly, the incident is a regrettable one. As the honorable member has pointed out, there have been no fewer than twenty murders in the territory during the last few years. Consequently, the Government cannot remain idle. But, despite the protestations of the honorable member, I remind him that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> C. Brown has just visited the Northern Territory and made exhaustive inquiries in respect to this matter, as a result of which he advises that it would meet the wishes of the majority of the people of Darwin and accomplish what the Government desires if the peace expedition were allowed to proceed. </para>
                <para>The honorable member has said that settlers have been threatened by the aborigines. Admittedly, settlers at Groote Eylandt have been threatened, but when the Government sent a party to safeguard them its action was condemned. On looking through the departmental files, I find that, twenty years ago, the natives of Caledon- Bay made an attack on settlers at Groote Eylandt, and what  happened  then can be repeated to-day. The missionaries at Groote Eylandt have protested that the mission needs no protection; that when they undertook mission work, they were prepared to risk their lives. Despite their protests, the Government considers it wise to take the precautionary measure of sending a protection party to the island. Because of their victories, the natives arc in high feather. In addition to killing Constable McColl, they have captured abandoned supplies which belonged to the white man. Their appetites are whetted for further victories. The Government realizes the seriousness of the position, but it is confident that these two experienced men will do nothing foolhardy. They go at their own risk, and I admire them tremendously for their courage. The expedition proposes to leave Sydney on the 6th of this month, and in order that the two men concerned may know the opinion of the Government, they will be enlightened regarding the details of this debate.  They go  with their eyes open, and with the blessing of the mission and the Government. </para>
                <para>As the honorable -member for the Northern Territory has pointed out, the matter of the Roper River Mission is most serious. My department received certain reports regarding happenings at the mission, as a result of which it appointed a board of inquiry to make investigations and report on the general management and operations of that institution. The board consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> T. Ashe, Crown Law Officer for the Northern Territory, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cecil</inline> Cook, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Protector of Aborigines ; but when the Church Missionary Society asked that it also should be represented, the Reverend C. H. Nash was added. Inquiries were made, and as the result a report was furnished to the Government, but it is not of so dreadful a character as the honorable member would make out. I do not say that it is a creditable report, but it. is doubtful whether we could take criminal action against the person concerned. The Government has been advised by the Attorney-General, who has seen the report, that the case is not one for criminal prosecution. </para>

                        <para>- The charges are so serious that they cannot be allowed to rest, and a further inquiry will be made into the matter. I have already shown that one charge of the honorable member - that this man was suspended as the result of the investigation of the committee of inquiry - is incorrect. We have decided to treat the report as confidential. The committee made certain other recommendations but they do not involve the closing down of the mission at all. The mission has done good work in the past, and I hope that it will continue to do good work in the future. The missionaries who have practically taken their lives in their hands in order to try to make terms with the natives belong to this mission. </para>

Although careful investigations were made, no trace of the women could be discovered, but a feeling persists throughout the country that they are still with the blacks. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> has stated that neither he nor the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has seen the evi deuce which was submitted to the committee .of inquiry, and that he is acting on certain decisions contained in this report. If, as the honorable member for the Northern Territory alleges, the evidence discloses a serious state of affairs, the Government should not hesitate to appoint a committee to investigate his charges. I was glad to hear the Minister say that the man concerned was not suspended as a result of the investigations of the committee of inquiry. I know something of the value of mission work, particularly in the Northern Territory. I trust that the Minister will take early action to test the charges of the honorable member for the Northern Territory, so as to prevent any repetition of the delay that took place in respect of the inquiry into the loss of the <inline font-style="italic">Douglas Mawson.</inline> I do not believe that those women, ever reached land after the boat foundered; iu fact, escape would be impossible, because of the waters in those parts being infested with sharks.

                        have been to Darwin twice. .1 know a good deal of the work of missions, especially in the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands, and I have nothing but admiration for them. The honorable member foi1 the Northern Territory
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline>
                        has made serious allegations against a man named Langford Smith, who is clothed in the garb of religion, and the Government should not hesitate to take action to investigate them. Some time ago, a native named Neighbor, with three companions, robbed a house in order to obtain food. They were captured by a. constable, chained together, and were proceeding on their way to Darwin. They came to a flooded creek, and the policeman, when endeavouring to cross it,- was thrown from his horse, and rendered senseless by a kick on the head from the horse&#39;s hoof. Neighbor managed to free himself from the chains, dived into the creek, rescued the policeman, and brought him ashore. None of the other natives tried to run away. As the result of the efforts of a
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Bon,</inline>
                        with whom I was glad to be associated, Neighbor was awarded the King&#39;s Gold Medal. The authorities in Darwin, did not give that aborigine a dog&#39;s chance. They had him photographed, wearing the medal which had been presented to him. The photograph and medal may be seen among the collection of historical and other records in the basement of this building. They took no interest whatever in his welfare, aud afterwards allowed him to drift away.&#39; Subsequently, Judge Ewing, of Tasmania, was appointed a commissioner to inquire into charges in regard to the general administration of the Northern Territory. A lady named
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Perau</inline>
                        admitted on oath that she had shot a man, and stated further that she was subjected to a great deal of annoyance by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline>
                        the Administrator, who had police watching her movements. All the evidence taken in connexion with that matter was suppressed by the Administration, and is now hidden in the archives of this Parliament. If all that has been said about
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langford</inline>
                        Smith, formerly known as the Reverend Langford Smith, is true, lie must be a sexual maniac, and should be sterilized. All such men ought to be shot. I thank the honorable member for the Northern Territory for having brought up this matter for discussion this afternoon; and I hope that the Minister, whose sincerity is undoubted, will do all that- lies in his power to remove this stigma from the escutcheon of Australia. I am sure that, all honorable members will support, him in any action which he may consider necessary to have the charges cleared up.

                    <para>.- I emphasize the very serious nature of the charges made this afternoon by the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> with reference to certain phases of administration and mission activities. The position cannot possibly be allowed to rest where it is. The charges call for a thorough investigation in order to clear the good name of all mission workers. The honorable member for Northern Territory says that he is in a position to indicate exactly the nature of the horrifying experiences detailed by him this afternoon. For my part, as a representative of the people, I shall not be satisfied, until the charges  made have been thoroughly investigated, because they must affect the future of all mission work, and the claim of missioners for the right to go into the remote areas of Australia to render Christian services to the aborigines. It has been stated that the man concerned has not been removed from his present position in the mission. Because of the serious nature of the allegations it is imperative that the fullest inquiry should be made in the interests not only of the mission, but also of the man concerned. The good name of Australia and of the mission is at stake.We must, at the earliest, opportunity, be informed definitely whether or not there is any truth in the charges, If they are proved, definite action should be taken against any person or persons guilty of such revolting conduct. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> will agree to a reconsideration of the duty on this sub-item, because I feel sure that, if the Senate&#39;s requested amendment is accepted, we shall do a great injustice to a deserving Australian industry. I, therefore, urge that the item be referred back to the Tariff Board for further investigation. In the 1921-28 tariff the rates of duty were &#163;4 a ton British, and &#163;5 10s. a ton general. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">When I was Minister for Trade and Customs I increased the British rate to &#163;5 a ton, and the general rate to &#163;6 10s. a ton, because I believed that the industry had put up a good case for a greater margin of protection. I am informed that 90 per cent. of the trade is in sulphate of alumina, which is alumina combined with sulphuric acid, and is used mainly for water purification and the manufacture of paper. The rates imposed by the Scullin Government were recommended by the Tariff Board in 1926 after a searching inquiry into the industry. That rate was passed by the House of Representatives on the recommendation of the present Minister when the tariff was before us early this year. The Minister then said that a number of items in the schedule would, from time to time, be investigated by the board.I presume this is one of those that were referred back to the board for reconsideration, following the adoption of the Ottawa agreement. When this item was before the Senate, that chamber, on the recommendation of Senate Ministers, adopted the board&#39;s recommendation made this year, to remove the fixed rates of duty, aud substitute ad valorem rates of 50 per cent. British, aud 70 per cent. general. The protection was thereby reduced from &#163;5 to &#163;3 a ton; and it will be further reduced to &#163;2 14s.10d. a ton by the application of the exchange adjustment provisions. The matter caused honorable senators some concern, and at the request of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in that chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Halloran),</inline> the item was recommitted for further consideration. The representative of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> undertook that the whole question would be reconsidered by the Tariff Board before it was dealt with in this chamber. Four months have since elapsed, yet Australian manufacturers have not been given the opportunity to present additional evidence to the Tariff Board. </para>

Prior to the establishment of this industry in Australia, as much as &#163;40 per ton had been charged for imported material. As the local manufacturer has always charged a fair price, the paper mills have reciprocated by dealing locally, despite the fact that at times they could have bought cheaper overseas. </para>

Since 1920 there have been big developments in this sphere, and Sulphates Proprietary Limited assisted in the formation of a subsidiary engineering company, which specializes in water problems. This company has erected the following filtration plants during the period under review: - </para>

                    <para class="block">I stress the point that the reduction of the protection from &#163;5 to &#163;2 14s.10d. a ton makes it lower by 25s. a ton than that granted under the Massy-Greene tariff of 1921. </para>
                    <para>The committee probably wishes to know whether the protection recommended by the Tariff Board, and&#39; adopted by the Government is adequate. I have a comparative  statement of production  costs in Great Britain and Australia.  It  shows that the price ex-wharf  in  Australia of sulphate of alumina  produced  by a British factory with an output  of  5,000 tons per annum - which  I  am assured is a small factory - will  be  &#163;13 3s. 4d. a ton under the proposed reduced duty, compared with &#163;14 16s. for the Australian product. Therefore, the protection suggested by the Minister on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, will be inadequate, and a great disservice will be done to an  industry which has  reduced prices, increased its efficiency, and brought local authorities  to a realization  of the importance of the purification of water supplies. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, they do not. The demand for this product has been greatly increased as the result of its availability at short notice, improved methods of handling, the reduction of the price of equipment, and the technical advice that has been given by experts to municipalities throughout Australia. It will not be long before the Australian manufacturers will be able to raise their output to 5,000 tons per annum. When that stage is reached, I believe that they will welcome further consideration of the matter by the Tariff Board. They do not want a higher duty than is adequate to protect the industry to-day. The figures that I have quoted show that the importer can land sulphate of alumina at a price &#163;1 12s. a ton cheaper than that at which the local manufacturer can produce it profitably.No water supply department or municipality in Australia hasobjected that the price of the commodityis too high. I could quote a large number of communications from such bodies expressing complete approval of the efficiency of the industry and of the reasonableness of the price charged. Sulphates Proprietary Limited, and its subsidiary company, have made available technical adviceof considerable value, and have thus rendered service of a higher standard than can be given by importing interests. </para>

                    <para>Let us examine what the local industry has done for the Australian users of this product. It was established at the end of 1918, and in 1919 commenced supplying sulphate of alumina at &#163;19 10s. a ton. Its only customer at that time was a paper-mill; it was not in a position to meet the whole of the Australian demand. There was then no duty. In 1920, the Brisbane Water Board paid &#163;29 15s. a ton for sulphate of. alumina, the price in Great Britain being &#163;14 a ton, or less than one-half of what was charged in Australia by importing agents. In 1921 .tup Brisbane Water Board paid &#163;28 a ton, and in 1922, approximately &#163;25 15s. a ton. In .the latter year the price in England was &#163;12 10s. a ton. Late in 1921, a duty of &#163;4 a ton had been imposed, but supplies had already been obtained from overseas at the price that I have given. The Australian industry was not yet in a position to supply the whole of the market. Early in 1924, the Brisbane Water Board paid &#163;22 10s. a ton for imported sulphate of alumina. In that year the Australian company made its first sale to that body at &#163;16 a ton. delivered at Brisbane. What was the result? The price of the imported product was immediately dropped to &#163;13 10s. a. ton, a. reduction of almost 50 per cent., to meet the Australian competition. That proves that Australian users of -sulphate of alumina had previously been fleeced, and that they benefited greatly from the establishment of the local industry. From 1925 to 1928, the Brisbane Water Board used the Australian product exclusively, the price charged being &#163;15 10s. a ton. It was thus prepared to give a preference of &#163;2 a ton so that the Australian industry, which had been responsible for the reduction of the price, might be supported and maintained. In 1929, the board bought a consignment of English sulphate of alumina for &#163;12 5s. a ton, but, owing&#39; to representations made to it that the local industry would not be able to carry on operations &#34;without substantial support in Australia, it agreed to purchase future requirements from the Australian manufacturers for &#163;14 10s. a ton. During 1931, 1932, and 1933, the Australian company has sold to the board a &#39;special sulphate for &#163;13 10s. a ton. Its. competition in this product </para>

                <para class="block">I direct the attention of honorable members to the difference between the price of the imported sulphate of alumina and the locally-manufactured product. The local industry is thoroughly efficient, and as it is not exploiting the public, it should be protected. If the company were shelter ing behind a high tariff and exploiting the public, the Government would be justified in reducing the duty; but that, is not the case. It is illuminating to note that, although alumina ferric could be landed in Australia in 1930-31 for &#163;.1.2 10s. a ton, including all charges, the sole Australian agent was charging a country water hoard &#163;25 a ton for it, or 100 per cent. on landed cost. A good deal is said at, times about the necessity for throwing a searchlight on the operations of manufacturers. It will be seen from whatI have said that a searchlight should also be thrown on the operations of some importers, who have been fleecing the public. The Australian-made chemical carried a profit of only 15 per cent. to the manufacturers when it was being supplied for &#163;15 10s. a ton ex works. In 1926, the Australian company guaranteed that the price would not go beyond &#163;15 10s. a ton ex works. It has not only carried out, that undertaking, but&#39; has also improved the product, by making it in a concentrated form, so that less is required. This improvement is equivalent to a reduction in price of &#163;3 a ton. </para>
                <para>This item should be referred back to the Tariff Board because the board has made several serious errors. There is an error, for instance, in the board&#39;s table of landing costs on page 7 of its report. Freight has been assessed by the board on a basis of one ton of 40 cubic feet at 45s. a ton, whereas freight can be obtained on heavy chemicals at 32s. 6d. a ton, as the following letter indicates: - </para>

                <para class="block">That freight would apply to all heavy chemicals, such as sulphate of alumina, as it does in the case of Australian coastal freights. Another serious error in the board&#39;s report relates to the manner in which this chemical is imported. The board appears to have accepted the statement of a representative of the British manufacturers, that all sulphate of alumina, including alumina ferric, comes to Australia in drums, which occupy 57 cubic feet 9 cubic inches to the ton weight, whereas the fact is that commercial sulphate of alumina, which accounts for 90 per cent. of the Australian market, would be imported in sacks, occupying 40 cubic feet to the ton. The result of these two errors is that, whereas the Tariff Board states that freight and insurance would amount to &#163;3 6s. 9d. a ton, the true figure would be only &#163;1 15s. 6d. a ton, a difference of &#163;111s. 3d. a ton. In view of these very serious errors, the whole subject should be referred back to the board for further consideration. </para>
                <para>Another factor that should be considered in connexion with this industry is that the Australian manufacturers of sulphate of alumina are helping water boards and other users of waterpurification equipment to obtain efiicient and cheap plant. For instance, chemical feeders are being sold to-day at &#163;13 10s. each whereas on the 20th July last, similar overseas feeders cost &#163;46 10s. at par and could not be landed here for less than &#163;70 each. Fifteen locally manufactured feeders have recently been sold to the Public Works Department of New South Wales. Chlorinators, which are essential for sterilizing water supplies of towns, public baths, butter factories and other enterprises, are being manufactured and sold in Australia for less than the ruling price of similar equipment in Britain, and America. </para>
                <para>For these reasons, I sincerely trust that this item will be referred back to the Tariff Board. If a suitable amendment of that nature is moved, I shall be glad to support it, though I do not desire to move it in my capacity as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. I have made a persoual investigation into the circumstances of this industry, and am satisfied that it is thoroughly deserving of assistance. </para>

                        <para>.- Under this item it is proposed to replace a specific duty of &#163;5  a  ton British  and  &#163;6 10s.  a ton  foreign by ad valorem  duties  of 50 per cent. British and 70  per  cent, foreign. The Deputy Leader  of the  Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Forde)</inline> told  the com  mittee that a duty of 50 per cent, ou British importations of sulphate of alumina will mean a reduction of the British duty to &#163;3 a ton, which, after allowing for exchange adjustment, would be further reduced to &#163;2 16s. a &#39;ton. At the same time, he said that the price of this commodity is about &#163;14 a ton. I cannot understand how a duty of 50 per cent, is equal to &#163;3 a ton. He also said that the proposed duty  i3  20s. a <inline font-style="italic">ton</inline> less than the duty imposed under the 1921-30 tariff. The party to which I belong is sometimes inaccurately described as the low tariff or freetrade party, but the fiscal policy which we support is that of adequate protection for sound Australian industries. The Tariff Board is a better guide to the committee than the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement of a company directly concerned in the manufacture of this product. I know nothing of the industry; but it is not worthy of protection, I submit, if an ad valorem duty of 50 per cent. British and 70 per cent, foreign is insufficient. The  Deputy.  Leader of the Opposition said that, after the local industry became established, there was a sudden drop in the price of the imported article. If that is so, I say, &#34; All success to the local industry &#34;. In many cases beneficial results have followed the establishment of Australian industries; but, if those controlling them are exploiting the consumers, they must expect to receive the same treatment as importers who are alleged to be guilty of similar practices. The Ottawa agreement provides that Australian manufacturers must expect reasonable competition in the production of many commodities. I am not familiar with the articles mentioned in this item, and I have no knowledge of those concerned in their manufacture, but the committee will agree that the duties recommended by the Tariff Board are liberal, and the local industry should be &#34;satisfied with them. </para>

                        <para>.- The Tariff Board states that in England there has been a progressive decline in the cost of alum and. sulphate of alumina. From 1925 to 1932, the price of alum has been reduced from &#163;10 10s. to &#163;8 10s. a ton, and that of sulphate of alumina from &#163;8 5s. to &#163;6 15s. a ton. These reductions are due largely to economic causes, and not to the  conditions obtaining in Australia. It is necessary to refer to only one paragraph of the Tariff Board&#39;s report to justify its recommendation that the duty should be reduced. from &#163;5 a ton British to an ad valorem rate of 50 per cent. When reference is made to the price of alum it should be to the price paid in England, and not to that which the people . of Australia pay for alum imported from England. It is quite misleading to make the comparison with the price of English goods after they have been shipped to Australia and subjected to certain charges. The Tariff Board shows that the price of powdered alum f.o.b.  England  is. &#163;9 13s. 3d. a ton, while the cost landed in Australia is &#163;23 3s. 4d. It is absurd to take the Australian cost as a basis for comparison. </para>

                            <para>- We are now considering the duty which should be placed on this material, so that the Australian industry may operate under fair conditions. In order that we may decide what is a fair duty we must compare the price in Australia with the price of similar goods in other countries, such as England. Usually, the English prices are quoted f.o.b., and the Australian prices at the works, thus giving an advantage to the Australian-made article. In order to get a proper comparison the English prices should be written down a little. Powdered alum in England costs &#163;9 13s. 3d. a ton, compared with &#163;16 in Australia. The respective prices of alum in the lump are &#163;8 15s. and &#163;16. If both quotations were on an f.o.b. basis, the Australian price would be about double the English price. Sulphate of alumina is quoted at &#163;7 10s. 9d. a ton f.o.b. English ports ; the Australian price  is &#163;14 16s. a- ton. These comparisons show that the people of Australia are being charged unduly high prices for alum and sulphate of alumina. I do not- know, whether the reason is exploitation by Australian manufacturers, in-  efficiency in Australian factories, or the possibility of the Australian industry being too small to be carried on economically. Whatever the cause, the fact remains that the people of Australia pay nearly double the English price. Having investigated this matter thoroughly, the Tariff Board recommended a margin of 50 per cent, ad valorem. That should be sufficient. in&#39; view of the added protection afforded by freight, insurance, primage, landing coStS, cartage, and other charges, amounting to &#163;S 10s. a ton. If the Australian industry cannot, carry on with that measure of protection, it. should go out of existence. I support the Senate&#39;s request that the* duties be 50 per cent. British and 70 per cent, general. </para>

                        <para>. - When the manufacture of sulphate was commenced in Australia some years ago, the price of this commodity immediately dropped by nearly &#163;10 a ton. Those of us who have watched the operations of manufacturers and importers for a number of years know that if this- Australian industry is destroyed by outside competition, overseas manufacturers will levy toll on Australian consumers. They have done so before. It is well known that as the output of a factory increases, so its overhead charges are proportionately reduced. An increased output from this Australian factory would soon lead to the price being reduced to about &#163;10 a ton. The statement of the Kyabram Water Trust, which was read by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> is evidence of the valuable service rendered by the Australian manufacturers of this commodity. The company&#39;s experts travel throughout the country, and arc available at short notice to give advice to water trusts and other bodies for the purification of their water supplies in the interests of the health of - the people. It may not be generally known that one of the difficulties associated with the manufacture of butter in some parts of Australia is that of the water supply. In order that Australian butter may have,-* a chance of competing with the product&#39; of other countries in the world&#39;s markets, some of our country water supplies have to- be treated. Previously, expensive filtration processes were employed to purify and clarify the water. Sulphate is also used extensively in the purification of water used in the manufacture of paper, but I see no evidence that the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Tariff Board called any paper manufac turer before it as&#39; a witness. The board&#39;s report does not contain any evidence by paper manufacturers that the Australian manufacturers of sulphate have charged exorbitant prices for their product. On the other hand, there is voluminous testimony that they have rendered valuable service to the community. The experience of the authorities controlling the water supply of Brisbane is of interest. The torrential rains which fall on the watershed of the Brisbane water supplies sometimes discolour the water, and make treatment necessary. Before the Australian manufacture of sulphate of alumina was commenced, the authorities at Brisbane paid about &#163;9 a ton more for the purifying material than they did after the Australian&#39; competitor entered the field. Moreover, the authorities found that they  could  obtain from the Australian manufacturers advice which they could not get from importers. Thai, fact, together with the certainty of getting regular supplies of sulphate of alumina of good quality from Australian factories, led to their deciding to use the locally-produced material. In order that the Tariff Board may call further witnesses in support of the claims of this Australian industry, I move - </para>
                    <para>That the item he postponed. </para>
                    <para class="block">The  chairman  of directors of the Australian company which manufactures this material informed me recently that for many years- the company made no profits at, all, and that its profits now are duly about 5 per cent. It is therefore clear that the company has not dipped its hands into the pockets of the consumers in order to make huge profits. I hope that the Minister will agree to the postponement of the consideration of this item pendinga fuller investigation by the Tariff Board. Even if the price were considerably higher, the services rendered would  be worth the extra cost. Butter is an important item of primary produce, and we should do everything in our power to (insure that- the best quality of butter is produced, both for home consumption and for export. I appeal to members of the Country party, and to -the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcnicoll)</inline> in particular, to agree that the Tariff Board be given another opportunity to investigate the position. If, after taking all the available evidence, it is still of its present opinion, I shall be prepared to. accept its verdict. </para>

It is open to honorable members to vote against that motion, but it is also open to them to move an amendment &#34; that the bill be read this day six months &#34;. When we arc considering a tariff item, it is surely competent for an honorable member to move that consideration of an item be postponed. Indeed, the Minister frequently moves to that effect. As to whether the precise wording of the honorable member&#39;s amendment is in order. I do not know, but if it is not, the matter can -easily be adjusted. The honorable member for Maribymong said that his reason for moving the amendment was to enable the Tariff Board to inquire further into the matter. Whether that concerns the Chair or not is a matter for the Chair to deter- mine, hut I suggest that any honorable member may move that a debate on any item be adjourned, or thai an item be postponed. </para>

                        <para>- It is obvious that that course might be followed, but it does not concern the point of order which has been raised. In an ordinary tariff debate, items are brought up for consideration one at a time, and it is competent for the Minister, or for a member, to move that an item be postponed. We are now dealing, however, with a request from the Senate relating to a tariff item, and every such request from the Senate must be dealt with on a motion moved in committee. Thecommittee is now considering a motion which the Minister has moved, &#34; that the requested amendment be made &#34;. No tariff item is before the committee at the present moment. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know under what Standing Order the committee is deprived of the right to decide for itself whether it shall or shall not come to an immediate decision on any motion before it, whether that motion be for the acceptance of a request from the Senate, or for any other purpose. The business of the committee is in its own hands, and there is no standing order providing that it must here and now dispose of a request from the Senate because the Minister has moved that it shall do so. The honorable member for Maribyrnong has advanced reasons why further consideration should be given to this item, and why the matter should be referred once more to the Tariff Board. Surely it is competent for any member of the committee to move that the debate on the Minister&#39;s motion be adjourned, or that the item be postponed. </para>

                        <para>.- This duty has been twice considered by the Tariff Board, but if every item were dealt with in that way, an inordinately long time would be occupied in disposing of the tariff schedule. The principals of this company waited upon me, and. I referred their request to the board. The only points raised by them were effectively replied to, and nothing new has emerged during the present debate. If the amend mont is carried, the matter will be referred back to the board, but the Government cannot accept the amendment. Today we have heard complaints about the delay of the board in dealing with cotton yarn andoregon. It is hardly fair that industries that have had two hearings should be given a third chance. </para>

                        <para>. - I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It is true that the claims of this industry were considered by the Tariff Board in 1926, and the duties which were imposed when I was Minister for Trade and Customs were then recommended. When the rates were reconsidered in the light of the Ottawa agreement, the board suggested a drastic reduction of the protection given to the industry. The company asked the Minister to have the matter further considered, but the board did not conduct the usual public inquiry, at which the company would have had an opportunity to rebut some of the alleged misleading statements made by its competitors, the importers. Personally, I should like the old rate to be approved by the committee; but the policy of the present Government is to accept the board&#39;s recommendations, and that course was adv.ocated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> The Minister quoted from a statement made by the board regarding the freight on sulphate of alumina from England to Australia, and, in reply to an interjection by me, said that the figures were based on. information dated the 10th March last. Four months have elapsed since then, and further reductions of freight may have occurred. If further inquiries were made, possibly the freight quoted as ruling on the 3rd March for soda ash, another heavy chemical, would be found to apply also to sulphate of alumina. The odour of these chemicals does not affect the freight charges, because the goods are not deleterious. Cheaper freight is obtainable from some of the shipping companies to-day than six or eight months ago, and I believe that if the importers asked for lower freight charges fhan those quoted on the 10th March last, on which the board based its recommendation, the request would be granted. The members of the Tariff Board, as reasonable men, would surely be prepared to reconsider all the. facts, and give the representatives of this Australian factory an opportunity to place before them the latest infprmation regarding freightcharges. The company has reduced prices by 50 per cent., and it is giving excellent service to the community. Its technical advice is available to local authorities, such as water boards, and to butter factories. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Senate&#39;s request is based on a recommendation of the Tariff Board contained in its report dated the 12th May, 1933. If adopted, the only alteration which the request will make to the item is to increase the duty on spirituous toilet preparations by ls. a gallon for every 20 per cent. spirit content or fraction of 20 per cent. </para>
                    <para>In. recommending this increase, the board points out that at the present time importers of toilet preparations which contain, say, 100 per cent. proof spirit, pay extra duty on the spirit content of 20s. a proof gallon, British preferential tariff, while local manufacturers of toilet preparations, who do not use a prescribed proportion of Australian products, such, for example) as essential oils, have to pay excise duty on the spirit used at the rate of 25s. a gallon. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> Thus the local manufacturer&#39;s ad valorem protection is reduced by the equivalent of 5s. a proof gallon. The board&#39;s recommendation for an increase of the spirit content rate on imported toilet preparations will overcome this anomaly. Local manufacturers whouse a prescribed quantity of Australian raw materials for example, essential oils, will have a. further protection as the result of paying less excise, duty on Australian spirit used. The board has recommended ad valorem rates of British 45 per cent. and general 65 per cent., which are 5 per cent., general tariff, lower than those prescribed in the bill. The Australian delegation at Ottawa undertook to maintain a margin of preference of 25 per cent. ad valorem, hence the retention of the rate of 70 per cent. under the general tariff. </para>

                    <para>- It is so seldom that the Tariff Board recommends an increase of duty that one cannot help feeling that one did the right thing, when Minister for Trade and Customs, in imposing a total prohibition against the import of all toilet preparations. As a result of that prohibition Australian manufacturers were given an opportunity to develop the local industry, and they have obtained additional capital and increased the number of their employees. The interesting speech of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy)</inline> indicates that as the result of the prohibition 300 additional persons have been employed in one factory, and hundreds in another. At a time when the almost general practice of the Tariff Board is to make recommendations in a downward direction it is a consolation, even if the case is an isolated one, to deal with a recommendation for an increased duty. The results in this case certainly justify the policy of the Scullin Government in giving protection to Australian industries, as a result of which additional employment has been given to our workers and prices have been reduced to consumers. </para>

                    <para class="block">The previous Government increased the duties by 25 per cent. British and 30 per cent. general, and also provided alternative fixed rates of1s. 3d. and1s. 6d. a dozen on file and chisel handles and 4s.6d. and 7s. 6d. a dozen on other handles. The ad valorem rates contained in the request are 5 per cent. British and 10 per cent. general higher than the 1921-30 tariff, under which no fixed rates operated. The Australian manufacturers have been gradually capturing a large percentage of the market during the last few years, and at present the larger local handles&#39;, such as pick, mattock, and axe handles which are manufactured from Australian timber, are selling at prices much lower than the landed duty-paid cost of imported handles with present exchange. The Tariff Board considers that the Australian timber is quite suitable for the manufacture of axe handles for ordinary household purposes, but is not entirely suitable for use with axes used by timber-getters and bushmen. This item has previously been debated in this chamber, and I know that some honorable members contend that Australian axe handles are as good as the imported. The professional timbergetter prefers the imported hickory handle. Of course, the difficulty could be overcome if some of the Australian manufacturers imported hickory in the log, and manufactured hickory handles here. The proposed duties are higher than those which operated under the 1921-30 tariff, and are more than sufficient to bring the overseas costs in line with the Australian selling prices, but the Tariff Board considers that this difference is necessary in order to overcome the prejudice against the local product. The majority of the smaller handles required, such as file and chisel handles, are being produced locally, and the Tariff Board, in recommending the duties of 30 per cent. British and 45 per cent. general on this type of handle, states that the evidence submitted showed that these duties are sufficient to hold the trade in the lines being manufactured . in Australia. While protecting the local manufacturers, they are not so high as to impose an unreasonable burden on the few types not manufactured in Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- It is true that this item was debated in this chamber earlier in the year, but at that time the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> adhered to the duties in the schedule. Since then the Tariff Board has made a recommendation, which has been adopted by the Senate. I am sorry that that alteration has been made, because the increased duties imposed by the previous Government enabled a useful industry to be established in Australia, It is now to be made vulnerable to imports. No doubt the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> will be able to give us a good deal of information respecting an enterprising industry which is manufacturing tool handles in his electorate. Much of the prejudice which formerly existed against Australian-made tool handles has now disappeared, and the users of tool handles generally are quite satisfied with the quality and price of the local article, </para>

I have made inquiries from not only those who chop wood in the early morning, hut also farmers and professional timber-getters, and, while they were prepared some two years ago to listen to the propaganda of the importers, they are now definitely satisfied that the Australian-made article is quite equal to the imported. The Australian handle-manufacturing in: dustry comprises thirteen principal manufactories in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and, to show that this is not a backyard industry, let rae state that the capital employed in it is estimated at &#163;82,000, the value of the plant, buildings and machinery is &#163;75,000, the number of hands employed is &#39;288, and the value of the output in 1932 was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;S6,000.</inline> As a result of the high duties that were imposed, there has been a falling off of imports; but that was only to be expected, because the tariff was increased to compel overseas manufacturers who wanted to exploit the Australian market to establish their factories here. Consequently, there has been a falling off in the value of imports from &#163;58,000 in 1927-2S to &#163;13,000 in 1931-32. </para>

                                did not specifically refer to axe handles, but there is no doubt as to his opinion of the suitability of Australian timbers for that purpose.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline>
                                A. Duffy,  Chairman  of the Timber Advisory Committee, Brisbane, and representing the Brisbane Handle Factory Limited, Brisbane, and Messrs. C. A. Kruger and Son,&#34; Bundamba, Queensland, supported the duties requested by the New South Wales manufacturers on the ground that Australian timbers were quite suitable for tool handles. About seven or eight other Australian manufacturers gave similar evidence before the Tariff Board, and, so far as I can gather from its report, there is no evidence to the contrary. Two American firms have established branch factories in Canada, and although the handles which they produce are entirely of American timber, they are admitted into Australia under the British preferential tariff. That preferential tariff was never intended to allow American firms which had established factories in Canada, to compete in the Australian market to the. detriment of the local manufacturers, and also of the bona fide British manufacturers in both England and Canada. A very efficient factory has been established at Bateman&#39;s Bay for the manufacture of tool handles, and I should like to hear what the Minister for the Interior
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins),</inline>
                                who represents that district, has to say with respect to these duties. A number of timbergetters employed by Messrs. Bagot Brothers at Ballina, New South Wales, in the electorate of the honorable member for Richmond
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green),</inline>
                                all use Australian-made handles. If the local industry were permitted to develop under protective duties, permanent employment would be provided for a number of our factory workers and timbercutters at a time when we should do everything in our power to help the unemployed.

                        <para>.- I happen to know something about the petition signed by 168 so-called axemen in Victoria, to which the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has referred. I am reliably informed that, if it had been required, the people who do not favour the petition could have secured ten times that number of signatures from men who make a living by swinging an axe. The witness quoted by the honorable member for Gippsland knows practically nothing about the timber-getting industry. Broad axes are used only by expert axemen for squaring timber and sleeper-getting. Handles for broad axes must be bent, and as all American handles are straight, they have to be steamed and suitably bent by axemen to meet their individual requirements. The finest timber in the world for use as handles for broad axes is water gum, which is grown in limited areas in the far north coast of New South Wales, and in certain parts of Queensland. Timber grown in southern New South Wales and Victoria is not so suitable for axe handles. As a rule, expert axemen prefer axe handles made from Australian timber. At the last show of the Royal Agricultural Society in Brisbane, every prize-winner in those sections set apart for axemen used Australian-made handles ; and at the last show of the Royal Agricultural Society in Melbourne, every major prize-winner-that is, every championship winner - also, without exception, used handles made from Australian timber, spotted gum, chiefly. Two of the successful competitors used handles made of water gum, which is deep red in colour, and is better than American hickory. Unfortunately, the area upon which it is grown is somewhat limited, but it produces sufficient to supply the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements for high grade axe handles for many years to come. Probably one of the reasons for this opposition to the use of bandies made from Australian timber is the fact that so many country storekeepers are tied to wholesale importers who, naturally, in many cases, dictate the class of goods which the retailers shall offer, especially in hardware. </para>

                    <para class="block">Were we to argue this question for months, diverse opinions would still be held as to which wood is the most suitable for axe handles. What I complain of is the prejudice which has largely been responsible for the antipathy to Australian woods. Before the merit&#39;s of a number of very fine Australian timbers were recognized, hickory held undisputed sway for many purposes. I know that jinker shafts are a different proposition from axe handles; but I have never forgotten a conversation that I had with a wheelwright in a country district, who, in reply to my query as to whether those who ordered jirikers from him always specified hickory shafts, replied, &#34;No; I keep a good supply of blue gum as well as hickory, and as many persons -choose the one as the other. &#34; The paragraph concerning. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Galbraith&#39;s</inline> tests says that the handles were selected at random from wholesalers&#39; stocks, and concludes with the following statement :  - </para>

The others, in order of their breaking loads, were: Firstgrade oak, 185 lb.; first-grade hickory and first-grade gum, 175 lb.; seeond-grade hickory and first-grade, leatherwood, 145 lb.; olive wood (two samples).. 130 lb. and 100 lb. </para>

                    <para class="block">Recently I met a gentleman who represents Tasmanian manufacturers. He informed me that front mountain blue gum that firm is turning out one of the finest axe handles offered for sale in the Commonwealth. That that make has met with approval is shown by the fact that large sales of it are made in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, from which centres a big distribution takes place. I saw on his books orders for at least 10,000 axe handles, proving conclusively that merchants are inclining towards the article made from Australian wood. I hope that the time is not far distant when the prejudice against Australian timbers will have been, completely removed, and they will take their rightful place in the front rank of the timbers of the world. </para>
                    <para>I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beer, president</inline> of the Axemen&#39;s, Association of Victoria, from whose evidence the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> quoted, presented to the Tariff Board a petition signed by a number of axemen. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green),</inline> on the other hand, showed that practically every winner of a principal prize at the wood-chopping contests, held at Brisbane in August, used an Australian-made handle. I also understand that champion axemen who were among the prizewinners at the last Melbourne show, where the contests include not only chopping on the ground, but also at a height, of from &#39;20 to 30 feet, used Australian handles. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Galbraith</inline> says that there is no strain on an axe handle in use except when the- heel or toe of the blade first strikes the wood. He declares that more axes are broken by wrenching the blade from the wood than by any other means. It is pleasing to note that tests of this nature are being made at our engineering schools, and that Australian timber, in common with other Australian products, when put to the test, holds its own with the best that the world produces. For this and the other reasons I have given I shall vote against the proposed reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> stated this afternoon that he had been informed by axemen that danger is associated with the&#39; use of an Australian handle  at  some height from the ground, because of the likelihood of its breaking and causing the user  to  overbalance. That applies with equal force  to  American- hickory. I have no wish  to  disparage that timber, but I am totally opposed to importing  it  while Australia produces -every class of timber from which good axe handles can be made.

                    <para>A lot of timber . is grown in the .Cairns electorate, and much of it is exported. Generally, axe handles are made from spotted gum, but mountain ash also is used for this purpose, its only defeat being that it is subject :to borer. It is a timber that will stand up to any amount of work, and will not break. That applies also bo spotted gum. One objection that may be .urged against it is that it is somewhat heavy; but that its strength is equal to that of either American hickory or any other timber cannot be denied. A large number of bush workers who cut for sawmills use this particular handle. I cannot understand why it should be suggested that American hickory is to be preferred -ou the ground of safety. A handle made from any wood may be broken in -splitting :a block of wood, because -of inability to use&#39; the axe properly. &#39;The prejudice against other Australian products has been lived down, and time will effect  a  cure in this case. It would appear that there is  a  definite intention on the part of some persons) for what reason I cannot assume, to give a setback to this industry, which is of real value to Australia. I commend to honorable members who have any doubts concerning the accuracy of some of my statements about Queensland timbers a work on timbers and* forest products generally by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swain,</inline> who for some years was  chairman  of the Forestry Board in Queensland, and is  a  recognized authority on timbers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swain</inline> makes it plain that timbers grown in Queensland and other parts of Australia are equal to any -produced in the world for the making of axe handles. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the request of the Senate. I spoke- on this item when it was under consideration in this chamber earlier this session, and subsequently the manufacturers of axe handles in Queensland sent an axe handle to my home. I must admit that it was a good article - far better than I. expected an Australian axe handle to be. I said in my previous speech on this subject that the South Australian people, if convinced that the Queensland products were as good as American hickory handles, would buy them. But, undoubtedly, the American hickory handle is better than the Australian-made handle, and although the latter is now suitable for the work for which it is intended, it is too heavily protected. The honorable member for /Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> referred to the broad axe. This implement has a width of 12 inches, and is ground on only one side. Left-handed and right-handed axes are made and these require appropriate handles. If handles are not made for both right and left-handed use they must be bent into the desired shape. Extra good timber is needed for such handles. Even the honorable member had to admit that supplies of suitable Australian timber for the making of handles for broad axes were inadequate to our needs. The honorable gentleman referred to spotted gum, but I think that he would admit that many handles are made from inferior timber. The duty requested by the Senate is British, 3s., and foreign, 4s. 6d.  a  dozen. There is approximately three quarters of a superficial foot of timber in an axe handle. Taking timber at &#163;2 10s. for 100 superficial- feet, the value of the timber in an axe handle is only a few pence. With the protection of 4&#163;d. foreign now suggested, axe handles could be produced locally for about 5-&#163;d. each, the protection amounting to the cost of manufacture. People who want American handles are compelled &#39; to pay 3s. 6d. each for them. I submit therefore that the protection now suggested is adequate, and I hope that the Senate&#39;s request will be acceded to. </para>

                        <para>. - The arguments of honorable members who seek a reduction of the duty on. axe handles are much more faulty than the timber from which&#39; Australian axe handles are being made. Honorable gentlemen opposing the existing duty are actuated by a desire to close down Australian industries, increase unemployment and reduce the spending power of the great consuming public of Australia. As a member of the Country party I value every industry that can be established here under reasonable conditions. Each new industry that we establish successfully gives employment to additional people and reduces public expenditure on unemployment relief. We have, timbers in Australia equal to the best in the world. </para>

                            <para>- In the early stage of the manufacture of any article faults are bound to occur. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who has interjected, found that the wooden ships that he bought in America were faulty. The loss that that transaction caused ito the public was far greater- than the loss involved in the purchase of a few faulty axe handles. I am prepared to go to the extent of prohibiting imports from the United States of America, for that country does not assist our primary industries in any way whatever. If food taken on board an American ship at an Australian port is not consumed before the ship reaches American waters, it must be dumped into the -sea outside the three-mile limit. Why, therefore, should we consider American industries. I am not concerned that American axe  handles cost 3s. 6d. each, because no one can complain of the price of Australian handles. It has been demonstrated in the various  woodchopping  contests at the great national shows in Australia that Australian timbers are  eminently  suitable for the manufacture of axe handles, though I agree that some makers &#34; are using unsuitable timbers. Those opposing the existing duty undoubtedly hold freetrade views, and are continually seeking to make it difficult for the people of this country to achieve their legitimate industrial and commercial aspirations. We must develop our industries if this  country,  is to make progress. Unless substantial  secondary  industries are established here the great war lord who interjected would find it impossible to defend our shores.  1  shall oppose the Senates request because J believe that we should do everything possible to develop the great natural resources of this country. </para>

                        <para>.- lt, was quite unfair- for the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> to say that honorable members opposed to the existing duties on axe handles, and favoring the Senate&#39;s request, wish to close down industries in this country. Nothing of the kind is desired. We are anxious that our industries shall be developed ou a sound basis. If Australian axe handles are as good as those imported from. America it is not likely that, the American article will be bought, for three Australian axe handles can be obtained for the price of one American handle. As the honorable membur for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has said, our skilled axemen need the best handles, and buy American hickory handles. Although the Tariff Board has reported&#34; that certain Australian timbers are suitable for making axe handles, it has also said .that these timbers are not obtainable in commercial quantities. The honorable member&#39; for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> suggested that the test of an axe handle is its strength, but that is not so. Some Australian timbers arc among the hardest and strongest in the world. But an axe handle must have lightness combined with toughness. Unfortunately, some Australian axe handles are so heavy that it is hard to tell the end on which the head is fitted. That is a great objection. The following comments were made by the Tariff Board on the evidence submitted to it as to the relative quality of the Australian and American axe handles <inline font-style="italic">v -</inline></para>

                        <para>The prices charged by local manufacturers of handles from native timbers are from one-half to one-third of the lauded duty paid cost of imported handles. Despite this disparity, importations were at the rate of &#163;19,000 per annum during IH30-31 and 1931-82. This is evidence of a definite demand - at almost any cost - for American hickory handles. </para>
                        <para>There can be. no question as to the superiority of hickory over other timbers for axe handles, sledge hammer handles, pick handles and the like. Its particular virtue is a combination of resiliency and toughness not found in other timbers which are available in commercial quantities.

                    <para>That suggests, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beer&#39;s</inline> statement is hardly in accordance with the facts. Although the Tariff Board has said that sufficient quantities of suitable Australian wood are not available for the manufacture of first-class axe handles, it has not adduced any evidence to that effect. The evidence referred to in its report shows that plentiful supplies of suitable timber for this purpose are available. In quoting the evidence tendered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beer,</inline> the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> pointed out that a timber-feller standing on a staging fixed some distance from  the ground might lose his life if the axe handle should break. I do not dispute that, but an American handle is as likely to break as is an Australian handle. In the making of axe handles, a great deal depends upon the cutting and quartering of the timber. It is not always profitable to quarter a log to get the grain to the best advantage for making axe and other tool handles; Some Australian axe handles may be faulty, but the same can be said of American handles. A good deal depends upon the nature of the timber; but even the very best of timbers, including hickory, if not cut and quartered in the proper way, will break as easily as pine or any other light timber. Greater risks can be taken with Australian spotted gum, in cutting and quartering it, than with any other tim&#39;ber in the world. Oak and ash timbers have a distinct flat and edge grain, and if quartered iu the wrong way, are very brittle. Spotted gum has an interwoven grain,  which makes it more dependable than  many other timbers which have been so highly spoken of to-night. In giving evidence before the board, one witness stated that as a professional axeman he had used </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian axe handles in bush work for the last two years, and had also used Australian handles in all the heats and iu the final of the wood chopping contest, at the Royal Sydney Show, which he won. That man found the Australian spotted gum handle entirely satisfactory. The Railway Department of New &#39;South Wales uses large quantities of handles made in Australia, and the Victorian Railway Department finds that Australian-made pick handles meet all its requirements. Orders for large supplies would not be lodged with the Australian manufacturers unless the timber from which the handles are made is serviceable-. The New South Wales and Victorian Railway Departments obtain expert evidence as to the durability of the Australian-made handles, and if they were not up to standard, the local manufacturers would not continue to receive contracts from the New South Wales and. Victorian Governments for the supply of large quantities. It appears to me that the Tariff Board does not always make its recommendations in accordance with the evidence submitted. There are indications that, in regard to supplies of Australian timber, the board has been guided by prejudice against Australian manufacture, rather than by the actual evidence tendered. The board states that in some respects the Australian timbers are not as suitable as are the American timbers for the manufacture of axe handles; bin I see nothing in the evidence to justify its conclusion that suitable timbers are not available in sufficient quantities. In these circumstances, the committee should oppose the Senate&#39;s request in order to afford adequate protection to this Australian industry. </para>

                        <para>.- Axes are admitted free of duty, but axe handles, which have to be replaced more frequently, are carrying an exorbitant duty. When I was in S&#39;outh Australia two months ago, an axeman whom I have known for years thanked me for putting the case for the axemen to enable them to get cheaper handles. He also said that he had &#39;been in hospital for a -fortnight as a result of using an Australian-made axe handle. I refer the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> to the figures quoted by the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> who said that, in spite of the fact that Australian axe handles can be obtained at from one-third to one-half of the price of hickory handles, &#163;19,000 worth of the latter are imported annually. This sum represents nearly 400,000 axe handles. No one denies that Australian axe handles have been used successfully at wood-chopping competitions, but surely we should be guided rather by the fact that the axemen in this country use, each year, 400,000 imported hickory handles in spite of the excessive cost of these handles. We must also remember that in the tests made in Victoria by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Galbraith</inline> new handles were used. Most of the Australian handles, even when not in use, deteriorate by drying to a greater extent than a hickory handle. The old duty, exchange, primage and transport costs aggregate 120 per cent. The duty of 45 per cent. recommended by the Tariff Board, which the Government is prepared to accept, will be supplemented by exchange 25 per cent., primage 10 per cent., and transport costs 20 per cent., making a total of 100 per cent. against American handles. If the Australian industry cannot compete under those conditions, those who are supporting its cause must admit that it is inefficient or is lacking in good material. The old rate of duty meant an unnecessary burden of 1s. 6d. to 2s. on each handle, and unduly penalized the users. I support the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

                            <para>- No. The main argument used against Australian axe bandies is that they are unsuitable and inferior to those made of American hickory. If we were to prohibit the importation of American hickory for three years, the prejudice against Australian timbers would disappear, and the people would realize the value of some of our own timbers. I hope that the committee will not agree to the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

Time after time the quality of our pines and other woods has been questioned. Opponents outside this chamber of our native timbers have concentrated on the argument that, whatever their uses, they ara unsuitable for making axe handles. There has been a strong prejudice against Australian timbers. The Tariff Board&#39;s report reveals the gradual breakdown of this prejudice. The reportstates - </para>

This proves that the prejudice against Australian axe handles is gradually disappearing. Unfortunately,, some Australians are biased against any product of their own country; they prefer goods grown or manufactured in other countries. This building itself is proof that Australia has many magnificent and useful timbers. The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nock)</inline> said that Australian axe handles will not endure as well as the imported handles. </para>

                    <para class="block">At the present time, these clocks are classified as time registers or detectors, and as such are dutiable. The request is that they be admitted duty free. The matter is not of verygreat importance to either the revenue, local manufacturers, or British manufacturers. The British Senior Trade Commissioner in Australia advisesthat these time recording clocks are manufactured in the United Kingdom, but his department in London does not wish to press for the application of the formula margin of preference stipulated in the Ottawa agreement. The New Zealand tariff specially lists these clocks as free of duty from all countries. They are not made in Australia. The clocks are specially constructed to record automatically the time of arrival of homing pigeons, and the present duty is regarded as an unnecessary impost. </para>

                    <para class="block">In support of its recommendation, the Tariff Board states that, under the duty of ls. recommended under the British preferential rate, with exchange normal and without primage duty, records produced by the English companies associated with Columbia Gramophone (Australia) Limited would land at prices  substantially higher than the local manufacturers&#39; selling prices, while, in the case of the cheapest record mentioned during the board&#39;s inquiry, the landed price would be higher than either the factory or wholesale selling price of similar Australian records. It is believed that the local industry is adequately protected. Records of over 16 inches in diameter are not manufactured in Australia, and are not being produced abroad. A duty of ls. each on records represents an ad valorem rate of 155 per cent. on records priced overseas at 7d. f.o.b., and of 35 per cent. on records with an f.o.b. value of 2s. 7d. each. As the majority of records are priced somewhere between those two figures, there is no necessity to retain the alternative ad valorem rates, and the amendment will make for simplification. </para>

                            <para>.- The duty oncertain foreign films was increased some time ago from 4d. to1s. a foot. This amendment to the schedule was rejected by a large majority in the Senate, and the item has now been returned to us with the request that the old duty of 4d. a foot be restored. In the meantime, there has been a good deal of propaganda by interests concerned, and not all of it has been quite fair. Letters have been sent to members of Parliament, and articles have appeared in trade journals in which the Government has been subjected to attacks. Anattempt has also been made to exert pressure on the Government through the newspapers. The Government always tries to hold the scales fairly between all interests concerned, to promote the greatest amount of development in Australia, while following, as far as possible, the recommendations of the Tariff Board, and to hold the balance evenly between primary and secondary producers. The duties on films were primarily imposed for revenue purposes. When the duty on foreign feature films was increased to 4d. a foot, the revenue dropped materially, because importers, instead of bringing in six or eight copies of a film, brought in only one, and had the other copies made in Australia. This was all very well for the Australian industry, which flourished under these conditions, but there was a serious loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. In an effort to get back this revenue, the duty was raised to ls. a foot. However, the Senate has refused to accept the increase, and the Government, after considerable thought, proposes a compromise at 8d. a foot. </para>

                            <para>- Unlike the honorable member, the Government is not influenced by propaganda, but it has been influenced by the fact that the Senate will not agree to a duty of ls. a foot. Although the Government will not obtain as much revenue as it anticipated, it will receive considerably more than under the rate of &#34;4d. a foot. I am not altogether satisfied with the methods adopted by certain interests in the film world, who caused a panic among small exhibitors by telling them that they would be penalized as the result of the changes proposed by the Government. I believe that action, should te taken to inquire into all the ramifications of the industry. It would be beneficial if the States transferred their powers in this regard to the Commonwealth, so that this Parliament may be able to legislate on all phases of the iudustry, including production, distribution and exhibition. Honorable members may not be aware that the Commonwealth has, on several occasions, invited the States to transfer their powers, but so far that has not been done. The industry is particularly one that lends itself to federal control. It may be possible to introduce a quota system, but I do not recommend it &#39;until further investigation has been made. The Government has done its part to assist the industry by admitting British films free, and their increasing use and steady improvement -are tributes to the policy_ of this and of other governments. </para>

                    <para class="block">That letter was written after a deputation had waited on the Minister, and I pre sume that he again placed the matter before Cabinet. I do not blame him for changing his opinion about this duty if further evidence showed that the increase of the rate to ls. a foot was too great, which was what really happened. When he introduced that amendment on the 30th March last, he said it would have the effect of making positive films dutiable at the negative rate, if used for copying purposes. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> asked what effect the amendment would have on laboratory work, and the Minister replied that it should provide an increased amount of work for the Australian film-printing industry, and bring in revenue that was previously lost. I find, however, that instead of resulting in additional work in the laboratories, it would probably cause reduced importations of films of the cheaper kinds, and unemployment in an industry that was built up under the reasonable measure of protection imposed by. the Scullin&#39; Government. The Bruce-Page Government increased the rate from l&#163;d. to 3d. a foot in 1929, but I shall not elaborate upon the consequences of that action, and the way in which it was received throughout the Commonwealth. In June, 1930, the Scullin Government, faced with a deficit of &#163;10,000,000, and a prospective deficit for the next year of &#163;20,00,000, increased the duty from 3d. to 4d. a foot for a twofold purpose. It was thought at the time that additional revenue would be obtained and that a local film-printing industry would be established. On the Sth March the Minister referred in these words to the amendment  then made - </para>

                        <para>These are the increases imposed on negative and soft positive cinematograph films. . . . It has recently become the practice to import a negative or soft positive copy only, and to print the whole of the Australian requirements from this. Previously five or six positive copies of a film were imported, but, with the increase in the rate of duty from 2Jd. to 4d. per foot on foreign films, there began the importation of only one negative copy of each film, and revenue returns progressively contracted as this practice grew. </para>

                    <para class="block">Protective duties usually result in a reduction of imports and a consequent reduction of revenue, but they also lead to the establishment of Australian industries; -In most instances employment is given to large numbers of persons, who, in turn, are able to pay income tax and provide employment for others. When the duty of 4d. a foot was imposed, it resulted in the establishment in Australia of a filmprinting industry, which gives employment to-day to about 150 persons. The Minister has now reconsidered the whole matter, and he thinks that a reasonable compromise will be reached if the duty of ls. a foot is reduced to 8d., but, in my opinion, seeing that the Opposition cannot force the Government to revert to a duty of 4d. a foot, a fair compromise would be 6d. a foot.

                        <para>We hasten to lot you have the union&#39;s considered views on the question of thu Government&#39;s intention to increase the duty of film from 4d. to ls. per foot. </para>
                        <para>Permit me to point out that since the depression our members have  suffered  wage reductions amounting to 30 per cent., this in an industry consisting of employers who are always ready to pay fair and reasonable wages. Unfortunately, business has been so bad over the last three years that no profits. have been made by picture proprietors, therefore, they were forced to take advantage of any wage reduction that caine along, and to reduce staff to a minimum. Mention is made of this fact to prove that we have no reason for putting forward .views that are not believed by us. </para>
                        <para>The union had me visit Canberra to confer with  Colonel White,  for the purpose of having the duty reduced. Our representations went for naught. We believe that should the Government insist upon the ls. per foot duty, it will have the effect of a .serious reduction in the importation of films into the Commonwealth, with the result that many of the theatres in industrial ureas will reduce the number of  their screening nights, thereby lessoning the employment of our members. Then again, thu Minister for Customs, some time back stated through the press that the duty would only mean a difference to the exhibitors of 15s. per feature. As exhibitors use at least 208 films each year, it will seem from the Minister&#39;s own figure!! that it is a considerable sum to place upon theatres that have been showing losses for tinpast three years. </para>
                        <para>Another point worth mentioning is. when you increased the duty on film up to &#39;Id. per foot, it created a duplicating industry which employs about 150 hands. Any  falling  off in the importation of films  will  seriously  hamper  this now industry that has spent many thousands of pounds on machinery, &#38;c. </para>
                        <para>Our union depends entirely on the picture side of the industry, the legitimate stage having fallen down to a very low  ebb.  Therefore, it is most  essential  that Australia should allow to enter as much film as possible, without which, competition will become so keen among the exhibiting combine on the one hand, and suburban and country exhibitors on the other, which must have the effect of closing down many struggling showmen who will not be able to pay the film hire that will be demanded. </para>
                        <para>To back up my statement that there will bc less&#39; importation of film if the ls. per foot duty remain, it can be pointed out that certain kinds of films, such as westerns, and gangster pictures which go hig in industrial districts, is of no value to middle-class districts, with the result that they are not booked. The film hire generally received for these pictures throughout Australia is about &#163;1,000, and does not at present show a profit; therefore, if the duty is raised 200 per cent., it will not be profitable to import. </para>
                        <para>The union, by resolution of a general meeting, directed its officials to co-operate with the exhibitors and distributors in the fight to reduce the duty, believing as we do, any further burdens placed upon picture theatre proprietors will mean a further cutting of the staff to enable them to meet their obligations. During my visits to theatres of late, I discovered in many of them, that the wife and family of the employer have replaced our members. When questioned as to the reason for the move, they proved by their books that even the few shillings saved was necessary to keep the theatre open. </para>

                            <para>- The printing industry is a very small part of the business; but it has a great deal to do with the cost of the exhibitors&#39; section, which employs 25,000 persons in different parts of Australia. If the extra 4d. a foot adds to their costs and prevents the screening of the cheaper class of films for which there is a demand in certain areas which cannot afford star features, it will certainly affect the finances of picture theatres in those areas. I place more reliance on what the unions say about employment than I do on what the Minister says on the subject. </para>

Stripped of the extraneous matter that has been imported into the debate by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> the facts are that the duty of 4d. a foot on foreign films was designed to bring in a revenue of approximately &#163;177,000 per annum. Honorable members must bear in mind that British films are not affected. In an endeavour to defeat the purpose of the Government, the Australian representatives of American film companies limited their imports to one copy of each film and established a company in this country to reproduce copies from the original. The result was that the, duty collected from the impost was &#163;56.000, instead of &#163;177,000, per annum. </para>

                            <para>- The only defence of the action of the American film companies is that it has provided additional employment. I shall deal with that later. The Scullin Government and the country generally believed that the duty of 4d. a foot on foreign films was a reasonable one. Personally, I am in favour of imposing a duty of 1  s.  a foot on imported foreign films ; that would bring in a revenue of some &#163;130,000 per annum,and at the present rates of imports the film organizations would still be &#163;47,000 better off than was originally intended. However, the Government has agreed to a compromise of 8d. a foot, which should produce &#163;95,000 per annum. I suggest that the committee should accept the proposal readily; it will inflict no hardship on American film companies, as it will exact a much smaller revenue than those concerns could reasonably be expected to pay. </para>

                    <para>A good deal has been said about the company that has been formed for the duplication of films. According to the latest available figures, it is a flourishing concern, having paid its shareholders something like 40 per cent. on their investment last year. That company will not suffer as a result of the suggested impost, particularly in view of the fillip that has recently been given to the production of Australian films. </para>

Most of it had an inaccurate basis. These concerns have distributed circulars among country picture showmen claiming that the proposed increase of the duty on films to ls. a foot would ruin them, and  i  adversely affect the industry generally. The figures circulated were brought under my notice by some country picture show proprietors, and, when I first read them, I felt that the claim was a fail&#34; one. However, I discovered that the American film companies were deliberately misleading picture show proprietors by applying to individual sections figures that rightly applied to the whole industry. I resent such tactics, which are deliberately designed to mislead. </para>

                            <para>- It is regrettable that any honorable member should quote, apparently with approval, extracts from a communication that . mis represents the tastes of persons living in industrial suburbs. It is an insult to the intelligence of those who attend picture shows, no matter in what suburb they live, to -claim that they delight in witnessing trashy, distasteful, and destructive films of the &#34; wild west &#34; and &#34; gangster &#34; variety. &#34;We should be doing a great service to the community, and particularly to the rising generation in industrial suburbs, if we placed a prohibition on the importation of such films. It is a tragedy that they are permitted entry. </para>

                        <para>. - It has been suggested that the imposition of the duty now proposed by the Minister will lead to an increase of the hire charges paid .by the exhibitors, and involve higher charges of admission. I. would point out that when the distributors evaded the payment of duty to the amount of some &#163;120,000 per annum by importing negatives and having -them copied in Australia, they did not reduce their rates to the exhibitors. What effect will this increased duty have upon the costs of the exhibitors? In the first place, British films enter Australia duty free, and 30 per cent, of all films shown in Australia to-day are British. In addition topical films, scenic films, travel talks,&#39; serials, and short films of 2,000 feet or less, are exempt from this increased duty. Only foreign feature films of considerable length are affected. In all probability an average of less than one film exhibited at each programme will be affected by this increased duty. The average length&#39; of a foreign feature film is about 6,000 feet, and in respect of that film the increased duty of 4d. a foot would involve an extra cost to the dis- tributor of &#163;100. The average number of prints or copies made in Australia of one negative is from six to eight. Therefore the increased duty would involve an additional cost of &#163;12 10s. a copy, which cost will be spread over several hundred exhibitors throughout a State. Under those circumstances, is it conceivable that the added cost would be passed on to the exhibitors, particularly in view of the fact that they obtained no benefit whatever from the action of the distributors in evading these duties previously? Is it conceivable .that the added cost of &#163;12 10s. a picture film, spread over three or four hundred theatres - about 6d. a theatre - would lead to increased admission charges? That suggestion is absolutely ridiculous. I consider that the proposal of the  Government is entirely fair, because it is merely endeavouring to recoup a small portion - less than half - of the revenue which it lost as a result  of foreign negatives being copied in Australia. There is no justification whatever for an increase of the already high rates to the exhibitors, and surely much less ground to assume that these increased duties will lead to higher charges for admission. </para>

Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> I am not at all perturbed about the pressure that has been brought to bear by foreign film interests, because pressure is usually exerted on honorable members when fiscal matters are being discussed. I am concerned more with the position of the people who earn their livelihood in the motion picture industry, and I suggest that even at the risk of losing a little revenue we should give every encouragement to a new industry which has been  established in Australia for the copying of negatives. Honorable members have been approached, not only by the American film representatives and the exhibitors here, but also by the theatrical employees. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member&#39;s statement is not proof of that. The Scullin Government increased the duty on films from lid. to 4d. a- foot, and as a result a new and important section of the motion picture industry - the reproduction of films - was established in Australia. At the present time, the film industry is one of the greatest industries in the United States of America and we should do all in our power to encourage the industry in Australia even if it means the loss of a certain amount of revenue. &#34;We have to decide whether it is of more importance to Australia to regain revenue which has previously been lost because of the establishment of this industry, or to continue to lose that revenue in order to encourage the development of the industry. If an additional sum of &#163;95,000 is extracted from the film interests in Australia, the tax will be passed on to the exhibitors, who will have to bear the additional cost themselves, or pass it on to their patrons. The picture theatres give employment to many thousands of people in Australia. The exhibitors have been hard &#39;hit by the depression. The reduced purchasing power of the community has affected their audiences to such an extent as to force them to reduce their admission charges, and as a result their turnover has been considerably reduced. I have received the following communication from the Theatrical Employees Union : - </para>

                        <para>May we mention the fact that ah industry has been created in Australia for the purpose of  duping  nlms from negatives and employs about 150 hands. As the negatives are the raw material necessary for the continuation of this new branch of industry created, we can see no justification for a 200 per cent: increase in duty, Should the duty be increased it will mean a considerable decrease of importation of films into the Commonwealth, as the film distributors will not import western and other unprofitable films, which will mean the closing down in some districts of theatres from the usual six screening nights, to one or two each week. It will further have the effect of increasing film hire to the exhibitors who are not in a position to stand any further costs in the running of their theatres. It becomes necessary for the successful running of the picture industry, to import as much film as possible into the Commonwealth, as you will realize pictures that please some&#39; districts would bc hooted in others, so we are anxious iti the interests <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> the  whole  industry that no further burdens  be  placed upon it. </para>

                    <para class="block">As honorable members have professed to be so concerned about the balancing of budgets, they should give some consideration to the unenviable position in which the exhibitors- of films in this country will be placed as a result of this increase of duty. It is generally admitted that this additional impost of &#163;95,000 will be passed on to the exhibitor, and the question is whether he can pass it on any further. If he attempts to do so by an increase of the admission charge, his audiences will become depleted and he will be forced to close down his theatres partially or wholly with a. consequent diminution, of work for the theatrical employees. , Some honorable members have endeavoured to bring into this issue the merits of British films as &#39;against those of American films, but I am not particularly concerned about that. I should like to see the film industry established in. Australia on sound commercial lines. Exhibitors have to cater for the public. . We have had no evidence that the exhibitors would not give a preference to British films over American films. The truth is that the British moving picture industry has not developed to anything like the extent of its American rival. Consequently, if the people who patronize picture shows still have a preference for American films then, in the long run, they will get them or will cease to attend picture houses. If the duty on foreign films is raised to such a level that Australian exhibitors will be forced to screen other and cheaper pictures, attendances will dwindle, exhibitors will eventually be driven out of business, and unemployment in the theatrical industry will increase. The duty imposed by the Scullin Government had the effect of bringing into being an important branch of the moving picture industry in Australia. Let us not, by this attempt to secure a little more revenue from the American film industry, do anything that is likely to injure the Australian end of the moving picture business. </para>

                        <para>. -  The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> has told the committee that patrons of moving pictures would get what films they wanted ; that Australian exhibitors would give it to them. I doubt that the honorable member was strictly accurate on that point, because, as all who have any knowledge of the industry know, picture patrons of this country have to take what is given to them. Australian exhibitors are so tied up by their contracts that they are not altogether free under their contracts to reject unsuitable films. They are practically forced to screen the pictures sent to them. The position in this respect is so serious that, as the Minister has indicated, it will have to be considered from all its aspects. </para>

                            <para>- In one case the hirer had to agree to sign for the whole of the prod.net of the exchange with which the contract was made for. one year, and if any film was not up to standard he had to pay for it even if he .did not screen it. The honorable member for Dalley spoke of the serious position that has arisen in connexion with the production of Australian films. It is suggested that Australian pictures are being used as a bait to promote the sale of imported films. One exhibitor desiring to show an Australian picture, was informed by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> exchange that by contracting for a considerable number of programmes he would gain the advantage of being able to exhibit the special pictures handled by that exchange. The existing form of contracts offers no assurance to the Australian moving picture industry. This is a matter which should bo closely investigated. </para>

                    <para class="block">I mention this iu the hope that, when a further investigation is being made, it will receive attention. If the Government decides to award prizes for the production of Australian films, precautions must be taken to safeguard exhibitors from being hampered in their business by the inclusion in their contracts of any extraneous provisions. They should be given a fair chance to show Australian pictures to Australian people. Then there is the further question of percentages, which presses heavily on country exhibitors. On one picture an exhibitor was asked to pay to the exchange 60 per cent, of his gross takings, leaving only 40 per cent, to the showman. I believe that the Minister is trying to act fairly to all interests concerned, and that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> correctly stated the position to-hight. At all events, he satisfied me that I would be justified in supporting the proposed modification of the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

                        <para>. - The most serious features of the moving-picture industry in Australia have been mentioned by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> and the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom).</inline> Judging by what has been said in this discussion, we appear to be in danger of doing the wrong thing in a futile effort to &#34; get at &#34; the people who are the real cause of all the trouble. It must be apparent to everybody that American producers are fleecing the people of this country through the film exchanges, and that our efforts to impose taxation on them through the tariff will be absolutely futile because of the rigidity of the contracts made between the distributors and exhibitors. I agree with the Postmaster-General that a searching inquiry should be made into every aspect of the moving-picture business, with a view to making it possible for the Australian industry to compete on reasonable terms with American producers. But the Government proposal will not do this, although I am afraid that many honorable members who will vote for it think that it will. My fear now is that, because our minds are prejudiced against, the American film industry - and I think rightly so, because I believe it is fleecing exhibitors in Australia and destroying all possibility of profit for the local industry - we shall not be able to take effective action against it through the tariff. We may think that we can, iu this way, impose some taxation upon American trusts and combines, but I am afraid we shall not succeed, and that in the meantime we may injure the Australian moving picture industry, which is already in a shocking condition. The number of positives imported will not be affected, no matter how the duty may fluctuate. The increased duty will have to be borrie wholly by the exhibitor, who employs Australian labour, not by the distributor, who, I believe, is allied with the American produce&#93;-. My concern is for the Australian workers in the industry, who, numerically, are the biggest, factor. The employees engaged in the multiplication of films in New South Wales are all members of the typographical association, and their knowledge of the .technical side of the industry is not inferior to that of even the directors of big film corporations. They fear, not a diminution of profits, but the dismissal of a number of hands, or an application to the Arbitration Court for the reduction of award rates. If greater taxation is imposed in the hope that some of it will be passed on to the American producer, and that is not the result, more harm than good will be done. I consider that 6d. a foot would be a fairer duty than Sd., and I shall support it. </para>

                        <para>. - I offer no objection to the dissemination of propaganda among members of Parliament by moving picture distributors. Propaganda is practised in connexion with almost every item of the tariff, and we should adopt an extraordinary attitude were we to take exception to it in this case. That which I have seen appears to me to be harmless. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> spoke of pressure on exhibitors. Some months ago, certain exhibitors in my electorate brought under my notice circular letters that were issued by the distributors, which, in one or two cases, urged that the facts mentioned should be placed before the federal member for the district, and that his support should be enlisted. I cannot see anything objectionable in that. Some years ago  when the Bruce-Page Government increased the duty on fibm the methods adopted by the moving picture industry generally were most reprehensible. Tdrere was then a trial of strength between the&#34; Commonwealth Parliament and the- distributors and exhibitors: Many of tlie5 exhibitors employed&#39; the most undesirable tactics to compass the- defeat of members&#39;who voted for the increased duty;: but the victory that they gained did not benefit them, becatise the succeeding Go^ vernment imposed a still higher duty.. I believe that the moving picture interest&#39;s have now realized that they are not politically powerful, and that they gain nothing by applying coercive measures&#39; to members of the National Parliament. If it is necessary to- impose duties to obtain revenue, that action will be&#39;taken despite political pressure against it. If- appears to me that the industry is&#39; approaching the question to-day in a chastened spirit, and I doubt whether it will again attempt to smash a government, or to bring about the defeat of members who do what&#39; they conceive to be their duty to the whole of the people. In the present instance, my sympathies are entirely with the industry, and I unhesitatingly support the proposal of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> To my mind, the Government has not a strong case; and it is largely buttressed with prejudice against &#39;the American industry. I admit that, until recently, the American picture interests had practically unchecked freedom in Australia. To-day, however, they are up against worid competition, and particularly from Great Britain, in which country they have practically lost the market. The British picture interests are beginning to regain the position that they formerly held, hot only in the British Empire, but also in many countries in which formerly American interests enjoyed a 95 per cent. dominance. Australia is one of the countries in which British picture interests are now competing strongly with the American; they command approximately 30 per cent. of the market. I contend that the matter should be considered, not only from the amusement, but also from the economic, point of view. I shall not pose as an authority on the merits of moving pictures; but, from what I have seen, I am satisfied&#39; that&#39;, for all round&#39; productive merit, British pictures; which are1 sent1 to1 Australia to-day are1 not in the same classas American productions&#39;.- I challen&#39;geany one to prove- thati the British- industry is entitled to receive consideration- from this Parliament on account&#39; of the serviceit has rendered to Aus&#39;tralia-; </para>

                            <para>- The booming&#39; of British films&#39; gives them &#38; false value, and&#39; is intended to mislead- the people- in- regard- to their quality. Recently, I- read an- article by a British pictureshow reviewer in the- London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail,</inline> in. which it was stated that, 95&#39; per cent, ofl the. pictures produced in Great Britain to-day were no credit to the British film industry, and no advertisement to Great Britain if shown in other parts of the world. In the opinion of that reviewer only about 20 or 30 of the 400 or more pictures that he had reviewed were any credit to British producer&#39;s. That bears out my own opinion of the British picture-producing industry. It seems to me that we see very few of the best British pictures. I have seen reviews of many British classical and historical pictures produced in the iast two or three years, but the pictures have never come to Australia. Only the poorest rubbish of the British producers comes here. &#39;Apart from pictures produced in the United States of America, very few foreign pictures are shown in Australia. It seems to me, therefore, that by agreeing to the Government&#39;s proposal we shall penalize our own people. The extra duty will, undoubtedly, come out of their pockets. The amusement-loving people of Australia have had a raw deal in the iast three or four years. Many picture houses and theatres have been closed, because the people have not been able to spend as much as formerly on entertainments of this kind. 0ne of the surest indications of the existence of the depression in this country has been the disinclination of the people to spend money on amusements, and one of the surest indications of tie lifting of the depression will be the return of the people to their accustomed habits in this connexion. Undoubtedly, the talking pictures provide 95 per cent. of the enter-  tainments which our people enjoy in these days, and we should not, merely through a -vengeful spirit towards the United States of America, make amusements of this kind a half-penny dearer than they need be. The picture industry of that country has involved the expenditure of enormous sums of money. If this monopoly has, in thb past, called for heavy toll from our people, it has undoubtedly &#34;delivered the goods&#34;. The technique of high class American pictures is superior to that of the best pictures produced in other countries, and the people who spend money to see American pictures get good value as a rule. We should not discourage the importation into Australia of the best American pictures. I am glad that the imposition of a heavy duty on these pictures in recent years has led to the building up of a small but valuable industry in this country in the printing of copies from negatives, and has enabled our own people to learn something of the technique of picture production. In my opinion, the American picture interests were quite justified in trying to avoid crushing taxation by establishing a studio in Australia for the printing of pictures from the negatives. I do not agree with the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> that we should heavily tax every American industry doing business in this country. Each industry should be dealt with on its merits. If  Ave  &#34;flog&#34; the American picture industry there will, undoubtedly, be an unhappy reaction. We shall, in such circumstances, see very few of the  be3t  American pictures. The concessions granted by Australia to British picture producers&#39; have not had any very great effect. The people of this country are the best judges of the pictures that come here. They are well able to pick good pictures from bad ones, and they certainly have not been enthusiastic about either British or locally produced pictures. </para>

                        <para>. - According to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> the object of the Government in imposing a duty of ls. a foot on imported foreign feature films was to gain revenue to the amount of &#163;177,000 per annum, but foreign picture companies have re-arranged their business methods, to avoid paying &#39;this extra tax. It is strange to me that the Postmaster-General should complain about an industry taking steps to reduce production costs. I have always understood that the honorable gentleman favoured the conduct of industry on economical lines. He is always talking about the necessity for efficiency and up-to-date methods. </para>

                            <para>- If - the honorable gentleman, applies that principle to one industry, why not in another? It is surely just as expedient &#39;that one industry should be run on economic and efficient , lines as that any other should be so run. Honorable members opposite say that everything possible should be done to reduce costs, and after all capitalism is based on business methods of the nature complained of by the Government. We cannot blame commercial organizations, whether foreign or local, which adopt such a logical policy, and I should imagine that any industry which did not keep its costs at the lowest possible level would receive the strongest condemnation of honorable members opposite. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> show that with this added duty they will not. The Postmaster-General said that we should deal with one thing at a time. We can deal only with the aspect now  before the committee, and we may later attempt to deal with the methods of distribution; but Government supporters have given no indication as to the way in which that can be done. It is questionable whether we have the power to deal with the aspect mentioned by the Postmaster-General. So far as we can see there is nothing to prevent the picture distributors passing on any additional impost to exhibitors and through them to picture patrons. The Government is justified in endeavouring to secure revenue from every reasonable source, and, if it feels that the picture distributors should render a greater service to the country than at present, they should be made to do so; but not at the expense of the picture patrons. The picture theatre is the only form of amusement available to the poor man at a reasonable price, and we are totally opposed to any direct or indirect, methods that may be employed to increase the cost of this form of entertainment. </para>

                            <para>- They always do, and in most cases of that nature the increase, of such taxes is a profitable proposition to .the trader. If the duty on films is increased, the  prices  of admission to picture theatres may be raised to a greater extent than is necessary to cover the extra impost. If the Government requires additional revenue from this industry, it should show the tax will be obtained from those concerning whom complaints have been made to-night. There is no question as to their power in this country. The Postmaster-General has rightly said that the picture distributors impose exacting conditions upon the exhibitors, and there is nothing to prevent them from evading this increased tax. As they have the matter entirely in their own hands, we feel that the additional revenue will not be obtained from the picture distributors, but from the lecture patrons and exhibitors who, being already overburdened, should not be asked to carry more. The Postmaster-General endeavoured to discredit the views expressed by the Secretary of the Theatrical Employees Union <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrop),</inline> on the ground that the members of the union are not associated with the moving-picture industry. The fact, is that the greater number of the members of the organization mentioned work in picture theatres, owing to the dearth of employment, in other theatres. Many of them are living at present from hand to mouth. In visiting many suburban and country theatres, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrop</inline> found that, struggling picture show proprietors are conducting their businesses with the aid of their wives &#39;and members of their families instead of employing labour. The Government may secure &#163;95,000 in revenue- </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The number of screenings each week in some theatres may be reduced and fewer films will be required. Under its original proposal the Government 3et out to obtain &#163;177,000, but the foreign companies devised means of evading the tax and so reduced their costs. The Government now proposes to- raise &#163;95,000 from this source, but the companies may still continue to reduce costs. If a compromise of 6d. a foot is accepted the film importers may carry the impost, which I think they reasonably could. They may feel that the additional expenditure involved, when spread over a large number of exhibitors, will be &#39;too small to be passed on. We should not, make the position of exhibitors more difficult? than it is at present. </para>

                            <para>- The higher the amount, the less likely will the distributors be to bear the burden. The film importers may be prepared to accept a duty of 6d. a foot, and not pass it on. The question of the effect of duties on unemployment has been mentioned. I should like to refrain from discussing this item from that angle, as my colleagues have already dealt with that aspect of the matter. Bather would I stress the fact that picture shows are the chief entertainment of the poorer sections of the community, and that we should not make it more difficult for them to have this enjoyment. We, in this party, believe that these duties would deprive them of this pleasure, and therefore we shall vote against the Government&#39;s proposal. </para>

                        <para>. -  Those uugaged in the film business have indulged in a good deal of propaganda. In the publication before me - the <inline font-style="italic">Film Weekly</inline> - there is a statement that apparently the Government has forgotten &#34; the lesson of 1929 &#34;. It is clear that the exhibitors were influenced to write as they did to members of this Parliament; but I shall not go further into that, as the bitterness may only have been passing. I have signed scores of letters to members and picture theatre proprietors stating that the impost was not so heavy as they had been led to believe, which, I think, confirms my view that they had. been influenced to write as they did. I propose to supplement the figures given by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> in an endeavour to convince the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> that the impost will not press heavily on the small exhibitors. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> confused what I said on a previous occasion with another matter. I said that the increased duty would give increased employment in film printing, in which industry about 150 employees are said to be engaged. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said that unemployment was being created among theatre proprietors, which is  a  totally different matter. The unemployment argument was used by those engaged in the film-printing industry when the duty was raised, but their fears proved groundless. The exhibitors should be able to absorb the extra duty, and not have to pass it on, because the removal of the federal entertainments tax, and the granting of other concessions should increase their turnover. In  a  number of ways, the Government has assisted the industry, aud, in addition, exchange between the United States of America and Australia has eased considerably. The exhibitors should have borne the whole ls. duty without complaint, but, instead, they have chosen  to  scare the picture show proprietors. I shall show how tinfounded is that alarm. It has been ascertained that 70 per cent.  of  the  Tentals  received from exhibitors is paid by city and suburban exhibitors, and 30 per cent. by those in country districts. There are 310 suburban picture theatres, and 630 in the country. The average length of  a  feature film is approximately 6,000 feet. An increase of the duty by 4d.  a  foot - the difference between the rate of 8d. now proposed by the Government, and the 4d. which operated prior to March last - would mean an additional duty of &#163;100 on each film, but, as was pointed out by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson),</inline> that would be further reduced by printing copies. On the basis of a week&#39;s screening in one city theatre in each capital city, 21 screenings in each city theatre each week, three screenings each  week in  half the number of suburban theatres, and two screenings in each week in half the number of country theatres, the increased charge would be 2s. 4&#189;d. for each screening in city and suburban theatres, or11&#189;d. for each screening in country theatres. In the case of double feature programmes, the additional cost would be 4s. 9d., and 1s.11d., respectively. These calculations are based on an average film screened in  a  city theatre for one week. In the case of the better-class films, the charge would be much less for each programme, because such films are screened for as long as twelve, or even sixteen weeks, in Sydney and Melbourne. In! view of all the changed conditions which have operated to the advantage of distributors, the higher duties should not be passed on to- the exhibitors. I, therefore, ask the committee to accept the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall deal with this subject from the financial point of view, but, in passing, I must remark on the unique event which has occurred here to-night - the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> moving for a reduction of an existing duty. I do not know whether the Government has given serious consideration to the proposal that there should be no duty whatever on films entering Australia, that not more than one copy of any film be admitted, and that an excise duty be placed on all copies made in Australia. Under that proposal a film would contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth, not on the basis of its length as at present, but according to its acceptance by the people. A good feature film like <inline font-style="italic">Tall Me To-night,</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Cavalcade,</inline> which has had a long run iu some theatres, pays no more duty than another film which is not so great a box office attraction. We should endeavour to tax each film according to its earning capacity., </para>

                            <para>- It appears to be a way of getting out of the difficulty without having to .effect any compromise. When the Senate refused to agree to the duty of ls. a foot, the Government compromised by fixing the rate at 8d. a foot. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> performed what must have been a miracle for him, by moving that the duty be reduced to 6d. In fixing this figure, he was probably guessing just as much as the Minister. Each proposed a lower figure haphazard, and without any &#39; attempt to base &#39; the duty on science or reason. If my suggestion were adopted, those nauseating films, which one is compelled &#34;to see almost every time one visits a picture theatre, would not be exhibited, because the exhibitors would lose money by having to pay excise on them. </para>

They can look after themselves; but I am concerned with the exhibitors and their employees, and with those engaged in printing films in this country. I submit that an increase of the rate from 4d. lo 6d. would be fair, in view of the fact that the duty was only 1 1/2 d. in 1928. It was next increased to lid., and later to 3d. The Scullin Government increased the duty to 4d., and the present Government raised it to ls. The Minister said that he was anxious to help the industry, and that the Government proposed to give money prizes with this end in view. Is it expected that the giving of these prizes will benefit the exhibitors ? </para>

                            <para>- There are no money prizes given to assist the exhibitors. I  wa3  a member of a royal commission which inquired into the motion picture &#39;industry, and I think that I know as much about the subject as any other honorable member of this committee. There has been a tremendous slump in the industry in recent years. It has felt the depression to a greater .extent than most other industries. The prizes to which the Minister referred are for the encouragement of the production of motion pictures in Australia by local companies; that is an altogether different matter from the duty on imported films. The producing companies will not be  assisted by the imposition of a duty of oven ls. a foot, as may be seen from the following telegram received by a senator from EffteeFilms Limited, Melbourne, probably the most enterprising of the local producing companies: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Australianproducers benefited to some extent from the money prizes given by the last Government, but the matter of prizes should not bo introduced by the Minister when we are considering the effect of an import duty on distributors and exhibitors, and upon the employees in the industry. I have already quoted from the contract which exhibitors have to sign, to show that the distributor has power to pass on duty charges to the exhibitors, <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> iu turn pass them on to those who patronize the theatres. It has been said that relief will be given to the exhibitors by the remission of entertainment tax, but in. very few picture theatres is the price of admission as high as 2s. 6d., below which the Commonwealth tax did not operate. </para>
                    <para>There has been a tremendous falling off in the footage of imported films, including films from the United Kingdom. The quantity has declined from 35,971,000 feet in 1930 to 16,000,000 feet in 1932. The customs tariff rate varied from1&#189;d. a foot to 4d. a foot between 192S and 1932, and the amount of revenue collected declined from &#163;296,273 in 1930 to &#163;58,101 in 1932. The number of admissions to theatres was 6,671,646 in 1930, but this number declined to 2,142,734 iu 1932. The amount collected in amusement tax was &#163;76,670 in 1930, but was only &#163;28,543 in 1932. The gross film sales amounted to &#163;2,095,077 in 1930, but, to only &#163;1,391,059 in 1932. According to an audited statement issued by Messrs. Flack and Flack, public accountants, of Sydney, eight Australian branches of American distributing companies made net profits amounting to &#163;170,000 in 1930, but experienced losses amounting to &#163;22,000 in 1931. &#163;41,000 in 1932, and &#163;27,000 in 1933. When the royal commission inquired into the position of the industry, from 1,200 to 1,500 country showmen throughout Australia werehaving a lean time, and any additional tariff impost will increase their difficulties and reduce the number of the workers in the industry. I hold no brief for the American distributing companies. When the royal commission took evidence, I stated that Commonwealth legislation was required to deal with quotas and contracts between American branch distributing companies and the Australian exhibitors, According to their association, the exhibitors have been experiencing bad treatment at the hands of the American companies, but this is not the time to investigate that matter. No attempt should be made to prejudice the minds of honorable members by an attack on those companies. </para>

                        <para>.- This items deals with radiator shells, plated. The Senate&#39;s request is that the duties of  &#163;2  British, and  &#163;3  foreign on radiator shells be abolished. This request, although in accordance with the Tariff Board&#39;s report, should not be supported by honorable members. The board has not made a proper investigation of the whole of the industry. In Victoria are five electroplating firms who specialize in the chromium-plating of motor car fittings, and four of them knew nothing whatever of the inquiry. </para>

                        <para>. -  This item which relates to motor car fittings  is  really a simplification of the tariff which all honorable members will agree is overdue. The only vehicle part  in  dispute  is  radiator shells. Certain manufacturers have written to honorable members stating that they did not know  that  the inquiry was taking place.That,  of  course, was their own fault and not  the  fault of the Parliament. The position  is  not so serious as the Deputy Leader  of  the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has suggested, because radiator shells form only one of numerous lines of nickeland chromium-plating. Motor cars are imported with radiator shells unplated.  The  shells are greased to prevent erosion. They have to be taken off the cars, sent to  the  local factories to be plated, and then  reassembled.  The labour entailed in  that  operation is worth as much as  the  chromium-plating. The withdrawal  of  tha duty on radiator shells would  not  affect the manufacturers greatly, because they have other plating work. The motor trade is undoubtedly increasing as  the  result of better times. If the committee will accept the proposed rates,  I  promise I shall refer the item back to  the  Tariff Board. </para>

                            <para>- They have had many repeat orders from leading firms in Australia. There is no doubt about the quality and the price of their work. During the last three years they have reduced their prices by 50 per cent. Until recently the firms in Victoria were plating the whole of the radiator shells imported by the Ford company, but that company has altered its policy in recent years, and now wishes to see the duties lowered. One member of the Government, the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has, quite legitimately, I admit, held a brief for if since it changed its policy. If the Senate&#39;s request is adopted, five firms in Victoria will be seriously affected, as will also firms in the other States. I speak from a personal knowledge of the five Victorian factories, the Edson Plating Company and the Modern Plating Works, South Melbourne; the Nella Enamelling and Elec&#39;troplating Proprietary Limited, South Yarra, I&#39;. R. Quintin Proprietary Limited, North Melbourne, and the Walhalla Plating Works, Carlton. If, pending the promised inquiry by the Tariff Board, the present duties are allowed to stand, these Australian firms will be able to carry out orders already received, and perhaps no harm will be done ; if, on the other hand, the Senate&#39;s request for the removal of the duty on radiator shells is accepted, they will be seriously injured in their business. I have been specially asked by the Engineers Society in Victoria, as well as the firms which do this class of work, to mention this matter to-night. The Walhalla Plating Works has been doing plating for the Ford Company for the last five or six years, and has been complimented upon the quality of its work. It is also claimed that Australian firms engaged in this particular work have reduced their prices by 50 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The board may have had in mind the interests of the :motor importers. But I have always understood that, in fiscal matters, the interests of Australian firms should receive first consideration, and it seems to me quite wrong that, in respect of this particular item, they should be ignored. 1 see no reason why we should change our fiscal policy merely because some Australian firms, which are really offshoots of American manufacturing companies, have altered their business practice during the last few years. If the board&#39;s inquiry should disclose that the work done by these Australian firms was faulty in any respect, or that they had not reduced their prices, there might be some reason for an alteration of the duty ; but that is not the case. This proposal is not for a minor reduction of the duty. The Senate&#39;s request is to remove it altogether, and thus do a great injustice to the Victorian firms I have mentioned, as well as companies in all the other capital cities, which went to considerable expenditure to install special plant and train men to do the work. If the Senate&#39;s reque&#39;st is adopted much of that plant, will be scrapped, and a considerable number of men will lose their employment. Altogether it will be a scandalous and anti-Australian act. I urge the Government to postpone consideration of the item until further inquiry has been made. </para>

                        <para>-  As has been explained on several occasions, a certain entry was made in the records of Captain Conway in 1917. The truth of this entry is unquestioned. Whether it was justifiable is a matter of opinion. Upon a report by Major-General Bruche, it was expunged  in 1931 by direction of the then Minister for Defence. There is noevidence of the entry having been injurious, and it is not proposed to take any further action in the matter. </para>

                    <para>The soldiers&#39; committee appointed by the previous Government recommended savings and economies in repatriation expenditure totalling &#163;1,300,000, including reductions approximating &#163;1,100,000 in war pensions. The operationof these recommendationsas embodied in the FinancialEmergency Act 1931 effected savings in war pensions in the year 1931-32, of approximately &#163;834,000 (the savings in 1931-32 did not operate for the full year), and in 1932-33 of approximately &#163;1,070,000. Owing to the operation of various factors, which affect the normal pensions expenditure, it is not possible to estimate, exactly the savings due to the Financial Emergency Act, The figures quoted are therefore only an approximate estimate. </para>
