Other concessions were made to the country which were of equal if not greater value. </para>

Will you, sir, in future have regard to the deliberate obstruction that is practised by Ministers, who require urgent questions that are asked by honorable members of the party to which I belong to be placed on the notice-paper, and to the attempts of the Government Whip to persuade Government supporters to leave the chamber when we are raising matters affecting our constituents on the motion for the adjournment of the House, so that the House may be automatically adjourned because of the absence of a quorum ? </para>

Ministers have the right to control the business of the House, and the  Speaker  cannot interfere with the exercise of it, unless what is done is in conflict with the Standing Orders or the acknowledged -practice of Parliament. </para>

Early this morning, when giving a ruling upon a point that had been raised by two honorable members on this side of the House, you stated that the Standing Orders made no provision for the circumstances that had then arisen, and that it was necessary to refer to other authorities which are used for the guidance of the  Speaker.  It was also stated that it was necessary for you to exercise discretionary powers apart altogether from the Standing Orders. We feel that we have the right to examine those discretionary powers, to see to what extent they may be exercised. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the matter will not be carried beyond this stage. On a previous occasion I made a very full statement, which I consider should be satisfactory to honorable members generally. When the Attorney-General rose to a point of order, I was about to say that I refuse to be cross examined on my rulings. The Standing Orders provide ample protection for any honorable member who is dissatisfied with the ruling of the Chair. In such a case he may move immediately a motion of dissent. That has not been done. I therefore regard the incident as closed. </para>

                        <para>- The function of the Government is, not to evolve such a scheme as that to which the honorable member has referred, but to co-operate with the industry towards that end. Such action is being taken. The Australian Apple and Pear Export Council has a definite scheme for the regulation of exports of apples and pears, with the object of preventing a repetition of last year&#39;s  disastrous results. An endeavour is also being made to secure the co-operation and collaboration of the Government of New Zealand, so that the two Dominions may act in concert. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a measure which is designed to establish a Supreme Court in the Territory for the Seat of Government. Its introduction represents a further step in the creation of a distinct judicial system for that Territory. While the Territory formed part of New South Wales, jurisdiction over it was exercisable by the Supreme Court of that State. That jurisdiction was originally vested in the High Court by the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909. In 1929, however, a change was made, and since then, though the High Court has continued to  hold  jurisdiction in relation to the Territory, it has exercised that jurisdiction, not under the Seat of Government Acceptance Act, but under section 30b of the Judiciary Act 1903-1927. In addition, the High Court is vested with such jurisdiction in relation to the Territory, both civil and criminal, as has from time to time been conferred upon it by ordinances made by the Governor-General. Further, under section 34a of the Judiciary Act, the High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all judgments whatsoever of any Court of the Territory, in accordance with the terms of those ordinances. The first step towards establishing separate courts for the Territory was taken in 1930, when a Court of Petty Sessions was set up under the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance. That court has practically taken the place of the District Court of New South Wales, and of the Court of Petty Sessions which previously had jurisdiction within the Territory. Accordingly, provision has already been made for the exercise of the inferior jurisdictions in the. Territory by special federal means. The jurisdiction vested in the High Court in relation to the Territory is sufficient to enable the residents of the Territory to obtain a judicial determination of such disputes as ordinarily arise . between them, or are likely to arise. It is, however, considered to be inappropriate that the High Court, which is the highest appellate tribunal in the Commonwealth, should discharge in the Territory similar functions to those which the Supreme Courts discharge in. the States. Matters of local territorial importance correspond with matters which are largely dealt&#39; with by the Supreme Courts of the States, and there are certain difficulties in the way of the High Court exercising this jurisdiction in Canberra. As honorable members are aware, the jurisdiction of the High Court is such as is provided for in the Constitution; and although it has accepted, and rightly accepted, the jurisdiction con&#39;ferred upon it in relation to the Territory, obviously it was not contemplated that it should act, to any considerable extent, in relation to the Territory in the same manner as the Supreme Courts act in relation to the States. Further, there is an objection to the existing system in  that, under the present law, the facilities available do not enable the public to pursue and enforce expeditiously their claims and &#39;rights. There is difficulty in obtaining justices of the High Court from time to time to sit in the Territory, and the jurisdiction is not in line with the other work which a justice of the High Court normally does. For some time it has been generally recognized that it would be desirable to have a court for the Territory with the same status as the Supreme Court of a State, because such a court would he more readily accessible than the High Court. With this object in view, this measure proposes to establish a Supreme Court of the Territory which will be known as the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will observe that it is not proposed to title the court, &#34; the Supreme Court of the Federal Capital Territory and that the phrase &#34;(Australian Capital Territory&#34; is used for the first time. That has been done because it is necessary that every court should have a seal, and it is important that that seal should be readily recognizable and identifiable in foreign countries. A seal which described the court as the Court of the Federal Capital Territory would give no indication of the locale  of the count, and, accordingly, it is proposed to use the phrase &#34;Australian Capital Territory &#34;. A minor difficulty arose out of an endeavour to use the description &#34; The Supreme Court of the Federal Capital Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia &#34; - and that perhaps would be the most .strictly accurate designation - but in that case it would be. almost impossible to have a seal of .a reasonable size and legible form. It is thought desirable to bring in the word &#34;Australia&#34; in order that the nature and character of the court may be perfectly plain. </para>
                    <para>Fortunately it has been possible to make arrangements which will  enable this change of judicial system in the Territory to be made with practically no expense. It has been provided that the court will he constituted by a judge of the Bankruptcy Court, or of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and the judge who is appointed a judge of the Supreme Court will not receive any additional remuneration for carrying out the duties of the new office. Arrangements have already been made, subject to the passing of this bill, under which His Honour Judge Lukin will perform the duties of the judge of this court without any additional remuneration. The Government is indebted to His Honour for the willingness with which he has. agreed to accept this additional duty. The court will- sit at Canberra, but it will be empowered to sit at any place in the Commonwealth if specified by the Governor-General under clause 9. Chamber business also may be dealt with at any place in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As the result of that arrangement there will be ready access to the court. It is hoped that the judge will be able to attend at Canberra fairly frequently, because the Federal Judge in Bankruptcy at present divides his time practically equally between Melbourne and Sydney, and it will be possible for him to deviate in his journeys between those cities to deal with any business which may require attention at Canberra. The jurisdiction of the court will be practically the same as that now exercisable by the High Court. In the first place it will have the same original jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, as immediately before the 1st January, 1911, which is the date of the inauguration of the legal system in the Territory, the Supreme Court of New South Wales had in relation to that State. Further, the court will have such jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, and whether original or otherwise, as is from time to time vested in the Supreme Court by ordinances made by the Governor-General. Under that head, for example, there will be probate jurisdiction and jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes, matrimonial jurisdiction and the like. The court will also have jurisdiction, with, such exemptions and subject to such conditions as are provided by ordinance, to hear and determine appeals from all judgments, convictions, orders and sentences of inferior courts having jurisdiction in the territory. Those provisions are contained in clause 11 of the bill. The result will, therefore, be that the residents of the territory will have in substance the same judicial machinery available to them as have the residents of the State3, and it will be provided at very little additional expense to the public revenue. </para>

                            <para>- That is difficult to say. It is provided in clause 6 that the court shall be a superior court of record and shall consist of one judge. It will be a superior court of record, but in a difFerent sort of hierarchy from the supreme courts of the States. As a rule, as honorable members know, judges of a supreme court are justices. In the bill the term &#34;judge&#34; is used, but that is a matter for the Parliament to decide. It can, if it thinks fit, utilize the title &#34;justice&#34;, but the term &#34;judge&#34; was adopted for the reason that it is proposed to take advantage of the availability of the services of the judge of the Bankruptcy Court who is also a judge of the Arbitration Court, and it would be rather &#34;difficult for one person to be a &#34; justice &#34; 3n one capacity and a &#34;judge&#34; in another. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Under existing circumstances the jurisdiction vested in the High Court is exercisable by a single justice, who, in pursuance of the Judiciary Act, has power to refer any matter or question to the Full Court. The Supreme Court will be constituted only by a single judge, and it is accordingly necessary to provide for some  such  reference as can at present be made. In a State the public have the right of having matters tried by a judge of the Supreme Court with an appeal to the Full Court of the High Court. There is no full court for the Territory, and it is not proposed to establish one, but it is proposed that the judge shall be entitled to state .any case or reserve any question for the consideration of the Full Court of the High Court or may direct any case or question to be argued before that court. In civil cases, normally, trials will be heard by the court without a jury. The court will have power in accordance with the practice which is in operation in all the States to order trials by a jury where that is thought to be fit and proper. The administration of law and equity by the court is to be concurrent. The rules of court are to be the rules of the. High Court or of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as far as applicable, but there is power to make special rules for the court itself. These rules of court will govern the practice and procedure of the court subject to what I have said as to the applicability at the present time of the rules of the High Court and of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Clause 27 provides that the procedure and practice will be governed by rules of court as I have mentioned, and clause 28 provides that the judge may make rules of court with respect to matters of practice and procedure, in particular with respect to the matters mentioned in sub-clause 2; and the rules of court must&#34; be forwarded to the Attorney-General, who may disallow any of them. That is the ordinary procedure in the States.- Provision is made in part IV. of the act for the appointment of a registrar, a sheriff and such other officers as are necessary. This will not involve any increase of staff. The duties to be . carried out in relation to these offices will be performed by officers of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department or the Crown Law Department.  </para>

                    <para>The High Court is to have  jurisdic-diction  to hear &#34; and _ determine appeals from judgments of the Supreme Court in civil matters. This jurisdiction is set out in clause 51 of the bill, and is practically the same as the jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to appeals from a single justice of that court. There is an appeal in matters involving any sum or matter at issue of the value of &#163;300, or involving directly or indirectly any claim, demand, or question to, or respecting, any property or any civil right amounting to that value, or affecting the status of any persons under the laws relating to aliens, marriage, divorce, bankruptcy, or insolvency, or being a matter with respect to which the High Court thinks fit to give special leave to appeal. As I have said, that is the same jurisdiction as the High Court has in relation to appeals from a single justice, and the provisions of the bill are framed upon that basis. </para>
                    <para>In criminal matters an appeal will lie to the High Court. In the cases set out in clause 52 of . the bill there may be an appeal against a conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone; or with the leave of the Supreme Court or judge, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or a question of mixed law and fact; or with the leave of the Full Court of the </para>
                    <para class="block">High Court, on any ground of appeal mentioned in the last preceding paragraph, or any other ground which appears to the Full Court of the High Court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, or with the leave of the Full Court of the High Court against the sentence passed on his conviction unless the sentence is one fixed by law. All forms of jurisdiction are either included in this bill or arc conferable by ordinance. It is proposed to confer by ordinance all the jurisdiction that is not referred to in the bill, and I refer especially to jurisdiction in probate and in matrimonial causes. That jurisdiction will be conferred by ordinance in the same way as &#39;it is at present rather inconveniently conferred upon the High Court. I have, however, abstained from providing that the court shall exercise admiralty jurisdiction, because of the unlikelihood of admiralty matters arising in Canberra. Honorable members who are familiar with the methods of establishing supreme  courts  in a State will be aware, when they read the bill, that it closely follows these methods. Various matters are dealt with to which I have not referred in this second-reading speech, as they are entirely matters for the committee stages of the bill. It is sufficient for me to summarize the position by saying that this court will have the same jurisdiction in relation to the Territory as a supreme court has in relation to a State. </para>
                    <para>This is a non-political bill, and merely represents an endeavour to provide in what I am glad to think is a ready and inexpensive method a needed improvement on the judicial machinery of the Territory. It is proposed that, when the bill is passed, it shall become law on the 1st January, 1934, or on such earlier date as may be fixed by proclamation. Upon the measure becoming law, any case or matter or proceeding pending in the High Court, in the exercise of its present territorial jurisdiction, is to be continued in the new supreme court as if it had been originated in that court, and provision has been made whereby the change from one court to another will not be attended by any inconvenience to litigants. </para>

                    <para class="block">Territory will like the new name that has been conferred upon the Federal Capital Territory by the bill, for I do not think that the words &#34; Federal Capital Territory &#34; are sufficiently descriptive. It is certain that, outside of Australia, very few would be able to determine whether &#34;Federal Capital Territory&#34; related to the United States of America, Australia, or a number of federated States somewhere or other. The term is a wise arid happy choice, and I should like to see its use extended. </para>
                    <para>The measure will not only effect a clarification, but also an enlargement, of the jurisdiction in the Australian Capital Territory. From time to time justices of the High Court have visited Canberra to perform work which is really outside their province. It appears to me to be quite wrong, when the High Court is in session elsewhere, to take one of its justices away from his duties to attend to matters in this Territory which are really beyond his province. It is always possible that an appeal might arise from the case, and, therefore, it is inadvisable to continue such a system. I welcome the clarification and enlargement of the powers and jurisdiction in this Territory, which will give an opportunity to those who, through desire or necessity, have to resort to litigation, to run through the gamut of courts of petty session, the Supreme Court, and thence to the High Court or Privy Council. I am pleased that no additional expense is to be incurred by the creation of a supreme court in the Australian Capital Territory, and believe a judge of the Bankruptcy Court or the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, will be acceptable, and everything that can be desired. Apart from his transport to and from Canberra, no other expense should be involved, as Canberra is fortunate in having any quantity of sheriffs and registrars in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. </para>
                    <para>I hope that as time passes, and the importance of Canberra is increasingly recognized the High Court itself will be situated here. This is the capital of the Commonwealth of Australia, which is potentially a great nation, and it is both desirable and proper that, at some time in the not distant future, the High </para>
                    <para>Court should be established here. It could then, visit various States as needed. I welcome this legislation, and I am sure that the people of Canberra will do likewise. </para>

                    <para>To a certain extent the bill may be regarded as one which deals with matters of procedure&#39; in regard to the proposed court, but I am mindful of the fact that the innovation also has a political aspect. The Attorney-General has indicated who shall preside over the Supreme Court, consequently, I am entitled to discuss the competency&#39; of his jurisdiction, an opportunity which would, not be afforded to me in normal circumstances. It is said that by appointing a certain judge to preside over the court, the country will not be involved in any additional expense. To me that either indicates that this gentleman has little or nothing to do at present, or that he will have very little to do at Canberra. In times of distress, when so many in the community are suffering, it would appear that this person is one of the most favoured in the community, for already he receives a substantial remuneration in his capacity as judge of another court, in addition to which he draws a pension from the Queensland Government. That represents an appreciable bur. den on the taxpayers of Australia, which I contend could be obviated. Without going into details, I point out that it is apparent that when a new government department is established it is necessary to expend money if it is to function properly, and this Supreme Court will be no exception to the rule. In the circumstances,- I question the advisability of establishing it. </para>
                    <para>I offer no compliments to the gentleman who is to preside over the court, as I do not consider that he is deserving of congratulation by this Parliament. This is the gentleman who has made himself notorious in circles among which it is my privilege to move, and also among people whom I have the privilege to represent. As a result of his actions, many persons have suffered privation, and will never regain the position which they formerly occupied in the industrial world. It is indeed a sad chapter in Australian history. I can clearly visualize many close personal friends and their families who have suffered intensely as a result of the political action brought about through the instrumentality of this man. Consequently, rather than express compliments on his behalf they have nothing but harsh terms to apply to him, and I join with them in the expression of those opinions. </para>

I resent the insulting attitude and sneering remarks of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn).</inline> I am responding to the statement of the Attorney-General that thanks are due to this man. I hold the contrary opinion, and I hope that what I have said will reach his ears. Clause 14 of the bill provides that the judge of the court shall have power to direct whether certain cases are to be tried before a jury or a judge alone. It is our boast that, under the system of trial by jury, every person who appears before, a court is assured of justice without any danger of such influences as I have referred to being brought to bear. According to this bill, however, the judge is to be given power to deny a litigant the right to have his cause pleaded before a jury, and that is a serious matter for those who may appear before the particular judge who is to preside over this court. </para>

                            <para>- I do realize my responsibilities, and shall endeavour to discharge my duty as I see it, without the assistance or direction of the Attorney-General. Another important point is the qualifications required of those who may be called to serve on a jury. I have- observed that, by first stipulating certain qualifications, it is possible to have a jury empanelled whose political opinions are well known beforehand. When that is done for the trial of a case involving political issues, the interests of those who look to the court for justice may be seriously prejudiced. I am thinking particularly of the property qualification, which is sometimes required in New South Wales, of those who are to serve as jurymen, and if it is proposed to introduce the principle in the Federal  Capital  Territory, I must oppose the bill. It may be said that, in many respects, the courts possess greater powers than does the Parliament, because, although we make the laws, the courts interpret them. It is proposed in this bill to invest the presiding judge with wide discretionary powers, which ho may exercise in the interpretation of legislation passed by Parliament, and if this power is exercised contrary to what litigants may regard as their proper interests, they may be put to the expense of having to appeal to the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- If there is no better way, it is of the greatest importance then for us to  consider  who is appointed to preside over the court. The human factor, with all its political prejudices, is introduced, and it is idle for us to pretend that this factor does not influence judges in giving their rulings. It is important, therefore, that Parliament should do whatever is possible to see that the course of justice is  not  influenced by the private opinions or prejudices of members of the judiciary. These matters are of the greatest importance to the poorer sections of the community who have not the means to appeal against what they regard as an unjust decision of the court. It is commonly accepted that a civil litigant, or an accused person, possessing ample means has more chance of obtaining a legal decision satisfactory to him than has the person with no means. He is able to fight his case from court to court, whereas the poor person must accept the first decision, whatever it may be. I am anxious, therefore, that the lower court should be so constituted as to enable all persons, whether rich or poor, to secure justice. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> Clause 9 of the bill states that the court may sit at Canberra, and in such other places in the Commonwealth as are from time to time specified by the Governor-General by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> I understood from the speech of the Attorney-General, that this was to be a court for die Federal Capital Territory, and, if that is so, why should it be necessary to provide for sittings to be held in other parts of the Commonwealth? So far as I have been able to gather, the Attorney-General did not explain the reason for this. As the usual practice of adjourning the debate has not been followed in this case, it has not been possible to make ourselves fully conversant with the points that have&#39; been raised, and we have to rely upon our  recollection of the not very explanatory remarks of the Attorney-General. </para>

                            <para>- That may be true. But honorable members who are associated with me cannot study these measures to the extent that they wish, on account of the refusal of the Government - in which the Attorney-General played a leading part -to give them a little assistance.We hope to be in a position one day to repay that injustice in full. Every man has his day, and honorable members opposite will not always have control of the situation. </para>

                    <para>So far as one can gather, the bill makes no provision for the granting of legal aid to personswho are in what may be regarded as necessitous circumstances. I do not suppose that there is a town or city in Australia where there are not persons who, having fallen foul of the law, have not the means to obtain legal assistance in their defence. If the courts were freed from many restrictions in regard to procedure, those persons would have no difficulty in presenting their case without legal assistance. In existing circumstances, it frequently happens that a trial is prejudiced because of ignorance of the requirements of court procedure. I have seen accused persons endeavour to conduct their own cases,, and because of faulty presentation, due to ignorance of the details of procedure, have decisions: recorded against them. Provision should; be made that will ensure the fair trial of cases that will come before the Supreme Court that is to be established in the Federal Capital Territory. There is in New South Wales a. legal aid department, to which application may be made for legal assistance. The. matter is so, important that such assistance should be available, in every jurisdiction. </para>

Supreme Court of the Territory. I object to the appointment of that individual. Although the Attorney-General has said that this measure is non-contentious and nonpolitical, we cannot overlook the fact that this particular judge so incensed the late Government by what were considered inhuman acts against the workers, that it removed him from the bench of the Arbitration Court, and placed him in the position that he now occupies. </para>

                            <para>- I have not named anybody ; but the Attorney-General has done so. Clause 14 of the bill provides that, unless, the judge otherwise orders, the trialin every suit in the Supreme Court shall be by the court without a jury. Can we expect justice in those circumstances? Under clause 8, the Governor-General may appoint a judge of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy or of the Commonwealth. Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to be the judge of the Supreme Court. What may we expect if a judge sitting in chambers refers a case into open court, and it is heard without a jury by a certain judge? Such a system is unfair and unjust. Trials should be by jury in every case. </para>

                    <para>Sub-clause 3 of clause 8 provides that the salary at present received by the judge of the Bankruptcy Court or the Arbitration Court shall be paid to him as judge of the Supreme Court. I understand that the present remuneration of the Bankruptcy and Arbitration Court judges is &#163;2,500 a year. The judge in bankruptcy, as we know, was appointed to the Arbitration Court by the Bruce Page Government, after his retirement from the Supreme Court of Queensland, from which State he is in receipt of a pension of &#163;1,000 a year. The bill should provide that when any person appointed to a judicial position is in receipt of a pension from another government, consideration should be given to that circumstance, when fixing his emoluments. We know perfectly well, that the judge of whom I am speaking absolutely refused to accept any reduction  of  salary in accordance with the Premiers plan. But in his capacity as a judge  of  the Federal Arbitration Court, he increased the hours of labour from 44 to 48 weekly, and reduced the wages of the timberworkers. Despite what the Attorney-General has said to the contrary, I submit that the Arbitration Court is distinctly a political body, and that the judge in question was removed from that court to the Commonwealth Bankruptcy  Court,  because his decisions were antagonizing the workers. It is quite apparent that the Bankruptcy Court does  not  provide sufficient work to fully occupyhis time, consequently other work must befound for him. As a result the taxpayers of Australia are to be subjected to a considerable expenditure by the establishment of a Supreme Court in the Federal Territory. There is practically no crime in the Federal Capital, and it would speak volumes for the law-abiding: character of its citizens if they continued without a Supreme Court. </para>
                    <para>Apart from the expenditure that will be involved in the appointment of a judge&#39;s associate, the bill provides for the appointment of other officers. A good many understrappers, such as clerks, cleaner&#39;s, &#38;c, will be required, and the salaries of- these officials will absorb a considerable amount of money. We have been told that the time has arrived when we should exercise the most rigid -economy. I submit that no economy will result from the establishment of a Supreme Court in the Federal Capital. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> The bill does not  pTovide  that any litigant may appear before the court in person to conduct his own case if he so desires. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to mention any names, but the case to which I  ^ refer was that of a man from Whitebridge, who upon the death of his wife, resisted the granting of probate to her sons by a previous marriage. He pointed out that the estate of which his wife was possessed, had been entirely built up with his own earnings. But inasmuch as she had children by a former marriage, he was disinherited. He appeared before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and subsequently applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justic&#176;</inline> McTiernan in chambers for the right to - appear in person before the High Court to conduct his appeal against a decision of the probate judge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McTiernan refused his application. He then requested the Attorney-General to allow him to conduct hi3 own case before the High Court, and was informed that he must employ an attorney. That course was quite impossible, because he was possessed of no means. This man had worked all his life, -but had been foolish enough to place the whole of his estate in the hands of his second wife, only to find, upon her decease, that she had failed to leave him a single penny. Thus a very grave injustice was inflicted upon him. I wrote to the Attorney-General about this case, but failed to obtain any satisfaction. The bill contains no provision to compel a judge in chambers to allow a litigant to appear before the High Court to conduct his own case. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not pretend to be a Daniel, but I do know how injustice is frequently inflicted upon litigants who cannot afford to pay counsel to represent them. It has become almost a legend that one who goes to law without being possessed of means is very unfortunately placed. Everybody knows that the litigant who is possessed of the most money always has the best chance of securing a verdict in his favour. Justice is governed by points of law. I have nothing whatever to say against the Supreme Court of any State, although I have sometimes had occasion to criticize certain judges severely. Upon the present occasion I merely wish to make a somewhat lengthy quotation from a wonderful book, entitled <inline font-style="italic">A - Sovereign People,</inline> a study of Swiss democracy by Henry  Demarest  Lloyd, which is edited by John A. Hobson. This quotation, which I embodied in a speech that I delivered in this House seven years ago, reads - </para>

                        <para>The employers and employed in each group of trades elect their representatives, fifteen for each side, to form a  conseil.  The numbers choose by ballot a committee consisting of  president,  vice-president, secretary, and vice-secretary, the presidency and The other offices being held alternately by an employer and a workman, with the further proviso that, when the  president  or the secretary is an employer, the vice-officer must be a workman, and vice versa. </para>
                        <para>The work of the  conseil  is divided as follows. First comes the conciliation board, consisting of an employer and a .workman, who preside by turns. This board has summary powers of decision in cases involving sums not exceeding twenty francs. In case of disagreement between the members, or where sufficient evidence for a summary judgment is lacking, the case is referred to the second board, the tribunal. </para>
                        <para>The Tribunal de  Prud&#39;hommes  consists of a president, three employers, and three workmen, hears evidence and, where necessary, summons experts and gives final decisions in cases not involving more than 500 francs. </para>

                    <para class="block">I quote that to show the widespread influence of the Court of Wise Men in Switzerland. Thousands of pounds are expended every year in the hearing of cases before the arbitration tribunals of Australia. For instance the hearing of the tramway arbitration case, which affected the tramway systems throughout Australia, cost the association &#163;20,000. Gold medals were presented to the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> and myself, by the Tramway and Omnibus Association, on account of the assistance that we gave to that association during the hearing. In Switzerland justice i3 meted out at little cost to the parties in dispute. Out of 6,341 cases before the industrial court of Switzerland, 4,245 were settled by conciliation and 1,885 by arbitration, 11 cases being unsettled. In some cantons the procedure is entirely or virtually gratuitous, the cost being borne by the public. In other, cantons a single court fee, varying from 1 franc (lOd. par value) to 20 or 30 francs is imposed. I am anxious that my fellow men should be able to obtain justice in the courts of Australia at the lowest possible cost. Justice is frequently set aside by points of* law, and those who are wealthy have a great advantage in our courts. I suggest that only one lawyer, or barrister, should appear in a case of dispute, and that the appellant and defendant should  have the choice of counsel provided by the Commonwealth  of Australia. I should like to see the nationalization of our system of law so that any citizen could put his case before a court in the same way as a case is argued before the courts of conciliation of Switzerland, no third party being allowed to interfere. Cases are heard before the pacificator, who confers with the parties, perhaps across a table. If he were deciding the case of say, Brown versus Maloney, he would say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> : &#34; I advise you to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maloney&#39;s</inline> offer. &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> might prefer to take the case to a higher court, in which a lawyer can appear for either the plaintiff or the defendant, but no further evidence is permitted to be called. The duty of the pacificator is to, try to make peace between citizen and citizen. I hope that the younger members of this chamber will make&#39; a careful study of the book, <inline font-style="italic">A Sovereign People,</inline> so that they may be able to carry on the good work which is now beyond my efforts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> -the present High Commis sioner, and also the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> when overseas, failed to procure for me at my request certain books on industrial arbitration. The members of the Swiss consulate were generous in that regard and I take this opportunity to express my grateful appreciation of their action. </para>

                        <para>. - Several points have been raised by honorable members during this debate. The personnel of the jury will be determined under a jury ordinance which at present exists and has already been the subject of discussion in this Parliament. The question was raised as to why it was necessary to provide for sittings in places other than Canberra, but that is being done entirely for the convenience of litigants, so as to bring about expedition in the hearing of cases and to save expense. It is unlikely that there will be many formal sittings of the court per  annum,  and it would be very , expensive if, on every application, the court had to attend at Canberra. There is some misapprehension which is not unnatural with respect to legal aid, because the fact that there is*1 any provision for legal aid is not directly discernible; but in section 69 of the Judiciary Act there is a provision for legal aid in criminal cases under federal law. So far as civil cases are concerned, the bill provides that the rules of the High Court shall apply until other rules are made. Under the rules of the High Court, order 4, there is a provision which enables persons who can prove that they have less than &#163;25 worth of property, to obtain legal assistance; and a barrister or solicitor is directed to assist, and the barrister or solicitor so directed shall not be at liberty to refuse his assistance unless the court or justice decides that he has some good reason for refusing. - When an order is made in favour of a person under these rules no court fees are payable. There are provisions for legal aid in the act although it is somewhat difficult to trace them. </para>

That definition is desirable, irrespective of what may be one&#39;s view-point on other subjects. Clause  11  provides that the court shall have certain jurisdiction, and that other jurisdiction shall be provided by ordinance. I stated in my second-reading speech, perhaps rather briefly, that there already exists an ordinance authority conferring jurisdiction on the High Court in connexion with probate and matrimonial causes.

                        <para>. -  In civil cases of any magnitude quite a number of applications may be required before trial is reached. It must be remembered that the judge of this court will preside over the Bankruptcy Court which will sit in Sydney and Melbourne, the work of this court being fitted in between the sittings of that other court. There will he only a limited number of&#34; formal sittings of the Supreme Court at Canberra, probably from two to four a year, and provision exists to avoid delay in the case of criminal trials, as they have to be dealt with promptly. In a civil case of any magnitude, there are many proceedings, some of which may involve application to a judge in chambers, and if the parties had to wait for the judge to come to Canberra many months might pass, and the hearing would be delayed. I assure honorable members that this arrangement will make matters more convenient and expeditious. </para>

                            <para>- Only recently a man who was to be tried in Canberra asked to be tried in Sydney because the witnesses were available there, and it was difficult and expensive to bring them to Canberra. . Everything depends upon the  circumstances of the case. Criminal cases which have originated in the Territory have been tried both in Canberra and Sydney, but, of course, the jury is always drawn from the locality where the trial is held. There is no general virtue or advantage in having the jury drawn from one place or another. Sometimes it is thought that one locality favours the accused and another the Crown, and vice versa. An accused might prefer Sydney, believing that a local jury would know too much about him, but it is quite impossible to say in advance which venue will suit either side. This is a wise provision in the interests of all concerned. The object will be to have the court at Canberra as a general rule, and an order for a trial anywhere else will be .made only in special circumstances. It will be seen that the clause provides that - </para>

                        <para>.- I believe with my Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> that there is no necessity to establish a Supreme Court at Canberra, as the necessary machinery already exists to try cases here. I recall that criminal cases have already been tried here, &#39;by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McTiernan. Nor do I believe that the establishment of this court will not involve additional expenditure. I also believe that as the court will be able, at the direction of the Government, to move to any other place in the Commonwealth, that may be done to suit political purposes. In what  is known as the Mayfield Eviction Case, after two juries had declined to convict the accused, the venue of the court was changed to Singleton, away from the industrial area. </para>

                            <para>- It was done because the State Government feared that no jury in Newcastle could be found to con vict those men The inference to be drawn from the interjection of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> is that the people of Newcastle could not be trusted to give an unbiased verdict. I resent that, and I know that the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> will also do so. Many juries have been selected from Newcastle which have - performed their duty conscientiously and well. Merely for political purposes, and in a desperate attempt to obtain a conviction, the venue of this court was moved to Singleton. Perhaps as things unfold themselves we shall find that this bill is really implementing machinery which will be used to give effect to amendments concerning conciliation and arbitration and for deportation purposes. </para>

My inference from the remark of the Attorney-General is that the only jury which will deal justly with a &#39; matter is one which will convict. Honorable members opposite laughed when the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> said that no jury in Newcastle would convict these men. The reason was that the men were innocent of the charge that was made against them. I did not intend to participate in the debate until the Attorney-General made his unfair implication, which casts a slur upon the people of Newcastle. I am against any provision which enables the Government to shift the venue of trial from one place . to another merely to secure a conviction. </para>

                            <para>- The question raised by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> should receive the serious consideration of the committee. Honorable members on this side of the chamber who have offended against the Chair have been distinctly told that it is necessary for them to rise in their places and use the words, &#34; I withdraw and apologize.&#34; The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> did not rise in his place, but merely said that he would obey the ruling of the Chair. If the Chair maintains the ruling it has given, that the form of withdrawal and apology adopted by the Minister is sufficient, other honorable members will adopt that form in future. The Standing Orders do not cover every point that is likely to arise, and, as the  Speaker  said last night, those that are not so covered are governed by the rules laid down in May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice.</inline> &#34;We appear to be establishing so many precedents, however, that, instead of our looking to the House of Commons for guidance, it may look to us in the near future. As I believe that the ruling of the Chair is entirely wrong, I have much pleasure in seconding the motion of dissent that has been moved by the honorable member for &#34;West Sydney. </para>

                    <para>This measure provides for the regulation of the transfer of butter and cheese from one State to another, and is on similar lines to the Dried Fruits Act, which was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1928. Its main object is to ensure to all producers of butter and cheese a fair share, and not more, of the advantages and disadvantages of selling within Australia and overseas. </para>
                    <para>Five years ago, Australia exported 45,000 tons of butter overseas. During the year ended the 30th June last, this total was more than doubled, having reached the high figure of nearly 101,000 tons, of which no less than 93,700 tons were sent to the United Kingdom. &#39; The value to Australia of the export trade in that year was &#163;9,270,000. Some of  thi3  welcome increase was, of course, due to the expansion of the areas devoted to dairying. During recent years States like Queensland have largely increased their dairying settlements. Not a little of the increased production, however,  is  due to improvement in farm technique, pasture improvement, fodder conservation, improvement in the type of cattle  raised,  and the exclusion of unprofitable animals following the wider use of the  system  of herd-testing. In these activities, the Federal  and  State governments have assisted, and are assisting generously. </para>
                    <para>As I have already indicated, Great Britain is the principal purchaser of Australia&#39;s dairy products. Indeed, apart from a valuable market for some 6,000 tons in the East, the United Kingdom represents practically the only outlet for our exportable surplus, and year  by  year  we  have been sending greatly increased quantities to that market. Unfortunately, however, Australia is not the only country which has been developing and increasing its butter production. As I have shown, Australia&#39;s exportable surplus has increased during the past  five  years  by  56,000 tons per annum, while our sister dominion, New Zealand, has increased her export during the same period by 40,000 tons. As in our case, the only worth-while outlet for New Zealand&#39;s surplus is the United Kingdom: This means that from these two sources alone Great Britain receives nearly 100,000 tons of butter per annum in excess of the figures of  five  years ago. At the same time increasing quantities of Danish butter were being placed on the British market, mainly because of the restrictions imposed on imports  by  other continental countries, and iri these circumstances a fall of prices in the United Kingdom was inevitable in order to bring about the necessary increased consumption to absorb the greatly increased imports. This explains why the London price for Australian butter several months ago fell  as  low as 64s. per cwt. To-day the price is in the region of 72s. per cwt., which, when the difference in exchange between English and Australian currency  of 25 per cent, and the Paterson plan bounty of 3d. per lb. are added, gives the Australian producer a gross return of ls. Id. per lb., from which, of course, all transport and other charges must be deducted. It is recognized that, apart from maintaining our product at the highest possible standard of quality, we can, unfortunately, do nothing to influence the overseas price of butter, as this is governed by factors entirely outside our control. While the Australian butter producers must, therefore, accept world prices for their exportable surplus, they have claimed, and not without justification, that the selling price of butter in Australia should not be based on the greatly depressed overseas price. </para>
                    <para>For some years past there has been in operation a voluntary scheme known as the Paterson plan, and designed to assist in ensuring a more remunerative price for butter sold in Australia. Under this plan a levy is paid on all butter manufactured, and from the fund thus created a bounty is paid on all butter exported. The bounty is of course limited to those contributing to the plan. </para>
                    <para>The existence of a bounty  on  exported butter brings about an automatic increase of the local price, and the dairying industry has profited considerably from this enhanced price. When the Paterson scheme commenced, the export of butter amounted to only one-third of the total Australian production, and the levy of 1-Jd. per lb. which was then operating was more than sufficient to pay a bounty of from 3d. to 4d. per lb. on the export proportion. The extraordinary growth of our export trade to over 50 per cent, of the total production meant that an increase of funds was necessary to pay the same bounty on the greatly increased export proportion. Consequently it became necessary either to reduce the rate of bounty or to increase the rate of levy. As a matter of fact both were done, and for the last four years the levy has been paid at the rate of lid. per lb., while at one stage during that period the rate of bounty was as low as  2&#189;d.  per lb., but it is now 3d. per lb. </para>
                    <para class="block">In view of the voluntary nature of the Paterson plan, the dairying industry has found difficulty in sustaining it. During the past few months there has been an increasing tendency on the part of factories to break away from the scheme, and the industry claims that another section of the butter-producing industry - I refer to the people who make butter on farms - are not making any contribution towards the stabilization of the industry. These persons, together with the factories which have broken away from the plan, are reaping the full advantages and benefits of the improved conditions made possible by means of the Paterson plan. In consequence of these circumstances, and because of the large amount of butter being exported, the scheme is rapidly losing its effectiveness. </para>
                    <para>The question of introducing State and Federal measures on the lines of the existing dried fruits legislation was first discussed at a conference of Ministers for Agriculture held in May last, and in the following month the matter was further discussed at a conference of Premiers at which the Commonwealth Government agreed that it would fully consider any proposal for the introduction of Commonwealth enabling legislation in the event of the adoption by the States of marketing measures in respect of butter. </para>
                    <para>The States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, which, in the &#34;aggregate, produce approximately 90 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the total output of butter and cheese, respectively, in Australia, have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation under which a board will be established in each of those States to regulate the intra-state marketing of butter and cheese. </para>
                    <para>One of the principal provisions in each of the State measures is that which empowers the respective State Ministers in conjunction with the proposed boards&#39; to determine the quantities of butter and cheese which may be sold on the home market. The States, however, are not empowered to regulate the interstate transfer of goods without which it would not be possible to ensure that the balance of butter and cheese over and above that, determined for home consumption shall be exported overseas. To meet this position, it is essential that there should be Commonwealth legislation which will prohibit interstate trade in butter and&#39; cheese except under licence, which licence-  will only be granted subject to the condition that the licensee shall comply with export quotas fixed by the Minister for Commerce. These export quotas will be determined on the recommendation of prescribed authorities appointed by the Commonwealth. In those States where boards are established under State legislation it is proposed to appoint those boards to act as prescribed authorities. </para>
                    <para>The system of export quotas prevents price cutting on the Australian market, and ensures that the producer will take his fair share of the less remunerative export markets. That is to say, the burden of. export is equally shared. </para>
                    <para>I have already indicated that the provisions of the bill which is now before the House are similar to those of the Commonwealth Dried Fruits Act, which has been in operation since 1928, and I now propose to outline briefly for the information of honorable members the events which led up to the introduction of this legislation. Prior to 1928, a board was set up under State legislation in each of the four dried vine fruit producing States- Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia - mainly with the object of fixing export quotas to prevent a minority of packers from placing all their fruit on the local market, and leaving the export  market to  those packers who were prepared to export rather than glut the Australian market. Little or no difficulty arose in connexion with this export quota arrangement until one of the boards, acting under its statutory powers, compulsorily acquired a quantity of dried fruit from a packer who was endeavouring to sell fruit in another State, which, in the opinion of the board, should have been exported. Litigation followed, and it was subsequently held by the High Court that a board set up under State law had no power to interfere in any way with interstate trade, because the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution provided that interstate trade must be absolutely free. The States, thereupon, appealed to the Commonwealth Government which brought down legislation in 1928 to supplement the State law to enable the boards again to become operative. Regulations made under that legislation provide that the prescribed authorities - State dried fruits boards - shall issue &#34; Owners &#34; licences in respect of the owners who deliver fruit to a carrier for carriage into another State, and &#34; Carriers &#34; licences in respect of the carriers. The principal conditions which owners are required to observe under &#34; Owners &#34; licences are - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>The only condition which carriers are required to observe under &#34; Carriers &#34; licences is that they shall not accept delivery of any dried vine fruits from the owner for interstate carriage unless the owner is the holder of an &#34;Owners&#34; licence. </para>
                    <para>This dried fruits legislation has operated very successfully in conjunction with the State legislation for over five years, and there is no reasonable doubt that the dried fruits industry has been carried on during that period with a greater measure of stability than has attended most other primary industries. The export of dried vine fruits is efficiently regulated by a Commonwealth Board established under the Dried Fruits Export Control Act, and prices within Australia are fixed by a voluntary organization known as the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which represents about 95 per cent. of those engaged in this industry. </para>
                    <para>The Government has given a great deal of careful consideration to the proposal to apply a similar system of control to the dairying industry in relation to interstate trade which will not necessarily involve any increase of price to the Australian consumer over and above the additional cost at present brought about by the operation of the Paterson plan. The Government believes it is necessary in the interests of the industry that those engaged in it should be protected by legislation against the possibility of glut-tod home markets and consequent adverse realizations. </para>
                    <para>It will be noted that the provisions of the bill are not to be brought  into  operation until a date to be fixed by proclamation. In this connexion,  the  Government has decided that the  proclamation  will not be issued until appropriate steps have been taken to protect the consumers against any  unreasonable  increase of the local price above London parity. A clause to this end has already been inserted in the bill, which is now before the Victorian Parliament. The issue of the proclamation, will also be dependent upon a poll of producers of butter and cheese being taken by each such State to decide whether a majority of such producers desire the enactment of the  State  legislation. It will be realized by honorable members that, notwithstanding the assurances given to the Government by representatives of the industry to the effect that a majority of the producers  are  favorably disposed towards marketing legislation of this nature, it is desirable that the producers should be given the light to decide this matter for themselves. </para>
                    <para>There appears to be some doubt at the moment whether the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania intend to introduce legislation for the regulation of interstate trade in butter and cheese. The Government, however, is prepared to give effect to the Commonwealth legislation provided the poll taken by the States which pass intra-state legislation indicates that, in those States where an affirmative vote is cast the aggregate production of butter and  cheese  is not less than 60 per cent. of the  total  Australian output. </para>

                    <para>It is scarcely necessary for me to tell honorable members that the position of the wheat industry has given more concern to the members of my Government than, probably, any other single problem during the present year. Wheat is in many ways the most difficult and the most complicated of all the world&#39;s unsolved economic problems. The industry suffers both from increased production and from dwindling demand. Great areas of Canada, the United States of America, the Argentine and Australia depend for their prosperity on the yield and price of their wheat crops, and wheat is one of the staple products of European agriculture. Again, the prosperity of the wheat-farmer concerns in varying degrees of importance many other important industries and activities, the makers of agricultural machinery, the fertilizer manufacturers, the railways, shipping companies and so on. Indeed, so widespread are the effects of the prosperity or otherwise of the wheat industry, that it is commonly said that advancing wheat spells general prosperity and cheap wheat general depression. </para>
                    <para>Nowhere have I seen the <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> in the wheat industry better summarized than in an article by Professor S. H. Wadham, of theUniversity of Melbourne, a noted authority on the subject, which was published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 1st November, 1933. From that article I quote the following: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Many paradoxes are recorded in the pages of history, but probably none has ever been more farcical yet more tragic than the present position of the world&#39;s wheat industry. Some countries, by paying bounties to their farmers on the wheat they have grown, are fostering production at a price level which is definitely unprofitable. Others, working on the opposite plan, by keeping foreign wheat from crossing their boundaries by high tariffs, are raising the price of foodstuffs to their people. Meetings to try. and end the tragi-farce have terminated fruitlessly or in such weak forms of agreement as to be almost useless. An absurd position, yet when it is analysed from the stand-point of any individual country, it seems quite logical and practically unavoidable, as long as present-day political systems and national fears and jealousies persist. It illustrates the im practicability of applying economic principles when the forces of national polities aro in the field. Yet, if there is to be real progress for mankind, if men and women arc to obtain more and more useful things in return for their work, those principles will have to be understood and followed. The silly tragedy of the world&#39;s mentality in 1033 is nowhere better exemplified than by the wheat impasse. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Two problems of outstanding importance lave faced the Government in this matter. First, it was compelled to reach a decision with regard to the international agreement recently entered into by wheat-producing and wheatpurchasing countries, the specific objective of which was the raising of world wheat prices. I remind honorable members that the Commonwealth Government was not a willing participant in the early stages of the negotiations. &#34;When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> stated at the World Monetary and Economic Conference that&#39; restriction of production was a policy of despair, he&#39; echoed views that were widely held in this country. I need not recall to honorable members the circumstances which caused, not only the Commonwealth Government, but also almost all the State Governments, and most of the accredited representatives of the wheat-growers, to give assent to the proposals embodied in the agreement. </para>
                    <para>The second problem has arisen from the fact that, at current world prices, the wheat industry in Australia is being carried on at a loss, and that, generally, growers are not receiving an adequate return for their labours. This is the problem with which, in the Wheatgrowers Belief Bill, we are immediately concerned. The principal reasons for the seriously depressed prices of wheat over the past few years are as follows: - </para>
                    <para>First, there has been continued expansion of production in the principal exporting countries, with assistance from governments which has enabled producers to remain in production, who, owing to reduced returns, would have otherwise gone out of wheat-farming. Figures of Australian production illustrate this point - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="143331193312016_21_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>Secondly, there has been a growing  policy in Europe of imposing high duties and import quotas with high internal prices, thus bringing about increased production at home and reduction of imports. For example, in 192S-29, with an import duty of 2s. 6d. per cwt., Germany produced 123,000,000 bushels and imported 78,000,000. In 1931-32, by which time the duty had been increased to 12s&#39;. 6d. per cwt., production was 184,000,000 bushels and imports were 23,000,000. The price of wheat in Germany in recent years has been as high as 14s. 6d. a bushel, English currency. </para>
                    <para>Thirdly, as a result of the factors already mentioned, huge stocks have accumulated in North America. On the 1st August last, these stocks amounted to 440,000,000 bushels in excess of the normal carry-over. So serious has the world position of the wheat industry become that proposals, to which I have already referred, were made and ultimately adopted under which exports from the exporting countries were to be restricted to agreed limitations. The details of this agreement have already been explained to the House, and need not be again traversed in connexion with the present bill. As one of the principal exporting countries, Australia has suffered severely by the serious fall of wheat prices, and for the past two seasons the Commonwealth Government has found it necessary to come to the assistance of the industry. In 1931-32, the assistance took the form of a bounty on all wheat sold from the crop of that year. The rate of bounty was 44d. a bushel, and the total expenditure was &#163;3,414,000. In 1932-33 a special grant of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,000,000</inline> was made to wheat-growers through the State Governments. This assistance was generally allocated by the &#39;States to individual growers on the proportion of acreage sown to wheat, though certain sums were set aside to assist growers who were in necessitous circumstances. </para>
                    <para class="block">New South &#34;Wales also utilized a portion of the sum provided to offset charges on freight. &#34;When the budget for 1933-34was being framed no provision was made for special assistance to wheat-growers, for two reasons: first, because of the general relief afforded to industry under the tax remission proposals embodied in the budget; secondly, because of the anticipation of a rise in world prices following upon the international agreement. It is probably too soon for the effects of reduced taxation to be felt in the costs of primary products ; the beneficial effects will no doubt be realized later. The average export price of Australian wheat in Australian currency in recent years has been - </para>

                        <graphic href="143331193312016_22_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">While the international agreement was being negotiated, and during the speculative operations which took place in the United States of America at the same time, there was a rise of prices. In May last the price was 2s.11¾., and it rose steadily until in September it reached 3s. 5d. Since September the price has declined, and at present it is about 2s. 7d. a bushel f.o.b. Australian ports. Advices received from the High Commissioner&#39;s Office in London suggest that immediate price prospects are difficult to forecast. Keen competition for the relatively small import market available, principally on the part of Russia and Danubia, has caused the recent weakness. Recent comment in informed circles suggests the probability of the market firming; but the prospects must, it is feared, be classed as uncertain. The hopes of higher prices, which it was thought would follow the international agreement, have not, therefore, been realized so far. This does not mean, however, that the agreement has been fruitless. Prices would almost certainly have declined still more had not the heavy surpluses in the United States of America and Canada been kept off the market. </para>
                    <para>Costs of production of wheat in Australia are difficult to arrive at. This is due to the varying conditions arising our. of locality and to the different yields per acre. Various authorities have made estimates on the subject, but the Government does not feel justified in basing action on the figures available. The Government is, however, satisfied that, at current world prices, the industry is being carried on at a loss, and that generally growers are not receiving an adequate return for their labours. That being so, consideration has been given to the question of granting further financial help, and the bill before the House embodies the Government&#39;s proposals. </para>
                    <para>In the necessarily full consideration which is given to a subject of this character by the Government, very serious problems arise. First, there is the question as to whether a grant is justified at all; and, if so, its extent and the method of distribution. Secondly, there is the very important question of the raising of the necessary funds. </para>
                    <para>In exploring such a question, it will be realized that the Government must consider the country as a whole, because, in the last analysis, . financial assistance made available by governments to one section of the community must be borne by some or all of the others. The Government has fully realized the need for some help to the wheat industry. Australia is more than ever dependent upon its export industries; and in this respect wheat production, and the welfare of the industry, are of the highest national importance. After the fullest investigation and inquiry, it was decided that, on the basis of present prices, the expenditure of a sum of &#163;3,000,000 was justified, and that the wheat-growers of Australia should be assisted to this extent. </para>
                    <para>The financing of &#163;3,000,0.00 in present circumstances is no easy task, and the Government has given much consideration to this phase of the matter. Broadly speaking, there are three sources of finance possible - </para>

                    <para>I propose to deal first with the possibility of borrowing the money.When assistance of approximately &#163;3,500,000 was provided for the wheat bounty in 1931, the finance was arranged by borrowing the full amount. There was no special condition about repayment, but the present Government has made provision on the basis of repayment in fifteen years, on which basis there will be an annual charge of about &#163;300,000&#39; in interest and sinking fund for that period. </para>
                    <para>In normal circumstances, loan fund moneys should be used only for works of a reproductive character. A departure from this principle is justified only on the grounds of serious financial emergency or special circumstances of a nonrecurring character. The financing of the wheat bounty in 1931 from loan moneys was a measure of emergency, but the financing of bounties of this nature from loan funds as a matter of practice is not sound policy. The Government, therefore, is not prepared, even if it were practicable to do so, to finance the whole of the assistance this year by borrowing. </para>
                    <para>As to the second method, the budget for this year contemplates a deficit of $1,176,000. For th.e firs* four months, the transactions show an excess of receipts of &#163;3,500,000, but this figure is no indication of the trend of the year&#39;s finance. Concessions announced in the budget will cost &#163;6,052,000, almost the whole of which will be reflected in the remaining months of the year. Moreover, expenditure in the first four months was below, the average for the year, as is invariably the case. </para>
                    <para>It is too early yet to make any definite forecast as to whether there will be an improvement in the budget position. Some improvement is hoped for, but it is quite out of the question to look for an improvement of a magnitude which would enable us to provide the whole of the finance required for assistance to wheatgrowers. </para>
                    <para>Thirdly, I set out the position with regard to the proposals for an increased price for home consumption. Many representations on behalf of wheatgrowers have been made, both in this chamber and outside, to provide for assistance by some scheme which involves an increase of the home consumption price, either by a pool or some similar arrangement, or by a sales tax on flour. </para>
                    <para>In discussions which have taken place on the subject of the form wheat assist ance should take, the creation of a compulsory Australian pool has found support. It is not desired to traverse the whole of the objections to such an organization, but it is .desired to emphasize one outstanding fact - that its operation must necessarily have the effect of increasing the price of bread to the Australian consumer. One of the avowed reasons for the compulsory wheat pool is that it would enable an &#34; Australian &#34; price to be fixed, that is, a price for wheat consumed in Australia, which would not be influenced by prices ruling abroad. The price of wheat in Australia, and, of course, flour, would thus be artificially raised above world parity. </para>
                    <para>It is admitted by all that present world prices are unsatisfactory, and this, of course, is the cause of our present difficulties. It follows, therefore, that the first act of a pool administration would be to raise the price of wheat consumed in Australia to an extent that would give an adequate return to the grower over all his wheat, whether consumed locally or exported. As the quantity of wheat exported this year will be more than double that consumed in Australia, it will be seen that a substantial increase of the price of the proportion consumed in Australia would be necessary to give a reasonable all-round return on the total production. As production increased, this position would become accentuated. </para>
                    <para>The present price of Australian wheat ia about 2s. 2d. a bushel at country station sidings. If, for example, it were decided that an increase to 3s. a bushel for the total marketable crop was required, it would be necessary to raise local prices to about 5s. a bushel. This would add approximately &#163;6 15s. a ton to the price of flour consumed locally, and would in turn increase the price of bread by more than Id. for a 2-lb. loaf. These figures are approximate, and are conservative, but they clearly illustrate the point that the introduction of a compulsory pool on the lines advocated, and the fixation of a local price independent of world parity, would have the same effect in raising the price of bread as would the imposition of a flour tax. </para>
                    <para>It is clear, therefore, that, if the whole of the assistance were provided by increasing the home consumption price, the full subsidy would be passed on. in the form of an increased price for bread. It is inevitable that some of the assistance should be provided in this manner, but the Government is not prepared to find the whole amount by an increase of the home consumption price. After fully considering the position, the Government proposes that approximately half the money necessary to assist the industry should be found by a flour tax, the remaining halfto be provided from other special taxation, and from thebudgets of 1933-34 and 1934-35. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to impose the following specialtaxation: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The total amount to be provided byspecial taxation this financial year is, therefore, &#163;.1,950,000, and the balance of &#163;1,050,000&#34; is to be provided from the budgets of 1933-34 and 1934-35. To enable payments to be made to wheatgrowers as early as possible, it will be necessary to obtain temporary accommodation until revenue moneys become available. The authority- of the Loan Council has, therefore, been obtained to permit of the money being raised by treasury-bills, subject to repayment from revenue of &#163;1,950,000, or thereabouts, not later than the 30th June, 1934, and the balance of &#163;1,050,000 to be repaid from revenue not later than the 30th June, 1935. The Commonwealth Bank has agreed to provide finance on these conditions. </para>
                    <para>The estimated amount of flour consumed in Australia is 650,000 tons a year, and, on this basis, the tax of &#163;4 5s. per ton is estimated to realize about &#163;1,600,000 up to the 30th June next. The tax will cease to operate on that date. If revenue improves sufficiently during the next seven months the flour tax will be removed before the 30th June next. </para>
                    <para>The Government is being criticized for proposing to impose taxation, which will be mainly felt by those on the basic wage. I point out that many of those who have indulged in this criticism have themselves advocated in this House a fair return to the wheat-grower, even if it involved increasing the local price of wheat. If the scheme for assisting the wheat-grower were financed wholly by flour tax, the full cost would be passed on in the form of an increased price of bread. The Government&#39;s proposal involves passing on to the consumer only half of the cost, the other half being found from special taxation and the budget. </para>
                    <para>There are many precedents since the beginning of the depression for the imposition of a flour tax. In New South Wales, a former government introduced flour acquisition legislation in 1931 which placed an impost of &#163;2 15s. a ton on flour, though this was later reduced to &#163;1 10s. a ton. The United Kingdom has a form of flour tax to provide a fund for the payment of a guaranteed price of 5s.7&#189;d. a bushel to British wheat-growers. Other importing countries, for example, Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, Greece, Holland and Switzerland, all have adopted schemes for raising the internal prices of wheat and flour. The plans of the United States of America for the rehabilitation of the wheat industry include a processing tax, the proceeds of which are devoted to payments to growers as an inducement. to reduce their acreage. Exporting countries also have special forms of assistance, which have resulted in an increase of the price of locally-consumed wheat, and the subsidizing of exports. </para>
                    <para>Australian wheat prices are based on world parity, and the Australian consumer benefits by falls of prices abroad. As prices are inadequate on the basis of costs of production, the Australian consumer has been benefiting at the expense of the wheat-growers by the abnormal conditions which have existed. </para>
                    <para>As I have already stated, the Government proposes to pass on to the consumer only half of the cost of the assistance that is to be provided, so that the consumerwill still be better off than when prices are normal. </para>
                    <para>Before leaving the question of the influence of the flour tax upon the price of bread, it is interesting to note prices ruling in other countries. The average price of the 2-lb. loaf in Australia, other than New South Wales, is3¾d. In the United Kingdom, the price at present is 4¾d., with provision for an adjustment by id. for every 32s. rise or fall in the price of flour. The New Zealand price is 5d. per 2-lb. loaf, and in Canada,the price is approximately 6d. per 2-lb. loaf. These rates are expressed in Australian currency. While purchasing power varies somewhat in the different countries, it is clear that Australian consumers, even with the further small addition to bread prices which the flour tax will bring about, will be able to purchase their bread for less than will the people of other countries: </para>
                    <para>It will be necessary to bring down a tax bill to give effect to these proposals, and further information will be furnished to the House when that measure is introduced. As Tasmania produces very little wheat, it has been decided to make a special rebate to that State to offset the flour tax. Payment will be at the rate of &#163;7,500 a month, which is based on the estimated consumption of flour at the rate of the proposed tax of &#163;4 5s. per ton. Payments will be made at this rate to the Government of Tasmania for the period for which the flour tax operates, and the bill contains a clause to this effect. </para>
                    <para>The amount of &#163;3,000,000 will be distributed to the States as follows: - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>Apart from these conditions, an important departure has been made this year from the principles under which payments were made to growers in former years. As a condition of the grant, the State Governments are required to confine financial assistance to those growers who did not receive taxable income during the financial year ended June, 1933. The Government felt that it would be anomalous to make payments out of public funds to persons who were really not in financial difficulties. It is known that many who received government assistance in the past did not need it. Either they were growing wheat under more favorable conditions than most, or they had incomes from other sources. The object of the Government is to assist those who are really in , need of assistance, and it considers that a man who is in a position to pay federal income tax has not a just claim for financial help from public funds. </para>
                    <para>It is realized, however, that since June, 1933, many people have suffered reverses, and&#39; it is likely that some, though they are subject to tax in respect of their earnings during 1932-33, may not be similarly circumstanced in respect of the current year. The Government, therefore, proposes to meet those growers by permitting them to claim on the grounds that, though they received income to a taxable amount in 1932-33, it is unlikely they will receive taxable income in 1933- 34, and that there are circumstances which entitle them to receive assistance. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable member will remember, the United States of America agreed to accept in silver a certain proportion of the war debt. This was an advantageous arrangement for Great Britain, because it effected a saving of something like 50 per cent. on its war debt payments. Great Britain purchases the silver from India, in which there are enormous stocks of it. Provision is made for not more than 50,000,000 oz. a year to be sold by India. The main agreement sets out that the Governments which were parties to the conference shall refrain from new legislative measures which would involve further debasement of their silver coinage below a certain fineness. That has no application to Australia, because its silver coinage is 92.8 per cent. fine, anddebasement of it has not been practised in the past and is not contemplated in the future. There is further provision that silver coinage shall be substituted for low-value paper currency. That, too, does not affect Australia, because the Australian 10s. note is not regarded as a low-value paper note, but refers to countries that issue notes foran amount as low as1sor2s. </para>

                            <para>- British silver is legal tender in New Zealand and in certain other dominions and colonies. Some other countries have made provision for the acceptance of their silver as legal tender by their colonies. When the Government of India has disposed of 175,000,000 fine oz. the main agreement will lapse. Australia may use, for the purposes of additional silver currency, if it so requires, the little silver it holds off the market.  It  is unlikely that advantage will be taken of that provision, because only such silver currency as is needed is issued, and we have rather more than we need. If any one party to the main agreement does not ratify it by the 1st April, and thus absolves itself from the obligation to hold certain  silver  off the market, the other countries who are parties to it may, if they so desire, take up that quota, by accepting the obligation to keep off the market an additional amount pro rata to that required of the country that has withdrawn from the agreement. If that should happen, it will be open to Australia to introduce fresh legislation containing an agreement with its silver producers fixing a figure different from that which is fixed by this &#34;bill. </para>

                    <para>The second agreement has been voluntarily entered into by the principal silver producers of Australia and the Government of the Commonwealth. It provides that there shall be placed in cold storage each year for the next four years, an amount of 652,355 oz. of standard fine silver, the arrangement to begin to operate on the 1st January next. The Commonwealth has dealt with the Broken Hill Associated Smelters and the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Port Kembla, through whose hands pass the silver produced by practically the whole of the silver producers of any consequence in Australia. Their interests and their directorate are linked, and they have a Common chairman, with, whom the Commonwealth Government has come to the agreement. The com.pany referred to in the agreement is the Broken Hill Associated Smelters. That company, by arrangement with the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company, has accepted the obligations imposed by the agreement. As honorable members may know, probably 90 per cent, of the silver production of Australia comes from Broken Hill. The agreement imposes no onerous obligation upon the Commonwealth. An amount of 650,000 oz. is to be set aside by the company each year, and stored in its strong room at Port Pirie. The agreement is largely a machinery one, for taking delivery of the silver and seeing that it is properly sampled and weighed, &#38;c. There are provisions in it for inspection by Commonwealth representatives and the like. Insurance is undertaken entirely by the company. The Commonwealth Government has no obligation, financial or otherwise, except to see that the provisions of the agreement are observed, and to ensure that faith is kept with the other countries which are parties to the main agreement. </para>

If it can achieve that object, and ensure the stability of silver, it will have a very beneficial effect on the Australian section of those who entered into the agreement. One is tempted to Spread oneself on the question of bi-metallism and the increasing use of silver as a monetary factor. But I do not propose to deal with that aspect of the matter to-day, although I may say in passing, that in my opinion silver must inevitably play a greater part than it has played in the trade and commerce of the world, including the settlement of debts and the carrying out of other obligations. In this respect it will displace, to some extent, the more precious metal, gold. The main agreement provides for the use of silver in the payment of debts, and the interest upon debts, by the British Government to the Government of the United States of America. The necessity for the use of some metal to relieve the strain on our gold reserves and resources, is shown by the ever-increasing scarcity of gold. Considerable hardship and want have been caused in the  world by slavish adherence to a metal as a monetary factor. During the last two years, because of the scarcity of gold, and the increasing price of it, there has been greater production of silver. That will continue only so long as the price of gold remains at a high level. For the moment, however, we are concerned not with that aspect so much as with the definite attempt to mitigate and prevent violent fluctuations, and the reduction of the price below the cost of production. </para>

                    <para>An extraordinary feature of the second agreement is, that Australian producers are to store 652,935 fine oz. each year for four years, although the production amounted to only 756,941 fine oz. in 1928, 937,437 fine oz. in 1929, and 834,936 fine oz. in 1930. During those four years 2,511,740 fine oz. will be placed in cold storage. If, during that period, the price of silver is increased to a figure more in keeping with past values, the producing companies will be handsomely remunerated. A rise of even -Jd. or Id. per oz. would represent a very big sum. There is one phase of the agreement which will be welcomed by, not only honorable members, but also the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The withdrawal from circulation of silver will not adversely affect the foodstuffs of the people, so it is not likely to sabotage production. It is refreshing to know that the carrying out of this agreement will not involve the Commonwealth du any additional expense except that a customs officer may be required to make periodical inspections and to make assays of the silver taken out of circulation. I am reminded of a piece of fiction illustrating the fallacy of hoarding gold, on which some people seem to think that the whole of civilization depends. The writer envisaged the nations forming a central reserve for gold, but- as they were not willing to trust one another a central committee was established. That inter national committee selected a neutral territory which was made the repository for the gold reserves. It was situated in a volcanic region, and when the committee made its annual &#39;inspection it found that the whole of the gold had disappeared together with the&#39; international army that had been provided for its protection. One bright wit among the company then suggested that there was no reason why the committee should not sign certificates to the effect that the gold was there intact. That suggestion was adopted, and for a number of years  the  world proceeded on its way on certificates. For the moment we are not so much concerned about the fetish of gold or silver and the hoarding of it as we are about producing and handling it without any cost to the Commonwealth. This Government has entered into an agreement for the withholding and selling of silver, and for the reason that no cost or responsibility other than that of requiring this Parliament to ratify this agreement is involved, I offer no objection to the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not quite satisfied as to the effect of this agreement, particularly in view of the fact that during the last twelve months, a considerable quantity of silver has been hoarded, not only in this country, but also in other parts of the world. The Minister has indicated that the idea is to place in storage a large quantity of silver in various places. That means that silver will be taken off the market for a certain period, with the object probably of stabilizing the value of Australia&#39;s metal, not only in this country but also throughout the world. That probably would have a beneficial effect upon the silver mining industry, and might give relief in other directions by stabilizing values to some extent; but what effect wall it have on those interests which have been hoarding silver, not only in bullion, but in coin, particularly  since  gold has become a scarce commodity among the nations? I suggest that a large quantity of the silver in question should be coined thus enabling the Government to make a considerable profit, at the same time putting into circulation a considerable amount of currency which would be backed by actual values, and it would not be a fiduciary issue at all. Not only would the Government derive large profits from the coinage of the silver, but the financial position would also be eased considerably. The silver could be identified, and would not interfere with the existing currency. The number of notes in circulation, particularly 10s. notes, could be considerably reduced by the issue of 5s. pieces. The Commonwealth Bank could identify and account for every penny of silver issued in that way. </para>

                            <para>- The issue of notes in any quantity becomes a process of inflation, because it has no actual value behind it. There is a certain value in silver coinage which does not exist in connexion with paper currency. In addition, a metal currency has a different effect upon the minds of the people, as is proved by the fact that many of them are hoarding silver. I also suggest that the Government should give serious consideration to the issue of farthings. Some honorable members are inclined to ridicule such an idea, but the fact is that the purchasing power of one farthing to-day is almost as great as that of a halfpenny two and a half years ago. Very often a reduction of wholesale prices to the extent of 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. cannot be reflected in the retail prices, because of the fact that it represents a reduction of less than a halfpenny, and, therefore, cannot be passed on to the purchasing community. The issue of farthings would greatly assist the passing on of various reductions, particularly in items such as bread, meat, milk, and other commodities which are daily purchased for cash in small quantities, more especially by people with small incomes. I urge the Government to consider the advisability of coining 5s. pieces and farthings, thus increasing the amount of silver and copper coins in circulation. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> for his remarks. This Government is losing a great opportunity to gain considerable revenue by not increasing its silver coinage. Silver is cheaper to-day than it has been at any period in the history of the world. Every ounce of silver that is now purchased at, say, ls., is worth 5s. 6d. in currency, representing a profit of 450 per cent. of real and tangible money. I do not hold that gold is the best form of currency, although many people consider that it is. At any rate, it will not be denied that silveT is the next best form of currency. Paper money compared with silver has no value at all. For instance, after the war I sent &#163;1 to Germany, and received in exchange 25,000,000 notes. To ascertain the real value of silver against notes, one need only put &#39;a match to them. The official <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book,</inline> volume 25 of 1932, shows that the total value of silver produced from the Broken Hill Mines up to the . end of 1932 was &#163;148,700,473. The dividends and bonuses paid by the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited to the end of 1930 amounted to &#163;33,975,627, which stamps that concern as one of the greatest silver mines in the world. Australia may be classed as one of the world&#39;s greatest silver-producing countries; and, withsilver at ls. 4d. an ounce, if my scheme were adopted, there would be a profit to the country of 312.5 per cent. immediately it was minted into coin. Our silver coins stand pre-eminent among those minted by other countries for 925 parts out of every thousand are pure silver, whereas the English coin minted since 1921 contains only 500 parts of silver in each thousand. The value of the English silver coin was reduced after Great Britain had been flooded with fiduciary notes to the value of &#163;300,000,000, and the people had become timid. Consequently, the wise people of the Mother Country decided to provide the more stable and very profitable silver coin. Strangely enough an Australian 2s. piece is worth only about ls. in London. If the Government would mint &#163;1,000,000 worth of silver at ls. 4d. an ounce that would provide &#163;4,125,000, or, if the silver content of our coins were reduced to the English standard, the profit would be &#163;7,631,250. </para>

                            <para>- There are various alloys. I have an English silver coin minted in 1920 clearly showing the tinge of copper alloy. However, that is a mere bagatelle. How much better it would be in the cause of honesty and truthfulness if the Government were to issue additional silver coins to supersede notes, which profess to be payable in gold, but not one of which has been paid in gold? Admittedly, Australia is doing better to-day by making its notes legal tender. If the Government minted additional coins, wages could be paid in silver, and I have yet to learn of any workingman or woman who would refuse to take his or her wages in silver. </para>

                    <para>I am a bimetallism I believe that when the millionaires - perhaps there were seven in the United States of America and six in Europe - combined with the big national banks of Great Britain, the United States of America and France, and forced the standard of gold upon humanity, they sentenced every &#39; third man, woman and little child to want, misery and privation. I impress upon the Government that it is its duty to lower its silver currency to at least the same value as English silver currency, for what is satisfactory to England should be acceptable to us. It is notable that the silver franc, wherever the flag of France is flown, is of equal value, but British coins vary in value throughout the world, in Great Britain itself, in Canada, India, Australia and in New Zealand. It would be a splendid gesture and would aid towards establishing the peace of the world if all the money that is minted were made of an equal value so far as its metal content is concerned. The opportunity is slipping by and the Government should hesitate no longer. I recall that, at the beginning of that last terrible war, a federal general election was about to take place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;W.</inline> L. Baillieu, who, unfortunately, is now ill and who I hope will recuperate as a result of the trip he is taking, said that if the banks would finance the companies, including the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, it would carry on at full swing. As the result of a letter that I wrote to the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> saw me, and after several interviews authorized me, on behalf of the silver-producing companies, to make available to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who became Prime Minister as a result of that general election, the whole of the silver, lead, and zinc output of the mines at the English selling price which existed prior to ,the war, ,less 30 per cent. Had Andrew Fisher been wise enough to accept that offer, Australia would have made a profit of over &#163;300,000,000, which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> has since pointed out, might have saved this country from the present economic depression. The Government should follow the suggestion of the honorable member for Calare, and mint additional silver coinage, so restoring confidence among the people. I have endeavoured to press this matter on many occasions, for I think that it is to the advantage of the National Government of Australia to use to greater profit this wonderful metal. England has reduced the silver content of its coins until it is now lower than it has ever been at any time since the reign of Edward the Confessor, with the exception of the 37th year of the reign of Henry VIII., of inglorious memory. Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, all credit to them, promptly raised the silver contents to 925 parts out of every 1,000 parts. </para>
                    <para>In the East, silver passes from merchant to merchant in the form of ingots, the value of which is stamped upon them, and it is customary to determine the value of a sovereign by the morning&#39;s quotation for silver. Incidentally, at one time a &#163;5 Bank of England note brought a higher value in India than five golden sovereigns. It is all a matter of exchange. How glad we should be if the dream of that historian of the past materialized, and the world had coins of one metal with the same silver content. The need of different languages to effect the interchange of goods would then scarcely be needed. It would be a fine thing for the shipping companies if a uniform system of currency were introduced. It has always seemed to me that a person travelling, say, to England would be well advised to take his money in silver, and thus avoid the payment of exchange. I do not think that there is any law in the Commonwealth, as there is in New Zealand, to prevent persons from taking silver out of the country. I have addressed numerous meetings advocating the introduction of silver coinage, which would be legal tender up to any amount, and never once have I failed to have my proposals endorsed by those present. So long as I remain a member of this House, and while silver is at its present low price, I shall continue to advocate this  proposal, because I believe that its adoption would benefit the country. </para>
                    <para>I have no desire to accuse Ministers of discourtesy, but some of the answers which have been given to my questions on this subject have been very far astray. For instance, I have been told that it would be impracticable to give effect to my proposal, because people would object to carrying large quantities of silver about with them. If that is so, let the Government do what was done in the United States of America, where the Government collected vast quantities of silver by means of which financial stability was maintained. I regret the disappearance of the five shilling piece. It was ona of the most artistic coins ever issued by the British Mint. I have in mind, particularly that splendidly modelled horse that pranced on one side of the coin. However, if people object to carrying so much silver about with them, why not issue five-shilling notes? The Commonwealth Statistician states that the private wealth of Australia, including land, improvements, live-stock, . coin, bullion, &#38;c, amounts to &#163;3,351,463,000, and his calculations are supported by those of private accountants and actuaries. If to this is added the wealth represented by unsold land, together with the metals contained therein, and the value of rivers, harbours, &#38;c, the total wealth of the cpuntry amounts to &#163;5,250,000,000. Against that vast aggregation of wealth it would surely be safe for us to issue notes. I am astonished that some of our governments have not done this in the past, instead of borrowing overseas, and fastening upon the country the curse of interest. If honorable members look up their Bible, they will learn what will be the final end of the interest-mongers. Of all the financial experts, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas</inline> is the only one who has ever advocated making use of the accumulated wealth of the nation.We are born in a community, and live and die in it, without ever obtaining the benefit of the community wealth which we and our forefathers have created. Let us make use of our silver, to issue a currency which, I am convinced, no worker in this country would hesitate to accept. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

                <para class="block">This is a measure which should commend itself to honorable members. It is designed to meet a difficulty which has arisen because of a case in which the High Court has interpreted sections 67  and 68 of the Patents Act. The effect of this interpretation has been to make it impossible to&#39; grant a patent on certain applications in cases where the original applicant has died. Section 67 of the act provides that a patent shall be sealed as soon as may be, and not after the expiration of sixteen months from the date of the application, or such further date, as is prescribed - that is, by regulation - or, as the High Court or Supreme Court allows. It is evident, therefore, that there is full power to grant extensions when it is thought proper. It is generally imposed as a condition that no action for infringement shall be brought during the period of the extended time beyond that set out in the statute, so that the interests of other parties will not be unfairly prejudiced. Section 67 of the act lays down the procedure in the event of the death of the applicant, and states that if a person making an application dies before- the expiration of the period of sixteen months, the patent may be granted to his legal representative, and may be sealed at any time within twelve months after the death of the applicant. Let us see how these provisions work out. In one case an applicant, AB, applies for a patent, but finds that an extension of time is necessary. First of all he has the full sixteen months allowed him, after which the time may be extended under the regulations. If that is not sufficient, he may then apply to the High Court or Supreme Court for a further extension. The other applicant, XY is, at the beginning, in the same position as AB, but he dies one month after making the application. As he died before the expiration of sixteen months, the patent may be granted to his legal representative, but may be sealed only within twelve months after the death of the applicant, which, in the case I have cited, would be thirteen months only after the making of the application. </para>

                    <para>The bill will enable the tax to be passed on to the consumer, but a miller who passes it on must show it as a separate item on his invoice or other account. Penalties are provided for any attempt to pass on amounts in excess of the tax actually payable. A person who uses flour for the manufacture of goods for sale by him may add the tax to the sale price of his goods. </para>
                    <para>In regard to stocks of flour on hand at the 1st December, 1933, the tax will be charged on the weight, less 1,000 lb., held by each separate owner, including private consumers. It is expected that, in actual practice, very few private consumers will be found to be taxable. In view of the policy of taxing stocks on hand at the 1st December next, the bill will provide for a refund of the tax paid on stocks, less 1,000 lb., that are on hand at the 30th June, 1934. This rebate will be made only to those holders of stock who have disclosed correctly their stocks on hand at the 1st December, 1933. In practice, the tax will apply to all flour used between the 30th November, 1933, and the 30th June, 1934. </para>
                    <para>Flour exported for sale, or sold for export, will be exempt, and a rebate will be allowed of tax paid on flour used in the manufacture of goods which are exported, provided that the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied as to the quantum of flour contents of the exported goods, and that tax was paid on the flour contents of those goods. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to refund to public charitable institutions the tax paid on Hour supplied to those institutions, and on the flour contents of such goods as bread, biscuits, cake, &#38;c, supplied to them, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the prices charged for the goods include amounts in respect of the tax so paid. &#34; Public charitable institution &#34; will mean a public hospital, a public benevolent institution, or a religious organization. </para>
                    <para>Persons other than millers who held stocks of flour on the 1st December, 1933, will be required to declare the quantities held. Severe penalties for failure to do so, or for false statements, are provided. The Commissioner of Taxation is arranging to follow up declarations in order to test their accuracy, and will riot hesitate to prosecute defaulters or evaders. </para>
                    <para>Holders of stocks who will be taxable on stocks on hand will be required to pay the tax as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Where the tax does not exceed &#163;5, it must be paid with the submission of the declaration of stocks on hand at the 1st December, 1933. </para>
                    <para>Where the tax exceeds &#163;5, the tax may be paid by equal monthly instalments of &#163;5, except where the unpaid balance of the tax is less than &#163;5, when the instalment will be that unpaid balance. Where 20 per cent, df the tax exceeds &#163;5, the payment may be by equal  monthly instalments  of 20 per cent, of the tax. </para>
                    <para>Instalments will be payable on the 21st day of each month, the first being payable by the 21st December, 1933. </para>
                    <para>Millers will be required to lodge monthly returns by the 21st day of the month following that in which the taxable sale or delivery is made, and tax will be payable with the lodging of the return. </para>
                    <para>A rebate of tax is provided for in respect of debts which, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, are proved to be bad. Provision for the refund of tax overpaid is made in cases in which the tax has not been passed on to a purchaser, or, if passed on, has been refunded to the purchaser concerned. </para>
                    <para>Whilst it is not anticipated that the services of the Income Tax Board of Review will be necessary to settle disputes between taxpayers and the Commissioner, the bill provides for such a means of settlement. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains secrecy provisions similar&#34; to those of the Sales Tax Acts. As far as possible, the machinery employed for the collection of the ordinary sales tax has been adopted for the purposes of the flour tax, by reference to the Sales Tax Acts. Wherever necessary in this connexion, alterations of wording have been shown in the bill. I commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

                            <para>. - The three resolutions that I am about to introduce relate to the imposition of the flour tax. The first deals with flour sold, delivered, or used by the manufacturer thereof; the second relates to tax on flour held in stock on the 1st December, 1933,by any person other than the manufacturer thereof, to the extent that it exceeds 1,000 lb.; and the third refers to flour and specified goods in the manufacture of which flour is used, imported into Australia on or after the commencement of the acts. The impost in the first case is, in fact, an excise duty payable by the manufacturer of flour. In the second case it is a tax payable by persons, not being manufacturers of flour, holding stocks of flour. In the third case, the impost is in fact a customs duty payable by the importer of goods. Because of constitutional limitations, it is not possible to introduce one bill for the purpose of imposing the flour tax in all these circumstances. It is necessary to enact a separate act to impose the tax upon the goods specified under each of the three headings referred to, and in order to authorize the introduction of bills for this purpose, I move - </para>

There are four of these small uninhabitated islands situated between Timor and Western Australia, and they are about 200 miles from the north-west coast of Western Australia. The islands contain deposits of low-grade guano, and bechedemer, trochus shell and tortoise shell are to be found on the reefs. From time to time, complaints have been made of illegal fishing in the waters adjacent to these islands, and representations have been made by the Government of &#34;Western Australia that they should be brought under Commonwealth control, while any actual administration would be performed by that government. </para>

In&#39; July, 1924, the Government of Western Aus-_ tralia informed the Commonwealth Government that for the purpose of dealing&#93; with illicit fishing, it considered that the islands might be brought under the jurisdiction of the fishing laws of that State ; and as the result of representations made by the Commonwealth to the Goment of the United Kingdom, the Dominions Office informed the Commonwealth that the British Government would lie prepared to transfer these islands- to the Commonwealth. It was considered that the Colonial Boundaries Act of 1895 which used to be utilized in these matters, was not available for the purpose of extending the limits of the State of Western Australia&#39;, and there is no doubt that that is the case, because section 8 of the Constitution Act, clause 8, provides - </para>

On the 23rd July, 1931, action was taken by  His  Majesty the King, under section 122 of the Constitution, and by an Order in Council, these islands were placed under the authority of the Commonwealth. This order, according to its terms, is not to operate until after legislation shall have been passed by the Commonwealth Government providing for the acceptance of the islands and their government. This measure, when passed, will bring that Order in Council into operation. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth, while being willing to accede to the wish of Western Australia that control should be exercised over these islands, does not consider that it would be desirable to pretend to have anything to do with them from Canberra. The Government of Western Australia has asked that provision be made for the government of the islands, and is prepared to undertake full responsibility for their administration and control, and accordingly the bill makes provision for fixing a date for the  coming  into operation of the Order iri Council. That date is to be fixed by Proclamation by the Governor-General. Clause 6 of the bill provides  that these islands are accepted by the Commonwealth as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth under the name of the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. When the bill is passed these islands will become a territory of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Labour party in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley).</inline> I find on analysing the amounts that have been expended for the purpose of making grants from the Commonwealth revenue to these mendicant State Governments, that they are increasing from year to year. This Parliament apparently has accepted the yearly appeal of these States as a permanent affair, for it has appointed a royal commission to make certain inquiries regarding State disabilities in order to determine the amount by which each State shall benefit annually. The figures disclose that the Governments concerned, although ostensibly carrying out their undertakings under the Premiers plan, which was designed to bring about a balancing of budgets, have failed to achieve that result. Originally these grants were made for . the alleged purpose of compensating States for disabilities suffered as a result of federation, but to-day the Government is prepared to grant financial relief to States to enable them to balance their budgets! Honorable members who support the measure have claimed that the several States concerned have honoured their obligations under the Premiers plan. If that is so, the increased vote that is now requested to relieve the States demonstrates conclusively that the Premiers plan has  failed. When making these grants we must ask ourselves whether we are dealing justly with the citizens of other States. Honorable members have declared that those who live in the States that are to receive these grants contribute their quota of taxation, but I point out that the amount paid by these States is much less than - that paid by the larger States. As a matter of fact, it will be found that the- States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania receive more by way of grants and other benefits than they contribute in the form of taxation to the Commonwealth revenue. It would be wise if those who&#39; continually talk about the desirability of breaking up the federation took a more consistent attitude and refrained from making these continual demands for increased grants. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Honorable members on this side are justified in asking how long this sort of thing is to continue. In 1929-30, &#163;910,000 was paid for the purpose, while this year &#163;2,130,000 is to be paid. South Australia, which in 1929-30 received &#163;360,000, is now to be paid &#163;1,150,000; Western Australia jumps from &#163;300.000 to &#163;600,000, and Tasmania from &#163;250,000 to &#163;380,000. There is no saying what amount the Commonwealth Government will have to provide next&#39; year to assist these State Governments to meet their current obligations. </para>
                    <para>If it is right for the Government to finance State Governments, it is equally right for it to have an examination made into their activities to ensure that they are carrying out their functions properly. We do not know exactly who is to receive this money or for what purpose it is to be used. Honorable members of this party are of the opinion that the whole trouble in the various States is that they and this Government have pursued a policy that has been detrimental to the interests of the people of Australia. By controlling the judiciary, they have been able to enforce various reductions of wages, which have reduced the spending power of the community, and this, in turn is reflected in  lower  returns to business and a reduced government revenue. Consequently, instead of finding themselves out of the wood as the result of the Premiers plan, these States now need more assistance than ever from the Commonwealth Government. </para>
                    <para>It is but natural to expect that portion at least of this money should be expended on the section which is in the greatest need of assistance, the unemployed, which accounts for the amendment that has been moved by the leader of the party of which I am a member. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> My colleagues and I are not prepared to accept the claim by supporters of the Government that the unemployed position has improved, and to-day the members of our party find that the position of this unfortunate section of the community is more desperate than ever before. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#39;&#93;</inline> The information supplied by the Statistician&#39;s Department, although the best available, is not always reliable; not that the department has any desire to mislead honorable members, but because it has not before it the data which would enable it to reach an accurate conclusion. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> said that the percentage of unemployment in Australia at; the present time was 25.6, he should have made it clear that the figure applied only to those trade unions, representing 56.5 of the whole, which furnished returns. He should have. told honorable members that the Statistician&#39;s Department was not in a position to say what was the percentage of unemployment among the whole adult population of Australia. Honorable members, who use their powers of observation, know that the unemployment position has grown much worse since the accession of this Government to office. In the portion of my electorate which is largely industrial, the condition of the people is worse now than ever, and if that be true of parts of New South  Wales, it is probably also true of other States. If we are to allocate Commonwealth revenue to various State Governments, we should at least insist that it be spent upon the relief of unemployment. The first duty of any government is to its people, but some of the State Governments to which these grants are to be made, may, when they receive the money, follow the example of the Commonwealth Government, and use it to remit taxation upon wealthy sections of the community. I am not prepared to support the granting of money which is to be applied in that. way. </para>

                    <para>What are the disabilities of these States concerning which we have heard so much ? Some -honorable members refer frequently to the disabilities suffered by their States as a result of. federation, but I have never heard them mention any of. the advantages which their States derive: through their membership of the Commonwealth. For instance, if each State had to provide its own defence force, the burden on the more sparsely populated States would be extremely heavy. Tasmania, under federation, enjoys an open market in New South Wales for its potatoes, and large sums of public money are used to subsidize shipping services between the mainland and Tasmania. This helps Tasmania&#39;s tourist trade, which is of  great  importance to that State. The financial position of Tasmania would have been much worse than it is were it not for the taxation which the Government draws from a certain consultation in which most of the tickets are bought by residents of New South Wales. If the federation were dissolved, the Government of New South Wales might decide to enforce a prohibition of the sale of Tattersalls tickets in that State, or might impose restrictions upon the importation of potatoes from. Tasmania. </para>
                    <para>The amendment moved by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> should receive the support of every member of this chamber. If these grants are spent in providing the unemployed with food, clothing and shelter, all sections of the community will benefit. When money is put into circulation in that way, a demand is created for goods for which at present there is no sale, and trade and commerce is stimulated. </para>
                    <para>A commission was set up by this Parliament to inquire into, and report upon, the disabilities of the States .under federation ; but, before any report is presented, the Government brings down this measure, which provides, not only for the continuance of the payment of grants at the old rate, but also for increasing those grants. The Government has admitted that the increases are not regarded as compensation for State disabilities, but are merely to enable State Governments to balance their budgets. As a matter of fact, the State disabilities of which we hear -so much should be decreasing, rather than increasing. We have been told by representatives of Western Australia that, because of the intense competition from the eastern States, secondary industries cannot be established in Western Australia ; but if we examine the statistics, we find that there has been a considerable increase both in the number of secondary industries, and in the number of factories in operation. It is evident that some honorable members have, knowingly or otherwise, misrepresented the position in an endeavour to induce this Parliament to vote to the States they represent increased sums of money, when that money is needed largely because of governmental mismanagement. The finding of the money for these grants has imposed hardship on the States of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, from which the greater part of the Commonwealth revenue is derived. I hope that Parliament will insist that the grant which it is proposed to make under this bill will be earmarked for the assistance of the most deserving section of the community - the unemployed. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that, due to the manner in which these measures are being rushed through the House, the leader of my party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who had obtained the adjournment on this measure, is not present. In my opinion, the amount of the appropriation is not sufficient. It should be increased, so that relief might be given to deserving persons for whomthe Government has refused to do anything. Applications for pensions have recently been rejected by the department; although the applicants were fully entitled to receive assistance. I have endeavoured to induce the Minister in charge of the department <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to take up these cases, but have received no satisfaction. In one case a seaman was refused an invalid pension on the ground that his disability was not incurred  while he was a resident of this country. The man was employed on an Australian steamer working on Australian articles. At the time he fell ill, the steamer was travelling between Sydney and Papua, and, though he was an Australian citizen who had lived in Australia for years, the department refused to entertain his application. </para>

Although inany case he would have been absent from this country for only a matter of weeks, and is now unable to earn his livelihood, the department has decreed that his disability was contracted outside of Australia. </para>
                    <para>There are other directions in which the Government could so liberalize the interpretation of the act as to make it possible for a number of unfortunate people to receive some slight measure of relief.

He took over the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Customs when his predecessor was compelled to relinquish it on account of ill-health, and had very little time in which to prepare for the meeting of Parliament. He has displayed, not only ability, but also a great deal of determination, patience and perseverance. </para>

                    <para>.- I tender to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> the congratulations* of the Opposition upon his having piloted&#39; the tariff through this House, and secured its acceptance by another place. I wish, however, to make it quite clear that I do not agree with his decisions in connexion with a large number of items. That, of course, is natural, because much of what has been done is opposed to the policy of the party which sits on this side of the House ; and, as I have stated in the course of debate, many of the tariff reductions that have been made will, in my opinion, tend to whittle away the protectionist policy of Australia, and do a great deal of damage to Australian secondary industries. I realize, however, that the honorable gentleman has had to give effect to the fiscal policy of his party, and I am fair enough to say that he has done so in a capable and courteous manner. Although at times feeling ran somewhat high, all parties were able to meet on friendly terms outside this chamber, and to give to the other side the credit of conscientiously holding different views on such an important subject as protection. The honorable gentleman assumed control of the department when his predecessor was stricken down by illness, and the task which he had to undertake was both onerous and responsible. Having had charge of that department, I know how heavy is the responsibility of the position, and what long hours have to be worked. Both the Minister and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy)</inline> have most capably discharged their duties, according to the requirements of the policy which their party wishes to see adopted. </para>

                    <para>. -  I thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> for the wonderfully fine tribute they have paid to the work that I have gladly done in connexion with the customs tariff. I say &#34;gladly&#34; because, although the work has been strenuous and difficult, it was done in the service of one&#39;s country. That is the only way in which I regard it. Although the tariff may not suit all - it is not possible to make one that would - it is the hope of the Government, and certainly my sincere and earnest wish, that it will be for the good of Australia, and, incidentally, the Empire, of which Australia is a part. In having thanked me, the Prime Minister has also thanked the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy).</inline> My thanks also are due to the Assistant Minister who made my task much easier than it might have been, and to the loyal members of the Public Service, who worked night and day to complete the tariff that the Parliament has now passed. Their work, unlike that of Ministers, is not done before the public gaze. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to bring before the Government, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> in particular, a matter concerning which we have had some correspondence. I refer to the scheme which is known as the Douglas Credit Proposals. I have been &#39;approached by a large number of people to move the Government to cause an inquiry to be made into the merits of these proposals. I express no opinion myself, but it is certain that many loyal and reputable citizens of Australia firmly believe that the scheme provides a panacea for the troubles that we are experiencing. On the other hand, many believe it to be merely a specious and illusive doctrine. I consider that the best interests of the Australian people will be served by a thorough and an impartial inquiry which would reveal the merits of the scheme or. disclose its defects. It is undeniable that very many persons believe that the present monetary system is one of the major factors in the world depression. Whether that be so or not, it is certain that we have been compelled to recognize the limitations imposed upon this Government and this country by the present monetary system. The advocates of the Douglas credit scheme claim that the adoption of their proposals would remove all the difficulties that now confront us. Without in any way associating myself with these views, but as the mouthpiece of those who seek the assistance of the Government, I ask thai early and sincere consideration be given to the request that I have put forward.  </para>

                <para>The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has referred to the Douglas social credit system. I am reminded of the huge expenditure that this country was put to when the Big Pour, one member of. whom is now the Governor of Tasmania, came to Australia. Let me give only one item of expenditure. The ladies of the party saw fit to enjoy a salt water bath at Brisbane, and the highly-paid official accompanying them paid &#163;3 of Commonwealth money as a tip to the bath-keeper. Of course, this Government was -not to blame for that expenditure. A large sum was expended in connexion with the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer to Australia. He was an English gentleman in every sense of the word. When he was here I pointed out to him the fact that Great Britain was paying only 3 per cent, for ten years, and thereafter <inline font-style="italic">Z\</inline> per cent, on loans from the United States of America, while at the same time the Mother Country was charging Australia an interest rate of 5 per cent, and 1 per cent, sinking fund. During that period the United States of America, to its credit, was paying on its liberty bonds an interest rate of from 4$ to 5 per cent, to enable it to make concessions to Great Britain. Later, that terrible man from Canada, who has been the greatest curse to Australia, came here to institute the sales tax. I support the proposal of the right honorable member for North Sydney to have an inquiry made into the Douglas social credit system. No movement, not even that of  Henry  George, has made such a rapid advance in Australia  in  so short a time as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas.</inline> I have known of three meetings being held in Sydney on one night to discuss his system, and it therefore cannot be discarded as improbable or impossible. I have given some study to it, and I recognize that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas</inline> is to-day perhaps the greatest financial expert in the world. He was the only man to point to the accumulated wealth of Australia. I hope that the Government will not refuse to incur the small expense necessary to institute an inquiry into the Douglas social credit system. </para>

As South Australia has few industries I urge the Government not to crucify the cornflour industry of that State and to exempt from the sales tax on flour all flour used in the manufacture of cornflour and starch. </para>

One case is that of a returned soldier named John Suzor, who enlisted at the age of seventeen years. He was admitted to the Suez Military Hospital, suffering from influenza. Eventually his complaint was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis, an incurable complaint. He. was discharged from the Caulfield Military Hospital and granted a 50 per cent. war pension.  His  pension rate has since varied considerably. At one time it was &#163;1 10s. a fortnight, and later it was increased to &#163;4 4s. Then it was increased to &#163;8, and subsequently an additional &#163;4 a fortnight was granted on account of attendants&#39; fees, or &#163;12 a fortnight in all. The department reviewed this case, and decided that Suzor was not suffering from a disability caused by war service. This man has been an inmate and out-patient of many hospitals, and at each of them he has been said to be suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The last communcation received from the Repatriation Commission was to the effect that this returned soldier was entitled to a small pension. The letter which is signed by J. E. Barrett,  Deputy  Commissioner, reads - </para>

                    <para>I And that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treloar</inline> was discharged from the Forces on 16th August, 1918, and was granted a pension at 25 per cent. rate on account of nervousness. The pension was cancelled in March, 1919, as medical evidence showed that any incapacity attributable to war service had disappeared. In May, 1931, the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal considered an appeal for acceptance of bronchitis and mental trouble as due to war service. The Tribunal disallowed the appeal as regards bronchitis, but accepted mental disorder as aggravated by service. In view of this decision war pension at the rate of 5 per cent. (4s. per fortnight) was made available as from 25th June, 1930, in respect of the aggravation. </para>
                    <para class="block">The ex-soldier subsequently appealed against the rate of his pension to the War Service Assessment Appeal Tribunal, but that body in the light of all the available evidence, was unable to uphold the appeal and confirmed the assessment. </para>

The last information supplied to me discloses the fact that he served 2 years , 278 days during the. Great War, and was discharged on the 18th of March, 1920,  suffering from bronchitis, D.A.H., and defective vision. In 1922, he was in receipt of ?2 2s. a week which, in 1923, was increased to ?4 a week. That payment was continued until 1931, when his pension was reduced to 14s. a week. Because of this income, his State food relief was discontinued. </para>
                <para>It is difficult to understand what determines the action of the commission when it varies or cancels pensions which have been paid for a considerable period. It should at least work upon a set formula, as it is unlikely, so many years after the war, that any additional evidence could be made available to justify a discontinuance of the pension. </para>
                <para>Another case, which I have previously mentioned in this chamber, is that of Victor Hugo. I have had an opportunity to go through this man&#39;s file both bv myself, and in company with the Minister&#39;s private secretary. Hugo was on active service from the 2nd June, 1916, to the 6th August, 1916. He was admitted to the field ambulance suffering from melancholic dementia. He was later admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital. He subsequently became an inmate of the Fourth Australian General Hospital at Randwick, and was also an inmate of Broughton Hall. The finding of the discharging board was that his disability was due to neurasthenia, and in February, 1917, he was given a 50 per cent, pension. That was increased on the 1st February, 1918, to 100 per cent., although the departmental file does not disclose why. Later, his pension was reduced to 75 per cent., then restored to 100 per cent., and, on the 12th November, 1925, he was granted a special rate of pension. On the 9th of August, 1931, fourteen years after he first received his pension, his case was reviewed by the commission, which cancelled the pension. In justification of its action, the commission tried, in a cruel manner, to create the impression that his condition was due to his own misdemeanour, and attributed it to excessive alcoholism. However, a careful search of this man&#39;s overseas history fails to substantiate that statement. Captain R. D.  Heggarton,  of the Australian Tunnelling Company stated; - </para>

                <para>I have another case, that of ex-Sergeant J. T. Hill, of the 7th Light Horse, who was previously receiving a war pension of ?1 ls. a fortnight. He appealed against the? assessment&#39; of the board, felt ill, and approached the Repatriation Commission with a view to receiving attention. While on active service this man met with an accident, but did not report it to the commanding officer at the time as he did not think it was serious, and, like many others have done under similar circumstances, carried on. After the war, the accident came against him, and he applied to have it recognized as a war disability as, owing to its effects, he was unable to continue in his employment. After he had applied for attention, a fortnight elapsed before he was permitted to see a doctor, and a week later he was X-rayed and a blood test taken.  His  condition was so bad that a special message had to be sent to the department, and eventually <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Binns</inline> arrived with an ambulance from Randwick, where he was admitted. He declares that he remained at Randwick some time, but did not receive the necessary treatment. On one occasion, he was taken into the operating theatre tb undergo an operation., but it was not performed. Later, he was transferred to the Sydney Hospital. &#34;While he was in the military hospital, the man&#39;s life was in danger, not because of any fault that could be attributed to the medical staff or attendants, but because it is the practice of the department to deny treatment in cases where its application may be looked upon as an admission of liability. Neither the doctors nor the staff were responsible. I hope that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> will bring under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> the various matters to which I have directed attention, and that arrangements will be made for a complete inquiry into the administration of that department. </para>

As another ex-Minister of that department, I should not like the opportunity to pass without paying my tribute to the Minister for .the splendid work which he has done. I am aware that to him, and possibly to a number of other Ministers, the honorable member for Maribyrnong is, at times, a bit of a nuisance. This is all the more reason why I should bear testimony to the excellent work which the Minister for Trade and Customs has done. As honorable members know, and as the records of the House show, I have disagreed, sometimes regretfully, with many of the proposals brought down by the Minister; but as one who had experience of many tariff discussions in this Parliament, I congratulate the honorable gentleman upon having passed one of the most extensive and, shall I say, intricate tariffs that have ever been placed before this chamber. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I had occasion to visit Great Britain on public business, and was absent for about six months. Upon my return other duties were thrust upon me, and for a time I was Acting Prime Minister. Consequently, I did not have an opportunity to attend so closely to the administrative details of the department as I should have liked; but, from my knowledge of distinguished predecessors -in that portfolio, I can say with every confidence that the present Minister&#39;s ability and administration bear favorable comparison with the many honorable gentlemen who preceded him. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> in protesting against the importation of stone from the eastern States in connexion with the erection of the new Commonwealth Bank building in Adelaide. It is unnecessary to do that, because there is an ample supply of good stone in South Australia for that class of work. Large deposits of granite and marble are readily available. In fact, within the last twelve months South Australian freestone has been recommended for use in Victoria, and- one con- tractor, who secured the tender for the erection of a building costing &#163;200,000, offered to reduce his price by &#163;10,000 if he were allowed to use South Australian freestone. I am not advocating the sending of freestone from South Australia to Melbourne, but I do contend that it should be used for the Commonwealth Bank building in Adelaide. I hope that those responsible for that building will arrange for the use of local stone. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Angas also referred to the manufacture, in Adelaide, of cornflour from wheaten flour. This industry, which has been in existence for some years, requires <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> considerable quantity of wheaten flour to meet the demand for its product. I think I am right in saying that Adelaide is the only city in which cornflour is manufactured from wheaten flour. Therefore, I hope that the Treasurer will see his way clear to exempt wheaten-flour from the sales tax, when it is used for that purpose. Otherwise, as the honorable member for Angas has pointed out, it will be subject to two taxes, and thus manufacturers of cornflour in South Australia will be unfairly penalized. When the industry was started, the immediate result was a reduction of the price of cornflour and starch, so it has served a useful purpose. Lately, we have been speaking about the disabilities of the various States. As I do not wish to see another disability imposed on one of the weaker States in the Commonwealth, I hope that the Treasurer will give serious consideration to the suggestion that wheaten-flour, used for the manufacture of cornflour, is exempted from the sales tax. </para>

                <para>With regard to the question raised by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> I cannot undertake, on behalf of the Government, to promise an inquiry into the Douglas credit system. As has been pointed out by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas</inline> appeared before the Macmillan Commission in England, and gave evidence at length concerning the credit system which bears his name. Later, an inquiry was held in Canada, and also by the Labour party in Great Britain. I think I am right in saying that more inquiries have been held into principles and details of the Douglas credit system than into any other financial system. I am afraid that it would be very difficult to get the right personnel for an inquiry in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The Commonwealth Government&#39;s economic adviser also dealt with the matter as a departmental officer, and his finding was in keeping with those of other experts or commissions that have investigated the system. It would, I repeat, be difficult to get in Australia men who are really qualified to make an inquiry - men who have not already passed judgment upon it. I, perhaps more than any other man in Australia, have been deluged from time to time with literature dealing with well-thought-out schemes to relieve the present depression and improve the general situation in Australia.- I give the advocates of the Douglas system full credit for their motives. They see the necessity for improving the conditions of the people, and in a genuine way put forward their proposals. Many able persons have promulgated other schemes with the same object in view. Is it suggested . that, whenever these schemes are put for- \ ward, the Government  should  set up a royal commission? The  thing cannot  be done. There has been more investigation into the Douglas system than into any system which has been submitted for the relief of the conditions under which the world is suffering to-day. I cannot pledge the Government to any such investigation, because it would not be satisfactory either to the advocates of the Douglas system or to its opponents. </para>

                <para>I come now to the matter raised by the honorable members for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> and Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey),</inline> in regard to the imposition of a double tax upon flour used in the manufacture of cornflour. In view of the representations they have made to-day, the matter will receive further consideration. That is ail I can say at the present juncture. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> expressed the hope that I would bring certain matters before the Repatriation Department. There was no need for him to occupy so much time in ventilating those matters in Parliament. He might have brought them under the notice of the department itself. They are all matters with which this Parliament has nothing to do. If the honorable member were very much concerned about themhe would take them to the department to which they belong, where his representations would receive immediate attention and consideration. Even to-day he merely asked that they should be submitted to the department concerned. I say to him, &#34; Take them yourself, and have them dealt with, but do not waste the time of Parliament upon them.&#34; </para>
                <para>May I add that the time occupied this afternoon by him was only in keeping with other things that have happened during the week. In common with other members of the Government, I have displayed very great patience during the past week, but I say advisedly, that we are not prepared to allow the work which 70 honorable members of Parliament are prepared to do to be interrupted and blocked by five others. We have exhibited ali the patience possible, but the limit of our endurance has been reached. When business begins next week, the Government will take a stand, if necessary, to ensure that five honorable members shall not dominate the conduct of our parliamentary business. I want that clearly understood, so that those honorable members may know that the business of the people must be proceeded with, whatever may be their own particular grievances. </para>
