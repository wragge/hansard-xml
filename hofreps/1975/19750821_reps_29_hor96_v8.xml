          <para>-Yesterday the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> raised a matter in the House relating to privilege and I undertook to give a ruling on it at the earliest time, after having made a judgment on whether the matter is of such significance that it should receive precedence over other business of the House. The Leader of the House raised the matter, feeling that the articles represented an attack on honourable members and was a grave reflection on the House itself. These indignities are referred to in May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> on page 143. However, the only pertinent references which I have been able to find in the articles are: </para>

        <para>Turning now to the publication of an alleged statement by the Leader of the House- a statement which the Leader describes as false- I think the House would agree that such wilful publication is damaging to the integrity of the person concerned and constitutes a serious infringement of his rights. Because it is not concerned with the actual business of the House, I feel that the publication by the newspapers of such a report cannot be brought within the ambit of parliamentary privilege, but I am sure all honourable members would condemn this type of article. In the circumstances I am of opinion that the matter raised should not be accorded precedence over other business. </para>

            <para>- I did hear my colleague the Minister for Urban and Regional Development answer a question on this matter. I was not aware of a question having been asked of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> on it. I do remember that when the Australian Housing Corporation Bill was being handled by the previous Minister for Housing and Construction he made a statement on this matter in the House. I have had a look at correspondence between him and the National Secretary of the RSL. The correspondence referred to a servicemen's consultative and advisory committee. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development, who now has responsibility for the Australian Housing Corporation, has also under consideration the appointment of consultative panels or a consultative panel for the Corporation. The matter came to my notice when the National Secretary of the Returned Services League wrote to me on 18 June. I wrote back to him on 15 July. He sent a letter of appreciation for my reply on 21 July. I think that it might help honourable gentlemen if I ask for leave to have the letter I wrote to the National Secretary of the RSL incorporated in Hansard. </para>

            <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keys,</inline></para>
            <para>Thank you for your letter of 18 June 1975 concerning appointments to the Board of the Australian Housing Corporation. I very much regret any misunderstanding which may have arisen over this matter. </para>
            <para>At the outset, I can assure you that the fact that a representative of the Returned Services League has not been appointed to the Board of the Corporation in no way involves any diminution in the respect in which the Government holds the Returned Services League and the many Australians it represents. </para>
            <para>As you pointed out in your letter, there has been a historic link between the RSL and the Defence Services Homes Division. You may be assured that considerable importance is attached to maintenance and development of the Defence Services Homes Scheme as an integral and major part of the task of the Corporation. I believe that the housing benefits which have been introduced by my government under the Defence Service Homes Scheme since December 1972, are indicative of the importance that the Australian Government attaches to this aspect of its policy initiatives. </para>
            <para>I understand that it is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, to set up a consultative panel or panels representing the special interest groups affected by the Corporation's activities and this matter is currently under consideration by the Corporation. I feel sure that my colleague will wish to consult the League as a matter of priority. </para>
            <para>While I have not been able to meet the specific request you have put to me, I should mention that the legislation specifies the circumstances in which a casual vacancy in the Corporation can arise and that in such an event the question of representation by the RSL would again be examined. </para>
            <para>I am attaching for your information a copy of a statement outlining benefits which the Australian Government has provided to housing for servicemen and ex-servicemen since December 1972. </para>

            <para>THE DEFENCE SERVICE HOME SCHEME</para>
            <para>IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SCHEME SINCE DECEMBER 1972</para>
            <para>One of the first steps taken after the Labor Government came to office in December 1972 was to carry out a comprehensive review of the then War Service Homes Scheme. The major changes which were made following this review were the most significant since the enactment of the original legislation in 1918. A further comprehensive review was made prior to the 1974-75 Budget and it was decided to make a number of additional major changes to improve the borrowing arrangements and scope of the Scheme. The following is a summary of the changes which have been implemented since 2 December 1972: </para>
            <para>Extension of Eligibility</para>
            <para>The categories of persons eligible for benefits under the Defence Service Homes Scheme were extended to include: . </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Members of the Forces on continuous full-time service on or after 7 December 1972 who, whether before or after that date, complete three years' effective full-time service. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>National Servicemen and National Service Officers serving immediately before 7 December 1972, who complete the period of service for which they were engaged to serve. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>Representatives of approved welfare organisations who, subject to certain conditions, served overseas with the Australian Forces in the 1939-45 War or in subsequent military operations. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>Single and widowed persons with qualifying service in the Forces. (The removal of the dependency requirement enables full recognition to be given to the principle that Defence Service Homes benefits are not only granted as a measure of repatriation but also as a reward for service). </para>
          </item>
        </list>
            <para>Maximum Loan</para>
            <para>The maximum lending limit under the Defence Service Homes Scheme was increased from $9,000 to $12,000 in May 1973 and, in December 1974, the limit was further increased to $15,000. </para>
            <para>Deposit Requirements</para>
            <para>The minimum deposit required under the Act was reduced to 5 per cent of the purchase price of the home. A discretionary power in the Act to waive the deposit is being exercised more liberally in favour of widowed mothers, seriously incapacitated applicants and others whose family obligations make it difficult for them to accumulate the normal deposit. </para>
            <para class="block">Loans for the Discharge of Existing Mortgages </para>
            <para>Prior to December 1972 it was the general policy not to grant loans for the discharge of private mortgages. While it has not been possible to lift restrictions on the provision of assistance for the discharge of existing mortgages, the previous policy has been relaxed and consideration is now given to the granting of loans for this purpose where the terms of the mortgage are onerous and having regard to the applicant's income, payment of the commitments under the mortgage is causing serious hardship. </para>
            <para>In addition, the Act was amended on IS May 1973 to specifically provide for advances to be made to discharge existing mortgages where the applicant is a person entitled to the special rate of pension payable under the first paragraph of the second schedule of the Repatriation Act. (Broadly this covers totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners.) </para>
            <para class="block">Assistance in Respect of a Second Home </para>
            <para>The general intention of the Scheme has always been that an eligible person will be entitled to the benefits of the Scheme on only one occasion and the longstanding policy has been to grant assistance in respect of a second home only in circumstances of great emergency. </para>
            <para>For a number of years strong representations had been received seeking an amendment to the Act to enable loans to be transferred from one home to another where the borrower is compelled to move for medical or employment reasons. </para>
            <para>After reviewing the matter closely, the Government concluded that there was a need for a more flexible set of arrangements and the Act was amended on 6 December 1974 to include provisions which facilitate the transfer of the balance of an existing loan from one home to another in special circumstances. However approval to transfer a loan will only be given where- the borrower, for reasons beyond his control, is compelled to move to another home; the application for the transfer of the loan is made before the first home is sold and the liability under the Defence Service Homes Act discharged; the applicant contributes as a deposit on the second home the full net proceeds derived from the sale of the first home. </para>
            <para>Interest Rate</para>
            <para>The Government reviewed the interest rate charged in respect of loans made under the Scheme. The rate of 3% per cent per annum had not been changed since it was fixed at that level in 1 946 and since then the long term bond rate had risen from 3 per cent to 9!4 per cent per annum. It was decided to retain the rate of 3% percent per annum for all loans up to the previous maximum loan of $ 12,000, and to provide for interest at a rate of 2 per cent below the most favourable rate charged by the Commonwealth Savings Bank on housing loans, to be charged on the amount of loan in excess of $12,000. </para>
            <para class="block">Special Arrangements for Persons on Limited Incomes </para>
            <para>In reviewing the interest rate on Defence Service Homes loans, the Government was concerned that an increase in the interest rate could make it necessary to refuse some applications for loans from eligible persons who ordinarily could not meet the obligations of home ownership except under the concessional conditions previously provided in the Defence Service Homes Act. Examples are widows, totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners, persons living on age pensions or small superannuation payments. </para>
            <para>To enable loans up to the new maximum loan of $13,000 to be granted in those cases, the Government decided that provision should be made in the legislation for a reduction in the instalments otherwise payable in cases where it is established that it would cause hardship to the applicant if he were required to pay in full the amount of the instalments based on the higher rate of interest payable on loan amounts in excess of $12,000. The amount by which instalments are reduced will remain as a charge on the property, but payment will not ordinarily be required while the purchaser or borrower continues to occupy the home, unless there is an improvement in his financial position, which permits him to make increased payments. </para>
            <para>OPERATIONS</para>
            <para>Since the Labor Government took office, activities under the Defence Service Homes Scheme have increased as follows: </para>
            <para class="block">
        <graphic href="096131197508216_6_0.jpg" />
      </para>
            <para>An amount of $130 million has been provided in the Budget for expenditure on Defence Service Homes in 1 974-75. </para>
            <para>From the inception of the Scheme in 1919 to 30 April 1975, 352 187 applicants had been assisted under the Scheme to become home owners and the total expenditure under the Scheme was $ 1 ,779,23 1 ,826. </para>
            <para>GROUP HOMES</para>
            <para>A special feature of the Defence Service Homes Scheme is the opportunity to purchase at cost, land or land and a dwelling-house in a Defence Service Homes estate. Upon the Labor Government coming into office, special action was taken to increase the stock of land to meet present and future demand. Land holdings, which at 30 June 1972 were estimated as sufficient to yield 4992 building lots were sufficient at 31 December 1974 to yield 11415 building lots. There are currently 49 Defence Service Homes estates in various stages of planning and development. </para>

          <para>- I do not know what the objective of honourable gentlemen is in trying to make some great issue over this matter. The great issue is that, with the creation of the Australian Housing Corporation, the very great benefits which the old War Service Homes Division was able to give to returned servicemen for some 50 years will be enhanced. The Corporation obviously will have a much greater future than the old War Service Homes Division. I have noticed over the years that a very great number  of Liberal members of Parliament have objected to the War Service Homes Division because it was an outstandingly successful socialist enterprise. Ex-servicemen were able to get the best of attention at a minimum of cost. The old War Service Homes Division was not only better than any bank or any building society but also immeasurably better than any insurance company. It also made available for ex-servicemen the services of such skilled people as conveyancers, solicitors and architects. </para>
        </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There was, as I would expect honourable members to have realised, some diminution of morale in the old War Service Homes Division because, with the cessation of overseas wars and the aging of people who had taken part in them, the future of the Division was minimal. That was one of the reasons why the Australian Government Government- decided to put the whole of the War Service Homes Division on a much wider basis. We would hope that, in due course, the services which previously were limited to those who had served overseas on active service will become increasingly available to all those who fall within the Australian Parliament's jurisdiction. There is no substantial difference of opinion between the Returned Services League and the Government on this matter at all. The RSL has acknowledged the fact that conditions of housing for returned men or for serving members are immeasurably better than they were when this Government was elected. </para>

            <para>- I can well appreciate the honourable gentleman's concern about the reports because I suppose that nobody has illustrated greater concern for welfare housing than he has. If the New South Wales Government were prepared to use in order to solve the economic problems of that State half the energy that it has used in the last 24 hours to misrepresent the effects of the Australian Budget, New South Wales would be a better place in which to live. It is difficult to imagine a greater collection of drivel and grizzle than we have witnessed so far. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The claim by the Minister as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> that New South Wales will receive only $90m, is completely false. New South Wales will receive for welfare housing in this financial year an amount of $123,41 1,000. That is the same as last year. Let us look at what happened in the last full year of Liberal-Country Party rule-1971-72. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member can do the calculation in real terms if he likes or in actual terms, but the amount was $55.5m. So the criticism of this Government's provision for welfare housing has come about as a result of an increase of 122 per cent in the amount actually allocated as compared with 1971-72. In fact, the amount of $123.411m compares very favourable indeed with the amount allocated in the last 3 full years of office of the Liberal-Country Party Government. In those 3 full years it was able to muster and allocate $138.55m. Last year the Australian Government advanced amounts to the States for welfare housing that were consistent with their capacity to spend the funds; in other words, every cent that they could spend was allocated to them. In 1973-74 the New South Wales Government had to carry over an amount of $ 17m which had been allocated for welfare housing because it did not have the capacity or the ability to spend it. The amount of $123m is to be split up between the Housing Commission of New South Wales and the Home Builders Account. The allocation is a matter to be decided in negotiations between the New South Wales Minister and myself. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The New South Wales Government has shown over a period of time that it has severely neglected the people in need of welfare housing, particularly in respect of community services. It is obsessed with a North Shore mentality. I simply say to this House that the criticism is a mixture of sham, hyperbole and misrepresentation. The New South Wales Government is very quick to criticise any lack of spending by the Australian Government and is equally quick to criticise any means by which funds are raised in order to enable such spending to be carried out. In my view the attack on the Budget by the New South Wales Government illustrates a sanctimonious attitude by those who are dominated by North Shore duplicity. </para>

            <para>-Recently members of my Department had discussions with the principals of the Department of Transport in South Australia who advised that they expected to complete the sealing of the Eyre Highway during 1975-76. There have been some problems with some of the contractors, one of whom had to relinquish his contract which in turn has been taken up by other contractors. So that part of the work is proceeding quite satisfactorily. At the moment, apart from the 3 earthwork contractors, the South Australian Highways Department and the contractors who are doing the priming and sealing have 6 tankers working on the job. As I said to the honourable member earlier, it is anticipated that the construction and sealing will be completed this year. It is part of our objective to ensure that the Trans- Australia Railway is then in competition with the road hauliers as well as sea transport so that there will be a truly competitive position between these modes of transport. On top of that we want to use the equipment that is being used on sealing the Eyre Highway to get under way with work on the Stuart Highway, which was part of the Prime Minister's election policy and promises. Once we can get the equipment released from work on the Eyre Highway it can then be used on the Stuart Highway. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member asked whether there are any procedural matters holding up completion of the Eyre Highway. No, as far as this Government is concerned all the approvals that are necessary under the national highway program have been put through and there is no reason why work should be held up by reason of finance. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Attorney-General: Is it correct that the court in Paraguay which refused extradition of the Bar tons did so because it did not consider that the British extradition treaty with Paraguay applied to Australia? Do we rely on British treaties for extradition procedures with a substantial number of other countries? If the Paraguayan decision brings into question extradition arrangements between Australia and other countries, what special steps are being taken to have the Paraguayan court decision reversed or otherwise to overcome this dangerous situation? </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable member for the question because it involves a matter of considerable concern to many Australians. The Barton case, of course, highlights not only the difficulties with extradition law but also the sorry state of corporate law generally in Australia. I have in mind matters relating to the proposed corporations and securities Bill, the corporate affairs bureaus as they exist in the various States and matters of that sort. It is true in regard to extradition law that Australia still depends in large measure on old treaties, and a consequential element of uncertainty comes into the situation. For some time the Government has been embarked upon an ambitious program of negotiating and upgrading the extradition law. Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and my own Department work is in hand on these matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>So far as the particular court case is concerned, although it is early days yet it is my understanding, as I indicated to the House yesterday, that an appeal will be lodged and our lawyers in Paraguay, who are versed in Paraguayan law, not Australian law, are optimistic about our chances. I would like to make a final point before I sit down. When one thinks of the Barton situation and other situations that were in the news even this morning- Queensland Mines Ltd, Nabarlek, Patrick Partners and matters of that sort, all at different levels- we can only say how lamentable is the Australian legal situation, fragmented as it is through the various States, each section unable to take care of the situations that can develop at any time and how much we badly need corporations and securities legislation of a kind that we introduced into this Parliament as long as 7 months ago. </para>
          <para>One could go on and say that the Rae Committee in the Senate sat for 4 years exposing mischief and abuse of this sort. My predecessor introduced the Bill into the Senate, I think in December of last year. That Bill went through this House, I think in February, or perhaps ea'rly March, of this year. It is now bogged down in the Senate on the motion of the Opposition parties in the Senate. It does no credit to this Parliament. It certainly does no credit to the Liberal Party and the National Country Party which must be seen to be opposing reform measures of this sort. It is only when we get reform measures of this sort that abuses of the sort which the honourable member has in mind will become a less frequent feature of the Australian scene. </para>

          <para>- I noted the comment in the newspaper which is not usually regarded as a socialist journal, making this point in defence of the position of this Government. The point is well taken. First of all, much of the indignation and perhaps just about all of it is manufactured. Most of the manufacturing is coming from the benches of the Opposition. I find that rather puzzling because if honourable members opposite were successful in sowing discord and pessimism in the community- that is their purpose because they have only one objective in mind and that is to try to undermine confidence in the community so that hopefully they can capitalise on that for a very narrow, very short time, and very selfish political purposes- then the corporate sector of the Australian economy would suffer more seriously than any other sector. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The corporate sector is showing signs of an early recovery. I have said that many times and I repeat it. We should not try to frighten this development. I do not try to make too much of the strength of that recovery. On the other hand, members of the Opposition who profess to be dedicated to the free enterprise system in the community seem committed to undermining that recovery to the disadvantage of the private sector. </para>

            <para>- There is no justification for the reports. The States have never been better treated financially than they have been under this Government. For instance, this year financial assistance grants to the States will be of the order of $3, 1 85m, an increase of 34 per cent. Additionally, we introduced an improved betterment factor which increased the multiplier for that purpose from 1.8 to 3 per cent. We added $220m to the base grant. But the overall picture is even more generous than that. The estimates for 1975-76 of total funds going to the States from the Australian Government- they cover capital funds as well as funds for recurrent purposes and include specific grants- show that the States will get $8,566m from the Australian Government compared with $6,567m last year, an increase of some $2,000m. That is an increase of a much greater order than the order by which we have increased our outlays of expenditure under the Budget. If one bears in mind that some 25 per cent of our commitment for expenditure in the Budget is for the States one can readily gauge just how generous this Government has been, at some sacrifice to itself, to the States. </para>

              <para>-Over the years we should not forget that a very great number of people in Australia saw political advantage in and wanted to retain their vested interest of cashing in on the mistakes of the West in Indo-China over the last 30 years. They are walked at the fact that this issue is no longer available to them; that the West as a whole, not only in Europe but now also in North America and Oceania, has woken up to the cruel exploitation of the people of Vietnam. There are some people still in Australia who would like to cash in on the consequences of the disastrous policies that previous Australian governments supported in Indo-China. There were a few people- my memory is that they were mainly diplomats- who sought asylum in Australia, and in those circumstances very properly I said that they could have asylum if they undertook not to engage in political activity or allow themselves to be exploited in political activity. Obviously anybody who comes to Australia is as entitled to seek Australian citizenship under the law as anybody else is, whether such an undertaking has been given or not. </para>

            <para>-The Leader of the Opposition has set himself firmly against the redistribution al reform effects of the new personal income tax scale. He has established his position in defence of a privileged minority in the community. What he has effectively said is that, given the opportunity, he would prevent the introduction of this personal income tax scheme; he would prefer to persevere with the present system of taxation, with all its inequities and all its serious defects in administrative and operational respects. He is saying, in effect, that the half a million people who currently pay tax under the present scheme, who are among the most needy in the community and who would cease paying tax under our scheme, in fact will be forced to continue paying tax if he has his way. He has a rather curious argument to the effect that his defence is in support of the thrifty- those who save, those who work hard, those who keep their nose to the grindstone. Surely a marginal tax rate of 35 per cent, for instance, for people with incomes between $5,000 and $10,000 a year, compared with the present rate of between 44c and 48c in the dollar, is an incentive to more industry- if the proposition upon which his assumptions are based is that people work harder if they are given more return for their work. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We ought to be clear about the position of the Leader of the Opposition and the philosophical inspiration upon which he proceeds- the philosophy of objectivism, the Ayn Rand school of thought. That is that man stands alone and stands for himself and to hell with anyone else; that what happens to others is their fault and their responsibility. To put it in its simplest form, those who make it in our sort of society should be able to hang on to everything they get and if they get it from their forebears in the form of a wealthy inheritance, perhaps a large pastoral holding, then the case becomes even more persuasive. This is a sort of reversion to social economic Darwinism. If, on the other hand, they fall flat on their face in the struggle in our sort of system and cannot get up, they have freedom the Leader of the Opposition is talking about freedoms lately in a rather vague way which in a general sense sounds unexceptionable but, if one knows the inspiration that is guiding him, I think it is rather exceptionable- and their freedom is to stay flat on their face. Some freedom! I conclude with a word of warning to my good friend the Leader of the Opposition: He is an innocent country boy and he may well be the unwitting victim of a gigantic international communist conspiracy. Ayn Rand graduated from the Leningrad University in 1924. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Prime Minister a question that is a supplementary to the one that was asked of him by the honourable member for Warringah. Was any undertaking required of the Chilean refugees that they should not participate in politics or political discussions in Australia? Has any undertaking similar to that required of refugees from South Vietnam been required of any other category of refugees admitted into Australia since the admission of refugees first began? Does he believe that, as a result of the undertaking given by those of whom he has required that there should be no political involvement, they will be second rate Australian citizens in that apparently they are not to be allowed to participate in political affairs in the same way as every other Australian citizen is? </para>

            <para>- There is no requirement of the character that I earlier described for categories of refugees as a whole. Hundreds of Vietnamese refugees have come to this country. They were in general refugees who were not going to be admitted by any other country in our region. There is only a handful of people who are Vietnamese citizens and who have been required to give the undertaking which I have described. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman is very frustrated that he will not be able to exploit these people who have given the undertaking unless they break their word of honour. They were, as I say, principally diplomats. They were not people who would ordinarily have come within any category for admission to Australia, but they were allowed in on condition that they gave this undertaking- a very proper undertaking. If in due course they wish to become Australian citizens, then of course they will be able to become Australian citizens like anybody else who lives in the country. </para>

I do not know how long honourable gentlemen opposite will want to exploit these situations which they did so much to prolong.

              <para>-The honourable gentleman mentions the Chileans. I do not know whether any undertakings were required from Chileans. There has been no history of Chilean political activity in this country. I certainly believe that the Chileans who have been given refuge in this country should refrain from political activity as should Ugandans and others. But there has not been a history of Chilean or Ugandan political activity in Australia. There has been a regrettable history for the last 15 years of the exploitation for internal Australian political reasons of the situation in South Vietnam. The honourable gentleman wants to continue to exploit for his political purposes those refugees who have come to Australia as a result of the disastrous failure of the policies which his Government supported in Vietnam throughout the 1960s. </para>

            <para>-My Government sought election on the promise that it would enable local government to participate in the proceedings of the Loan Council and that it would allow local government to have access to the Grants Commission. Over 2 years ago the Parliament passed a new Act giving an extended charter to the Grants Commission. As a result of that Act local government has benefited immensely in last year's Budget and in this year's Budget. Last year local government in Australia received $56.3m. In this Budget it will receive $79.9m. In each case those sums will be available to local government bodies to spend as they see fit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Unfortunately it has not been possible to carry out the other undertaking upon which my Government sought election, that local government should have representation on the Loan Council. It will be remembered that at the Constitutional Convention in September 1973 I put the proposition that the aldermen and councillors in each State should be entitled to elect a person to speak and vote for them on the Loan Council. </para>
          <para>It was agreed at the Constitutional Convention that the 6 Premiers and I should meet the following month- October 1973- to discuss an amendment of the Financial Agreement under which the Loan Council operates. Only 2 Premiers supported my Government's proposal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reece.</inline> It required the support of all 7 heads of government. Accordingly, we had to try other means. In May last year a referendum was held on a proposal to provide that the Australian Government could borrow money on behalf of local government bodies. The referendum was carried in New South Wales. It was almost carried in Victoria. It received 46.8 per cent of the votes in the 6 Australian States combined. </para>
          <para>I am happy to say that over the last few months, as a result of the renewed effort to have the Constitutional Convention reconvened, it has been agreed that at next month's Constitutional Convention, which will assemble in Melbourne on 24 September, 2 local government proposals will be on the agenda. The first is for a referendum to permit this Parliament to make laws with respect to the borrowing of money by the Commonwealth for local government bodies constituted under the law of a State or Territory; the other is to permit the Parliament to grant financial assistance to any local government body constituted under the law of a State or Territory on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. Those items will come before the Constitutional Convention. They are listed immediately after the agenda item concerning the referendum on interchange of powers and the agenda items concerning amendment of the referendum provisions contained in section 128 of the Constitution. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report referred to by the honourable gentleman. Indeed, I referred to it in answering an earlier question. The report is almost a notorious fact in Australian public life these days because it has been the subject of so much comment. I think I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> on the radio program <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> this morning describing the situation revealed in the report, the conflict of interests, the insider trading, the reckless representations made and the opportunity for and abuse of privilege. These have become well known to all honourable members as a feature of that industry to the detriment of many Australians. The report also set out that not only were people being unjustly enriched by abusing their privilege and their position but they were doing so at the expense of ordinary Australian investors who were being defrauded and taken down. I remember the report saying- I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said it- that the adverse effects on the capital market of Australia were something that should not be overlooked. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It has been said over and over again that Australia needs a single, all-embracing corporations and securities law. One asks: How often are we to hear that said? It is as easy to transfer capital in Australia today as it is to make a telephone call. It can go from Sydney to Perth on the making of a telephone call. Yet the States persist in their 6 separate puny attempts to regulate these abuses. I have no doubt at all that in their own minds they concede the futility of the effort. Yet they oppose this Parliament, this Government putting the situation right or moving in the direction of putting it right. </para>
          <para>As I said in answer to the earlier question, we introduced into this Parliament the Corporations and Securities Bill in, I think, February or March. It had previously been introduced into the Senate in December of last year. We are now in August of 1975. It went through this House after a full debate. The Opposition did not move a single amendment to the Bill when it was here because it had not really thought out its position. Yet the Bill had been the subject of close, detailed, prolonged public discussion and consultations with the various professional associations throughout Australia. Representations were received. I have certainly made it clear that we are not dogmatic on it as. a piece of legislation. We are flexible. We want there to be a law. We have certainly said that we are prepared to consider any reasonable amendment put forward to the Bill. But in the Senate predictably the Opposition-the Liberal and National Country Party people who insist upon preserving the present inadequate system- insisted upon referring the legislation to a Standing Committee, despite the opposition of the Government. The Bill is with the Standing Committee now. It has to be said that, as I understand it, the Standing Committee has barely begun to consider the task and is already asking for an extension of time. If amendments are to be moved they can be moved and the Government will consider them. But this situation does this Parliament little credit. It does great discredit to the Liberal and National Country Party people for their continued obstinate opposition to measures of . reform of this sort because all it means is that cases like Patrick Partners, Queensland Mines Ltd and the Bar tons will be a continual affliction on Australian corporate life for years to come. </para>

            <para>-I suggest to honourable members that in asking questions they take a little more cognisance of the Standing Orders. Since the start of this sessional period I have been more lenient in ruling on questions than I was during the last sessional period. But a number of questions today and during this week have gone very close to asking Ministers for opinions on statements made by other persons or opinions on matters which have been the policy of previous governments, both of which are out of order. I think such questions prolong answers and do not do any service at question time. I ask honourable members to be more careful in framing the questions they ask. </para>

            <para>-Yes. On Tuesday at question time the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> said that I had suggested an optional preferential voting system in which a voter had 'only to vote on  a  group basis for one candidate'. I have never advocated or supported such a system. I have proposed a simplified preferential system- a system which would enable the voter who wishes not only to support a particular candidate but also to record his preferences in the manner recommended by that candidate to use a shorthand method of voting. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>The proposed simplified system of preferential voting would enable a voter to place a No. 1 beside the name of the candidate he most prefers, to have his vote counted and, if necessary, to have his preferences distributed in the recommended manner, without the need to number each square. If a distribution of preferences became necessary the votes of the candidate to whom the No. 1 vote was given would be counted in accordance with the recommendations of the candidate 's how to vote card. What I have said is that if the voter wants to record his preference in some other way he should still have the right to do so by placing a number in each square according to his preference, as at present. What I have said is that, in either event, a voter should have the right to vote for an individual candidate. He should not be compelled to vote for a list on an all or none basis. To imply that I would support this form of de personalisation of parliamentary representation is to misrepresent my views. </para></speech>

          <para>-The matter  I  wish to raise in this debate concerns many Australian citizens who are victims of an unjust system of land valuation as it affects local government ratepayers. The matter has received some attention from time to time and is mainly one which comes within the jurisdiction of State governments. I raise this matter in the House today because I believe it is of very great importance. Perhaps it is a question that could usefully be discussed in conferences between the Australian and State governments. It also might be discussed, to some advantage, at the Constitutional Convention meetings. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I ventilate this matter today because the Australian Government has shown initiative in a number of areas and here is another opportunity for the Australian Government to deal with a question. Ratepayers- goods citizens of this country- are suffering from an oppressive land valuation system when applied to the collection of local government rates. The New South Wales Government is unmoved by the burden being borne by some of the nation's best citizens. I make a plea today for thought and consideration to be given to these people who have helped to pioneer our country, have reared families and have built homes for the purpose of having a place in which to live in the closing period of their lives. They find, unfortunately, that because of the present land valuation system quite frequently rates skyrocket and land values increase as a result of the activities of speculators, developers and others who buy lots of land. This, in turn, affects the people who do not wish to be moved and whose property values remain approximately the same over the years. </para>
        <para>Honourable members would know that local government rates are based on the unimproved capital value of land. Recent land sales are taken as a measure of the unimproved capital value. I should like to point out how injustice is brought to citizens. This affects people in cities, towns and the countryside. No one is exempt from this form of land valuation and rate collection. A particular case which has come to my attention is in the city of Bathurst. Flats were permitted to be built in a residential areas in which people had bought or built homes so that they might live the rest of their lives in a decent environment and in the company of friends and relatives. They were disturbed when a developer paid a high price for a property and that high price was translated into the value of all the other properties in that area. I ask honourable members to consider the plight of citizens who had their homes built and who have now been shocked to find that the valuations on those homes have increased sharply. The savage rates that have been imposed on them are of such magnitude that they find it almost impossible to pay the rates levied on them. These savage increases in rates ought to be halted. I believe that action needs to be taken in this country at this time if the situation is to be eased in any fashion at all. </para>
        <para>I bring to the attention of honourable members a number of cases that have come to my notice. The first concerns a valuation in the city of Bathurst which rose from $2,800 to $22,000. The rates for these ratepayers- more than one was involved-rose from $280.26 to $1,669.30. These rates must be paid by pensioners, retired people and those reaching the period of retirement. This is an unjust burden. It is an intolerable burden. I feel that parliaments and governments ought to be speaking out about matters of this kind. Through the initiative of this Government, greater grants are being made to local government. But, despite what may be said to the contrary, the situation with respect to rates cannot be overcome merely by the making of grants. These peaks will remain the peaks. They will continue to be great hurdles for people to try to surmount. </para>
        <para>In other cases, I found that ratepayers living only on their savings, pension or wages were called upon to pay as much as $2,000 a year in council rates. This situation is utterly unbearable and requires correction. I also bring to the attention of the Parliament the problem faced by farmers. These matters have been referred to me from time to time. A developer-speculator comes along and sells some lots of 25 acres or 50 acres and, as a result, land values increase. Those land values bear no relationship whatsoever to the earning capacity of the land, the economics of the land and the ability of the people to pay their way, having regard to all the costs involved, the increases in charges, the depressed cattle market and, as a further example, the fact that potatoes are an uneconomic proposition at this time. All of these are issues of great concern. </para>
        <para>Only this week, to add to all the other representations which have been made to me by numerous people in many places throughout the electorate that I have had the pleasure of representing, I received this letter </para>
        <para>I wish to place before you details of rate assessment on my property on Singles Ridge Road, North Springwood, and to ask your support in an effort to remedy the very inequitable position in which I have been placed- with many others in like circumstances. </para>
        <para>Attached are copies of relevant correspondence which had taken place over a period of almost one year since my initial protest to the Valuer-General on the valuation increase of over 500 per cent, from $7,500 to $44,000. </para>
        <para class="block">That is an increase of almost 600 per cent. The letter continues: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It appears that the only criterion recognised by the V.G. is that of value of sales in the area, regardless of the basis on which such sales were made. In my case adjoining land was bought by speculators at highly inflated prices founded in purely fictitious rumour. Since my land is zoned Non-Urban E' the restrictions imposed by this zoning make it impossible for me to sell my property. </para>
          <para>I am therefore placed in the position of being forced to pay rates based on valuation of $44,000 (this year $953.75) or by default lose the property where my family was raised and which I have held for 28 years. As I am a war widow, now 60 years of age, with a very limited fixed income it is quite beyond my capacity to continue to pay rates at this level. </para>
          <para>I beg you, as a last resort, to please make an effort in Parliament to bring about some alleviation of this intolerable burden. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This letter is representative of the feelings of many people. I ventilate this matter in the hope that Parliament- the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> and those who speak for this Parliament on these matters will seek to stir the States into activity to take a stand in defence of these people who in their closing years deserve justice and not burdens of the type that I have illustrated. </para>

          <para>-The honourable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Luchetti)</inline> who has just spoken, is, I believe, assiduous in representing the views of his electors. The purpose of this debate is to enable members, particularly private members, to express any grievance on matters affecting the conduct of government. In the short time that is allowed to me today I rise to speak on the conduct of many Ministers of this Government, probably the majority of Ministers. I believe that it is valid and necessary to say that the present Labor Government is characterised in large part by incompetence, maladministration, waste, secrecy and evasion. I will give some illustrations of those claims. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One of the rights which every citizen of this country has is the right to make representations to a Minister, if he or she wish through a member of Parliament. Every citizen has the right to expect that such representations will be dealt with quickly, fully and responsibly. This is a most important part of our parliamentary representative democracy. I have at present the largest bundle of outstanding representations to Ministers that I have ever seen in the period that I have been a member of this place. I can get very little response from most Ministers of this Government. The unreplied-to representations that I have make a pile four or five inches thick. Let me mention some of them very quickly. </para>
        <para>I mention first those dealing with immigration. This is a particularly bad area. I am sure that my experience is shared by other members in this place. I should not be at all surprised if this situation applied to Ministers themselves when dealing with other Ministers. I mention first the case of a Miss Carne val i- I apologise if I do not pronounce the name correctly- who is making representations on behalf of her sister and brother-in-law, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Angelo</inline> Gismondi. Sponsorship was sought on 18 October 1974. I made representations on 4 November. I sent a follow-up telegram to the then Minister for Labor and Immigration on 5 March 1975 after no response of any kind was forthcoming except for an acknowledgment of my letter, and that is useless. The Minister sent a letter on 12 May in response to this representation. That letter begged the question so much that additional representations had to be made on 22 May. Today is 21 August, and no substantive reply has been received. This is a bad case. It is one of the worst that I have, but it is by no means atypical of the whole situation. </para>
        <para>Under the Regional Employment Development scheme, a primary school in the suburb of Hollywood in my electorate according to my advice actually received approval from the then Minister for Labor and Immigration for a project. With the disruption that has gone on in the preparation and in the dealing with the Budget and all the chopping and changing that has occurred, that school has now been advised that the project has been cancelled. The school already has incurred expenditure of $2,000. We cannot get any reply of an urgent nature out of the Government. There is no response by telephoning, writing letters or sending telegrams. I am advised that there are many similar cases and that the whole administration of this scheme is a complete mess. </para>
        <para>For the first time in my knowledge one now has people desperately ringing and saying that the Government owes them such and such an amount for goods sold or services supplied and one has to ring up the Treasury or some other department and try to get the wheels moving so that those people will be paid. Surely to Heaven the Government has an obligation to pay quickly. One can send telegrams and letters or ring and get very little response in this respect. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the operation of the National Employment and Training scheme. I have had four particularly bad cases drawn to my attention in this respect. Of course, the people to whom I am about to refer were attracted to make their inquiries at the beginning in November of last year. They have come to me in desperation months later- in March or May. The 4 cases to which I am about to refer- there are more in the files- are still unresolved. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline> Cote, who made an inquiry, was refused. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cote</inline> has an appeal pending. He cannot get a reply. </para>
        <para>I made representations on behalf of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Hall on 25 March. There has been nothing substantive in relation to them. I made representations on behalf of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Wearne</inline> on 28 April. There has been nothing substantive in relation to her. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Wearne</inline> was encouraged by the Commonwealth Employment Service to enrol as a trainee in the Nedlands Teachers Training College. They said to her: 'Your application will be approved. You are in the category of those who will be approved'. So she enrolled. She has 4 children to support. She engaged in such study because she had been encouraged to do so. I repeat that the Minister has not given a substantive reply to my representations on her behalf. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Robin</inline>Bremner was also assured by the Department that she would qualify under the scheme. She did not qualify. She has lodged an appeal. The appeal is to be held in Melbourne. She has since been told by departmental officers that the only thing they can suggest for her to do is to get in touch with her member of Parliament so that he can make representations. She did so and I made representations. What has happened in relation to them? Absolutely nothing. A telegram was sent on 13 May. No response has been received to it. One of those people has written in a letter to me that the NEAT scheme appears to have been 'ill planned and poorly administered'. I can only commend her for her restraint because obviously the conception and administration of this scheme is incompetence in the extreme. The people to whom I have referred sit during their courses besides people who are receiving aid and who are in comparable positions. </para>
        <para>Surely the whole situation has reached a ridiculous stage when members of the Public Service, feeling no doubt out of a sense of decency that they have to say something to these people, have to say to them: 'Look, we cannot get any quick response. We suggest that you go to your member of Parliament and get him to raise the matter'. The acknowledgement by Ministers of letters written to them is perfunctory. I suppose the making of such an acknowledgement is polite but it does not get one anywhere. One wants a substantive result to representations, even if the answer is no. In many cases the decision may not be the right one, but at least the person concerned knows where he or she stands and is not going to continue to incur expenditure and to run up liabilities unnecessarily. One may follow up a matter by way of a telegram and still not get action taken any more quickly. </para>
        <para>From time to time I have heard it stated by certain people that they have not got sufficient staff. For heaven's sake, these new schemes were instituted by this supposedly bright, radical Government. The Government went to the people and said that it was going to do this, that and the other and those matters were debated and voted upon. The Government should not be saying that it has not got enough staff to deal with the problems which it has caused. That is no excuse. I say that the Government has a deep responsibility to regard the administration of its schemes seriously and not as something to be left to others and to be ignored. That results inevitably in much waste and dilatory conduct. It should be made quite clear that it is for the Ministers to insist upon efficiency being shown by their staffs and their departments. If the administration of a scheme is beyond a Department then that is something that the Minister and the Government ought to have weighed up at the beginning. </para>
        <para>I say that the whole tone of the actions of the Government has been to neglect the area of administration, which causes waste and extravagance. When Ministers stand up in this Parliament, as they did during question time this morning, and talk about their generosity they should remember that the money they are spending is the money of the taxpayers of this country. Figures have been supplied, in response to questions that have been asked, that indicate that the Ministry has double the number of staff employed by the previous Government. There is now double the staff on double the salaries with double the degrees, with every office machine and aid known to man and with a vast Public Service back-up. We have already had certain hard evidence of inefficiency in this field. We have had the comment by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Anthony,</inline> who was the Private Secretary of a Minister, that there were a thousand unanswered queries, or something to that effect, on his Minister's table. We have had a most illuminating statement by a former Secretary of the former Treasurer, who said that the filing system was not well kept. In fact, he went on to explain that everything was kept loose and that one had to shuffle through everything in order to find documents. That was happening in the office of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. Surely to Heaven the situation has reached a ridiculous stage. I make a plea to the Government to endeavour to overcome the problems. Beset as it may be by its political problems, the administrative problems are its responsibility to overcome. The Government is creating hardship, anxiety and expense to thousands of Australians by its reprehensible conduct. </para>

          <para>- I want to take the opportunity of this debate to support the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland).</inline> Like him, I want to take the opportunity, without acrimony and without making any personal attack on any Minister or officer of any department, to spur on the Ministers and their advisers to treat the Australian public with a greater deal of respect than they have shown in recent times. To my mind in the final analysis politics is about people and the rights of people. We have a great tradition in Australian political life of giving to even the humblest citizen in the country the right to have his particular grievance aired in the national forum of the Parliament. It has been both disappointing and depressing to note that there have been long delays by some Ministers in answering correspondence from members of Parliament who, in all good faith and honesty, have made representations on behalf of aggrieved constituents. I submit that it would be fit and proper if all Ministers were to adopt the practice of those of their colleagues who are most prompt in replying to the queries raised. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is disappointing to me that I have had to rise and support the honourable member for Curtin in bringing to the notice of the Australian people the very great discourtesies that have emanated from some ministerial offices. It gives me no personal pleasure and certainly no delight to have to get up in this chamber and speak like this, but I am concerned and worried about the increasing tendency towards discourtesy on the part of the administrators. Heads of Departments are involved as well as Ministers. It is simply not good enough that citizens have to wait many months for replies to their queries. I am also concerned about the types of replies that quite often are received. Many members of Parliament are very upset when they receive a stereotyped or roneoed reply signed by a Secretary and not the Minister on which is printed the name of their constituent, often without any address, and do not want to hand on the reply to their constituent because of the discourtesy that is inherent in that type of reply. </para>
        <para>The long administrative delays are creating great hardship in relation to such schemes as the National Employment and Training scheme and in the field of social security. They are areas in which deep personal emotions are involved. It is to be regretted that the system instead of getting better is getting bogged down and becoming hopeless and rather chaotic. Our office staff in our electorates is spending a great deal of time going through past correspondence in an endeavour to satisfy the requests of the constituents. I think it is appropriate on behalf of all members of Parliament to record in this national Parliament the great measure of thanks that we all owe to our own staffs. </para>

            <para>- I appreciate the support of my 2 colleagues, the honourable member for Lyne and Hume. I want to record my own deep personal appreciation of my dedicated staff- my secretary, Miss Ann Harber, and my research officer, Trish Burrell. I hope that the infectious enthusiasm that they and members of the staffs of other members of Parliament display will flow over to ministerial staffs. Their dedication could well be copied and their devotion to their duty and concern for people could well be followed by the Public Service with very great benefit to all people involved. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>We have noted the vast increases that have taken place in ministerial staff establishments. The honourable member for Curtin touched on this. I note that the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> asked a question on 27 April 1972 on this matter and that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> replied to a similar question from the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> on 21 November 1973. As a rule of thumb it would appear that the startling increase in the number of people working for Ministers under the Labor Government is roughly of the order of 60 per cent. I am not opposing that increase, but what I do oppose with all the strength at my command is that, notwithstanding this great increase in staff, the service is getting worse. I except from this criticism some Ministers who are superb in the way that they answer correspondence and queries but others just seem to treat us with complete disregard. It is depressing to note that notwithstanding the great innovations and improvements that have been made in such matters as communications some Ministers are more intent on being jet trippers and empire builders than keeping their finger on the pulse of their departments and getting on with the job of giving service to the people whom they should be proud to represent. </para>
        <para>Having spoken in that vein I want to comment on a few administrative matters that are causing very great concern within my own electorate and I know that the same situation permeates through many other electorates. I refer to the problems of getting payment under the Regional Employment Development scheme. I might say that I appreciate the fact that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> has seen fit to come along and participate in this debate. I thank him for the courtesy that he is displaying to back bench members. I have had complaints from several city councils in my electorate that whilst they have appreciated the funding for various essential RED projects under their care, the Federal Government has got the praise and the limelight although in effect the city councils have been picking up the tab because of long delays in receiving payment for the various projects. On many occasions this has resulted in the city councils and shire councils showing a debt on their books as at 30 June. This has a psychological effect on people and on councillors. The councils have to pay interest on the overdrawn amount. The Warwick City Council has been overdrawn by some $ 100,000, at certain times all applicable to RED grants not being paid by the Australian Government. The Jondaryan Shire Council has $50,000 owing. The Council has to pay interest on its overdraft. The Toowoomba City Council lodged claims at the end of May for' which no payment has been received. There has been further delay and further-bogging down of the administrative machinery. The Glen gal len Shire Council owes $35,000. </para>
        <para>The final matter on which I want to comment is the cavalier manner in which the Minister in charge of the Grants Commission <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> treated back bench members when he was the Special Minister of State in charge of the Grants Commission. I specifically refer to the manner in which allocations under the Grants Commission were made known. When I picked up my local paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Toowoomba Chronicle,</inline> I found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ron</inline> McAuliffe had made an announcement in regard to the grants. At that time I knew nothing about the grants. I took the matter up with the Minister and he really pooled himself when he said that every senator and every member was advised by telegram on Monday, 26 July. Yet the <inline font-style="italic">Toowoomba Chronicle</inline> rolled off the presses at 3 a.m. on the Monday morning. Obviously the information that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> had given to the newspaper had been released to him the night before the telegram to senators and members. I want to know whether the local member of Parliament is to be treated as being a second rate member? </para>

          <para>- I wish to refer to one of the most significant political events that took place during the winter recess of the Parliament. As we have seen the Opposition drift further to the right in its statements and as we have tried to analyse the criticism that it has made of Government programs, we have been able to observe that it has put up nothing in place of these programs or said what it would do if it were in government. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think one of the most interesting statements to be made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> since he became Leader of the Opposition was that made at the Press Club luncheon and reported in newspapers on 1 August. I want to quote what he said because it may be of interest to some of the other members of his own Party and of the National Country Party of Australia who have not already read what he had to say on their behalf. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We reject enforced equality in the work place, in the economy, in education. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">We have been unable to get either the Leader of the Opposition, any of his shadow Ministers or indeed any of the members of the Parties opposite to tell us exactly what they mean by not enforcing equality. Obviously it is a direct criticism of the manner in which this Government has carried out its program. I want to go through some of the programs of the Government so that we can see what would happen and what the Opposition would do should it ever return to government. I know at the moment that members of the Opposition think that they are high flyers because the computers tell them that they are more popular than we are. The computers told them that in April of 1974 and they are still sitting in the same place as they were sitting in April of 1974. One of the great strengths of this Government and one of the things that will hold it in good stead in any future campaigns will be the community programs which have been carried out and which are now threatened to be destroyed by a conservative government. </para>
        <para>Let us have a look at the manner in which the previous Government did not enforce equality in this country and will not enforce equality when it returns to government at some time in the future. It may be of interest for honourable members opposite to know that when the Australian </para>
        <para class="block">Schools Commission did a survey on the Australian schools system after we took over after 23 years of government by the present Opposition there were no fewer than 809 government schools classified as disadvantaged and no fewer than 211 Catholic schools classified as disadvantaged, making a total of 1020 schools with a total enrolment of almost 400 000 children that were going to schools classified as disadvantaged. This is a situation to which we could return if the Opposition should come to power. It would consider the operations of the Schools Commission and the classification of schools as something not in the best interests of Australia- as something that we are trying to force upon the community. </para>
        <para>Let us have a look at what it meant. Most citizens of this country get their opportunity at the beginning- at school or pre-school. It is too late after they have finished their schooling. Whilst the Liberal Party and the National Country Party might be critical of what we have done, I ask them to remember the mess in which they left us. There were 400 000 children who were just disadvantaged; there were many other schools on the border but those children were the ones whom the Schools Commission thought it could help most readily. But under the previous Liberal Government almost half the number of children who went to university or colleges of advanced education came from 17 per cent of the community- the professional classes. Sixty per cent of the Australian community made up of the skilled and the unskilled- the manual workers provided 20 per cent of the intake. That was an enormous waste. It was an absolute waste of ability of children who were going to those schools. Let us recall what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr McKinnon</inline> had to say some time ago in relation to equality of education. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Equality of opportunity does not mean conformity or levelling down. In an equal situation there will, of course, be high flyers and slow plodders within all groups of children. Equality does mean, however, that there ought to be roughly the same proportion of good, bad and indifferent students among all groups in the community. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He goes on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Should children from disadvantaged suburbs not have opportunities to complete secondary school and university simple because their parents are poor? Is there really evidence that they are less able? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Of course what has been exposed by the Karmel Committee report and the carrying out of the policies by the Schools Commission is that those children are not less able. The figures which I cited about entries into universities and colleges of advanced education will change as a result of the policies of this Government. But if the Liberal and National Country Parties return to office we will return to the old system because we cannot have enforced equality. The Leader of the Opposition promised in his speech 'an exciting approach to choice in education'. For 23 years we have had a look at that excitement. We have had a look at how the community lived with that excitement. We see the policies indicted by the way in which they were carried out at the end of 1972. </para>
        <para>Let us look at some of the other areas. In going through what one might analyse as 'enforced equality', I suppose that the Liberal Party would regard Medibank as enforced equality. What did it have at the end of 1972 when it went out of office? There were 113 private health schemes. There were 1 1 3 separate and distinct administrations and 1 500 000 people living in this country with no health coverage. I repeat, there were 1 500 000 people involved. At the time of the introduction of Medibank, working people were paying as much as professional people for the right to have some sort of health cover. Are honourable members opposite saying that the introduction of Medibank is enforced equality? Is Medibank to be dismantled whenever a conservative government returns to power in this country? Spokesmen on the other side of the House have a responsibility not to leave it at the statement: 'We will not have enforced equality'. They are expected to detail what they would do in office. For too long honourable members opposite have been saying that it is not their responsibility to say what they would do- that they are just here to criticise the Government. Medibank covers 13- million people. What are honourable members opposite going to do about it? The Schools Commission gives all children an equal opportunity. </para>
        <para>What are honourable members opposite going to do about the Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory? Are we to understand that this is another instance of enforced equality which never took place under previous conservative governments? Would that event of last Saturday have taken place under a conservative government? Would honourable members opposite have looked on that event also as enforced equality? Let us look at child care which was so miserably neglected under the previous Government. Report after report by professional people shows that it is absolutely essential to give the child an opportunity at school and to give them pre-school education and pre-school care for the assistance of the family and for the benefit of the child. Nothing of any significance happened under the Liberal Government. We are trying to do something. We have planned to ensure that all children are catered for in child care centres by 1985. Is that enforced equality? Is this a waste of resources to assist the families around this country? Honourable members opposite should say what they mean. </para>
        <para>Between 1949 and 1972, the standard rate of the age pension fluctuated between 18 per cent and 20 per cent of average weekly earnings. Whenever it reached 20 per cent and looked like going higher, in that year the conservative government of the day would give no increase to the pensioners. If there were to be an election, the government would look upon it as a time to give a substantial increase. We said when we came to office in 1972 that the age pension should be 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. One also has to look at what has happened to average weekly earnings since 1972. As has been stated in the House many times, average weekly earnings have risen much faster than the consumer price index. So I think that not only have we kept our pledge to make the pension 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, but we have kept pensions at a much higher rate than was expected in December 1972. Is it the intention of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party to reduce the pension rate from 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Is that giving the pensioners of this country too much equality? Are we enforcing standards on the community which are unacceptable to the Liberal and National Country Parties? It is the opinion of a lot of people in this country that perhaps spokesmen opposite should say a little more in detail about what they mean and what they are going to do should they ever return to office. </para>

They asked whether it was true that the Government had instructed certain Vietnamese refugees to sign statements requiring them not to be involved in Australian political life. The implication of those questions and the manner in which they were answered emphasise once again that this Government has plunged to new depths of political hypocrisy. This Government of compassion and concern has now found itself able to discriminate between people who live in this country. It is worth while reminding this Parliament and the people that in 1972 when this present </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Government went to the people, one of the objectives of its policy was to establish a bill of human rights to be applied throughout Australia. On page 45 of the Platform Constitution and Rules of the Australian Labor Party, we see that the Australian Constitution is to be amended to provide for the protection of fundamental civil rights and liberties. Paragraph 2 of the section on civil liberties states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Australian and State Parliaments to pass Acts providing for human rights and civil liberties, and to take all possible legislative and administrative action and judicial proceedings to prevent infringement of such rights and liberties and in particular to prevent discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, sex, creed or politics. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I stress the word 'polities'. We are faced today with a blatant attempt by -this Government to eat away at the fundamental rights of the Australian people. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the comment of the great French philosopher, Voltaire, who, in 1764, at the time of the French Revolution said: 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'. </para>
        <para>We on this side of the House know the views which the present Government has on Vietnam. We understand the attitudes of the Prime Minister, but we do not necessarily agree with nor accept them. But to suggest that people who have been allowed to come to this land, who have lost so much, their possessions, their rights in their own country and above all some of their self respect, should now be permitted to enter Australia as second class citizens and be denied the inalienable rights which we all take for granted, is a situation which I for one view with abhorrence and dismay. I wish to make it quite clear at this point that, whether a person is a Chilean, a Bait, a Ugandan, a Cypriot or a Vietnamese, once given permission to enter Australia they should have the full rights and responsibilities under the law of this land. These rights are inalienable. They cannot be divided, and above all they should not be applied, on the basis of race or political belief. What people were in their last country of residence is irrelevant. What is important is that the Government of the day permitted them to enter Australia. In allowing them to do so, it should have taken into account the full implications of that action. Above all, it is essential that people who live in Australia be given the full rights under the law. </para>
        <para>I submit that the Government, by this action, has contravened Articles 14 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Let me read out, for the benefit of this House, what those articles contain. In Article 14 we are told: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Everyone had the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries an asylum from persecution. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">We have brought into this land political refugees from many lands. In recent years the 2 most notable groups have been the Chileans and the Vietnamese. They came specifically with the objective of finding a new home free from persecution and where they would be allowed to live their lives as they wished with only one control, namely, the laws of Australia. Certainly there is no law of which I am aware which dictates that any person or any citizen living in this land should be prevented from enjoying to the full his democratic rights. Article 19 of the Declaration is also relevant and states as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Prime Minister, in justification of his action, made the spurious point that he was trying more or less to protect these people against us members of the Opposition and against those elements in the Australian community who, he alleged, would use them for devious political ends. I suggest that the Prime Minister should give us some credit. The Vietnamese war is over. We have to live with Vietnam, regardless of its political complexion. I would hope that he would expect this Opposition to have the capacity to know that, having seen the march of history, we now have to live with the outcome tomorrow. It is not in our interests nor in the interests of the Vietnamese refugees for us to continually rake over old coals. We have to build our relationships with Vietnam. To suggest that we are going to utilise these people for so-called nefarious political purposes is a deliberate attempt to discredit the Opposition with no evidence and shows the Prime Minister for what he is- a shallow person who assumes that his political opposition has no morality and does not support Australia's essential interests. </para>
        <para>I hope that this House will take this matter seriously, because there are many migrant groups in Australia, whether they be Jews, Arabs, Czechs, Yugoslavs, people from the Baltic states, Ugandans, Chileans or Vietnamese, who came to this land with the presumption that they were coming to a country of freedom. In Australia the right of freedom of speech is a fundamental human right. It is one which this Parliament must forever be willing to defend, for should we lose in any degree the right of freedom of speech we will be faced with the situation which Edmund Burke described so well: </para>

          <para>- I take the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly)</inline> to task for what he said about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as applied to Vietnamese migrants in Australia. He might consider for a moment applying the same argument to the period only a few years ago when the Party to which he belongs shot and destroyed Vietnamese people in an undeclared war in Vietnam, not because of any territorial infringements on Australia by the Vietnamese and without a declaration of war. So much for his pious words. The Liberal Party has used the Vietnamese people for its own political ends since about 1965, and apparently it continues to do so. I think the speech of the honourable member for Bradfield could be regarded as complete humbug. </para>

        <para>I want to speak today about the marvellous protestations and speeches of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> of recent times and to refer in particular, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> did, to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition at a National Press Club luncheon.

To date there has been no enunciation of policy by him. He has been preoccupied with ridding his own Party of all vestiges of Sneddenism. The moderates in the Liberal Party are completely persona non grata. It is a case of cleaning out the stable. Anyone with any moderate thoughts has been suppressed and expunged from the Liberal political landscape. It is a case of returning to the right. The whole idea is to have a general drift back to the right, unfortunately for Australia. Again we see the hair trigger mentality being displayed. An amusing article written last Sunday related that the Leader of the Opposition became so annoyed because apparently one of the bulls on his home property in the electorate of Wannon was breaking through the fence regularly that finally he leaned over the fence with a shotgun and blew its brains out. The same hair trigger mentality applied when be blew the brains out of his former leader, Prime Minister Gorton. When Prime Minister Gorton annoyed him to the point where it was intolerable for him, he denounced his Prime Minister, knifed him and destroyed him. </para>
        <para>He has confirmed all along up to date that his politics remain on the right. He said in the National Press Club speech: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I have no intention of leading a government which is only going to socialise Australia at a slower pace than Labor. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words, there is to be no return to Gortonism. Moderation will not be in vogue at all. It is to be the hard line all the way. The Leader of the Opposition is to be the high priest of small government. No longer is big government to be considered. There is to be a tearing down of wealth equalisation. He believes in privilege. He says that he rejects enforced equality which will result from things such as Medibank, which will give protection to people who in the past could not afford to insure themselves against health expenses. Of course, that is under challenge by him in the event of the return of a Liberal government. Things such as child care benefits, free university education for children who could not afford to go to a university, equality in taxation, redistribution of incomes and all those things he calls enforced equality will be rejected. In other words, privilege will be restored. That is what he really campaigns upon. </para>
        <para>His speech to the National Press Club was couched in marvellous imprecision. There was nothing precise about it. In fact, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which could not be described as a journal supporting this Government, said that his speech was imprecise, disturbing waffle. They are the words of a respected journal, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> about his speech. It was the first major speech he has made since he became Leader of the Opposition. He said that if he becomes Prime Minister he intends to give an exciting choice in education, as if to say that people in Australia today have no choice in education. What rubbish! If people want to send their children to a private school they can; if they seek to send them to a public school they can. All the Government has done has been to try to see that all schools in Australia are fit for children to go to. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned, when we came to power in 1972, there were 1020 schools described by the Schools Commission as being sub-standard, affecting 400 000 children. To bring them up to a decent standard of education and a decent standard of quality is, in the terms of the Leader of the Opposition, enforced equality. </para>
        <para>On the one hand he talks about enforced equality, and then on the other hand he says in terms of Government spending that he intends to encourage immediate massive investment in private industry through investment allowances and restructured taxes. So in respect of anything which affects the community in general, there is no big government for the middle-income earners and the lower-income earners. There is no government participation to help them to improve their standard of living, but there is government participation to make sure that all of the benefits are returned to industry. </para>
        <para>When the Leader of the Opposition talks about enforced equality in education what he means is that all the previous benefits will return to the upper crust and that tax deductions will be there for them to send their children to the greater public schools and the rest. He says he will wreck the Prices Justification Tribunal. He will banish that because it has been an impediment to prosperity. The fact that for years the major corporations in Australia have had no scrutiny has led Australia into the position where inflation is in a bad situation, but he intends to get rid of that tribunal. </para>
        <para>He says he wants freedom to strive, to achieve and to seek excellence, freedom to be different and freedom to conform. Have honourable members ever heard so much drivel from the leader of a major Australian party? If the Leader of the Labor Party had proposed that sort of rubbish in 1972 he would not have been elected Prime Minister, nor should he have been. Here is this man, because of the problem of inflation and because he believes that the Government's stocks are down in the electorate, thinking that he will inherit the mantle of the Primeministership. But I put it to the House: 'On what?'. What is his policy? Where is his policy? There is not one explanation on policy, just all of these generalities and they are all couched in such oblique terms as to serve whichever policy he would like to introduce into the laws of this land. </para>
        <para>He says the Liberals reject enforced equality in the workplace, in the economy and in education. He says a Liberal government will use example, encouragement and specific legislation to rid our country of discrimination. So he is going to use legislation to rid our country of discrimination; that is apparently to ensure that there are not the great gaps between privilege in Australia. He is going to rid Australia, on the one hand, of equality and on the other hand he says he rejects enforced equality in the workplace, in the economy and in education. He rejects any moves to deal with discrimination yet he says in the same speech, 2 paragraphs away, that there will be specific legislation to rid our country of discrimination. How could anybody trust this man? How could anybody rely upon him at all? What is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> 's view of where Australia should be going? He has no view, of course. All he knows is that he is propped up by the establishment to work for the establishment, to work for privilege in Australia. The whole tone of his addresses on so many occasions now has been against what he terms government interference in the lives of Australians, which is just so much rubbish. </para>
        <para>Again he offers criticisms of taxation. He said in his speech that the tax on average weekly earnings should be reduced for the average working man. We reduced it in this Budget from 48c to 35c in $ 1 and he is reported to have said in today's Press that the tax reforms would only encourage people to be spend thrifts. So on the one hand he says in a speech that there should be a reduction in taxation that applies to average weekly earnings and when we virtually index tax for the $6,000 to $9,000 a year group and reduce the application of tax on that group to 35c in $ 1 he says that it encourages people to be spend thrifts. This Budget saves about $530 per annum for the 2-child family- over $10 a week relief. In addition, this Government has provided Medibank, which is available to everyone in the community, child care facilities, urban development and all these other infrastructures which go to improving the quality of living for people on or below average weekly earnings. It should not be considered that most Australians are on average weekly earnings. Of course most Australians earn less than average weekly earnings. </para>

          <para>- I want to address the House on an area of administration in which I consider the Government has shown its most glaring incompetence. It is in relation to the administration of the tertiary allowance scheme. This scheme was one of this Government's initiatives and for that it deserves, I suppose, to be commended, but for the way in which the program itself is being administered the Government deserves only to be condemned. I point out that I have drawn to the attention of the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> that I proposed to raise certain matters in this grievance debate today and he has indicated that he is proposing to have made certain notes on the questions that I raise in order that he may consider them later tonight. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The tertiary allowance scheme is one in which the administration has practically broken down. There are tremendous delays in terms of considering student entitlements to benefits under the program and the administration has been organised in such a way as only to encumber the ability of students to be able to receive benefits under the program. I am told that even now there are many students who are receiving only at this late date the benefits to which they would otherwise have been entitled. The scheme has been the subject of considerable public discussion. I note that a report has been tabled on the tertiary education assistance scheme which I understand is to be known as the Williams report after the name of the  chairman  of the inquiry. The parts that I want to refer to relate not to the benefits that students are entitled to, although I might well be critical of the adequacy of those benefits and I might well be critical of amounts that are being made available under this Budget to students who, along with other people, have suffered a good deal as a result of inflation and have not in any way been aided by the Budget that has been presented. I want to refer to the comments of the Australian Union of Students in relation to the appeals tribunals. The Students Union had this to say about the appeals tribunals in general: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>AUS is concerned at the time taken for the Appeals Tribunals to be set up. The appointments to the Tribunals have still not been made public, and the machinery is still unclear. </para>
          <para>Of equal concern is that the Tribunals will offer little in the way of appeal, as they will be so hampered by the rigidity of the present regulations. </para>
          <para>AUS believes that the Appeals Tribunals should operate to interpret the principles of TEAS- of providing finance to students in economic need- rather than restating the regulations. Consequently, the Appeals Tribunals need to have discretionary powers, otherwise they cease to function as an appeals body. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Williams report has made no comments on the appeals structure. The student assistance regulations are the statutory rules of 1974 No. 1 79. There are 9 1 regulations and they are, in my view, cumbersome, difficult to read and to understand and certainly to be able to use these regulations in considering one's entitlement under them a person would need to have considerable legal training, in my view. </para>
        <para>In the time available to me in this debate I would like to take honourable members through the provisions of the Students Assistance Act, particularly divisions 2, 3 and 4 which provide for the student assistance review tribunals. The tribunals were established under section 18 to review allowances under the regulations. Division 3 provides for requests for reconsideration or review of decisions and it sets out the basis upon which a dissatisfied person should seek to have an authorised person review his entitlement. After a certain period of time if the authorised person decides against the request a person who is aggrieved may lodge a request for the matter to be referred to a tribunal. Upon receipt by an authorised person of a request under section 23 for a review by the tribunal of the decision of the authorised person he shall forward the request to the  chairman  of the tribunal, together with all the records and other papers relevant to the decision and its reconsideration by the authorised person. </para>
        <para>The manner of taking proceedings before the Tribunal are set out in sections 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30, but I particularly want to refer honourable members to the procedure of the tribunal because it is required to be informal in its deliberations. Section 27(1) says: </para>

        <para class="block">A party cannot be represented by a legal practitioner, notwithstanding the 91 regulations to which I have referred. I raise these matters because I want to refer particularly to the case of Robert Stephen Llewelyn of Marrickville. He was a student. The initial decision, as described in the public document being the particulars of the request for review No. 158 of 1975, was as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewelyn</inline>was ruled ineligible for benefits in 1975 because he had studied in his course for the maximum number of years required to complete it and had not done so.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">This decision and the request for review were put before the Board on 23 July 1975. The Tribunal considered the matters raised by the authorised person in the first instance. The reasons for the decision of the Tribunal were given as follows: </para>

        <para class="block">In other words, this young gentleman was subjected to something that no court of law would ever accept, and that is trial by ambush by the Department of Education. He was led to believe that his application was to be rejected under Regulation 34. He prepared his case on that basis. But at the hearing the authorised person came up and said: 'No, it is not that Regulation about which we are concerned; it is now Regulation 44.' Without adjourning the hearings, without considering other matters that might have been placed before the Tribunal by the student, it went on to deliberate on the matters put before it by the authorised person under Regulation 44. It decided: </para>

        <para class="block">In other words, the Tribunal decided that he was entitled under Regulation 34 but, on reconsideration, as requested, in the trial by ambush, this young gentleman was not entitled to a living allowance under Regulation 44. </para>
        <para>I am informed- I am not one who readily understands these regulations- that under Regulation 44 if certain information had been put before the Tribunal by this gentleman's teachers it may have been decided another way. But the decision has been taken. There is no further avenue of appeal. These informal proceedings, which had no legal basis, which are in the discretion of the Tribunal, quite clearly can wreak of injustices of this nature. I believe that that has occurred.

This is a grave injustice. I believe that the procedures we have are inadequate to provide a proper method of review for people aggrieved in this way. </para>

          <para>- I rise to draw attention to the material which I and no doubt other members of Parliament have received from the Car Consumers Association of Victoria. I understand that the Association has a branch in </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Sydney also, and I am pleased to represent it in Western Australia. This particular publication is titled <inline font-style="italic">The Secret Repair Policies of Car Manufacturers.</inline> It draws attention to a public notice that was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in Melbourne on Thursday, 15 May 1975 by the Association. It relates to Holden and To ran a owners and says: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Car Consumers' Association wishes to advise owners of the existence of a GMH policy relating to the extension of cover of Trim a tic Transmissions from 12 months, 12 000 miles to 3 years, SO 000 miles. This policy only applies to vehicles built before June 1974 fitted with Trim a tic Transmissions. If need of such a cover arises, contact your GMH dealer. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>It has been drawn to my attention that up to 500 000 consumers who have bought these vehicles over 6 years could be eligible but unaware of this policy. So I can understand why this has been termed a secret repair policy. </para>
        <para>I am also given to understand that these repair policies apply to other makes of vehicles. I feel that there must be some way in which to give wide publicity to this situation as in up to 60 per cent of Hold ens fitted with Trim a tic Transmissions faults have occurred and the usual repair cost of the Trim a tic can be between $325 and $375, and perhaps more in some States. This is particularly appalling for the average working man who is faced with the cost of repair of one of these transmissions. Usually he trades his vehicle in and changes his car because he cannot meet the cost of repair. Today most repairers demand the vehicle or the cash. That is the attitude they take. I am not making an attack on General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd because, as a Volvo owner, I am aware that in some cases they want the cash or the car. They do extend credit to some people but in most cases one finds that there are no credit facilities available and the only solution is to purchase another vehicle on hire purchase. This is not really the owner's responsibility but that of the manufacturer. Perhaps one reason why the manufacturer has not made the owner aware of this policy is that he could be the second or third owner of the car. But the cost to the consumer of this secret policy- I will continue to call it a secret policy- is tremendous. I hope that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> will be able to develop a system whereby people are made aware of their rights in these circumstances. </para>
        <para>I would like to draw attention to another point which has been raised by the Car Consumers Association, lt is quite a serious matter and one which has received some publicity, but unfortunately not sufficient publicity. There could be up to half a million GMH cars on the road today with lethal steering locks. The Car Consumers Association newsletter says: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Reports to CCA of the anti-theft steering lock in HQ model Hold ens suddenly locking on unintentionally and bringing about an accident were confirmed on 6 June 1974 when a Wagga Coroner investigating the road death of a 19 year old girl said he agreed with a motor mechanic that the steering lock system on the HQ Holden was unsatisfactory. The motor mechanic had told the Coroner's Court that he considered the system unsafe and that it could be a trap for a driver not familiar with the mechanism. </para>
          <para>In the case of the girl 's fatality the steering lock had locked on as the driver turned off the ignition. However, in the case of 2 reports to CCA, the driver is positive that he had not touched the ignition key at the time the steering lock activated. In one of these two incidents the Holden careened uncontrollably onto a footpath while in the other the car was being driven alongside the winding Murray River at the time of the occurrence and only good luck prevented the vehicle from careering into the river. </para>
          <para>On 8 June 1974 a GMH official, while describing the key movement needed to select the 'lock' position, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> as saying: 'This is clearly set out in the owner's handbook, which emphasises that the lock position should never be selected while the vehicle is moving'. The <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> then quoted the official as saying that 'switching off the ignition while moving could be dangerous, particularly on hilly and winding roads'. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What a fatuous sort of statement to make about the information being published in the owners handbook! A vehicle is sold to the owner, driven by members of his family and then driven by the following buyer and the handbook is not always passed on. It is not sufficient to publish a warning in a handbook and expect that everybody will read that handbook and take cognisance of it. It is estimated that approximately 500 000 HQ Hold ens and LJ To ran as which have this dangerous steering lock are still on the road today. If General Motors Holden 's has quietly taken some action to correct this problem I will be happy to hear about it. After almost <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years during which the HQ Holden was produced that is from July 1971 to the end of 1973-the cars are still fitted with this hazard. Judging from the GMH service letter from which I quoted earlier a revised design of the steering lock providing for a more positive detent was not introduced until about the end of 1973. </para>
        <para>These cars are getting older, cheaper and more readily available, and no doubt they are more worn and more dangerous. I feel sure it would be a step in the right direction towards national road safety if GMH were to recall those locks or to make available to dealers and to service stations throughout Australia the facility at their cost to solve the problem. It is only a matter of time before these half a million GMH vehicles which are affected will cause more deaths, injuries and suffering unless the recall is made. It is no good saying that there are not sufficient reports of this type of accident to warrant such actions. It is not one which people would closely investigate. If somebody had switched off the ignition there is no guarantee that they would admit to it because of insurance problems and because of their fear that the insurance company would not pay out on the ground of the negligence of the driver. This is another aspect of the matter. </para>
        <para>If there is an inbuilt defect it is the manufacturer's responsibility, no matter how old the vehicle is. Once the defect is discovered I feel it is the manufacturer's responsibility to take some positive action to make sure that all the vehicles are modified. To emphasise the point and to show the impact and the horror of such a thing I shall describe a further accident which arose out of this type of defect. It involves a family which was travelling along a straight stretch of country road early one Sunday morning. The driver wanted something from the glove box but it was locked. Noting the straight road and as there was no other traffic he slowed to about 30 miles per hour, turned the ignition off and handed the keys to his wife. Perhaps it was wrong to do that. But how many people do that type of thing? I would like honourable members to think about this. However, they soon neared a slight curve in the road where a bridge went over an irrigation canal. The driver turned the wheel to take the curve but the steering had locked when the ignition was turned off. </para>
        <para>The car failed to take the slight curve, went through the bridge into the canal and began to sink. Two of the bridge railings went through the car. One went between the driver and his small son who was in the middle of the- front seat. It went on and badly gashed the head of his little girl in the back and finally lodged in the camper van which the car was towing. The other railings went through the glove box, knocked out the heater, narrowly missing the mother in the front seat and another son in the back. Fortunately, the family escaped with their lives, although 18 stitches had to be inserted in the gash in the little girl's head. The car was a write-off. The family was extremely lucky. A tow truck driver who dived into the canal to rescue some of the family belongings said that he was unable to touch the bottom. These are the sorts of things which are possibly happening every day. </para>

          <para>Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, Jamal el Sur an i, says only his age has prevented him from physically fighting for the PLO cause. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr el-Surani,</inline> head of the PLO headquarters in Cairo, said in Hobart yesterday his role was with the organisation's political wing, and, as such, he knew nothing of the military division's activities 'until after they happened'. </para>
          <para>But he supported such events as the Munich Olympic Village massacre and said he regarded the PLO members who had been killed in such incidents as 'martyrs' and 'national heros' </para>

        <quote>
          <para>During the Press conference he said he was 'very hopeful' of Australia opening diplomatic relations with the PLO and that his talks with Government officials on this subject had been received well. But he did not discount the possibility that if Australia refused to grant such ties it would be considered by the PLO as an enemy and open to attack. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This ought to come as no surprise to us. It is consistent with the sort of thing said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yasser</inline> Arafat at the United Nations and elsewhere. There has been no denial and no accusation that that was in any way a misreporting of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr el-Surani</inline> said. He was here for quite some days after that report. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr el-Surani</inline> 's trip surely proved to the PLO that the Australian Government, by granting the visa, was in fact encouraging its terrorism and its policy of the destruction of the sovereign state of Israel. After having had an audience with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam) Mr el-Surani</inline> said he was hopeful that there would soon be an office in Australia. </para>
        <para>The other matter which concerns me relates to the attitude of the Australian Government to the recognition of the PLO at international forums. The Government's ineptitude regarding the admission of the PLO to observer status at the United Nations and at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation has been widely condemned for similar reasons to those which related to the granting of visas to PLO representatives. If the PLO dropped its demands for the destruction of the state of Israel all would agree that it ought to be heard. Similar action to that taken by the United Nations and UNESCO has been taken by the International </para>
        <para class="block">Civil Aviation Organisation, the World Health Organisation and the World Meteorological Organisation Conference. Again in those instances Australia has taken action which encouraged rather than moderated the PLO policy for the destruction of Israel. </para>
        <para>At the International Labour Organisation Conference in Geneva on 12 June this year the Australian Government voted for a motion to allow liberation movements recognised by the Organisation of African Unity and the League of Arab States to attend the conference. The PLO, being one of the liberation movements recognised by the OAU and by the League of Arab States, was able to attend and participate in the deliberations of the International Labour Organisation Conference while still being pledged to destroy a member of the ILO, namely, Israel. The motion as it was put before the conference was subject to considerable debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, along with union delegates from other democratic countries, moved an amendment requiring that all those seeking admission to the ILO should agree to abide by the rules and principles of the ILO. One would not think that that was an unreasonable request. </para>
        <para>This would have enabled the PLO and Israel to co-exist at the ILO. But that also would have required that the PLO drop its demand about the destruction of an ILO member, Israel. The Australian Government, to its eternal shame, accepted the report recommending the admission of the PLO to the ILO. The Australian Government delegate explained the vote in words which are very far from being explanatory. He stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Australian Government delegation had hoped that it would have been possible for what has been referred to as a compromise formula to have emerged either in the committee or at this Plenary Session so that this matter could have been adopted by an overwhelming consensus which would have recognised the principles which were embodied in the compromise proposals which were under discussion. This did not prove possible, and therefore my delegation voted in favour of each of the proposals before the Conference. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Australian Government, by its attitude, ran away from principle. It ran away from its own trade union movement and from the Australian Labor Party President. It also ran away from integrity. Contrast the Australian Government's attitude with the attitude of the United States Government delegate. On 21 June of this year the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> editorialised on the matter in these words: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The American delegation walked out, calling the vote a tragic decision because the PLO was a political, not a labour, entity under the ILO chaner. And the American position was made official by Secretary of Labor John Dunlop, who had planned to address the Conference but refused to attend after the vote to seat the PLO. </para>
          <para>UNESCO itself has already suffered. Some of its important programs are imper i led because the United States and other concerned nations have properly resisted making contributions to the agency while it violates its mandate and tradition of nonpartisanship. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">One should add that one of the consequences of the admission of the PLO to the ILO will be that the United States again will deny its contribution to the ILO budget- its contribution, if my memory serves me correctly, is about one-quarter of the budget- and that will greatly handicap the work of that international agency, the point being that the PLO is not a labour entity and has no right at the ILO in the first place. The editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times- rios</inline> is a most important point- continued: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The United States contributes a significant amount of funding to the specialised agencies, in some instances as much as a quarter of their total budgets. The $ 1 6m contribution to UNESCO has been held up, the $29m for WHO in next year's authorization measure has also been delayed. A large group of members of Congress have warned WHO's director-general that expulsion of Israel would undermine support and confidence in the international health organization. </para>
          <para>It has become clear that the Arab bloc- the greatest beneficiaries, along with the Third World nations, of UN aid and expertise- is willing to risk destruction of the specialised agencies even if this means depriving millions of people, including its own, of health, welfare, educational and other direct assistance. And too many shortsighted members of the UN, prey to Arab petro-politics, have acquiesced or abstained when the agencies are locked into positions that degrade the organisation 's charter and covenants. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is most important that the Australian people are given an explanation of the Australian Government's attitude towards the Palestine Liberation Organisation. How does the admission of the PLO to United Nations agencies advance the prospects of peace in the Middle East? How does it improve the operations of the United Nations? How does it serve Australia's national interests? How does it advance harmony within Australia? We have seen campus riots. We have had peaceful petitions to this Parliament. There have been letters to the Prime Minister which have been unheeded. The Australian people are entitled to an explanation of the Government's policy on this matter. </para>

          <para>-My grievance today, I am sure, will receive the support of every member of this House, whatever his party affiliation. I should like to say a few words about the anonymous letter writer and the anonymous telephone caller. I do not believe that there is any person in this community more despicable than the one who makes anonymous telephone calls or writes anonymous letters. There would be hardly one member of this House who has not at some time received an anonymous abusive letter or telephone call, albeit the odd one here and there. But there are within the community people who are being subjected to a continuous stream of abuse from anonymous letter writers and telephone callers. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Of course politicians are not the only butt for these people. I am well aware, as you probably are, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that some of the people who make these calls or write these letters are medically sick; but there are also others who, for one reason or another, support a cause and believe that they have the right because they support a cause differing from one's own, to intrude anonymously into one's life. Scarcely anyone who is in the public eye or who receives a certain amount of publicity is free from this type of rubbish. Recently I have come into contact with this practice personally, and I do not like it. During the last 2 election campaigns I became accustomed to going without sleep. For some odd reason people started telephoning my house at 1 o'clock in the morning and they would telephone through until 6 o'clock in the morning. Eventually I got a telephone I could unplug. But did that unnamed caller or those unnamed callers consider my elderly father for whom sleep was a brief interlude without pain? They did not at all. I became accustomed to that practice. It is a political thing and one learns to live with it. But what I will not become accustomed to is the way in which an anonymous letter writer or telephone caller can prey on people within the community to the very severe detriment of their health. </para>
        <para>I suppose that what really brought this to my mind was one middle aged woman in my electorate who was driven almost to suicide by people who were telephoning- it seemed to be a bit of a campaign- impugning her morals. She was a very nervous little thing. When I found her she was almost at the stage of suicide. We got her an unlisted number which cut off the problem. But one cannot cut off what is in the minds of people who do things such as this. Some problems cannot be as easily solved and they cause real suffering. I have a friend who receives abusive letters every time her name or her photograph appears in the Press and another friend who, when she answers the telephone- it rings very often some times hears only heavy breathing. These things may sound unimportant, but to the recipient they can cause real suffering and pain. </para>
        <para>I shall address myself for a couple of minutes to those who send me anonymous letters and make anonymous telephone calls to me. I hold them in supreme contempt. In my opinion they are completely without integrity and completely without guts. I am prepared to receive any letter or any call of criticism; indeed, I will protect the right of the individual to criticise me. But that individual has to sign his name to the letter or to give his name over the telephone. My staff is instructed to hang up on anyone who will not say who is calling before he starts speaking. We do not read anonymous letters. We look at the end. If there is not a signature we put the letter in the waste paper basket. So, such people are wasting their time. I do not receive many abusive letters, but my advice to anyone being abused is to follow my example. The anonymous letter writer is sick. Also he does not have the courage of his convictions; if he did he would want to debate his grievance. He is the cowardly type who wants to hit and run. My office is open to anyone who wants to come into it. I am committed to my philosophy of living. I am committed to my political Party and its policies. But I am prepared to discuss and to debate them with anyone, quite freely and openly- that is, anyone with a name. </para>
        <para>There is no one harder to fight than the one who hits and runs. No accident arouses more public hostility than the one caused by the hit and run driver. That is the type of person with whom the anonymous letter writer belongs. What satisfaction he can get from shooting an arrow into the air without knowing whether it will hit its mark, I do not know. I also do not know what satisfaction he gets from making unfounded accusations from an anonymous position. It is time some of these people grew up and had enough maturity to promote some discussion on whatever their grievance is out in the open. There is very little that cannot be discussed. Most of us respect those who open the lines of communication and discussion, even if we completely disagree with what the other person has to say. In my opinion the anonymous letter writer is a cowardly and gutless person. I hope that a few of those who have been making the calls or writing the letters are listening to this debate. They might take a hint from what I have had to say. </para>

          <para>- During the recess I took the opportunity of visiting central Australia and northern Australia. I did this for 2 reasons. I wanted to see something of the resources and nature of the place and I wanted to get a further insight into what is happening to the Aboriginal population. On that second point I shall say nothing at this moment although I hope I shall have an opportunity of saying something later. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I want now to say something about the nature of the place and the possibilities that lie inherent in it. As honourable members, would agree, I think, a great part of Australia's economic future is bound up with its mineral industry, its mineral products and its mineral exports. I think that this is something which needs to be developed as quickly as possible and as thoroughly as possible. I want to draw to the attention of the House the possibilities that he inherent in the centre of Australia and some of the things which we should be doing and putting in hand in regard to them. I hope I shall be constructive in this regard. A large part of the centre of Australia- it may amount even to a quarter of the continent- is covered by a fairly thin and recent layer of sand. Sometimes the rocks stick up from this layer but over many hundreds of miles there is no indication of what lies under the surface. Yet that surface is covered by only a few feet of sand. Some of that surface contains potentially valuable mineral areas. I refer particularly to the old rocks, the pre-Cambrian, the protozoa and even perhaps the archaeozoic rocks which underlie the surface. We do not know what they are. We do not know in detail what they are like. We do know something about their age. From the rocks which stick up from the surface from time to time we can get some vague idea of what lies under that shallow sand surface. It would help us if we knew more, if we knew the rocks and if we knew the dip of the rocks. Sometimes, of course, the valuable ores will stand out because they are harder than the folded rocks which surround them. A good example of this would be at Broken Hill or even, indeed, at Mt Isa. In other cases the valuable rocks are not hard. They are soft shales which will not stand out. </para>
        <para>I believe that this is the time when we should be doing something about the delineation of these areas. May I say, with satisfaction, that we found the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics actively working in this area. We found its people trying to identify the rock outcrops. I have a great deal of time and admiration for the work which is being done by the Bureau of Mineral Resources. I am not trying to criticise it. I am trying to say that more should be given to that body and that we should be going on with it in a faster way. </para>
        <para>I believe the first thing to do is a certain amount of drilling. As honourable members will know, a large number of drills are idle at present in Australia. They fall, I suppose, into 4 classes. The shallow drill was used for seismic work, for putting down shot holes and the like. It is a truck mounted drill which goes only to shallow depths and is very light. Second is the diamond drill which is used for exploring ore bodies. Third is the deep stratigraphic drill which is used for oil drilling. It can put down a really deep hole on land. Fourth is, or used to be at any rate, the drill which is capable of operating off-shore. In the first 3 categories we have idle resources and we used to have idle skilled teams. We have not got them now because they have been dissipated by reason of the under-use of our facilities. </para>
        <para>I would like to see a drilling program really put in hand not just on particular targets but in order to ascertain the nature of the sedimentary basins and the old rocks which are not sedimentary or old folded rocks but which are in very old sedimentary areas in Australia. In that way we can learn something about our mineral potential. This is the time to do it because we do have idle machinery. The sooner we start building up our skilled teams again, the better. I would think, for example, that in these areas covered by this shallow sand film we should be using our shot hole drills which were used in the seismic program in determining the depth of the sand and roughly what is underneath. By use of coreing one can find out and by use of dip meters one can find out the lie of the strata and be able to ascertain what is happening. In selective areas we should be putting down our diamond drills and finding out more. In order to find the main structure of the continent we should be using our deep drills onshore to find out the nature of the underlying basins to great depths. </para>
        <para>I want, in the next few months, to try to get a program of this kind accepted. I shall be trying in the next few months to find out what can be done and what resources can be devoted to it. Again I want to commend what the Bureau of Mineral Resources is doing. I do not want to criticise the Bureau. I want to say that it should be getting further resources and that the program of drilling, particularly in the centre of Australia, should be very much stepped up. This will help- I say this incidentally- the Aboriginal communities. One of the things which will be discovered is the extent of our water resources and underground water. In this area there is plenty of rough feed. I know this is a particularly good season but I think that even in normal seasons there would be rough feed. There is virtually no naked animal life because there is no surface water. If we can find out from this drilling where water can be found and easily brought to the surface we may be able to help the life of some of these Aboriginal communities. I put this as a side issue. </para>
        <para>The first point I make is that at this time we should be using our unused drilling resources and, once more, building up our skilled drilling teams in the 3 categories: The shot hole drill, which will go down and pierce, for example, a thin sand film; the diamond drill which will tell us more in detail; and the deep stratigraphic drill which will determine the nature of our main basins. There is much we do not know. </para>

          <para>- The honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland)</inline> in the debate this morning made some allegations which certainly deserve to be answered. I propose to answer them in part now and give a more detailed reply on the adjournment debate this evening, if I am able to exercise my privilege in that regard. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The honourable member made a number of allegations. I simply say in respect of his allegation about Ministers failing to answer questions that if there is any deficiency in my own Department I will certainly give attention to it. I do believe that this is a matter that can be considered. I think all honourable members will appreciate, after all, that the number of questions coming from honourable members is growing as the activities of this Government expand. In other words, there are more areas now about which to ask questions than there were previously. I am advised by the longest serving member of this Parliament, the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> that what has happened is nothing new and that there were occasions in the past when questions were simply wiped off the notice paper. In his long service, lengthy delays were experienced under the Liberal-Country Party Government. But there is a matter that cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. That is the criticism by the honourable member of the National Employment and Training Scheme. </para>
        <para>This re-training scheme was introduced by the former Minister for Labor and Immigration, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron).</inline> That scheme will stand as a monument to his name. This was the first Government even to consider seriously the introduction of a re-training scheme. Certainly there have been delays. Of course there are delays in having some of the applications finalised. The reason for such delays is very simple indeed. When the scheme was announced, there was a virtual flood of applicants, such a flood of applicants as to indicate the unsatisfied need of this community over a generation for retraining. People who are applying include those who have not had the opportunity to be trained in their youth, who have not had the opportunity to have a reasonable education, new settlers to this country, migrants from other parts of the world who have not had the opportunity to be trained in the skills required in this community. It ill behoves a former Liberal-Country Party Minister whose Government presided over the years of neglect in this field, to come along now and to criticise this Government for the deficiencies which may exist in the initial stages of an exciting scheme which will satisfy a great community and economic need for Australia. </para>
        <para>Let me illustrate my point by referring to what we saw on many occasions in respect of unemployment figures during the reign of office of the Liberal-Country Party Government. There was unemployment amongst unskilled workers and shortages of skilled employees. This situation arose because there was a massive imbalance in the Australian work force. That massive imbalance grew up in the years of neglect from 1949 to 1972. 'The generation of neglect' it will be known as and will be so described by historians. We had a situation almost with great regularity in which there was unemployment amongst unskilled employees and a shortage of skilled employees. This is an unfortunate, regrettable fact </para>
        <para>It is not appropriate for the honourable member for Curtin to launch a criticism against this scheme. In my view, it also is in very poor taste for the honourable member to make an attack on those who are doing their best to administer this scheme. They have been subjected to severe difficulties indeed in trying to cope with the large number of people seeking assistance. But I should say this: Those who are presently applying for retraining under NEAT are receiving very prompt attention indeed. This is done at great expense and personal cost to the officers of the Department of Labor and Immigration who are working very hard to administer the scheme. The delays to which the honourable member referred are in respect of people who have appealed against decisions ruling them ineligible to participate in the NEAT scheme at this time. This Government could not possibly hope to be able to satisfy the demands which have built up over 23 years. We will eventually have a scheme whereby every citizen who wants to be re-trained will be able to be trained to acquire greater skills. We will do this because it is a job that needs to be done. This nation needs to do it. But it will take time. Nobody could reasonably suggest that such a mammoth and massive task could be undertaken without friction or without delay. As I said, </para>
        <para class="block">I will take the opportunity if I am able this evening to reply on the adjournment debate in some detail to these allegations. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>the Opposition Parties welcome the change in approach by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> which enables the Constitutional Convention to be held in September, and welcomes therefore the motion that he has moved. The Opposition Parties, as this House knows, endorsed the initiative of the States for a Convention in 1972. It is our hope that this Convention will be a useful forum in which State and Federal representatives may constructively consider constitutional reform in a way which will advance the good government of Australia. There are changes which can be made to the Constitution for the improved working of the Federal system. Real difficulties have obviously been involved in this. There have been difficulties in obtaining the agreement of this Parliament in respect of the measures which ought to be put, on the precise changes needed, and in persuading the people of Australia of the benefits of such changes even sometimes when both Government and Opposition Parties officially have agreed on those changes in this House. There have, however, been too many hasty and ill-considered initiatives which have led to rejection of referendum proposals. I do not think they serve anyone's purpose. They waste the time of the Parliament and of the people. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Constitutional Convention does present an opportunity to identify areas where change is needed. It will ascertain what sort of consensus exists for change. It will provide a place where constructive efforts may be made to work out constitutional reform. For all of these reasons, the Opposition is glad that the Constitutional Convention will be reconvened in Melbourne in September. The Opposition of course recognises that the Convention itself cannot make any constitutional change. However, it can be the base from which constructive proposals can emerge. The Senate's resolution makes the way clear for the Convention to proceed. The Opposition Parties welcome the opportunities that the Convention offers. </para>

          <para>- in reply- I would not want the House or the public to draw any inferences from the phrase which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> used about the change of attitude by the Government. The fact is that the Government has consistently taken the attitude that the Australian Parliament should participate in this Constitutional Convention. I believe it was I who moved the motion on 3 1 May 1973 that the Parliament should participate in the Convention. It was certainly I who moved the motion on 1 August last year which I recalled when moving my motion today. The Government has been committed all along to participation in the Convention. The delay has taken place in the Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Honourable gentlemen should be reminded that the matter has arisen twice in the Senate. Last August the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> moved that the Senate should send some of its members to the Convention, as it had done in September 1973. </para>
        <para class="block">Under that motion there were to be 3 members of the Australian Labor Party, one member of the Liberal Party of Australia, one member of the Australian Country Party and one member of the Liberal Movement. In the previous Parliament the delegation had been 3 members of the Labor Party, one member of the Liberal Party, one member of the Country Party and one member of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. The change to the appointment of a member of the Liberal Movement instead of a member of the DLP was due to the fact that there were no longer members of the DLP in the Parliament but there was a member of the Liberal Movement who had been acknowledged by the Senate as the Leader of a Party. </para>

            <para>- None of us. I am merely quoting what the Senate acknowledged. It is plain looking at any copy of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> since July or August of last year that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall has been acknowledged to be the Leader of a Party. So the Government moved last July or August- I think it was last Augustthat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall should take the place of the former DLP senator who had represented the Senate at the Convention. An amendment was moved to delete <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall from the delegation and put in a second member of the Liberal Party. The amendment was put and defeated on an even division. The motion was then put and defeated on an even division. There the matter stayed until, as a result of negotiations in which I participated, it was again raised in the Senate. The same motion was put on behalf of the Government and the same amendment was moved to it. On that occasion the amendment was carried and, becoming the motion, the motion was carried. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I have gone into that detail in order to refute the suggestion which has been made on many occasions- I think it was implied by the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion; it has certainly been the subject of newspaper articles that in some way the Australian Government was impeding the meeting of the Convention. In fact the Australian Government took the earliest opportunity in every case to put the motion in this House, through myself, and in the Senate, through the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that the Australian Parliament should participate in the Convention. Later, as a result of negotiations that took place outside the House, that motion was again put in the Senate. There has been no change of attitude on the part of the Australian Government. We believe that the Australian Parliament should participate in the Convention. </para>
        <para>There were a couple of other matters mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition to which I should respond. He referred to referendums. Four referendums were put to the people last May. Three of those referendums flowed directly and entirely from the recommendations- most of them unanimous recommendations- of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review that were made back in 1958 and 1959. The fourth referendum- the one concerning local government flowed from undertakings which I had made in the election campaign in 1972 and to local government representatives in Australia in January 1973. </para>
        <para>The honourable gentleman then referred to some other matters which I believe show some confusion in the ranks of those behind him or their colleagues in other Parliaments. The fact is that there has been a difference of attitude between the Liberals- Federal and State- on many of the matters which have come before this Parliament by way of Bills. It is significant that in this Parliament, including in the Senate, there has not been opposition by way of a vote to programs which have, however, been challenged in the courts by State Liberal governments. Quite obviously things like the Australian Assistance Plan, which has been challenged by State Liberal governments, and the Regional Employment Development scheme, which has been challenged by State governments, were not in fact opposed here. The Government believes in these matters. It pursues them. I believe that it comes ill from the Leader of the Opposition that he should raise here matters which have been challenged not by him and his colleagues but by their counterparts in the State Parliaments. </para>

          <para>-When this Bill was in Committee last evening I asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)-</inline> I thought, in terms of politeness and reason- to give the Committee an explanation of why the nomenclature in many parts of the Bill had been altered. It was not as though one were indulging in some captious form of criticism. The request was made with politeness and reason. But the Minister was emboldened to embark upon a course that I can only describe as not doing himself justice as a gentleman and as a Minister of the Crown. But let us put to one side his exuberance of spirit and come to the explanation that he has offered. I think that the Committee, the Parliament and the country are entitled to an explanation when alterations of these characters are made. I ask the Minister again whether he would mind adverting to this matter. </para>

        <para>I am not going to argue the merits of the stand that I take. What I am submitting to the Committee is that the stand taken by the Government is tainted with illegality. 'Commonwealth of Australia' is the proper term to be used. The term </para>
        <para class="block">Australia' is not. I speak now in the constitutional sense. I gave the Minister section after section of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. But what was the reason given by the Minister last evening? I ask the honourable members to listen to it. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The reason why the definition of Commonwealth is excluded from the new Bill is that the definition of Commonwealth in the old legislation said: </para>

If that is the basis of the honourable gentleman's argument, it does not dismiss or diminish our anxiety on the point; on the contrary, it heightens it. I ask the honourable gentleman- I trust that if I offend him in any way at all he will draw my attention to it- in terms of simple civility: Will he please give the Committee a reason why the term 'Commonwealth' is being dropped throughout the Bill. If the Minister would do that, I think we would be able to make progress at a pace that might even bring pleasure to his frame. </para>

          <para>-Clause 7 is what I described last evening as the central feature of this Bill. It seeks to repeal sections 8, 9 and 9a of the principal Act, namely, the Defence Act. That central feature is the purported conferment upon a Chief of  Defence  Force Staff of command of the Defence Force. Again I asked, during the course of my speech in the second reading debate, whether the  Minister  for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> would give an explanation of the apparent conflict- I put it no harsher than that- with section 68 of the Constitution. I do not take the view that this legislative flourish can put at nought the constitutional provisions which exist in section 68 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>But let us put that to one side. I want to come to the exceptions in proposed section 9a, of which sub-section ( 1 ) states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Subject to section 8, the Secretary -  meaning the Secretary of the Department of Defence-  and the Chief of Defence Force Staff shall jointly have the administration of the Defence Force except with respect to - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The sub-section then gives the 2 exceptions, one being matters falling within command and the other those matters specified by the Minister. I deal with the second exception. I invite the honourable gentleman to give the Committee an indication of what matters may be specified by the Minister. I also invite the honourable gentleman to give an account of how he assesses possible difficulties of Ministers coming and goings and changing their minds so that a matter is not within the joint control of the Secretary of the Department and the Chief of Defence Force Staff. I believe that this is quite crucial if we are to have a fluctuation of ministerial edict as to what comes within the second exception, I think we will have a very curiously administered Defence Force. </para>
        <para>But, more importantly, I turn to the first exception; that is to say, matters falling within command. I express my misgivings- again I put it no more emphatically than that- as to the efficiency of running a diarchy, and that is precisely what is involved here. The Minister attempted, during the course of his speech winding up the second reading debate, to define what is meant by 'command '.He said this: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Command is to be taken as meaning the authority which a commander in the military service lawfully exercises over his subordinates by virtue of rank or appointment. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">There is no difficulty in comprehending that. He went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Command includes the authority and responsibility for effectively using available resources and for planning the employment of, organising, directing, co-ordinating and controlling military forces in the accomplishment of assigned duties. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The proposition I put to my friend is this: Under that definition, which is the one he embraces, there is not one matter that could not be properly described as being administrative. So I say to the honourable gentleman: It is not as though one can, with surgical accuracy, divide matters of administration from matters of command. This is exactly the area that has given rise to widespread anxiety throughout the country. </para>
        <para>The honourable gentleman last evening indulged himself to make, I thought, some rather ungenerous references to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Millar,</inline> a very distinguished Australian. He taunted my colleagues and me with the view that every sentiment uttered by us had the fountain of origin in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Millar's</inline> writings. With great respect to my friend- it is my Irish mood of agreeableness that prompts me to say this to him- that is simply not true. We are quite capable of forming opinions on these matters for ourselves upon proper inquiry, upon proper reflection and upon proper discussion with people who have views in this field. The Minister has not put at rest the anxiety that exists in this field. As was so cogently pointed out last evening by my friend, the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly)</inline> this is the question: What are matters of administration and what matters of command? It is not enough for the Minister to read out a definition and to say: 'Look, here it is. This should satisfy you. Go back and be rested with the assurance that I know what matters of command are'. I venture the view that considerable confusion will occur in this field. The Minister's recitation of a definition of a command is unsatisfying and is unhelpful. But let us take the matter a little further. The Minister's distinguished predecessor when he made his second reading speech on this Bill, said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Ministerial directives establishing the arrangements for the inter-relation of the high level Service and civilian positions in sharing of responsibility in appropriate areas, and stating the responsiveness expected of the departmental structure to the operational priorities of the Chiefs of Staff, have already been drafted, in full consultation among the Chiefs of Staff and Secretary. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">There is a teasing measure of ambiguity about that statement. I could have a full consultation with the Minister for Defence but one could not reasonably draw from that the conclusion that we were in splendid agreement about the matter. </para>
        <para class="block">Why have these directives not been made public? If the directives have been drawn and are in existence already, is there any reason why this Parliament should not have access to them? I invite the Minister to settle our anxiety on that point. It is to no avail the Minister taking a position of dogmatism on this point. We have our anxiety. We are not seeking to impale one side or the other. What we are asking of the honourable gentleman and of the Government is simply this: Please give us the information so that we may better form a judgment on these matters. I put what seems to me and what seems to my colleagues to be the gravamen of our charge that we do not know what are matters of administration and what are matters of command. </para>
        <para>I sum up by referring to the honourable gentleman's own definition. There is not one matter there which falls under a matter of command that could not, without resorting to any fertility of imagination, be put under a matter of administration. The smears which came from the Government benches last evening to the views offered by two of the greatest commanders in history, Montgomery and Wavell, do no credit to a Government which dismisses the views of men of courage and of character by saying: 'Ha! You are going back a few years'. That may be true but they were great men and they were responsible for great feats of arms. Their reputation is not to be diminished by smears. As Marshal Wavell himself put it, he ranked administration ahead of tactics. If a man of the eminence of Field-Marshal Wavell puts administration ahead of tactics, then I think it is at least incumbent upon the Commonwealth Minister for Defence to offer an explanation to us why it is in this apparently confused area, the Government is reluctant to give information. </para>

          <para>- Last evening, as the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> pointed out, I gave a definition of the concept of command. I think the essential feature there is the words 'which a commander in the military service lawfully exercises over his subordinates by virtue of rank or appointment '. This is a difficult area as the honourable member for Moreton himself would have recognised having at one stage exercised the position of Minister for the Navy. Under the Constitution, any Minister is responsible for the administration of a Department of State. One cannot be a Minister under the Constitution unless one has a Department of State to administer. The manner in which that administration takes place comes under the various rules and regulations which have been established by precedent- the Public Service Act and so on. In this area of command and administration, the Bill provides that the Minister shall be responsible for the administration of the department and the defence forces under the Act. This provides, as any Bill provides, for the Minister to have the opportunity to decide to allocate these functions. I am sure that the learned and honourable member for Moreton will recognise the very great difficulty- I am sure that he felt this himself when he was administering a Department of State- in defining precisely concepts such as administration. What the Bill seeks to do- this was on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel who recognised the great difficulties associated with precise definitions- is to ensure that the Minister has the responsibility under the Act. Two people would assist him in that administration one being the Chief of the Defence Force Staff and the other the Secretary of the Department. Perhaps here there is the element- I agree with the honourable member for Moreton- of the way that the defence re-organisation must be administered. I should like to draw on a comment made by  His Excellency  the Governor-General because I believe that it is pertinent to the whole notion of making any administration work. In December last year, the Governor-General said in his speeches at Duntroon and Point Cook: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>It has, for as long as I can remember, been a problem to persuade military people and civilians that they must cooperate with one another if both groups are to make a significant contribution to the formulation of defence policy. It is simply the case that neither purely military officers, nor purely civilian officers, can provide the country with what it needs in the defence field. Only by co-operation can this be done. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In this field of distinguishing as between concepts of command and concepts of administration, I know that the honourable member for Moreton, having had to face up to this himself as a Minister of State, will recognise the supreme difficulty of drafting a watertight definition. What we are being guided by here is the element of co-operation, the element of commonsense, and the notions of command and of administration that have applied in the defence forces structure. I recognise the difficulty that the Parliamentary Counsel had. He, in his wisdom, decided that this was a matter for the administration. We accepted his advice in this. </para>

          <para>-The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> expressed the difficulty a Minister has in his position as administrator and as the person responsible for the general control of a department. He expressed the difficulty in allocation of responsibilities- I think those were his exact words. He then pointed out the problem of command flowing from the Governor-General. I suggest that in this context it is not the Minister's responsibility but may well be that of the Executive Council or the Cabinet rather than the Minister as to who will command. I do not think the Minister meant to imply that but his words sounded very much as if he were implying that. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I raise again this matter of command and the difference between command and administration. There is constant reference throughout clause 7 to command. It provides that the Chief of Defence Force Staff shall command the defence force. It mentions 'command by the Chief. Throughout this clause, the word 'command' is used. I think my friend, the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> referred to the definition of command used by the Minister last night. He drew attention to the responsibility for effectively using resources and for planning the employment of, or organising, directing, coordinating and, controlling, military forces in the accomplishment of assigned duties. That also includes the responsibility for welfare, morale, discipline and personnel under his control. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Millar</inline>has been mentioned a number of times in this debate. I refer to him in this instance although I have not done so previously. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Millar,</inline> in his article of 9 July, sets out the responsibilities as he sees them and indeed as we see them, of the civil section. They cover the whole area that the Minister defined last night. They cover things like defence manpower, pay, recruitment, conditions of service, personnel policy, and training and education policy. If they do not fit within the definition of 'command' as the Minister gave it last night, I do not know what does. In fact, we have further evidence which would tend to support the proposition that there is great difficulty in deciding where the distinction lies. The former Minister, when introducing the Bill- and again I refer to it- said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Secretary . . . will be the adviser on policy, on organisation and on financial planning and programming. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">There is great conflict in the Government's mind; I am sure of that. It would seem that if the matter is to be cleared it is not for the Minister to say to us in Opposition: 'Why don't you go along and talk to the Secretary of the Department or the Chief of the Defence Force Staff and find out what they have in mind?' This is the Parliament. Here is where decisions are made. Here we have the right and the responsibility to find out the </para>
        <para class="block">Government's intentions. What are the directives? Again I request the Minister. What are the directives you are going to issue for the operation of the defence forces? I think that we as a Parliament need to know and the people of Australia need to know. </para>
        <para>One other matter is of great concern to me. It relates to the whole Bill but particularly to this clause. It is the Government's power to cause actions on the part of its servants without any regulatory or legislative basis. We were told last night, and indeed it is in the documents, that the reorganisation of the defence forces has been going on for something like 2 years. What was the basis, what was the power that the Government had to carry out those actions? I equate it with things like the regional employment development scheme, the Australian Police and the various interim commissions which were established when the Government had no directive or power from the Parliament to carry out those actions. It is government by stealth. I feel that in defence reorganisation the Government has done the same as it has done in other areas. </para>
        <para>We could easily refuse this Bill, I suppose. That would tend to be irresponsible. But if the Government is going to treat the Parliament and the people of the nation as it has and to opt for government by stealth I think that sort of action deserves reciprocal action. It is time that the Government went back to a democracy and allowed proper consideration of these measures. The only way under this Bill and particularly under clause 7, which we are considering, that we can understand the Government's intention and allay the ever-present fears that are welling up within the defence forces themselves as to how much say the Public Service is going to have over their actions it is for the Minister to tell us what his directives are, how the thing is going to work. What is the translation of the Bill? What is the relationship between civil and military men? I think the Minister owes a great deal to the Parliament and the people of the nation right now during this debate to tell us his intentions. </para>

          <para>- I will not delay the Committee long. I again make a formal inquiry as to why this amendment is necessary. The effect of this amendment is to take from section 4 of the Courts-Martial Appeals Act the term 'Royal Australian Air Force'. I will not repeat the argument I pressed upon the Committee last night, but I ask the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> whether he will give an explanation. It is true that the Defence Act does not use the term ' Royal Australian Air Force ', but do not tell me that it is because of symmetry of drafting or a passionate desire to have a splendid sense of uniformity running throughout all defence legislation that the term 'Royal Australian Air Force' is being deleted from the Courts Martial Appeals Act. </para>

        <para>I shall not, and my colleagues shall not, seek to delay the passage of the Bill through this chamber. We rest with the assurance that another place in all probability will examine the Bill at a public hearing, because that is what it needs. I am sorry that we were not able to convince the Minister as to the merit of that argument last evening although, if I may say in summary, I thought he came perilously close to accepting our argument. He listened to the speeches- I repeat, the very cogent speeches- of the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly)</inline> and the honourable member for Mitchell <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cadman).</inline> I thought: 'Well, there it is, Killen. You have failed to convince him, but those 2 stirring speeches and the speech of my honourable and robust friend from Kennedy have convinced him'. One could almost see the look of apostasy on his face as though he were about to go over to the other side. </para>
        <para>Probably when the Bill gets to another place we will find out a little more about it than the Minister has been pleased to assure us. I ask him again on the basis of simple candour and friendship and I trust in terms of courtesy whether he will please give us an explanation as to why the term 'Royal Australian Air Force' is being dropped from the Courts-Martial Appeals Act. . </para>

            <para>-I suppose I should apologise to the House for inflicting myself once again upon it, but I will not delay the House very long. The Opposition supports the Defence Force Ombudsman Bill. Its purpose is to establish an ombudsman to examine complaints in the area of defence administration. I suppose one would be at liberty to foresee some difficulty, should the matter of administration come up, if a person in the defence area says: 'No, this is not a matter of administration; it is a matter of command '. So no doubt the Ombudsman 's ingenuity will be put to the test in that area. The purpose of the Bill was summed up by the previous Minister for Defence quite succinctly in his second reading speech. At the risk of wearying the House may I recapitulate what that honourable gentleman said. He said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The function of the Defence Force Ombudsman will be to investigate complaints made by members of the defence force, former members of the defence force or their dependants with regard to any action in relation to a matter of administration which arises from the fact that a person is serving or has served in the defence force. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I suppose it is a matter of notoriety that all Government departments have as one of their constant companions inertia, and frequently this affects serving personnel and their families in a most grievous way, and to that extent the creation of the office of Ombudsman is welcomed. It will enable those who feel that they have been treated in a dilatory fashion, treated unfairly or treated with scant regard for then problems to have some redress. I am bound to say that the Bill is a splendid illustration of what I have described as inertia on the part of the Government itself because there has been in existence the office of Ombudsman in a de facto way since November 1973, with a very distinguished Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Hay, filling that position. I suppose the mills of God may grind slowly as long as they grind with exactness. In this case it has taken from November 1973 until August 1975 for the Bill to be produced. May I offer just one bland criticism of the Bill: The Bill having been presented on 15 May 1975, we are now greeted with some 17 amendments to it. I would have thought with all my simplicity of mind that it would have been possible for this Bill to be settled in the first place and that it would not have been found necessary for all these amendments to be introduced. </para>
          <para>May I make clear for my part and for the Opposition's part that the Bill does not give to the Defence Force Ombudsman the power to interfere in respect of matters which are disciplinary in nature. If I may put it in a homely way, if a seaman should tell the chief petty officer to go to Bourke, and tender further advice to him, the chief petty officer is not left in some powerless, hapless state of mind unable to rectify the blemish of conduct. One of the proposed amendments to the Bill excites my curiosity. It is amendment (7) which deals with clause 5 relating to the jurisdiction of the Defence Force Ombudsman. Subclause (3) of clause 5 reads: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Proposed amendment (7) seeks to omit subclause (4) of clause 5. As I say, this proposal excites my curiosity. Sub-clause (4) reads: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Where, at any time during an investigation into action taken by the Defence Force or a public authority, the Defence Force Ombudsman becomes of the opinion that the action was taken in the course of giving effect to a decision of the Cabinet, of a Committee of the Cabinet or of a Minister and that the Defence Force or the public authority, as the case may be, did not act improperly in the course of giving effect to that decision, the Defence Force Ombudsman shall not investigate the action further. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I am interested to know why that sub-clause is being expunged from the Bill. As the Bill now stands the Ombudsman must become seized of an opinion that the action was taken pursuant to, say, a Cabinet decision, and he says- this is the next consideration- it was not taken in properly, and that being the case he should not further investigate the action. Under the proposed amendment that provision will be deleted from the Bill. Is the position then to be that the Ombudsman can investigate a decision taken by the Cabinet? I draw the attention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> to what would seem to me to be, with great respect, some mild conflict in the Bill, that is that if the Ombudsman cannot investigate an action taken by a Minister it would seem to me, a fortiori, that he could not investigate an action taken by a collection or a grouping of Ministers. If that is the basis upon which the provision in sub-clause (4) becomes unnecessary then it would seem to me to be a rational explanation, but if on the other hand it is to be taken out of the Bill in the expectation that the Ombudsman can investigate action or a decision taken by Cabinet or a sub-committee of the Cabinet it would seem to me to be a rather curious form of trenching into the whole system of responsible government. I invite the Minister when winding up the debate, if he would be good enough, to give an explanation as to why this amendment is proposed. </para>

As the Opposition shadow Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> has pointed out, we do not oppose this Bill at all. In fact we will be delighted to see it at least pass through this House because in effect the concept of a defence force Ombudsman was accepted quite some time ago. I share the pleasure of the honourable member for Moreton, that the appointment of the Defence Force Ombudsman will in no way affect the discipline that is an integral and critical part of the forces. Discipline these days is not based on the martinet attitude of a regimental sergeant-major but on understanding and mutual respect between officers and non-commissioned officers and those serving under them. It is because of this respect and understanding which inevitably grows between a good No and a good officer and their men that I am pleased to see that there is special mention in clause 7 of the Bill in relation to a provision that a serving member of the defence force can have a complaint dealt with by the Service authorities before submitting the matter to the Defence Force Ombudsman. The relationship which exists between an No and the men serving under him is of a very special nature. I would think that the average serviceman would much rather approach the Service authorities than rush off to someone who is virtually a stranger to him. So I join the honourable member for Moreton in endorsing and supporting this Bill. May it have the speediest possible passage. </para>

            <para>-My comments also will be brief. I think that this right of investigation allowed to servicemen is a step forward. I think the name 'ombudsman' is a misnomer. I do not consider that an ombudsman is responsible to anybody other than the Parliament, and in that respect I think in it is the wrong term to use in view of the role to be played by the Defence Force Ombudsman. However, I think that the activities of the Ombudsman will be beneficial to many people within the Services. I have one small reservation in relation to clause 5( 1 ) which mentions investigating the matter of administration. Here again we come to the problem of command and administration. Until we have some clearing up of these definitions we are going to be in trouble. If in this case 'administration' is to apply to troops or men in the field and is to refer to matters of discipline or morale I find it most concerning. I trust that this will not be the case, but I sincerely press the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> to give us the reassurance we need in regard to that clause. I commend the legislation in concept although I disagree with the term used. </para>

            <para>- in reply- In response to the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> let me say that the reason that there are so many amendments- I apologise for it- is that, as he will be aware, on 6 March my colleague the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> introduced the Ombudsman Bill, which I suppose is the civilian equivalent of this Bill, to establish the office of the Australian Ombudsman. A number of amendments were made to that Bill, and because the Defence Force Ombudsman Bill follows very closely the Ombudsman Bill we felt it necessary to make the same amendments to the Defence Force Ombudsman Bill as were made to the Ombudsman Bill. That is the explanation for the amendments. The honourable member for Moreton also raised a question relating to the amendment to clause 5(4). That sub-clause has been the subject of public criticism on 2 grounds. The first is that there is no similar limit on the  powers of State ombudsmen. The second criticism is that, if the intention is merely to exclude cases where no independent discretion at all is exercised in giving effect to a Cabinet or ministerial decision, it is too wide and is unnecessary having regard to paragraph (a) of clause 5(3) of the Bill which excludes actions taken by a Minister from investigation by the Defence Force Ombudsman. In addition, the clause is inconsistent with sub-clause 1 7( 1 ) of the Bill which contemplates that the Defence Force Ombudsman can investigate actions taken in accordance with an ordinance or regulation, in which case he can call into question the reasonableness of a decision of the Executive Council. So on these grounds and in responding to what we thought were very justifiable criticisms of the original clause we now propose in the amendment to omit the clause. </para>

            <para>-This Bill, which seeks to amend the Crimes Act, makes it an offence under that Act for somebody who is an officer, member or employee of an organisation registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to steal, fraudulently misappropriate or fraudulently convert to his own use any money or property belonging to the organisation. Under the legislation a person found guilty of such an offence is liable to a penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. The Opposition agrees that there is a need for this Bill. It is extraordinary that, where organisations' funds are misappropriated, under existing Federal legislation all that we in the Federal jurisdiction can say is that the person responsible must stop doing it. We cannot do anything further than that. The organisations have to rely on State action if proceedings are to be instituted against the person who is guilty of that offence under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Clearly, in respect of organisations which are registered under a Federal Act, such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Federal Government should be able to initiate action in these circumstances. This Bill will enable it to do that. The Government is right in establishing machinery to deal with this despicable form of crime in which a person who is put in a position of trust by his fellow workers violates that trust and steals from his mates. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Unfortunately, there have been blatant examples of this abuse of trust in recent times. There have been cases involving the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia, No. 2 Branch, in Victoria. There have been cases involving several members of the Builders Labourers Federation. These are some of the more well known cases which come to mind. This Bill will ensure that action can be taken under Federal jurisdiction to bring to justice people who engage in criminal practices of this nature. Clause 3 (2) of the Bill recognises the fact that such crimes are often difficult to prove if proof requires the identification of specific sums of money or items of property. Under the Bill it will be sufficient to prove a general deficiency in the books of account. Upon such proof the penalty is, as described in the Bill, imprisonment for 7 years. The Opposition agrees that the Bill makes adequate provision for dealing with the situation for which it is designed. However, it is worth mentioning that the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act dealing with annual reports and financial statements of organisations probably need tightening to ensure that rank and file members of organisations are kept fully informed of where and how their membership dues are being used and of the general financial position of the organisation to which they belong. </para>
          <para>I said a moment ago that the Bill is adequate to deal with the specific problem of the stealing of the funds of an organisation. But since the introduction of this Bill we have received an interim report from the Royal Commission Into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney.  His  interim report was tabled in this House this week. I find it difficult to choose language to describe adequately the situation which is revealed by this interim report. Contained in its pages are cases not only of theft of union funds but also of blackmail and extortion accompanied by menaces, threats and intimidation. It sounds and reads like a story about the Mafia, but the tragedy is that it is not. It is about a small group of ruthless and dishonest people in the Australian union movement thieving from their workmates and extorting money under threats. Such actions are clearly of a similar kind to those covered by this Bill. </para>
          <para>As the Bill is presently drafted, some of those actions would not come within its provisions. In due course my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> who represents in this House the shadow Attorney-General, will be moving an amendment to correct this deficiency. The amendment is entirely consistent with the objective of the Government's legislation and therefore it should be acceptable to the Government. I do not blame the Government for not covering the appalling situation disclosed by the interim report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney because the report was not available when the legislation was brought down. But if the Government does not take the opportunity provided by this Opposition amendment to correct what is now seen to be a deficiency in the legislation it will be very clearly to blame. It would be intolerable if the practices described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney were allowed to continue. The Government must act now to put a stop to this longstanding campaign of blackmail and extortion. </para>
          <para>So that the House will be aware of the full implications of what has been going on, I shall refer to certain specific cases mentioned in the Sweeney interim report. Before doing so, it may be appropriate to remind the House that section 288 of the Navigation Act provides that no ship shall engage in the coasting trade unless <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is licensed to do so by a single voyage permit which is commonly known as an SVP. Section 289 of the same Act provides that seamen employed on vessels engaged in the coasting trade shall be paid at the current ruling rates for seamen in Australia. The first case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney in his interim report is that of the <inline font-style="italic">Wakasa Maru.</inline> That was the first occasion on which demands were made in relation to the coastal trade. Those demands were made some 4 years ago. In fact, the issue related to intrastate trade. The <inline font-style="italic">Wakasa Maru</inline> was to transport machinery to the Ord River scheme in north Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings</inline> claimed that the Australian vessel <inline font-style="italic">Wollongong</inline> should be used. It is interesting to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney rejects this claim, as the <inline font-style="italic">Wollongong did</inline> not have the capacity. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings</inline> imposed a ban on the ship. He fixed the sum of $2,500 for the ban on the vessel to be lifted. This was paid. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney comments in his report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am satisfied that the demands made had no relation to any union policy concerning foreign vessels on the Australian coast. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Sweeney also makes reference to what is known as the Marine Industry Group. This is a group of unions concerned with maritime matters and affiliated with the Western Australia </para>

          <para class="block">Listed in the documents referred to above was a note which stated: 'Loan to member- $250'. Tracing the cheque butts revealed that the member concerned was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings,</inline> who then claimed that he had used this money for a union trip. The cheque was then traced through the bank to York Motors Pty Ltd. It formed part of the transaction in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings'</inline> purchase of a motor car. The loan was not approved by the union or by the Marine Industry Group. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney comments: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am satisfied that there was an attempt to conceal the payment to Rawlings and a further attempt when the payment to Rawlings became known to conceal the purpose. I am satisfied that the reason this payment was demanded and received was to place money at the disposal of Wells and Rawlings, which could be used for their own purposes, and in Rawlings' case- his own personal benefit. The payment was not related to any union campaign at all. </para>

          <para class="block">We now come to the case of the Bay boats. The Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd wanted to ship 400 vehicles to Western Australia. No other means was available to get them there; accordingly, arrangements were made to take the cars by the <inline font-style="italic">Moreton Bay</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Botany Bay.</inline> I point out that neither of those vessels is in any sense a flag of convenience vessel. The cars were shipped to Western Australia and they were then unloaded. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings'</inline> name crops up again. He demanded $288 for every day involved in the shipment, a total of $2,500. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney comments: </para>

            <para>Quite clearly the payment was made under duress . . . I am of the opinion that the purpose of the demand was to replenish the funds of the maritime industry group and not to further any union policy at all . . . In my opinion the demand was made in respect of these two boats primarily for the purpose of allowing Rawlings to obtain $250. </para>

          <para class="block">The next case is that of the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Vigour.</inline> It involves joint action by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Elliott</inline> of the Seamen's Union of Australia. This ship was diverted to collect containers from Fremantle and to carry them to Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings</inline> demanded the difference between the Australian and British rates and placed bans on the ship. When he was advised that the voyage, under section 7 of the Navigation Act, did not form part of the coastal trade, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings</inline> replied that he did not care what the Act provided and his demand still stood. The payment was refused by the British crew who were already on a bonus system considerably more beneficial to them than the differential payment which had been demanded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rawlings.</inline></para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I rise with some reluctance to take a point of order in relation to the remarks of my good friend the honourable member for Corangamite. The Bill is simply to insert a single clause into the Crimes Act. Although my friend's speech is interesting I suggest that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matter that is before the House at the second reading stage. It may be that the remarks would be relevant to what I understand one of the honourable member's colleagues will move at the Committee stage. If they are I suggest, with respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that that will be the occasion for a speech of this kind, not at the second reading stage. </para>

              <para>-Speaking to that point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I draw your attention to the title of the Bill which states that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Crimes Act for the purposes of the protection of the property of certain organisations. 'Certain organisations 'include the maritime industry group of unions and the Seamen's Union of Australia. The comments that I have been making have shown what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney. He said that he was satisfied the demands made had no relation to any union policy concerning foreign vessels on the Australian coast, and similar comments. This money was obtained allegedly for an organisation and was not properly used for that purpose. My remarks are consistent with the title of the Bill. This is what we are talking about. It is misappropriation of funds which allegedly were for the organisation concerned and which were put in individuals ' pockets. </para>

              <para>- I defer to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> and in due course at the Committee stage I shall refer in detail to further cases referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney's interim report. I am sure the Bill aims to correct some of the abuses such as are outlined in the interim report, but in its present form the Bill is not fully capable of doing so. But I accept your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> and I shall refer to this in detail later when we get to the Committee stage of the Bill. </para>

          </continue><para>I impress on the House that conduct of the nature I have just described has been held by the royal commissioner to be 'entirely improper and contrary to trade union standards and ethics'. Because of that and because of the fact that the Bill as drafted is not capable of coping with all the irregularities which were brought to attention by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney, the Opposition will be moving to widen the terms of the Bill to provide against further abuses such as those outlined in the interim report which we will be discussing at the Committee stage. </para><para>I trust that the Government, in the spirit in which the legislation was introduced in the first place- to stop flagrant misuse of organisational funds- will see fit to support the amendment which is designed to protect the property of certain organisations in conformity with the title of the Bill, when individuals misappropriate funds which have been paid to them and do not transfer them to their proper destination. Leaving aside for a moment whether the persons concerned were paid the money legally in the first place, it is a matter of great concern, it is a new intrusion, and a most unwelcome one in the industrial relations affairs of Australia. I think it is wise of the Government to move in at this stage to try to prevent the extension of such abuses. We will co-operate with the Government in widening the terms of this legislation to ensure that the abuses do not occur in other areas as well. </para></speech>

            <para>-I have only a few remarks to make at this second reading stage. They relate mainly to the reasons which prompted the Government to introduce this measure, or rather the lack of explanation of the reasons why this measure was introduced. The second reading speech of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> was conspicuous for the omission of any explanation as to precisely why this measure should be introduced. The Opposition is ready to accept that if there are reasons for measures of this nature the Bill certainly should be introduced. The Opposition has absolutely no intention of hindering the passage of the Bill in that context, nor indeed does it in any way oppose the Government's remedying what it apparently regards as an unsatisfactory situation. I hope that during the course of his remarks on this debate the Attorney-General will explain the reasons why the Bill was brought forward. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> the Opposition's spokesman on matters relating to the Attorney-General's responsibilities, has written to the Attorney-General on a number of occasions endeavouring to obtain some information as to the reasons for the introduction of this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> requested that information of the Attorney-General to enable the Opposition to make a responsible and considered assessment of the Bill so that it could make up its mind as to what attitude it would take. So far, the Attorney-General's response has been courteous but unhelpful. I hope that during the course of this debate we may be able to find out precisely why the Government has brought in this measure. </para>
          <para>I would like to . commend to the House the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> regarding matters disclosed in the interim report tabled recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney. Matters involved in the Royal Commission into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney is presently conducting have prompted the Opposition to move an amendment during the Committee stage of the debate. The amendment has been circulated in my name. I again ask that the Attorney-General explain to the House the reasons behind this legislation and, in particular, why in an area which is normally covered by the crimes Acts of the various States he has seen fit to introduce measures which are essentially amendments to the ordinary criminal law. </para>

            <para>-This Bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914-1973 for the purposes of the protection of the property of certain organisations. I could not think of anything that would be more important than the protection of the property of people or organisations. The Act, of course, is cited as the Crimes Act 1914-1973. If it is amended by this Bill it may then be cited as the Crimes Act 1914-1975. It shall come into operation on the day that it receives royal assent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I commend the honourable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> for disclosing some aspects of the Sweeney report. I think that while it may have been ruled that that report is perhaps irrelevant to this particular part of the debate, it has certainly disclosed the necessity for the implementation of such legislation. This Bill will make it possible to bring to justice people who commit crimes against their own unions or organisations but who, at the moment, are outside the authority of State jurisdiction. The Bill, I believe, is adequate for dealing with persons who have misappropriated union funds, particularly those in authority as officers or members of an organisation upon trust. I refer to the unions which are registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It is; therefore, appropriate that provision be made by this Parliament for such offences, which I believe are associated only with the lowest form of human beings, to be dealt with. </para>
          <para>Section 71 of the Crimes Act 1914-1973 is the pattern used for the drafting of this legislation and should be adequate in bringing to justice all persons who commit such offences. The Government is endeavouring, I believe, to remedy a situation which has caused concern for some time for so many unions and so many organisations which have been the victims of stealth and misappropriation over the years. The amendment which will be moved by the Opposition will help to rectify and will help to fill in the gaps which we believe still exist in this legislation. I commend this Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I should like briefly to reply to the remarks that have been made. The honourable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> was good enough to indicate, first, the support of the Opposition for the Government's proposal and, second, to go on and say that certain regulations made under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would probably- as a consequence of this measure becoming law- have to be amended. I am happy to tell the honourable gentleman that I understand it is the intention of the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> to make such amendments, which will give further effect to methods of dealing with the social mischief which he described so eloquently in his second reading speech. I should also like briefly to say in reply to the honourable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> that we try to be courteous but we also try to be helpful. I have written to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> on the subject setting out the general circumstances of the necessity to amend the regulation. </para>

Those are the prime reasons for the introduction of this Bill. It is introduced in the context that the present law on the subject is all State law. It is in different forms.

          <para class="block">If one looks at the Bill one will find it is a Bill to amend the Crimes Act for the purposes of the protection of the property of certain organisations. It is for the protection of the property of the unions in this particular case. It is pursuant to that title that the amendment to add proposed new clause 4, which would insert proposed new section 92 into the Crimes Act, is moved. That, of course, will make it a crime for a person to, in effect, steal, take from or convert property belonging to an association- to take from a union. The title of the Bill is to achieve the protection of the property of unions and to make it a crime for people to steal from unions. That is putting it as simply as I can. The amendment would have to be consistent with that title and those purposes. </para>
          <para>If one looks at the amendment we find that it has nothing to do with protecting the property of certain organisations. Neither does it have anything to do with stealing from those organisations. What is does is seek to create quite a different kind of offence. It seeks to make it an offence- and it may well be proper that such an offence should be proscribed under our law- by menaces, threat or intimidation of any kind to whomsoever directed, to compel people of other groups- not the associations covered by this Bill- to give money to the associations. In other words, the Opposition is seeking to make it an offence to enrich unions, not to steal from unions. That is not consistent with the title. It is not consistent with the purpose of the Bill. </para>

              <para>- I rise to speak to the point of order. The purpose of the amendment is to deal with other categories of behaviour by officers, members or employees of organisations registered pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Bill as it now stands deals with certain categories of behaviour. Those are covered in clause 3 of the Bill. It outlaws behaviour of the type specified in clause 3 by officials, members or employees of particular organisations.

Therefore, I would submit, that the amendment is clearly within the terms of standing order 227 as the subject matter of the Bill is the behaviour of officers, members or employees of organisations registered pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the subject matter of the amendment is likewise the behaviour of officers, members or employees of organisations registered pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

            <para>-The purpose of the Australian National University Bill 1975 and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill 1975 now before the House is to put into legislative form decisions which have been taken and put into effect in relation to universities and colleges of advanced education in the States. They follow as a consequence of the Government's announced proposals that certain fees payable by undergraduate students at university should be abolished. With regard to the States, this could be done by policy announcement of the Government or by the funding by this Government of the State governments with the request by this Government that State governments where necessary amend the statutes governing universities and colleges of advanced education. So, in the States where there were requirements upon universities in their statutes and where there were requirements in the legislation setting up colleges of advanced education that those bodies charge a fee, the States have now appropriately amended the relevant legislation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> intoduced the 2 Bills which are now the subject of this debate, he asked that the matters be speedily dealt with. They were not dealt with as speedily as he then hoped. There was no great need to delay them a long time because there is no dispute with regard to the passage of this legislation. The Opposition supports the proposals because, in dealing with these 2 Bills, we are acting in relation to these 2 institutions as State governments would act in relation to their colleges of advanced education and their universities. The principal purpose of these Bills is to authorise the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education to admit undergraduate students without charging fees. The Bills do specify that they can charge certain types of fees, that is, those that are not fees in respect of tuition but rather fees and charges for university student unions, sporting associations and the like. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Australian National University Bill, there are 2 other amendments which the Opposition supports. The first expands the membership of the Australian National University Council by allowing for admission to that council of a representative of the staff of that university. The Opposition supports that proposal. The other amendment which we applaud is the clarification of the powers of the Council of the Australian National University with regard to the statutes that it itself can make. Under the Act as it now reads, that Council has power to deal with the terms upon which students become matriculate for entry to the University. In these days when there is an effort to broaden the opportunities of people to expand their education by entering tertiary institutions and, in particular, universities, to confine the power of the Council to regulations relating to matriculation is, if one puts a strict interpretation on that word, to limit the opportunities for tertiary education to people who have obtained traditional academic qualifications at secondary level in the form of matriculation examinations. </para>
          <para>We, therefore, are very keen to indicate our support for the amendment to this statute making power on the part of the Council of the Australian National University to enable it to make statutes with regard to the matriculation, admission and enrolment of students. We have in mind that this change will clarify the position and, in so clarifying, expand the capacity of the Council to admit as students to the University people who in their later life wish to complete a university course but who find that at the time when they undertook their primary education followed by secondary education they did not qualify at the traditional matriculation examinations. The provision of an expanded opportunity to obtain further education is deserving of further study so that more and more people who in the more mature years of their fife want to undertake further university study will be able to do so. That is particularly relevant at a time when, as they have found in recent years, universities are finding it necessary to impose quotas on admissions to a large number of courses, if not to all courses. The imposition of those quotas has tended to restrict entry to universities to those who have qualified academically in school examinations. </para>
          <para>I think all honourable members are aware that some of the most brilliant scientists, doctors, lawyers, teachers and members of other professions are those who have come up through a training based on practical experience and for whom the development of their abilities has come later in life. In the past many such people have found it difficult to qualify themselves by attaining university degrees because of the rather strict requirements with regard to matriculation as a means of entry into universities. I hope that this sort of matter will be examined closely and that adequate opportunity will be given to more and more of the people who in later life find that through the experience of life they have an aptitude for university study. I hope that the basis for admission to such courses will not be restricted to the passing of the formal and traditional matriculation examination. Insofar as this legislation will enable that type of person to undertake degree courses at the Australian National University, we members of the Opposition applaud the measure. </para>
          <para>As I indicated in my opening remark, these pieces of legislation are designed to put into practice and to confirm a course of action that has been in operation now for nearly 2 years. In that respect the legislation is retrospective because it authorises the 2 institutions concerned not to collect fees, although under their existing statutes they may have had an obligation to do so in respect of the 1974 year and so much of 1975 as has already passed. We join with the Minister in his expressed desire and hope that these 2 Bills will receive a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>- I want to speak very briefly in support of these Bills. Both of the organisations mentioned in them- the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education- are in my electorate. They are, of course, very important national institutions. Apart from the political or moral desirability of increasing the representation of students on the Council of the Australian National University from one to three, I suggest that the proposed changes are in accordance with the changes in society generally and the aspirations of the Government to ensure that people are represented at all levels. A few statistics about the student population of the ANU may be of interest to honourable members. The ANU has made very significant growth. Its student population now stands at about 5500. Of those, about two-thirds are full time students and about one-third are part time students. The ANU plays a very significant part in relation to the education of people within the Public Service in Canberra and has been largely responsible for the quite large percentage of graduates in the Public Service. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The deletion of the reference to matriculation, of course, will only regularise what is actually happening within the the University. At present there is no matriculation requirement. A person is either admitted or not admitted. The matriculation requirement has no relevance to the present situation. It is therefore quite right that any reference to it should be deleted. It is quite well known, of course, that within some of the other universities people who have satisfied the matriculation requirements are not necessarily admitted. Such a requirement is quite irrelevant and out of place in this situation. </para>
          <para>The Canberra College of Advanced Education is a fairly recently established institution. It is not so many years ago that the foundation stone of this institution was laid by the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton).</inline> It has made quite remarkable progress. It is now in the top ten of some ninety similar institutions. The College has quite a broad national role to play in that among other things, it provides education for quite a number of overseas students and provides special courses in local government. For those reasons this institution attracts students from a very wide field. As a matter of fact, more than 800 students at the CCAE come from outside of Canberra. The abolition of fees has resulted in some changes being made in the content and make-up of the students. There are now many more mature students at the College. That reflects the use to which the employees of the Public Service put the College. Many of them are people who have de gees and are seeking further education. So, the College is playing a very valuable role in relation to government and the Public Service. A wide range of courses is available. The courses are generally vocationally oriented. They have been developed to fit the needs as they have emerged in the community. The progress that the College has made in the very few years in which it has been in existence is quite remarkable. It now has 4500 students. The pressure being exerted on the courses available at the College is continuing to grow. </para>
          <para>An interesting development has occurred at the College in relation to the provision of accommodation. I think that it is one of the first institutions it is certainly the first in the Australian Capital Territory- to provide communal-type accommodation in which students are given separate rooms but share communal kitchens. That is in contrast to the full board accommodation that is provided at other institutions. This new development has taken place because of certain demands by the students. The general feeling among the students was that what was being provided was more than what was being asked for and was unnecessarily expensive. Students were paying $25 to $30 a week for full board, which they did not always want and could not always afford. Under the new arrangements students pay for their accommodation- their rooms- and share a kitchen and provide their own food. Of course, they can do that much more cheaply. I think that costs them something like $8 or $10 a week. That is a new development which has proved to be very successful. I know that it is now being followed in other institutions. Generally, the CCAE has been a very progressive institution. It has served its purpose well and I am sure that it will continue to do so. </para>

            <para>-There is no need to delay the passage of these 2 pieces of legislation. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wilson),</inline> who represents the shadow Minister for Education in this House, these Bills simply seek to bring into line a situation that has operated for some time. They refer primarily to the abolition of the payment of fees for tuition. The Opposition Parties have supported the Government's policy of assisting students at tertiary institutions by that means. I can only say that we wish these Bills a speedy passage through the House. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for the Media <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> in his second reading speech indicated that this Bill flows from a report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices presented to Parliament in November 1973. On the basis of 3 preparations a general recommendation was made for the compulsory disclosure of individual cost of manufacturer by drug companies. As the report was presented in November 1973 it has had a long gestation. The Bill was given its first reading here in May and it again comes before the House, the implication being that the Bill is obviously not considered urgent by the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think really the events that have taken place since the report on prices was presented indicate that in many ways the Government has changed its mind, that at that time it was very much in an ideological 'hit everything in private industry' phase. Now it appears to be relenting somewhat. But the Bill as it now stands gives frightening power to the Director-General of Health and through him to 3 unknown people in the Department of Health who form the pricing bureau and who decide what prices will be paid to drug manufacturers for prescription drugs dispensed under the national health scheme. In fact one could call the Director-General of Health a drug dictator when he received this power. The legislation would give him, or through him the pricing bureau, the power to make or break companies that could be employing thousands of people. It gives them the power to decide whether or not a company will continue in Australia. No other department, no other person to my knowledge, would have such power over people in this country, nor for that matter in this area of drug revelation and cost, in any other western country. </para>
          <para>The Government has not spelt out a clear requirement for this legislation. In fact some of its later actions have been contradictory. On the one hand it used to claim that the cost of drugs was too high. Now a committee has been established on an informal basis between the Department of Health and some of the drug manufacturers to look at the possibility of increasing drug prices because of the implications of bankruptcy and unemployment in the drug manufacturing field. </para>
          <para>The present situation was not explained to the Joint Committee on Prices at the time when it made its recommendation. I think that the extent of the knowledge available to the Department of Health is not generally known. There is a voluntary arrangement with the drug companies which I am told is gaining increasing acceptance. The present arrangement allows for a certain amount of give and take between the Department and companies in which the Department says: 'Well, we will let you have the price on this article but we want a cut in something else'. I believe this approach is better for the overall Australian community and the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </para>
          <para>The Department has available to it information from other countries. In particular it has available the cost of drugs from those countries which do not belong to the international patent convention. In other words, these countries do not support patent rights and offer drugs free of patent on the international market. The Department also has available to it information on the general wage level, the cost of packaging and manufacturing and so on. In addition to the Department of Health having this information available to it the Taxation Office has a special group which is investigating pharmaceutical companies. I understand that 28 of the major drug manufacturers in this country have had this special taxation team going right through their premises and books to ensure that there is no double dealing between an Australian offshoot of a foreign company- and certainly most of the major drug companies in Australia are multinationals and to see that there is no double dealing in regard to transfer prices, technical arrangements or contractual arrangements of any kind. I believe that is right and proper, but I also believe that this indicates the degree of surveillance already provided to see that drugs sold to the Government through the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements are sold at a reasonable price. </para>
          <para>I would like to say something about the price  of drugs sold in Australia compared to the price in other countries. I have seen tables for Australia, the United States of America, Canada, Britain, West Germany and New Zealand which indicate that some of the prices we pay are above those paid in other countries, and some are less. I think that is probably a reasonable situation. Certainly Australia is not one of the most expensive drug countries in the world. If one looks at the cost of drugs to the Government under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme it can be seen that the actual cost of drugs has fallen by 16 per cent in the last 10 years. This has taken place during a time of rapid inflation. At a time when the actual cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has escalated the cost of drugs has generally fallen. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> acknowledged this in his second reading speech on the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Charges) Bill which he made in this House yesterday when he stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Fortunately, the rises in the wholesale prices of drugs listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme have not been as great as for the more labour intensive health services. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He is at least acknowledging that there have not been the runaway price increases. If one looks at the average cost of a prescription under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, one will find that the actual percentage going to the drug manufacturer is failing. This is because the labour intensive sector of the total payment for the benefit, in particular the chemist, is rising because of our rapid inflation. </para>
          <para>There are some fundamental issues in this question of the revelation of drug costs. The first is whether we want Australian production of pharmaceuticals. Do we want the technology that this production in Australia brings with it? Do we want the employment that this brings with it? Do we want the continuity of supply that this brings with it? If we do- and I believe that we do and that it is to the benefit of Australiathen it is no good persecuting drug companies. One cannot have it both ways. It certainly would be possible to buy cheaper drugs on the international market from time to time, but one would miss out on all those other things including the guarantee of supply. One would also miss out on something which tends sometimes to make drugs more expensive in Australia than some other countries, and that is our stricter code of good manufacturing practice. I believe that it is correct that we should have a strict code to enforce quality standards not only for prescription drugs, but for over-the-counter drugs. The danger of losing production in Australia is not just an idle thought. It is just about here and now. For example, penicillin production in Australia was carried out by 3 companies. I think that it is now down to 2 companies and in fact the second company, Abbott Laboratories Pty Ltd, has closed production for the time being and has dismissed 70 people from its plant. To my knowledge, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory is the only remaining manufacturer in Australia of penicillin and its derivatives at present. In the next few weeks or few months, there will be a report from the Industries Assistance Commission. </para>

              <para>-The Government owns CSL. One can see from the Budget that the Government subsidy for CSL is double what it was in the previous Budget. In the next few weeks there will be a report on tariff protection for penicillin. If, as the rumours have it, the recommendation is that there be no tariff protection for penicillin, it will mean one of two things: CSL stops production of penicillin or the Government subsidy to CSL is increased dramatically. That is a real crunch point as to whether or not we want to have in this country some of the production, some of the technology and some of the employment </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I mentioned earlier that presently there is actually a special committee comprising officers of the Department of Health and some manufacturers who are looking at this cost price squeeze of drug manufacturers in Australia. As a result, a number of drugs have been increased in price in the last 2 months. These are increases in price agreed to by the Government. I believe that that attitude, when compared with the Bill which we have before us, is contradictory. It certainly does not indicate a clear government policy and certainly does not provide the situation for this Bill to be accepted as it stands at present. </para>
          <para>This Bill, as it is now, as I said earlier, gives frightening power to the Director-General of Health or to these 3 unknown people in the pricing bureau. For example, it places no limitation on the amount of information which can be required from a drug manufacturer. It allows no reasonable time limit for that manufacturer to provide that information. It allows no accounting of the overall profitability of the drug company in examining the cost of a particular drug. When one looks at the drug industry, one sees that so much depends on one or two particular drugs in respect of which the results of research have put a company ahead of others. This drug may have saved the lives of thousands of people. In this legislation, no account is to be taken of research costs or the overall profitability of the pharmaceutical section of a company. One should certainly not have to take into account a veterinary side or a cosmetic side of a company, but certainly the pharmaceutical section of the company should be considered. </para>
          <para>There is also no guarantee of confidentiality of the information obtained. There is no provision for any independent arbitrator. Everything is decided by this pricing bureau. I would believe as a minimum requirement that there should be some sort of arbitration arrangement. There is also the question of whether the establishment of a pricefixing power by one, two or three people in a department is constitutional when this country has not accepted a referendum in favour of price fixing. If one looks at what is required in other countries, such as Great Britain, one finds that there certainly is a requirement for information. I am told that in Britain this is basically in the form of a report on the profitability of a particular company rather than on individual drugs. When I was in Britain, I was told that in some cases the Government itself helps the company because of the importance to Britain of its export market. </para>
          <para>In New Zealand, information is required on imported drugs, not by the Department of Health, but by the Department of Trade for other reasons. In the United States of America at present there is discussion of lowering drug costs. This centres around America's Medicare or Medicaid programs, where there is Government financial support for drug prescriptions, where generic drugs are prescribed- this is only a small percentage- and where it is shown by the Food and Drug Administration that all the drugs prescribed have the same therapeutic value. When this is all sorted out, the medical practitioner will be required to prescribe drugs at the lowest cost. But none of the proposals make the demands on the drug companies for which this legislation will provide. </para>
          <para>This leads one to ask what is the genuine reason for the Government wanting this legislation. Is it something to do with its ambitions in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals? Is there also the question of unfair competition from a Government subsidised and supported company? This brings us to the interesting question of Fawnmac Industries Pty Ltd. This was purchased by the Government recently and I have here a Press statement of the Minister for Health in which several things are stated. One in particular is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It would also give the Government reliable information about the basic production costs associated with pharmaceutical manufacturing. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If the purchase of this company gives the Government this information, why does it want this legislation? If one were suspicious, one could say that perhaps the Government wants this information on individual drugs from other companies so that it can pass this information on to the company that it now owns and provide unfair competition. </para>
          <para>There is also the question of the suitability to the taxpayers of Australia of the Fawnmac purchase. The Press release at the time stated that </para>
          <para class="block">Fawnmac had cost $6m. In the Budget on Tuesday night, we learned that the purchase of Fawnmac had cost $8.4m- a slight discrepancy of $2.4m. That is no mean figure when one is handling the taxpayers ' money. I think that any explanation on this discrepancy would be welcomed by the people of Australia and certainly by the Opposition. But one could look more closely at the Fawnmac purchase. Was it a good buy or was it goodbye to a lot of taxpayers' money? I have some information on this matter. It has been very difficult to obtain. My office telephoned the manager of Fawnmac to obtain copies of the annual report to ascertain the degree of profitability of this company. This information was refused. We then approached the Victorian Corporate Affairs Office to obtain information about Fawnmac Industries and obtained particulars of the shareholding but not of the profitability. I was informed: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As disclosed by the returns, the companies are exempt proprietary companies and as such exempt from lodging at this office copies of their annual reports and financial statements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The shareholders in those companies, who appear to be very few and who appear to be members of the management, which is continuing under the new arrangements, have done very well out of this purchase by the Government. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Government will provide for Parliament full details on the profitability of the Fawnmac purchase and some good reasons why it was necessary to buy this company with taxpayers' money. I have been told that this company was for sale for $2m for two or three years. I trunk it was the only company that the Government could purchase because it was the only one with a manufacturing capability that was for sale. Since the purchase- as I said, the previous ownership has continued in management- the manager has sent letters to overseas suppliers to the company to the effect that as the company is now an Australian Government instrumentality special treatment will be provided. These letters have gone to eastern European countries and China, among others. </para>
          <para>This raises the very serious question of the action of the Government in purchasing this company, both for financial reasons and for policy reasons, and how much this piece of legislation is tied in with its ambition, at all costs to the taxpayers, to get into drug manufacture, because there appear to be very few lines of special selling ability and the plant is not of particularly noteworthy capability. </para>
          <para>Will special treatment be given to the Fawnmac company by the Government? The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, the long-standing government corporation, requires a significant subsidy. I do not criticise the subsidy for CSL, because CSL is required to manufacture vaccines and other products which are not commercially available. But it still raises the general question of efficiency of any government drug company. If the Government is sincere in wanting to cut drug costs, then perhaps it should be looking at its own actions rather than at the actions of the private drug companies to the degree that it is. I certainly support the need for careful evaluation and checking of what any drug company may put up as a reasonable price. </para>
          <para>At the present time there is an Industries Assistance Commission hearing on pharmaceutical and veterinary products. The matter was referred to the Commission some time ago by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> I am told that this investigation has turned into a general investigation of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and I think that is a good thing. I think it is good that we find out what the true position is because we have not been told yet. I am told that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, within the last two or three weeks, has presented a 50-page submission to this hearing on costs of production and cost structure. This to me is important information for the IAC to have. Because of this, the Opposition has decided that this legislation should be deferred until the Industries Assistance Commission report is completed and published and everybody on both sides of the Parliament and outside Parliament in the general public has had the opportunity to see what is the position with regard to drug manufacture. </para>
          <para>The Commission's inquiry was initiated by the present Government. Therefore it sees this as a matter for genuine and serious concern. We in the Opposition see it as a matter of genuine and serious concern. I think it is a reasonable proposition to defer this legislation until that report is presented. After all, it is not as if the Government has wanted this legislation urgently because, as we are told, this legislation is based on a simple recommendation from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Prices almost 2 years ago, in November 1973. So if we have to wait another two or three months or however many months- I do not think it will be more than 6 months- until this report is out, I think it is reasonable to request a deferral of this Bill. If the Government wants the information earlier, it can tell the IAC that it wants it earlier. </para>
          <para>Until now the Government has not made a case for its legislation. Much of its action, particularly recently, has been contrary to the points contained in this legislation, which, as I say, stem from an earlier, more ideological period. When we have the information from the IAC, a final decision can be made whether or not to accept the legislation. I issue a warning that if the Opposition is to accept the legislation- I am not saying that it will- major amendments will be required to. guarantee confidentiality, the inclusion of overall profitability, of reasonable time limits and of reasonable requirements on information provided and on the question of an independent arbitrator so that everything is not only above board and just but is seen to be just. If the public can see the position more clearly rather than there being a hidden bureau, that is probably all the better also. I move: </para>

            <para>-The National Health Bill was introduced by the Minister for the Media <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> acting for the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham).</inline> It requires drug manufacturers and distributors to furnish the Government with information on prices and costs of pharmaceutical benefits. It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd),</inline> who showed a tremendous concern for the drug manufacturers and distributors. I wish that he would show the same concern for the consumer and for the taxpayer who foots the bill for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The introduction of this Bill follows a recommendation by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Prices, whose membership includes representatives from all parties, in its first report in November 1973. The recommendation said that the National Health Act should be amended to allow the Department of Health to obtain cost and financial information in respect of products in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is at present no power under the National Health Act to require that the Government be given the details of costing. All we can do is foot the bill, even though 80 per cent of all dispensed medicines are supplied under the provisions of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This is tantamount to the Government signing a blank cheque in the name of the taxpayer, who foots the bill, and it leaves the Department of Health dependent on negotiations with drug manufacturers and distributors to try to achieve fair and reasonable prices for pharmaceutical benefit items. One has only to look at the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme over past years to see the extent to which the prices have escalated. It would be an irresponsible government, and certainly an irresponsible opposition, which was not prepared in some way to try to see that we pay fair and reasonable prices for anything that goes on to the pharmaceutical benefits list. While such negotiations can be successfully conducted with mutual co-operation, if a satisfactory price cannot be arrived at an item may have to be removed from the pharmaceutical benefits list, and this is certainly not in the public interest. Indeed, it could lead to medical, physical and financial hardship on the part of an individual dependent on a particular doctor's prescription, who would have to pay the full cost of a certain drug removed from the list. If this legislation is deferred until a report is presented by the Industries Assistance Commission on the whole drug industry, very many consumers may have to pay the full cost of the drugs they need for their health's sake. I consider waiting for an IAC report quite irrelevant to this Bill. We still have to protect the consumer and protect the taxpayer who foots the bill for pharmaceutical benefits whatever the result of the IAC investigation. As the Government in this instance is really acting as an agent for the taxpayers, it would be completely irresponsible not to make every effort to control to some extent the cost of the drugs on the pharmaceutical list. </para>
          <para>The provisions of this Bill are designed to protect the taxpayers from excessive prices being set for some items which are manufactured in a monopoly situation by some drug companies. As the Australian Government heavily subsidises the purchase of the vast bulk of prescription drugs, it is only reasonable to require drug manufacturers to provide full financial information to justify the prices charged for medicines included on the pharmaceutical list and especially when they control the patents. Such information will be provided in the same way as information is provided in income tax returns. It will be completely confidential and certainly will not be in danger of being disclosed to competitors which I imagine is probably the main worry that drug manufacturers have in this respect. </para>
          <para>The suggestion that the Bill be withdrawn until the Industries Assistance Commission has completed its report on the protection of the pharmaceutical industry is really a red herring in this case and it shows an irresponsible attitude on the part of the Opposition. The IAC is examining the viability of the industry as a whole in terms of tariff protection which is really a different area. The Bill relates to the protection of the consumer. There is no reason for the Department of Health to delay negotiations with individual companies over the pricing of drugs marketed in Australia as this is a separate although it may be a related issue. The proposal by the Opposition to defer consideration of this Bill is rather confusing. The introduction into this debate of the Fawnmac purchase I found irrelevant. I was tempted to take a point of order but I thought I would hear what the honourable member had to say. However, it was really another red herring. </para>
          <para>Does the Opposition believe that the Government should allow the price of drugs to be inflated at the will of the industry and to heck with what the consumer, who, incidentally, is the taxpayer, has to pay for them? Such an interpretation is unworthy of any Party which claims to champion the public interest and which advocates an unrelenting attack on inflation and restraint on Government expenditure. I would have thought that the Opposition would have supported this Bill right up to the hilt on that point alone. The hypocrisy of the Opposition is all too apparent. If the Opposition is sincere in its statements that Government spending must be restrained, then it will fully support this Bill. If it is not just paying lip service to its statements that prices must not gallop ahead of the electorate's ability to pay, then it will support this BDI. The Government cannot sign a blank cheque on behalf of the taxpayers in the way that the Opposition when it was in office signed blank cheques to buy the F- 1 1 1 aircraft. </para>

That is a red herring if ever I have heard one. I want first of all to draw attention to a statement that was made this morning by Britain's Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. He said that 'too great a squeeze being placed on companies would result in lower profits and create more unemployment'. I think this is a very pertinent comment and that a very similar situation will no doubt arise if this Government is given the opportunity under this Bill to put the ringer just a little harder on the drug companies. I will develop that argument a little later on. </para>

If he knew what he was talking about, if he had a look at the figures as I will explain in a few moments in relation to a breakdown of the figures on total health expenditure for 1973-74, hie would know that drug companies in Australia are not making very high profits. Of course one must also consider the employment opportunities which drug companies provide, the fact that the drug manufacturing business can expand and thereby provide many more employment opportunities in this country. If you have capital invested in this industry, as many people have, obviously you want a return on your capital. I do not hear any Government supporter saying he will lend money to anybody without a reasonable return on his capital. I am not here to defend the large companies but surely they are entitled to make a profit for their shareholders. They are entitled to make a profit so that they can operate their business and provide employment for Australians. </para>

          <para>The urgency for this Bill appears to have arisen from the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices. As the Prices Justification Tribunal is now carrying out virtually the same function as the Prices Committee, I want to refer to a comment by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in November last year in relation to the Prices Justification Tribunal. He said:   to give particular attention to the problems of sustaining and stimulating an adequate level of private investment and maintaining rates of return on capital which will induce new investment required to maintain economic growth and employment. </para>
          <para class="block">That is the very point I was making a little earlier and the very point that Britain's Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson,</inline> made today. </para>
          <para>I want to refer to the Prices Committee. I am currently a member of this Committee. I was not a member of the Committee when it brought down the report containing the section referred to in the second reading speech delivered by the then Acting Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cass.</inline> I want to refer to this Committee because I believe that it is somewhat redundant. I also believe that the Prices Justification Tribunal has failed dismally in its attempts, has done nothing more than to produce a lot of extra unemployment and has created a lot of hardship in business in this country. I believe that the Prices Justification Tribunal should be abolished. In relation particularly to the personnel of the present Prices Committee, not the personnel at the time when this report was produced- I say this with due respect to my fellow parliamentarians who sit on this Committee is interesting to note that during one of the earlier meetings of the Committee I asked members of the Committee whether any of them had ever had any business experience. The answer, with the exception of myself, was that none of them had had any business experience. I do not subscribe to this view and do not suggest that if a person is going to be the Minister for Health he should be a doctor or he should be a lawyer if he were going to be the Attorney-General or an engineer if he were going to hold a portfolio that had something to do with Works. Nevertheless I believe that experience in a particular field can be an advantage. The point I make is that I believe that at least some of the personnel who comprise these committees should have experience and expertise in the subject that is being examined. </para>
          <para>As the Acting Minister for Health pointed out in the second reading speech, this Bill resulted from the report of the Prices Committee. The actual recommendation of the Committee was quoted by the Acting Minister who also went on to state that 80 per cent of all dispensed medicines are supplied under the provisions of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. So that is the basis upon which this Bill is now before us. In his second reading speech he also said that negotiations are currently carried out between departmental officers and the drug companies concerned. He said that in some instances there was a failure to achieve satisfactory prices. He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If a satisfactory price cannot be achieved an item may be removed from the list of pharmaceutical benefits. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He further stated that such de-listing may not, however, always be in the public interest because of the therapeutic value of a particular drug. It has been my experience, as a pharmacist for some 20 years, that no company wants its product to be de-listed. If a satisfactory price cannot be achieved, then the company has no alternative but to have the product removed. What the Government is saying is that it knows best how to run the pharmaceutical industry and, in particular, the company that applies for a drug to be listed. </para>
          <para>I want to dwell a little on quality. I believe that the quality of the drugs we receive in this country is extremely important and that no inferior drugs should be introduced. I believe that the Government would agree with that. Drug research is extremely important. It may not be quite so important in this country, but one has only to look overseas to realise that the large and reputable drug companies are providing the greater proportion of the new drugs that come on to the market. I mention them as distinct from a number of smaller companies- the backyard operators, as they are sometimes called- which in the main do very little research. </para>
          <para>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that 19 new drugs were introduced to medicine in the United States of America in 1973, and 13 of them were from American pharmaceutical companies' research. In 1974, 18 new drugs appeared in the United States, <inline font-style="italic">I2¥i</inline> from America and 12 were developed in American pharmaceutical companies. Of the 37 new drugs appearing in 1973-74, 35te were developed by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Twenty-six manufacturers were involved in the United States marketing of the 37 new drugs. It is notable that during that period no new drugs appeared from the socialist countries, other than Sweden- and its new drugs were developed earlier in a free enterprise society. </para>

Does the Government intend to require every supplier to supply the cost structure of all goods it purchases? Let us go outside the pharmaceutical field. Will the Government squeeze suppliers and manufacturers and cause the companies to face liquidity problems, to reduce their overheads and thereby add to the unemployment market? I wonder whether it will require companies overseas, perhaps those from which we purchase our defence equipment and aircraft, to produce detailed statements of all their costs. </para>

          <para>I want to refer for a moment to the dear image of pharmacy, because it is closely linked with this Bill. It is true that pharmacy in this country has a dear image. I believe that that image is not warranted. The public has gained the impression that all master pharmacists are rich. I can assure honourable members that that is not the case. It is interesting to note that at the moment hundreds of pharmacies in Australia are for sale and there are no buyers. It is also interesting to note that in the last few years hundreds of pharmacies in Australia have closed down. The manufacturers have been labelled as making excessive profits. </para>
          <para>In his second reading speech the then Acting Minister for Health referred to patented drugs and stated that the voluntary system had not always been successful in obtaining information from manufacturers on costs of patented drugs. Let me point out that in the vast majority of cases this information is supplied voluntarily to departmental officers. Let us look at this question of patented drugs. I mentioned a little earlier the numbers of new drugs that have been introduced in the United States. It is interesting to note the patent rights that are applied for and granted on the discovery of drugs. One must look at some of the wonderful advances we have seen over the past 20 or 30 years. I refer to antibiotics, penicillins, tetracyclines, antihistamines, antidepressant drugs and drugs to treat cardiac disease, just to name a few. These have been patented by the companies that have produced them. The discovery of and research into drugs is a highly expensive business. It requires expensive and complex equipment and highly skilled research personnel. I might add that countless thousands of drugs are developed which, when tested, are found to be not effective, perhaps unsafe or no more effective than existing drugs. Therefore, successfully developed new drugs are indeed rare. </para>
          <para>I ask: Who is to sit in judgment on the price received for these hard won patented drugs? Will it be the Minister for Health or some of his bureaucrats? After all, if this happens and if drug companies are to be screwed and squeezed to such an extent that they do not receive a reasonable return on their outlay, we are going to jeopardise drug research in the future. In my opinion drug research would grind to a halt in exactly the same way as oil and mineral search in this country has ground to a halt. I daresay that if the drug companies had a budget deficit in the order, proportionately, of this Government's Budget deficit it would be catastrophic for the industry. </para>
          <para>I want to go into the question of quality because I believe that is very important. It is important to the Government because we hear so much about improving the quality of life of those people who are less fortunate than many of us. I agree that we should endeavour to uplift the quality of life, particularly for those less fortunate people. Therefore, I find it difficult to reconcile the Government's attitude in this area. After all, it must be interested in quality. I would hope that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham),</inline> who is a medical practitioner, would be interested in the quality of the drugs that we bring on to the market in this country. It is a well known fact that if one reduces the price one often gets cheap and nasty goods. These cheaper brands are more likely to be of less therapeutic efficacy than those brands in respect of which greater care in manufacture is observed and more advanced techniques and better quality control are exercised. </para>
          <para>The extent to which active therapeutic agents are absorbed is influenced by many factors, which incidentally may be compounded. I take the example of tablets, which represent by far the greatest form of intake of drugs today. The table ting process is important because of the crystal size of the drug, the excipients or the inert substances that are added to facilitate the division of dosage and to allow for granulation prior to the table ting process, the method of the admixture of the drug in the excipients, the type of quality controls employed during stages of manufacture and, of course, the disintegration of the tablet in the stomach after it is taken- not to mention the experience of the personnel who produce the tablets and the developed technology that comes only with many years of experience. The time the drug takes to disintegrate and to be freed in the stomach is extremely important when a tablet is taken. I can cite examples of patients coming back to my shop and telling me that a certain enteric coated tablet that was designed to be swallowed and to disintegrate in the abdomen had not disintegrated but had passed through and come out in the faeces. The enteric coated processes and film, coated processes which are used by some companies are processes which have been developed over many years. It is important that in the selection of processes we do not disadvantage these companies by screwing and squeezing their profits to such a great extent. If we look at the generic medicines, as they are commonly referred to, we find that those companies which do not indulge in research tend to produce the bigger volume drugs which are the more profitable ones and leave research to the larger companies. I hope that the Minister for Health who is at the table will agree that quality control is of the utmost importance. </para>
          <para>Of course one must also look at brand prescribing. As the Minister no doubt appreciates doctors often brand prescribe selectively when prescribing medicines. We had an instance fairly recently where doctors and chemists were advised that a particular type of heart preparation should be adhered to according to the brand which the patient had been taking over a period of time. Although the dosage was the same in other brands they suggested it was wise to keep the patient on the brand to which he had become accustomed. If we look at the total expenditure for 1973-74 we find that a little over $3 billion was spent on health and yet prescription medicines required $299m. Of that amount the manufacturers' profit ended up at $10. 3m. The chemists' share was $107m and the wholesalers' share $24m. The manufacturers' share was $ 168m. It was interesting to note that on the previous year there was a fall from 3.6 per cent to 3.4 per cent in the manufacturers' profit in the total cost -of medicines. I believe we have to be extremely careful that we do not apply too many restrictions to drug manufacturers in this country because the country 's health is at stake. </para>

            <para>-I join in the debate on the National Health Bill (No. 3) because on reading the Bill and listening to the various speakers from the Government side I feel that one or two areas are being glossed over. In my opinion the Bill refers mainly to the monetary side of the drug industry. When one looks at that one hardly ever notices that the highest profit making and highest dividend issuing companies in Australia are the drug houses. I wonder what is the purpose behind this Bill. The honourable member for Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodges)</inline> quite adequately explained on the technical side how one of the most comforting things we have in this country is the fact that the drugs which are manufactured here are of a particularly high quality. This quality is brought about by the amount of money the companies concerned are able to put into their research and into the development of their products. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>High standards result because some capital is put back into the business. We are all well aware that at the present time it is very difficult for any business to find capital to put back into the business. It is difficult to understand just exactly what this is all about. The honourable member for Petrie mentioned the point of profit. Of course we accept- I am surprised that he did not mention this-that the socialists favour profits in companies. It is a rather staggering thing that they have acknowledged, but they have not worked out exactly what they mean. I do not think they really understand. It really means that if a company can make profits it can keep on going; it can actually keep operating and by doing so it can keep up its employment. I think the socialists ought to be looking at all of these things instead of trying to bring in rules and regulations which will bog down industry. I refer now to clause 3 of the Bill which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>After section 102 of the Principal Act, the following section is inserted . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I shall not read the whole clause. The relevant part states that the Director-General may call for such information as specified in the notice being information that is information with respect to financial matters in relation to the manufacture or distribution of the drug or medicinal preparation including information with respect to prices and costs. I believe that this is starting to eat at the very existence of the free enterprise system in this country. </para>
          <para>One wonders exactly what is behind the socialists ' emotional attitude that everyone in business is making millions of dollars at the cost of the rest of the community. As I said before, one does not see these people listed as providing the biggest dividends. Why are they not if they are making such huge profits? Surely the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> and his socialist government should take a reasonable attitude and try to promote the free enterprise system which has been the most successful way of producing goods in this country. The industries that are controlled by the Government cannot make profits. This has been proved. This leads me to the next interesting point. I believe this is the real crunch behind this Bill. I draw the attention of honourable members to section 11 of the platform of the Labor Party or the socialist party whichever way its members prefer to be called. Under the section dealing with health sub-section 1 7 reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The promotion of the manufacture, bulk purchase and wholesale distribution of pharmaceutical products through the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that members of the Labor Party have found some hitch in doing that and so they have purchased the Fawnmac company to overcome that problem. But really this is the real thrust of the Bill. It is the start of the whole scheme. The people of this country have to be alerted that any Bill that is put forward by this Government to start to get its meddling fingers into industry is the first step to nationalise that industry. There is no way in the world that this Government is not planning to take on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical goods. On that basis, the Opposition will oppose this Bill. I wanted to bring only that point forward. I felt it was a very relevant point. Sub-section 22 of the same Party platform reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The dispensing of prescriptions without direct charge to the patient . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again we have the same system. Everything is being built up for a total socialist system and we will oppose it. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The honourable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs Child)</inline> has covered most of the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Government's case in this matter. The initial speech of the Minister for the Media <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> as Acting Minister for Health outlined the intentions of this Bill when he presented it. I will confine myself to answering some of the points raised by members of the Opposition in support of their amendments. The honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd)</inline> mentioned, as did the other two speakers for the Opposition, the honourable member for Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodges)</inline> and the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier),</inline> the profitability aspect of drug manufacture in Australia and pointed out that the manufacturers' contributions to the cost of drugs in this country has actually fallen over the last 10 years while the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme escalated. The honourable member further pointed out how a firm was dipping out of production of penicillin manufactured by the Abbotts company. If one follows that logic I suppose one could say that the way things are going even without this Act that we are proposing it looks as though the poor pharmaceutical drug firms and drug manufacturers are going out of business. I suppose if one believes that sort of philosophy one will say that there is a cause for alarm in seeing something happen which will accelerate the failure of pharmaceutical manufacture in Australia. No responsible government wants to see that happen any more than it would like to see it happen to any other vital, essential and worthwhile industry in this country. We do not want to see it fail. Therefore I can assure the honourable members opposite that this is not the intention, nor the object, nor can it be the effect of the legislation- quite the reverse. </para>
          <para>If we can get better information, true information, on which to base proper estimates of the profitability of these companies- whether they are going to the wall, whether they will cease to produce these essential drugs- we will be in a far better position to ensure the very thing that they are asking us to ensure, namely, that we maintain the benefits of having this expertise in Australia, having the employment that results, having the technology, the continuity of supply and all these other benefits which are attributed to free enterprise. However, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories also takes a part in this. It provides technology, expertise, employment and continuity of supplies. That was the reason for setting it up. It has nothing to do with free enterprise as such. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, we recognise that there are some benefits in having free enterprise and competition. Otherwise why do we foster a 2-airlines policy? Why do we subsidise private medical practice? Why do we subsidise private retail chemists? This is the Medibank scheme, among others. We even subsidise private hospital accommodation in Australia at a liberal rate. So do not let it be said that because we are extending health benefits to a wider range of people without so much direct cost to the patient and the consumer we are trying to disturb, destroy or displace the private sector. On the contrary, we want to keep the private sector on its toes by giving it a dose of the very medicine that it is prescribing for us- free enterprise competition, fair competition, not unfair competition. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Murray said that it would be cheaper at times for us to buy on world markets. But if we always go for the cheapest item we will then be saddled with all the disadvantages that go with some of the cheap drug markets. Government purchasing officers are not fools. They are not dolts. They have been in the game for a long time under governments of many colours. They buy all sort of things, not only drugs and military hardware. They know this is not confined to the drug industry- that certainly if one always goes for the cheapest item one does not always get the best product, and it may end up dearer in the long run because one has used an inferior product. We know all this. It is a complete red herring to suggest that because we get more information of the true cost structure of these firms therefore we will thumb our noses at that information and say: 'We are not interested in the extra cost of your quality controls because we do not want quality controls; we want the cheapest product'. This is the reverse of the intention of the Bill. So the argument is against the very amendment that the honourable members opposite are proposing. </para>
          <para>The point about penicillin manufacture by Abbott Laboratories Pty Ltd being discontinued, leaving only one producer in Australia, which happens to be CSL, is not, to my mind, an argument that therefore we will have to double the subsidy to CSL or in some way dramatically increase the subsidy to CSL or have it stop production. It may be that CSL, like Abbotts, will decide within a year or some time of that order that it is not profitable to produce penicillin in Australia., If Abbotts is such a marvellous multinational corporation- I think it is; it has a very successful image in the free enterprise field and in the drug production field irrespective of private or public enterprise- why did it decide to close down production? Evidently because it saw that it was more profitable to buy its penicillin overseas and to have it produced overseas. </para>
          <para>If it is good enough for the goose it ought to be good enough for the gander. It ought to be good enough for CSL to make the same decision and say: 'It now appears because there are huge economies of scale to be obtained by Australia getting its penicillin overseas that CSL also will bow out of" the penicillin production field'. But CSL is not committed to doing that. I believe that it will not. I believe that through the updating procedures which are even now in train it will be able to manufacture fairly and competitively and continue in the future to export penicillin, which it has done in the past in the face of private enterprise competition both in this country and overseas, even though it may be importing some  during its retooling period. So that is not an argument for or against the Bill or for the amendment. If anything, it only reinforces the arguments of the Government. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Murray said that there is no clear policy, and that the Director-General and the three unknown people in the pricing bureau have expounded no clear policy on this Bill or the philosophy on which the Bill is based. I should have thought that it was pretty plain. The Acting Minister in his second reading speech made it pretty plain to me. Surely the crunch comes in the extract he read from the first report in November 1973 of the Joint Committee on Prices- a joint committee, not a Government committee; it has Opposition members on it too- which stated that the National Health Act should be amended to allow the Department of Health to obtain cost and financial information in respect of products in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Although a couple of speakers referred to that report, to my mind none of them gave a convincing answer to why that is not a good enough reason. They have not canvassed the reason put by the Committee. </para>
          <para>Let me state briefly the reasons as I see them. The Department depends at the moment on negotiations with the drug manufacturers to arrive at what is considered by both sides to be a fair pricing return for drugs and medicinal preparations listed as pharmaceutical benefits. This is its duty in the public interest, when 80 per cent of prescriptions are in the pharmaceutical benefits listing. Those negotiations have not always been successful. The multi-national corporations particularly are a little shy about these things. They say: 'You want all this information. We will give it to you if you pass a law'. Surely that is the very reason the Government is seeking to pass a law. The honourable member said that there is already a trend in these firms to give the Government the information, so why does the Government want to force them. The answer is that that trend has its limits. Some of the firms say: 'Pass the law and then we will give you the information'. That is why the voluntary system will not work. </para>
          <para>The honourable member said also that overall profitability is not taken into account when the Government is looking at the pricing of individual products. He cannot have it both ways. Either he wants to give the Government power to get information on the particular products it is considering for listing or has listed as pharmaceutical benefits, or he wants to give the Government power to get all the information about all the financial transactions of all these manufacturers world wide. Now, which one is it that the honourable member wants? If he wants to bring in an amendment to look after that aspect, then his amendment should be that the terms of reference for the information available should be widened to state: 'We want to know all about your financial affairs world wide, not just information that bears on the pricing of possible pharmaceutical benefits.' The honourable member did not say that. He just said that the Government is not going to take it into consideration. In fact the Government does. I have met with representatives of the pharmaceutical manufacturers and we have assured them that we are interested in pricing in a total context; we are interested in the survival of the industry; we are interested in maintaining expertise and continuity of supplies, in a reasonable degree of competition to keep people on their toes and to keep quality as a factor. The Government is interested in all these factors, but it has not written them into the Bill because if it did another amendment would be moved to restrict the information that can be made available under the Act. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. </para>
          <para>The next point is that the honourable member said that there is no provision for confidentiality. This is not so. Confidentiality of information which is obtained under this Bill is provided for under an existing section of the Act. I draw the honourable member's attention to section 135A of the National Health Act. This came into operation on 1 February of this year. It is very broad. It applies to any person who has acquired any information by reason of his office or employment under the Act. It prohibits any such person from divulging or communicating to another, either directly or indirectly, any information so acquired which concerns the affairs of another except in the performance of a duty or exercise of a function under the Act. The exercise of his function under this proposed new section will be purely for pricing for pharmaceutical benefits purposes. It will have nothing to do with giving information to Fawnmac. It will have nothing to do with giving information to CSL. It will have nothing to do with giving an unfair advantage to public enterprises over private enterprises. </para>
          <para>The information obtained under proposed new section 102a will be squarely within the terms of section 135a. The honourable member should revise his opinion. Stringent penalties are provided. The penalty for disclosure in breach of the section is a fine of up to $ 1,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months. To ensure compliance with section 135a by the officers concerned, access to information obtained within my Department will be very limited. In fact, it is now very limited- so much so, that the honourable member cannot even say who the officers are. Most of the drug firms cannot say who the officers are either, though they may suspect. Even the identity of the officers has, so far, remained confidential. </para>
          <para>I am advised that disclosure of this confidential information to Fawnmac or CSL would incur this penalty. In view of the honourable member's statement that some firms now disclose the information needed for price negotiations then he and the drug firms whose cause he espouses ought to be reassured by the fact that neither CSL nor Fawnmac has benefited in the past from this voluntarily tendered information obtained for the Department by the officers of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Bureau. If it has remained confidential in the past, why should it not in the future? Why is the honourable member prepared to say that he supports detailed investigation of the affairs of companies by taxation officers- he says that is good practice and he supports it- yet he is not prepared to have a similar and confidential investigation by officers of the Pricing Bureau of the Department of Health which has to disperse the public money that the Taxation Office collects? Why is it all right to trust the taxation officers with confidential information in taking tax money off the companies when it is not all right to trust officers of the Department of Health who are going to give tax money back to the companies? </para>

              <para>- They are the pricing officers. They belong to the Pricing Bureau of the Department of Health. I think the confidentiality issue is another red herring. The honourable member for Murray then said that there is no independent arbitrator. I do not know how independent he wants these things to be. I would have thought that conscientious, dedicated and long-serving officers as these men are- they are senior officers- would have been independent to the extent that at least they are entrusted with negotiating for the Government as buyer with independent firms as sellers. Although they do pay for more than 80 per cent of the prescriptions written in this country, that is not a monopoly. There is still an open market for drug firms whose items are not listed as pharmaceutical benefits and which doctors, dentists and whoever else prescribes drugs can prescribe. They do not have to prescribe even the drugs listed as pharmaceutical benefits. They are not bound legally to prescribe them as pharmaceutical benefits. They can be prescribed outside the Government subsidy scheme and paid for by the patient. </para>

              <para>- I am making the point because there is an independent arbitrator available for the drugs that are outside the pharmaceutical benefit schemes the drugs which we will de list if ever we de list any. I do not think it has ever happened. Those drugs do have an independent arbitrator available in the Prices Justification Tribunal. But there is no consistency in the Opposition on this matter. The honourable member who has just interjected said that the Prices Justification Tribunal should be abolished, it is a waste and it has caused a lot of misery. The honourable member who preceded him in the debate is asking for an independent arbitrator. Which does the Opposition want? It cannot have it both ways. </para>

              <para>- The position is that I believe that the members of the Department entrusted with negotiating these prices are the appropriate people to do it just as the Prices Justification Tribunal is the appropriate body to adjudicate on pharmaceutical substances and preparations which are not listed as pharmaceutical benefits. I cannot see that one can be any more independent, any more reliable, or any more just than the other. If that is really what the honourable gentleman opposite wanted, why did he not move his amendment in terms that would have provided that where there is a dispute the matter be referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal? I submit that he did not do so not because he really wants another avenue of appeal, another arbitrator who is more independent, but because he wants to stop the Bill. </para>

I think that was the most honest comment that any member of the Opposition made. It is not the first step to nationalising; the first step to nationalising was taken with the establishment of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. That was a good step; it was never reversed in 23 years by our opponents. </para></speech>

            <para>-This Bill seeks to amend the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement. It has been hailed in quarters, which I may describe without offence as Australian Labor Party quarters, as representing something in the nature of a coup for the Party and for the Government. I will deal with that assertion later. It may be useful to remind ourselves that the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement has a fascinating history. Before I turn to that history and to the amendments as such, may I presume to remind the House that the Agreement stems from the obligations which this country has under the ANZUS Treaty. The schedule to the original Agreement states: </para>

We do well to remind ourselves that when that Agreement was introduced it was bitterly opposed by the Labor Party.

          <para>Various asseverations were made by members of the then Opposition- members of the Labor Party- to the effect that when the Party became the government the base would be shut down. I will deal later with the present policy on that matter. To give some idea of the attitudes of the day- to recall what were the attitudes in 1963- may I presume to remind the House that one honourable member of the Australian Labor Party said of the communications station: </para>

There was, in short, bitter opposition to the establishment of the base. Has the attitude of the Party which now forms the Government of the country changed? The simple, short answer is no. The attitude of the Government, of the Australian Labor Party, is a continuing one of opposition to the base. I cite the Australian Labor Party's platform, constitution and rules as approved by the 31st National Conference at Terrigal in 1975. It says: </para>

              <para>- I will come to the matter of joint control later. I suspect that what I say will be somewhat to the discomfort of my honourable friend because, far from seeking to give joint control, the amendment does absolutely nothing of the sort. There are to be 3 amendments to the agreement. Before I deal with them I remind the House that as recently as 1973 the Prime Minister described the communications base at the North West Cape as- mark the description- obnoxious. Indeed, many of his followers have repeated virtually the same sentiment. If something is obnoxious I should have thought that it would have been highly proper, depending upon one's assessment that that is the case, to seek to do something about it. So some time ago the Minister's predecessor was sent to the United States of America to renegotiate the agreement. He went with a great fanfare and with sustained applause from the country. He returned with applause as though he had achieved something of great moment.  His  achievement is to be found in the amendments to the agreement. It is the 3 amendments to which I now turn. I will take first the third one, which seems to be quite beyond not dispute as such but contention or argument. That is the amendment to article 14 which provides that costs incurred directly by the Australian Government on behalf of its armed forces shall, in short, be met. The only amendment to article 14 is the insertion of those words. So there can be no argument that that confers any form of control over the base. That provision deals with amendments concerning costs and costs only. </para>

          <para>The principal amendment is to article 1, which reads as follows: </para>

            <para>In accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement, the United States Government may establish, maintain and operate a Naval Communication Station (in this Agreement called the 'Station') at North West Cape in the State of Western Australia. </para>

          <para class="block">Precisely nothing is said there about control of the facility. The amendment simply states that the station shall be operated as a joint facility.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The simple fact of life is that no extension of control over the base is provided for. The right of the United States Government to have access to the national room- in short, the right of the United States Government to have access to the highly classified messages which are sent- has not been altered one iota. These 3 amendments represent nothing short of a form of political bromide for the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. The Government is taking the view that the facility will be jointly controlled when it wil be nothing of the sort. The national room of the United States at the base remains one of exclusive occupancy. </para>

              <para>- Yes, exactly. As the honourable member for Lilley suggests, why does the Government not have the courage to declare its policy? Why does it seek to amend the Agreement? Why not seek to rescind it? Both the Liberal and the National Country parties take the view that the base is of prime importance to the integrity and to the safety of this country. We have a responsibility under the ANZUS agreement and that responsibility will be respected immaculately by the Opposition parties, more particularly if we have the opportunity to respect them as parties in government. So I say to the Minister that if he takes the view that he has sedated the more robust and rumbustious elements of his Party by amending the Agreement in these terms, all I can say is that the capacity of those members to understand is even more limited than I have hitherto suspected. This does not alter the control of the base at all. The authority for that is not merely a simple reading of the language concerned but the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> who acknowledges the existence of national occupancy- exclusive occupancy- of the national room. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I sum up simply by saying this: The base is of vital importance to this country. It was established pursuant to the ANZUS Agreement. The ANZUS Agreement is of the utmost importance to this country. Unlike other agreements it is not possible for any nation to get specific performance of an alliance, of a treaty arrangement of this kind. The only thing that one can cash in the ultimate is goodwill. I am bound to say, looking at the record of the Australian Labor Party in terms of cultivating goodwill with the United States of America- not in terms of civility but in terms of mutual respect- that it is an appalling record. Insult after insult has been handed out by Ministers in a Labor government. There has been no attempt to be reasonable or to be rational. As far as the Opposition Parties are concerned, we do not make the slightest apology in acknowledging the importance of the ANZUS Agreement to this country and we do not offer the slightest apology in acknowledging the fact that pursuant to that Agreement stem responsibilities. If one does not have responsibilities under an agreement, the agreement is worthless. If one is not prepared to respond to responsibilities there is no point in entering into an agreement. It is a matter of public record that the Labor Party has committed itself to the policy attitude that all bases in Australia should be shut down.

              <para>- I am sure that the honourable member was paid handsomely, but judged by our measure probably too extravagantly. Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign owned, controlled or operated bases or facilities in Australia. The amendment put forward by the Labor Party is a simple illustration of the fact that here is a party that has lost the capacity and the courage to follow publicly what it declares by way of policy statements. Here was a splendid opportunity, if the Labor Party were consistent and really believed in what it was declaring, to say: 'We will seek to rescind the agreement'. But instead of that we have this craven attitude seeking to quieten down the more rowdy elements within the Party. </para>

The Opposition does not raise any objection to the Bill as such but it does point to the fact that the amendments do not in any way at all alter the essential character of the agreement and any assertion to the contrary is not merely false; it is a sheer pretence. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-It is very interesting to follow the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> in the debate on the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement Bill 1 975 which we have before us. Last night he was dealing with a Bill in which the test of loyalty was the association with the Commonwealth. Today we are dealing with a Bill in which the test of loyalty is the continuation of the defence association with the United States. The honourable member acted in the role of an agent provocateur. Although he said that the Opposition would not oppose the Bill, he was obviously intent on provoking difficulties for the Government by trying to persuade some supporters of the Government to accept the view that the Bill before the Parliament was not in accordance with Australian Labor Party policy. Although he was paying lip service to the ANZUS Treaty, he was trying to destroy that treaty. He was acting to provoke bad relations and ill-will between Australia and the United States. I do not think that any of these roles should commend themselves to the honourable member. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He dealt with the Labor Party policy, and he said that at the time when this agreement was first negotiated in 1963 members of the Labor Party said that the base would be shut down. I was in the Parliament at that time, and I well recall the then Leader of the Opposition, the former right honourable member for Melbourne, the late Arthur Calwell, making it quite clear that in the event of a Labor Party government being returned this agreement would be renegotiated. If there is one thing that stands out above everything else, it is that this is a responsible Government. We do not repudiate agreements made by our predecessors. It would not be in Australia's interest that we should do so. It would not be in accordance with the Labor Party platform or with the importance which the Labor Party places on the ANZUS Treaty that we should do so. The then Leader of the Opposition, the late Arthur Calwell, and the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> made it quite clear in policy speeches and on other occasions that the agreement would be renegotiated to conform with the Labor Party platform, and of course that is what has happened. Perhaps I should read those parts of the Labor Party platform. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Labor Party seeks close and continuing co-operation with the people of the United States and New Zealand to make the ANZUS Treaty an instrument for justice and peace and political, social and economic advancement in the Pacific area. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I think one should say that the Labor Party has always been a strong supporter of the ANZUS Treaty. Although we would all pay a tribute to the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Spender in negotiating the ANZUS Treaty in 195 1, it was the former Labor Government through <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> the then honourable member for Barton and Minister for External Affairs, who tried in the post-war years to persuade the United States to enter into a Pacific pact. The record is quite clear. It was the Labor Party's intention that such a pact should be brought about. The then Minister for External Affairs worked very hard, but in those immediate post-war years when the United States was preoccupied with events in Europe- of course they loomed very seriously in those days- the climate was not right. In the circumstances of the Japanese peace treaty, pacts were entered into between the United States and the Philippines the so-called Phil Us Pact-and between the United States, Australia and New Zealand- the ANZUS Pact. So the climate became right. </para>
          <para>I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies in his book <inline font-style="italic">Afternoon Light</inline> said that he took great pride in the fact that he was the Leader of the Government which negotiated the ANZUS Treaty. When that Treaty came before this Parliament it was supported by the Australian Labor Party. I do not recall, in my time in the Labor Party since 1946 and in this House since 1961, that any responsible leader of the Labor Party has attacked the ANZUS Treaty. It is extremely valuable to us in Australia not only because of the fact that through the due constitutional process the United States would come to our aid or we would go to its aid in the event of an attack on our territory, or on our sea vessels, or on our commercial aircraft, or on our other aircraft for that matter, but also because of the intimate association with the United States which this Treaty facilitates. It is also valuable because of the regular consultations that take place and the frank exchange of views on a basis of confidentiality. This indicates what the ANZUS Treaty has meant to Australia in terms of our access to American weapons of war, in terms of American intelligence and the technology that has become available to us through the presence of American installations on our soil, and in terms of the interchange of information which takes place not only between serving defence personnel, but between defence scientists and the like. So I would hope that nothing that anybody in this House does tonight does any damage to the continuation of the ANZUS Treaty which is vital as far as the people of Australia are concerned. It is against that background that this Bill comes before the Parliament. </para>
          <para>I think that all members of this Parliament and certainly members of the Government should express their appreciation for the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marshall</inline> Green, the former United States Ambassador to Australia. I would not disagree that when he was appointed as Ambassador to Australia, the position between Australia and the United States was a fairly sensitive one as far as foreign affairs were concerned. I think we would all agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marshall</inline> Green worked in the interests of his own country and ours to bring about a better understanding of the position of the then newly elected Australian Government. We owe him a great debt. I think we ought to state publicly the good work that he did not only for his country but for ours. </para>
          <para>So it was that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence went to the United States to discuss the operation of the United States Naval Communications Station. This agreement was entered into in 1963 and it had 25 years to run. Commensurate with the fact that the United States regarded the station as vital to its communications with its naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere, the agreement which is enshrined in this Bill takes the situation of that station as far as it could be taken by negotiation to meet the requirements of the Labor Party platform. </para>
          <para>I think it is fair to say that the presence of any installation on our soil to some extent impairs our sovereignty. Some people could take an extreme point of view and say: 'Well, away with all these installations'. We would live in a fairly lonely world if that were done. It is probably true to say that the agreement will not meet the wishes of all the people. Certainly it will not meet the wishes of those who might wish to see these installations removed. But there is one thing that is certainly true: This Bill provides that there will be no alteration until 1988 in the terms of the agreement relating to the United States Naval Communications Station at North West Cape which is absolutely vital to the continued association of Australia and the United States within the ANZUS Treaty. I, together with other members and the former member for Bass and former Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> was a member of the Labor Party's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence when these matters were reported to the Party. There was unanimous agreement that the arrangement which increased Australia's control over that radio station was a very satisfactory one. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will recall the second reading speech of the then Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> when he introduced this Bill. It referred to the fact that increased numbers of personnel had taken up duty at the station. The Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An Australian Deputy Commander took up duty at North West Cape on 19 July 1974 while a Royal Australian Navy contingent of 47 officers and men will be posted to the station before the end of next month. Fourteen of these will man the Australian communications centre. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The new agreement makes this centre a joint naval communications centre in a way which did not apply in the past. I think it is a very sound piece of legislation. It certainly is very much in the interests of Australia. I hope fervently that in this debate honourable members do not try to exacerbate differences about this station in the Australian community. There are divergences on matters like this just as there are divergences on matters without a defence significance. There are divergences about the proposal to set up an Omega station in Australia for navigational purposes. It is important that these matters be discussed intelligently and without rancour in this Parliament and in the community. Discussions on differences that may have existed in the Labor Party have taken place and members, probably almost without exception, are satisfied with the arrangement that has been brought down. </para>
          <para>I commend this Bill to the House. I believe that the naval communications station, overtaken in some ways as it has been by more recent developments in communications, still has a useful role to play in the future. It is a vehicle of communication not only with the vessels of the United States of America but also with vessels of the Royal Australian Navy. The presence of Australian Service personnel at North West Cape in addition to the presence of Australian civilians working in the station make it a joint effort in a way which did not apply under the agreement of the previous Government. I think I should say about the agreement entered into by the previous Government that it paid scant regard for Australian sovereignty. The debate that took place back in 1963 greatly neglected some of those issues. I thought that the previous Government sold out too cheaply at that time in the sense that it was not prepared to take into account Australian sovereignty. I think that the Bill before us now does that as well as it may be done at the present time. All of us on the Government side of the chamber look forward to a continued happy association with the United States within the framework of the defence treaty, particularly the ANZUS Treaty which is such an important part of the Labor Party platform. </para>

            <para>-The remarks of supporters of the Government participating in this debate in both the Senate and apparently in this House make interesting reading. There are few honourable members on this side of the House who do not hold the honourable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cross)</inline> in deep respect and high regard. I think it fair to say, if I might use ideological banter, that he is a member of the moderate section of the Labor Party, if not a shade to the right of that. In the Senate little was heard about this Bill from the left of the Labor Party. From looking at the list of speakers in this House there is not one other member of the Labor Party listed to speak. The honourable member for Brisbane has filled in and has put the viewpoint of the respectable right. The wayward left are not to be heard. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, with the greatest respect to the honourable member for Brisbane I want, by way of introduction, to take up certain points. There are only a few minutes left before the sitting will be suspended so I will go into the detail of my speech on resumption. The honourable member for Brisbane said, first of all, that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> would not have repudiated this agreement. Nevertheless the reality is that in March 1973 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> specifically described the earlier agreement that we are debating today as obnoxious. In March 1973 this headline appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Pictorial:</inline></para>

            <para>The North- West Cape Base agreement with the United States was obnoxious, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> said yesterday.

          <para class="block">That is a fine way to continue building up that reservoir of goodwill that the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> so aptly referred to when discussing what was necessary for an alliance to be properly effective. Secondly, the honourable member for Brisbane said that ANZUS is extremely valuable. He said that no leader, or respectable leader- responsible leader is what I think he said- of the Australian Labor Party has ever suggested to the contrary. If we hold to the maxim <inline font-style="italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius,</inline> I do not know how we can describe the position of  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Labor Party lately removed from the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns).</inline> The reality is that the honourable member for Lalor is  chairman  of a body that is actively seeking non alignment for this country. The reality is that those who follow the foreign policies espoused by the honourable member for Lalor are those who wish to see the alliance between the United States of America and Australia torn asunder. </para>

              <para>-I am sorry, it is 1988. 1 suppose one would have to be among the ranks of the most optimistic in Australia to assume that honourable gentlemen opposite will be in government at that time, but they are speaking on behalf of the Australian people at this moment and the assumption is made that an agreement already existing can be curtailed. I would have thought the prudent course of action by any person, irrespective of ideology, would have been to assume that the agreement should run to its date of destination, 1988, and to assess the circumstances then- the requirement for security, the requirements for communication. That is the very least. </para>

          <para>I have already referred in passing to the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Moreton in opening the debate for the Opposition when he referred to the question of goodwill and at the same time to the reality that there have been frequent occasions upon which the goodwill existent between the United States and Australia has been either jeopardised or exacerbated. The fact is that it does not matter how many agreements one may have with another country. The ANZUS agreement is only one of over 100 agreements existing between Australian and the United States. It is unquestionably the most important, but it is only one of more than 100 agreements. What the honourable gentleman said was quite correct. The value of any alliance is ultimately dependent on the reservoir of goodwill that exists between the member states to that alliance. The insults, the denigration, the constant calling into question of the value of that alliance, must have jeopardised that reservoir of goodwill to a substantial extent. </para>

          <para>MrPEACOCKContinuing the debate on the United States Naval Communications Station Agreement Bill, it will be recalled that I was mentioning the matters raised by the honourable member for Brisbane prior to the suspension of the sitting and in particular those matters that the honourable member for Moreton as our Shadow </para>
          <para class="block">Minister for Defence concluded on, namely, that what really counts in relations between nations is the reservoir of goodwill that exists, not the formal documents alone. I said that there are more than 100 agreements between the United States and ourselves and that of paramount importance amongst those is the ANZUS Agreement. I mentioned that what the honourable member for Moreton had said was quite correct. If that reservoir of goodwill is jeopardised or depleted, those formal words are not of the same impact and are not of the same importance. They cannot be called upon with the same degree of surety at a given moment of time. That reservoir has to be great and continuing. </para>
          <para>May I say here on a question of foreign policy, that this points to an essence of foreign policy that is often overlooked. It is not necessarily relations between governments that is important, but the relationship between the peoples of the countries concerned is of the utmost importance. How would we have felt if we were reading day after day of attacks being made on our government by a neighbouring country such as were made on the Government of the United States time and again by this Government? I just mention as an aside my pleasure in seeing the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> at the table. I remarked earlier that the left had been deliberately quiet on this matter. </para>

It will be recalled that in 1961 the Liberal-Country Party Government was returned, and properly so, but with a very narrow majority. Also as an aside I mention that on that occasion as a student I stood against the now honourable member for Lalor who was then the member for Yarra. I remember carving into his vote to a substantial extent. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Moreton and I were on a campaign together. However, in 1963, our majority on that previous occasion having been narrowed to an effective majority of one, we went to the polls. But shortly before going to the polls, an historic photograph was taken. That photograph revealed the then Leader of the Opposition, the late Rt.  Hon.  Arthur Calwell, and the then  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> waiting outside the Kingston Hotel for their instructions from the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party on what their reaction ought to be to the establishment of the North West Cape. We know what the reaction was. We know what the decision was. They were told by the then faceless men to question the establishment of the base- the base to which the present Prime Minister only 2 years ago referred as being obnoxious. That throws back to the vote of the Federal Conference in 1963, when he was waiting for his instructions. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>How much has this obnoxious Agreement been changed? How much has the so-called independent and influential foreign policy of the Labor Government changed this allegedly obnoxious Agreement? This Bill provides for 3 amendments to the Agreement. Are they gigantic or simple? The conclusion can only be the latter. The first amendment is to Article 1 of the Agreement. It provides that the base will be operated jointly. Secondly, the amendment to Article 2 limits United States control to the exclusive occupation of a national room. Those who have visited North West Cape have known for years that the only area that even the general public could not visit was that particular room, yet this is designated in the so-called amendments. The third amendment to this obnoxious Agreement, in the words of another, is to Article 14. It limits the Australian financial commitment to the cost associated with the location of elements of the Royal Australian Navy at the station. The substance of this Agreement is hardly altered at all. The honourable member for Moreton made that point. We made that point time and time again when the Agreement was renegotiated by the former Minister for Defence and Ambassadordesignate. </para>
          <para>The reality is that when the North West Cape Agreement was first formulated we welcomed it. The North West Cape base relays messages to submarines, surface ships and other bases. It initiates no commands, but it does relay commands. The station is a vital component of the United States' defence communications and also of Australia's communications. After all, Australia uses the North West Cape base for communication with its own submarines. At present, as I understand it, 25 per cent of the station's time is devoted to Australian naval needs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> the then Minister for Defence, and the United States Secretary of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Schlesinger,</inline> saw the status of the station as a bilateral arrangement in the framework of the ANZUS Treaty words that must have been written for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> by members of the Opposition Parties fundamental to the ANZUS alliance, fundamental to the ANZUS Treaty and a part of the bilateral arrangement between 2 countries which share a common approach to the world's problems today as stronger members of the Western industrialised democracies. The United States has been assured, evidently, by the Labor Government and by the Prime Minister that the Labor Government will honour this Agreement. </para>
          <para>I referred earlier, and I must do so again more than 2 hours later, to what the Prime Minister had said at one stage about that Agreement- not just the reference to it as being obnoxious in former terms, but the fact that he had said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We do not favour the extension or prolongation of any of the existing agreements. The Agreement stands but there will not be any extensions or proliferations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I will not develop the point any further than I did earlier, other than to say that to say in 1975 that irrespective of the circumstances a Labor Government will not renegotiate an agreement or that it will not extend it irrespective of the circumstances existent in 1988 is crass stupidity, to put it at its mildest. Irrespective of the security situation, irrespective of the arrangements into which we have entered, irrespective of the threats that may exist at that time, irrespective of the global problems facing the world, the Labor Party says 13 years before the curtailment or cessation of an agreement that under no circumstances will it extend it. What sort of delinquent action is that? It is a response to ideological motivation rather than a realistic assessment of foreign policy. </para>
          <para>The importance of the North West Cape for Australia is that it is- we will state it frankly and we will not run away from it- a cornerstone of Australia's security. It rests on the ANZUS alliance, as has been recognised by the Prime Minister. On occasions we have even had rhetoric from the Prime Minister. For example, in January 1973 he said that Labor had a mandate and a duty to maintain the American alliance. The man must be a human hiccup or some other form of arrangement who goes to and fro from time to time, if he can say that on the one hand and yet on the other hand describe it as obnoxious. Maybe he is simply a humanised form of the well known yo-yo. </para>

              <para>- Our friend interjects with a policy of love as the fundamental principle of foreign affairs. It befits him well. The Agreement serves to keep a super power, that to which we are allied, in the area until such time as detente is achieved. I stress now the importance of Diego Garcia in this context. Let us look at the Labor Party's platform and policies. We know that certain segments of the Labor Party are opposed to alignment. They are led particularly by the honourable member for Lalor, and I think maybe even the Minister for the Capt al Territory may proffer a viewpoint that a non-aligned foreign policy is in Australia 's interests. Certainly the honourable member for Lalor does. Secondly the Australian Labor Party says that we should have a nuclear free zone in the Indian Ocean. </para>

Is not the Government permitting the naval base to develop there? Is that not in consistence? If the Government alleges that it believes in an American alliance- it says it does but it does little to prove it- and if it then opposes the expansion of a logistic support base at Diego Garcia, it is, in racing parlance, trying to ride 2 horses in different directions at the one time, and it cannot be done.

            <para>- The transportation of the honourable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> from a place on the right of the  Speaker  to the left of the  Speaker  does not seem to have moved him any closer to 1975. He talks in the cliches of the past 15 or 20 years. He talks about a reservoir of good will to our friends in the world, but for some mysterious reason according to him our friends of the world include a small proportion only of the countries of the world. We hold a totally different view of Australia's relationships with the other countries on this globe. We believe that we have to establish good working relationships with all governments and all peoples, regardless of their politics. We do not like the politics of many of them. However, we recognise the fact that the world is made up of a large number of independent units and nations and that every one of them has its place in the new world of the 1970s. But it is not the world of the past in which the ANZUS Treaty was written. Some of its principles still appertain, of course, because there are nations with whom we have such a close affinity that it is absolutely essential that we retain that affinity. We can always expect them to be friendly towards us in times of peril or need, although times of peril and need seem to be occurring less often in this decade than they did in the past. Unfortunately our friends opposite always like to live as though the peril were just around the corner. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Honourable members will remember the leaflets that the Liberal Party put out during the 1966 election asking where we were going to stop the downward thrust of communism. The honourable member for Kooyong is still thinking in those old cliches here tonight. The Australian Government does not attack the United States Government. It reserves its right to have opinions about the policies of other nations. It reserves its right to express opinions about other nations which abut our own. Opposition members talk as though they might act as a partner with the United States of America, and of course they can not. They prefer not to be just the junior partner, but more often a satellite. The North West Cape communications station is a direct product of the previous Government's acting as a satellite in foreign affairs- not acting as innovators or being self-reliant on independent. The Australian Labor Party has always held a very strong view about foreign bases and facilities. The party's platform says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Labor <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> opposed to the existence of foreign-owned, controlled or -operated bases and facilities in Australian territory, especially if such bases involve a derogation from Australian sovereignty. </para>
            <para>Labor is not opposed to the use of Australian bases and facilities by Allies in war-time, or in periods of international tension involving a threat to Australia, provided that Australian authority and sovereignty are unimpaired, and provided that Australia is not involved in hostilities without Australia 's consent. </para>
            <para>The tenure of these bases and facilities by other powers should not be of such a character as to exclude properly accredited access by authorised Australians charged with the duty of evaluating Australian defence policy, whether members of the Australian Parliament, defence departments or armed services. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Tonight we are discussing a relic of the previous Government, one of its worst aberrations, one of its most mischievous operations, one of the more malevolent aberrations of its foreign policy, one of the inflictions upon Australia which could well have involved us in war and destruction without any possibility of intervention on our behalf. It was the final product of the previous Government's total deficiency in foreign policy in the 1 950s and 1 960s. My friend from Kooyong asks: Why is it obnoxious?' It is obnoxious because if offends the very principles on which the Labor Party has always approached its duties to the nation and its relationships with the rest of the world. Australian sovereignty and authority over any part of our territory must not be impaired. This agreement as originally written abdicated our responsibilities and our sovereignty. </para>
          <para>I must address myself to one or two other points made by the honourable member for Kooyong. The first is in relation to Diego Garcia. This is another relic of the past. It is a flow-on from previous relationships that developed between the United States of America and Russia and their attitude to China. I believe, as most of the nations around the Indian Ocean believe, that this base is irrelevant today. It adds nothing to the security of the area to establish bases throughout the Indian Ocean. We ought to attempt to persuade the leaders of both nations involved- the Americans and the Russians- to retire gracefully to nearer their own homelands. The honourable member asked whether the </para>
          <para class="block">Government is in favour of alignment. The Government is not neutral but is chooses its own friends and it chooses the time and place for its commitments. In the modern world there is no possibility of establishing a commitment which could still be valid in 13 years time. The Government reserves its right to make commitments as the time and place warrant. So to that extent we are unaligned. We are unaligned with other people's errors. We are aligned with other people's needs, other people's rights and other people's duties. We reserve our right to be self reliant and independent in foreign policies. </para>
          <para>But we also honour the obligations imposed upon us by the past. We still accept the agreement which was written by our predecessors. We recognise that it is necessary for this Government to continue the agreements of the past. We have no intention to dishonour our obligations that flow from them, no matter how much we may disagree with them. I think that that is probably the message of tonight for the Australian people. At the time when this agreement was written, the Australian Labor Party was opposed to it. Many of us in the Labor Party regarded it as a fundamental abdication of our rights and our duties. It placed us in an impossible position in foreign affairs. We made no apology for our attitude then and we make no apology for our attitude now. The history of the Australian Labor Party's attitude in foreign affairs is a history of attempting to escape from the shackles of the past and the obsessions and inhibitions of the Opposition. In the past we were always seen to be dependent on somebody. In the first 40 or 50 years of this century, it was the British. In the last 20 or 30 years, it was supposed to be the United States of America. We always rejected this role of dependence and we always will reject it. Our attitude is to be self reliant and dependent and to be ready wherever we are involved. </para>

Of course, they find it easier to buy goods overseas and get their foreign policies from other countries. They are totally dependent on others for their foreign policy. During the 20 years that I have been a member of this House I do not recall one sensible, independent, constructive contribution on foreign policy from any of the honourable members opposite. They were always continuing the <inline font-style="italic">cliches</inline> of the past. If they could get them from some text book written in America or from the speech of some American President, that is what they would do. They have had a total misunderstanding of the world situation. Of course, they say in 1975 that the threats that appeared to exist in 1945 and 1955 are still with us. When will they look at the world as it stands in 1975? This is a totally different world and they know it. They find it much more useful and much easier to try to stir the threats of fear and hysteria of the past and try to capitalise on them politically. </para>

That would be well enough were we so totally involved in America's commitment that we should accept not only the commitment to America but also the punishment that may flow from any strategic errors which that country perpetrated. The Americans set out to establish a global weapons system. They saw the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the threat of the 1950s and the early 1960s. Of course, subsequently they chose to see the People's Republic of China also as a threat. I believe that history shows and with hindsight - </para>

The facts are that once we allowed this base to be established on Australian shores we became the target for any counter-action by the Russians against anything the Americans could do. We placed ourselves in a situation where we could have been involved in a war or a war-like action without any possibility of intervention on our part and without any possibility of our preventing that happening to us. Perhaps we could even be held as hostage because we would be much more expendable than the cities of America. </para>

I can have no respect for the people who initiated it, or who sponsored it, or who still support it. I believe they did a great disservice to the Australian people and to Australia's role in the world. The original agreement which was signed meant that we accepted a total involvement in any conflict between, in all probability, either Russia and America or America and China.

              <para>- I said earlier, and I repeat it for the slow learners opposite, that this Government is prepared to honour those agreements, even those the contents of which they abhor. We have no intention whatsoever of departing from our duty as the representatives of Australia in this regard. When the agreement was written 12 or 13 years ago many of us held the view that no government was entitled to allow its writ to run for so much longer than the charter which comes with an election. We are all elected for 3 years. That is a reasonable charter. Beyond that we are making hostages for the future. Of course it is unreasonable to impose a strict limit of 3 years on any agreement which the Government may make. But I think the 25 years which was involved in this agreement was quite conscienceless on the part of the Opposition. I still believe it was quite conscienceless. No government should embark on such a proposition. So we carry the agreement forward. </para>

The American Government made some concessions in relation to the position which it had originally taken. America has gone as far as it is prepared to go. Because of the terms of the agreement we are unable to alter it in any way without a breach of faith. That is the last thing we will do. Therefore tonight this Government is asserting that it will undertake to accept the agreements of the past, whether or not we agree with them. We undertake to continue them while they run. But we still reserve our right, at any opportunity, to negotiate with the other party to the agreement for a change towards a greater Australian involvement and sovereignty. So the issue here tonight is the further protection of Australia's sovereignty and its right to control its own destiny. </para>

Let me explain to the people of Australia who are listening, and even to the Minister, that the product of what he said, the innuendo- the treachery assertion which is despicable for the man and the Minister and indicative of the low minded attitude of so many of those who currently and temporarily hold sway as Ministers of the Government- indicates that incompetently they have gone out and preached their philosophy and have returned to this House and denied a product of this ministerial negotiation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Make no mistake, the ministerial negotiation is a failure if the Ministers believe what the Labor Party asserts. The Labor Party asserts, if one turns to its philosophy as promulgated by the 3 1 st National Conference at Terrigal - </para>

          <para class="block">Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> has come into the House because I think South Australia is probably almost as derelict as Tasmania. I am not too sure whether the Labor Party in Tasmania remains as one with the Federal cause. Mind you, the Labor Party is about to lose all Federal seats so one must sympathise with its present stance. Federally the Labor Party's left wing in Tasmania is trying to control and stamp into the ground those few within the right wing of the party who survive. It was a former right wing Labor Minister from Tasmania, who thank goodness has lost his seat, who brought forward the measure we are debating tonight. </para>
          <para>Let me come back to the philosophy of the Labor Party. It can be stated in these words: Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign owned, controlled or operated bases and facilities on Australian territory especially if such bases involve a derogation from Australian sovereignty'. They are brave words, but what utter nonsense it is when we look at what the Labor Party is doing tonight. </para>

              <para>-I am glad to hear the honourable member contribute his two penn'orth, but I suspect that we will have within the ranks of the Government many who, if they agree with what they have asserted, will vote against this measure tonight because they have not been able to implement in any way the product of their policy. Where does this agreement in any way contravene Australian sovereignty? I will go back and show the honourable member in a moment for I think it is necessary that we do so. Where does this agreement in any way achieve what the left seeks, that is, the complete withdrawal of the United States presence in our part of the world? This particular negotiation, as honourable members will recall, came immediately after three of the senior Ministers of the Government- mind you, some of them have since had their day- denigrated the man and the administration of the United States. There was the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> who shortly afterwards became the  Deputy  Prime Minister; the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> the former Minister for Labor and Immigration- I am not too sure where he is now- who at that stage also made certain remarks, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Those 3 Ministers and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> made very brave assertions against the United States. This agreement was the grand achievement. This was how the Labor Party demonstrated that no longer was it prepared to have the Americans on our shore. It is interesting to note that in March 1973 the present Prime Minister said that the base pact was obnoxious. He went on to say that the North West Cape base agreement with the United States was obnoxious and that the then Defence Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> would renegotiate the agreement with the United States within a few months. Renegotiate, mind you; not just add a few words here and there. It would be a fundamental renegotiation. No self-respecting government would have entered into the agreement in the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> told a Melbourne Press Club lunch. The Prime Minister went on to say that the Agreement gives the United States sole control over the secret radio base for 25 years. What do we have in this respect? We have a wet squib. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the additions that we have before us. There are to be 3 amendments to the Agreement. The Bill is a Bill of 2 pages. The whole totality of the additions is 3 minimal extensions to 3 Articles of the Agreement none of which affects the continuity of Australian sovereignty. The preservation of Australian sovereignty was written into the Agreement in the first place, not by the Labor puppets of the socialist extremists from outside but during a speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick delivered in this place on 9 May 1963. In it <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> asserted, in the first instance, that the first of the broad principles that each Government recognised in the course of negotiations was that the Agreement and the obligation it creates respect the sovereignty of each. So there has been no change in respect of sovereignty. That was written into the Agreement by a government of our persuasion. </para>
          <para>The present Government- the persons opposite who are so prepared to denigrate the American presence- did not achieve the preservation of Australian sovereignty. It did not in any way change the Articles which were written into the Agreement way back in 1963. That is not to be the change to Article 1 of the Bill. The only change to Article 1 is of such significance that -oh dear me- the left wing must have been really delighted. It provides that the station shall be operated by the armed forces of the 2 governments as a joint facility. What happens? Do honourable members know where the 47 officers and men of the Royal Australian Navy are allowed to go? They are allowed access to exactly the same facilities at the North West Cape base as is any Australian or overseas tourist who goes there by a Pioneer bus. My word it was a remarkable achievement! It was really quite extraordinary! </para>
          <para>We heard brave assertions of treachery from the buffoon who preceded me in the debate. We heard the claim that the particular obligation entered into by Australia and the United States was going to be changed so fundamentally that the joint forces of the 2 countries were going to operate in a way which was in some way going to add to Australia's preservation of sovereignty and maintenance of the base. That is not true. The assertion and preservation of the Australian sovereignty came from the negotiations concluded by the Liberal-Country Party Government back in 1963. I think it is quite important that we remember that. </para>
          <para>Lest those of the left wing on the other side of the chamber have any doubts about the matter let me refer to page 1223 of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 May 1963. There they will find that the then Minister for External Affairs and Attorney-General laid down in quite clear and demonstrative form the fact that we were quite determined that Australian sovereignty in no way would be prejudiced. The second thing that he asserted was that the control of the station should rest with the United States. Of course, the left wing has said: 'That is diabolical. That does not agree with our Party platform'. But what changes have there been to the control exercised by the United States? Proposed article 2 has not been changed. It will remain as it is at present. It provides that 'exclusive use and occupancy thereof will be vested in the United States Government. It talks about granting to the United States Government all necessary rights of access to such land. There is reference to exclusive use, exclusive occupancy and all necessary rights of access. What change has the former Minister for Defence secured? Absolutely none. </para>
          <para>The third principle which each government recognised in the course of the negotiations was that when desired by either the United States or Australia there should be consultation between the 2 governments as to matters connected with the station and its use. That is a very proper provision. It is the provision by which the former honourable member for Bass was able to enter into this extension of the old agreement. There is talk of proper consultation and of the proper way in which changes might be entered into. What change has there been to that provision? Absolutely none. That provision was written into the agreement in case it was thought for some reason by a responsible government to be necessary to enter into some changes. The fourth principle which each government recognised in the course of the negotiations was that the Australian armed forces should have the use of the communication services of the station. That always has been the position. Has there been any extension of it? Of course not. That position remains. In other words, within the framework of this agreement- not changed by any discussions in this House tonight or by anything the former member for Bass has achieved, obtained simply because of that past negotiation back in 1 963- there is a continuation of the situation that the Australian armed forces may have the use of the communications service of the station. That is a very worthwhile and necessary reason for the station being there. The next principle reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Fifthly, that the Australian Government should not seek to make a revenue profit out of the American establishment, maintenance or operation of the station and that, where possible, it should assist to minimize the cost of the station to the American Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course that is the reason that we have the second change, that in clause 3 article 14 should be amended by the addition of the words 'other than costs incurred directly by the Australian Government on behalf of its armed forces'. What has this great renegotiation achieved? It has achieved the bearing of the responsibility for the costs of those Australian servicemen currently in the North West Cape in accordance with the orig i al agreement. The Australian Government will pay for the Australian naval personnel who are there. What a remarkable achievement! Goodness me. </para>

              <para>- As my colleague said, the only product of the demonstrably anti-American attitudes of this Government, particularly of its Left, are that the Australian Government will pay for the 47 naval officers and men who are stationed there as part of the joint service detachment. What a remarkable achievement! There will be 3 minimal extensions to the agreement. Those 3 extensions are where the left wing has either been done in the eye or the Australian people are being completely hoodwinked by the assertions that the Government has been able to achieve some remarkable extension of Australian sovereignty. Of course this is part and product of what the Government normally does. We become used to it. I shall continue to quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick 's address back in 1963. He stated: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>

            <para>Sixthly, that in the establishment, operation and maintenance of the station, the maximum practicable use of Australian resources should be made. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What a fit and proper assertion that is. There is no extension by the Labor Party. Australian resources? Indeed the present Minister for Defence- we have heard little of him- and his predecessor, have been trying to deny the use of Australian resources and materials and manufacturing capacity in the re-equipment and extension of the Australian armed forces. Indeed in their manufacturing policy and economic policy they are denying the ability of the Australian people to produce the goods and the equipment which might be needed in the event of a future conflict. Pity help us if it should ever occur. The provision I just quoted was written into that original agreement. There is no change by the Labor Party. It remains as it was. The next principle reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Seventhly, that, without submitting to the jurisdiction of Australian courts, or compromising its sovereignty, the United States would conform to Australian law and its personnel would observe it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There we are. We not only wrote in the preservation of Australia sovereignty, we also wrote in specifically that those who, being United States personnel, for the time being are within Australian sovereignty should be properly subject to Australian law and Australian courts. How in any way did we renege on our responsibilities to preserve Australian sovereignty? Of course we did not. The Labor Government could not find any reason to fault us. It has not changed that clause for that clause was fit and properly included in the original agreement. Indeed, the changes to the agreement, even down to the very minor amendments that have been written in by the re-negotiation of which the former Minister for Defence was so proud and of which the present Minister for the Capital Territory is so critical, are so minimal that it is laughable that the Bill comes before us at all. </para>

              <para>- The Minister for the Capital Territory called it treachery. He used hard and harsh words. I suspect he will vote against the Bill. We on this side of the House see no reason to do other than support it. The extensions that have been written into this measure are no more than an extension of the fundamental principles which we asserted in that original agreement. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Having looked specifically at those few minimal extensions and having contrasted the position of the left wing of the Labor Party and the reality of what it has achieved I turn now to look at the reality of where we are and our relations with the United States and the reality of what this agreement means. The Australian Labor Party has said a great deal that has tended to cause concern amongst the people of Australia because it is prepared to deny any threat, any fear and any circumstances within which there might be any armed attack on this continent for the next 15 years. The Government has told us of strategic assessments. It has told us that it wants a nuclear free zone. It has told us that it does not want the Americans in Diego Garcia. It has told us that it disagrees with much of American policy. In fact, what the Government has done is to put Australia in a position where, to a greater degree than ever before, we are subject to the will and direction of countries which obviously must be a threat to the future stability of the world. </para>
          <para>Surely nobody in the Parliament will suggest that between China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics there is anything but rather unfriendly and arm's length relations. Surely the Government recognises that one of the greatest threats to stability in the world today lies in the uncertain relationship between those 2 communist powers. Surely even the Government accepts that the product of the reopening of the Suez Canal and the equipment of the Russian bases around the Indian Ocean is that Australia stands very vulnerable and a long way from those with whom she has been associated in the past. Surely even the present Government recognises that the climate which it has created following the Guam Doctrine- for a while it was known as the Nixon Doctrine, but I suspect that today it is known again as the Guam Doctrine- is that the United. States would expect us to be capable of playing and willing and prepared to play our part in this area of the world. On the one hand the Government says that it supports ANZUS; yet on the other hand we hear a speech such as that made a moment ago by the Minister for the Capital Territory man who for the time being is a Minister in the Government. He alleges treachery. That is one of the most serious allegations that one can make against an individual or a government. He alleges treachery simply because the present Opposition had the foresight and the responsibility to take out an insurance to bring the greatest power in the world into a position where it would be aligned with us. </para>
          <para>I cannot express too highly my concern that the product of the Labor regime in this country is that there is no longer the certainty of that continued close and friendly relationship between the United States and Australia. Indeed, the very product of what the  speaker  who preceded me said is that Labor is not content to have so fragmented Australia's relationships or so severed those relationships by all its past assertions. He seeks to go much further. In the assertions that he has made tonight, surely he has demonstrated that there is still unhappiness among the members of his Party about those agreements that still exist. He demonstrated, in what he said, that the security that lies within the context of agreements such as this is not for him. The only security he seeks is some type of continued dialogue with the people of the communist countries to our north, communist countries whose future relationship with each other, even if not with us, is uncertain, communist countries in our region whose threat each and every member of the Labor Party denies. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to conjecture on the form that the present expression of the philosophy and policy of the Labor Party will take- disengagement and disarmament, and the complete denigration of defence arrangements which provide some type of cover against the run-down for which they have been responsible. On this side of the Parliament we support Agreement, but beyond that we support the principle behind it. We do not believe in warmongering, but we do believe in security and defence. We believe that the attitudes and principles that lie behind this Agreement are fundamental to the survival of this country, and it is despicable that the Minister or any other member of the Government of this country should perform as he did in this House tonight. </para>

            <para>- It was not the intention of several honourable members on this side of the House to speak to this Bill tonight. Sitting here listening to the views put forward by spokesmen from the Opposition, it became crystal clear that this Bill was being used as a vehicle to turn Australia back to the debates that we have had since 1949- debates on the Petrol affair, Vietnam and foreign bases. As there is no longer reason for debates on Vietnam, South-East Asia or Indo-China we are now getting back to the bases. We have gone the full cycle. We have to take seriously the views of the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who has just concluded his remarks, and the honourable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> because they happen to be the two very distinguished visitors from Australia who were the last people to shake hands with  President  Thieu and Lon Noe when they were still in office. Those poor fellows, representing democracy in their own countries, got away with only $100m worth of gold between them. They were fine defenders of what the Liberal Party and the Australian National Country Party stand for. It is significant that so much attention has been paid to this debate by spokesmen opposite. Since the liberation of China they no longer can proceed with the 'fear of Asia' debate which had been with us since 1949. They now seek a return to the debate on bases. It becomes a test of where every individual stands, where every party stands, where every group stands. Everybody receives a tag for what they say about American bases. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> who has been quoted here quite a lot, was perfectly correct: The Agreement will not be signed in future. No government, in its right mind, would again sign an agreement such as the one which was signed in 1963. The Opposition would not sign such an agreement; we would not. It is about time that members of the Opposition stood up and said so. Honourable members opposite talk about what will happen in 1988 but I point out that very few of us, travelling economy class, will be here to put up with it. Many of us will not be here to determine what decisions will be reached. </para>
          <para>Members of the Opposition still refuse to recognise what is happening in the world, especially in our part of the world. At a time when the super powers- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America- have nuclear arsenals that can destroy the world one hundred times over, a little rational debate about what part a country plays in its own policies about what influence it may have in its own region and about how it may be able to persuade in some small way the actions of the super powers, is extremely important. There can be no doubt from any unbiased observer's point of view that the attitudes and the policies of the conservative parties in Australia over our relations with Asia were totally wrong. The sacrifice of 490 Australian lives in Vietnam stands condemned as a pinnacle of Liberal Party policy. </para>
          <para>The Agreement on the North West Cape was signed in 1963 when, by stealth, we were sending military advisers into Vietnam. As it turns out, it was not the Americans who asked us to go into Vietnam; we asked the Americans to let us go into Vietnam. It is this sort of feeling and this sort of environment that existed in the mid-1960s under a Liberal-Country Party Government. It was all for home consumption. There was no world diplomacy about it. No standing up for Australia's own rights was involved. It was merely for home consumption for political purposes each 3 years because the then Government was doing very well out of it. The attitude of the then Government was: 'It is better to fight them up there than down here. Let us drop napalm on the Vietnamese, on the Cambodians and anybody at all as long as we are convincing the people of Australia that unless we do it they will be down here to take over this country'. Those countries happen to be liberated and the policies of those countries and the countries nearby happen to be changing very radically. One could go back over the attitudes. </para>
          <para>It is interesting that members of the Country Party- the steerage of the coalition- get up tonight to speak. For many years members of the Country Party said: 'Do not recognise China. Do not go near China. Just let China buy our wheat'. I go to China as frequently as I am able to do so. One trips over Australian farmers in China; one cannot move without running into bus loads of Australian farmers. They are all probably deducting their expenses from their tax. People must look at the role that we can play. We are not near Washington and we are not near London. We are part of Asia and we can have some influence on it. For years the Liberal and Country parties said that the Labor Party was wrong on Vietnam. No one has said seriously tonight that we were wrong. From now until 1988 the basis of the Opposition argument will be 'Labor Party, you are wrong'. In 1988 the present Opposition wa run away from the issue. The Opposition will not say- no spokesman has said it that it would sign another agreement such as this or that it would propose to sign further agreements. </para>

              <para>-Much has been made of the Labor Party poliCY. When one asks spokesmen from the other side to elucidate their own policies nothing comes forward. No member of the National Country Party or the Liberal Party can stand up as I, a member of the Australian Labor Party, am doing now and hold up a copy of the policy of his political party. The Labor Party is the only party that has put forward a policy that can be taken seriously, whether it concerns bases or any other issue. </para>

Please tell us. We are interested in what the Opposition has to say about it. It is a very interesting  exercise when the Opposition is talking about restraint in the Budget because someone has worked out that it would cost quite a lot of money to carry out that policy. By the silence of the members of the Opposition I take it that that is their policy. No less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> told us so. He has paraded around the country like a prize bull speaking to meetings and telling us what should happen in Australia. No one on the other side refutes what he has to say about foreign affairs. </para><para>If that is the policy of the Opposition let us look at its political aspects. What does the Opposition think this sort of statement will lead to in our building of relations with the countries to the north? Firstly, I think the Opposition must have learnt its lesson that there is a vast difference between the way in which some of the countries which are called communist countries operate their governments. There is a great difference in the relationships between lots of those governments. As the last speakers have said, of course there is great friction between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. There is perhaps some friction between the other countries that have been recently liberated and the People's Republic of China and among themselves. This is an area where we can play an important role but all we will hear for the next 20 years is whether we are to be loyal to the United States alliance and whether we are to rely on ANZUS. The argument is so stale. I would not mind if it was only the older members of the Opposition who are using it, but all the younger ones use it also. One would hope that someone on the other side was learning. </para><para>The Opposition has never got used to the fact that in 1949 the people of China decided to run their own country. At that time 600 million people decided that it was no longer lit and proper to allow foreign countries to run China. Looking back, I suppose it was a decision that they were entitled to make. If Australia had to make that decision in the future and made it I suspect that some of the younger members on the other side might decide that it was a good decision. China made that decision in 1949. There is no likelihood of the Government of China being changed in the future. We will have to live with that and we will have to build relations with that country. China is a major influence in Asia. </para><para>We are at the crossroads of all those countries trying to have an influence in our area. Yet we are sitting back hearing the same old tired story. Poor old <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. Why does not the Opposition let him retire? The establishment of the base in 1963 was his policy. Vietnam was his policy. The non-recognition of China was his policy. For God's sake, some of you go and have a look at what is going on. </para></speech>

            <para>-It is quite entertaining to see that there are some members of the Left who are now prepared to speak on what is a major issue before the Australian public. That issue is no less real today than it was in 1963. The issue is: Are we prepared in time of peace to grant facilities on our own soil to a foreign nation? That is the issue that must be answered today as it had to be answered in 1963. Without any doubt, from this side of the House and from the overwhelming proportion of the Australian people, the answer will be: 'Yes, we will provide facilities and bases. We do not regard that as as derogation from our sovereignty. On the other hand, we regard it as the way in which our sovereignty can be preserved '. Without a treaty such as the ANZUS Treaty, Australia would not have the assurance of national security that it now has under that treaty. </para>

              <para>-You mix with them. In 1 963 we had a debate in this Parliament on the North West Cape base. Let us call it a base; it is a communications facility. That facility has a very low frequency which enables the United States military command to communicate with its naval vessels throughout portion of the world. It probably has a range of 4 000 miles to 5 000 miles. It can communicate with submarines under the surface of the sea. It is very important to understand the purpose of that facility. It is very important for us to answer the question whether we are prepared to permit that facility to continue to operate on Australian soil. </para>

          <para>In 1963, the Executive of the then Government formulated the agreement. It did not have to bring that agreement before the Parliament as the Executive had the power to conclude the agreement and to let it run with aU the force of law. But the Executive brought to the national Parliament, to enable the national Parliament to debate the Bill the purpose of which was merely to authorise the agreement. When the Bill was before the Parliament we had a debate the Uke of which has seldom been emulated since. Every leading personality in the political sphere in the Parliament spoke. For the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calwell</inline> led and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> followed. For the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick led and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harold</inline> Holt and the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> also spoke. That debate was to determine whether or not we should grant to a foreign power the right to establish a base in Australia in time of peace. Well we won the debate in terms of numbers in the Parliament because we had the numbers at that dme. </para>
          <para>What is more important is that within 6 months an election was held. At that election in 1963 the majority of the Government increased from a mere one- my honourable and learned friend from Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> will well remember that we had a majority of one at that time- to a substantial majority. The Government was returned with the majority because the Aus.tralian people accepted the proposition that we put before them. That debate occurred against the background of the ANZUS treaty. The questions that were asked included: Did we believe in ANZUS? Were we prepared to play our part in ANZUS? Were we relying on ANZUS as a treaty for our national security? That was the background to the debate. And if the answer to those questions was yes, then quite clearly we had to allow the United States to have this facility so that the United States could play its part not only in the ANZUS Treaty but in world security- the western defence system. That is what the issue was about. </para>
          <para>During the course of the debate the issue came up as to whether Australia should have control of the base. The argument was quite clear. The Opposition at that time, the Labor Party, said: There is no way in which the United States can be allowed to have control of this base. When we come to office we will renegotiate the treaty to take away from the United States control of the base'. We in government at that time said: 'We have negotiated, and control must lie with the United States. If it is to be joint control'- as was argued by the Labor Party at that time- 'joint control would put into the hands of the people at the base representing the Australian Government the power of veto'. We were not prepared to say to the United States: 'You can have this base only if we have the power of veto \ To do so would have inevitably meant that the United States would not have agreed. We would not have had the base. We would have abrogated ANZUS there and then by that action. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party said: 'When we come to government we will, in accordance with the Treaty, renegotiate'. The Labor Party's purpose was to renegotiate to give joint control- in other words, to assume the power of veto. That is what the left wing of the Labor Party wanted. It will be remembered that then was coined the phrase the 36 faceless men'- the men who reached the decision while poor Arthur Calwell and poor Gough Whitlam were sitting out in the shrubs waiting for the decision. </para>

              <para>- It was cold then and it is cold now. The whole point is that we now have before the Parliament, for reasons which I am unable to discern, a piece of legislation which the Government does not need to bring before the Parliament to alter the Agreement. The Government has altered the Agreement in a piling way. It has done nothing whatever to fulfil its promises of what it would do when it came into government. The amendments to Articles 2, 3 and 14 merely re-assert the existing practice at the base. The only addition is to give Australia its own national room. The United States has its national room. We do not have access to the communications that go through the national room. We have not asked for it. It was not part of the negotiations by the present Government. It has set up a parallel Australian national room. Australia was always able to use the base to communicate with its own armed forces and its ships, including submarines, operating in the Indian or Pacific oceans. This amendment gives us the opportunity to reaffirm that we will look after the security of this country by means of treaties with our allies, and that we will give to our allies complete assurances that they can rely on our committed word and our willingness, at least on this side of the House, to defend Australia and to make our contributions to the western defence system. </para>

          <para>The debate today is against a changed background- not the background of 1963 but the background of today. The background of today is one in which a threat to Australia could emerge at any time by a destabilisation of the area to the north of us. A good question to ask is: Is that area likely to be destabilised? The answer must be: We cannot foretell, but there is a constant threat that it might. The threat arises in this way: The Soviet Union and China have great enmity towards each other. Troops are constantly on the alert at their border across the Asian mainland. If one goes to Peking one will be shown shelters and be told by the Chinese that rocketry is aimed at Peking and that the shelters are to protect them from nuclear fallout. We all know that the Soviet is fearful of being overrun by China in the longer run. China, for its part, is fearful of an interdiction strike by the Soviet. But across the Asian mainland their border is destabilised. Nobody would deny that. </para>
          <para>The new factor that enters into this situation is that the Soviet has naval forces in the Indian Ocean, with service from Vladivostok, past the east of Japan, through the Sunda Strait and into the Indian Ocean, or alternatively out from the northern ports of Russia or through the Mediterranean and around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. We all know that Soviet ship time in the Indian Ocean has been building up as a geometric progression. We now know that the Suez is open and the line of communication is thereby so much shortened. The Chinese see this and they see a threat of their being surrounded, not merely from the land border of Asia but from the south. They see also the Soviet achieving facilities, as the Soviet calls them- bases, we would call them- all around the bordering states of the Indian Ocean where their ships can be serviced. </para>
          <para>The Chinese are fearful of being surrounded. So there is a competition for power, a competition for influence in the Indian Ocean and the South-East Asian region. That competition for influence is caused by the Soviet wanting to penetrate into African states. The Chinese have done this, the Soviet has done this down through South-East Asia and, if that competition builds up, there will be a destabilised area. Remember that the Soviet has massive sea power and airborne sea power. The Chinese have no sea power or airborne sea power but they have plenty of ground power. Therefore, if the Chinese are to match this Soviet naval presence it can do so only on the ground. If there is a competition, not only ideologically but for areas of influence, of sovereignty or suzerainty, then the whole of the area to the north will become destabilised. We should look at Australia in its geographical context in the event of that area becoming destabilised. We have to the north of us a destabilised area of thousands of miles extending across the Pacific to the United States, and across Asia, Asia Minor and Europe to Western Europe. We cannot look there for support. If we are to look anywhere for support we must look to the ANZUS treaty. </para>
          <para>In those circumstances would anybody in this chamber be prepared to deny the United States the use of communication facilities at North West Cape? Members of the Labor Party will say: We are not denying them the use; we are letting them have it. But they also say: We regret that the agreement was ever entered into; given the opportunity we would end it and we will end it as soon as we can. Would they abrogate the agreement? Under the terms of the agreement they can renegotiate it at any time. The state of mind exposed by Labor speakers tonight is that they want to abrogate the agreement and they would do so if they thought they could do so honourably. They want it both ways- honourably and yet not abrogated. They cannot have it both ways. If they mean what they say then they ought to say in the fulsomeness of the term: This agreement is there, we stand by it, it is vital to us and we want it to be maintained. But they dare not do that because of the outbursts of members like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bryant,</inline> the Minister for the Capital Territory, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Young,</inline> the honourable member for Port Adelaide and formerly the Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. </para>
          <para>Instead members of the Government talk about a nuclear free zone, but what will that do? Does anybody imagine that the Soviet ships unload their nuclear weapons before they sail into the Indian Ocean? If we want a United States presence in the Indian Ocean as a balancing force to the competition between the Soviet and China then we must encourage the United States naval and air power into the Indian Ocean. Who would say that before they sailed into the Indian Ocean they must likewise jettison their nuclear weapons? It is a fairy tale. A nuclear free zone would operate only to the great disadvantage of Australia. </para>
          <para>What of the other proposal that the Indian Ocean should be a zone of peace? How can it be a zone of peace when the 2 contestant nations build facilities all over the states- the littoral states as they are called- bordering the Indian Ocean? How can members of the Labor Party say that they want the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace when they themselves, by the continuance of this agreement, are prepared to give a base to the United States literally on the Indian Ocean coast? They deny themselves. They make nonsense of their own argument. Fortunately the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian people would not accept the argument for to accept it would be to prejudice very seriously the defence capacity of this country in alliance with a great ally, the United States. </para>
          <para>The purposes of the Government's amendments are merely to try and placate the left, to leave the left with some sense that they have partly won. But there is no room for that. We must face up to the issue; the left must face up to the issue and the right must face up to the issue. The issue is simple and clear- will we or will we not grant to an ally, albeit a foreign power, a base on our Australian soil in a time of peace? The answer clearly must be, yes. This debate is not confined merely to the North West Cape base for there are other foreign bases in Australia. If members of the Labor Party in government vote for this Bill they will, in fact, be voting for the continuance of the other bases in Australia. We strongly support the continuance of those other bases. But the honourable member for Port Adelaide, the Minister for the Capital Territory and everybody else on that side of the House know clearly that if one votes yes for this Bill which their Government has put up, one is voting for the continuation of every United States base in Australia. That is the simplicity of the situation; that is the reality of the situation; that is, in a sense, the awesomeness of the situation. </para>
          <para>I conclude by referring to 2 statements. One was made on 21 May 1963 when the debate on this subject was before this chamber. It comprises one sentence: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>All that we assert is that there should be no annihilation without representation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those were the words of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> containing within them all the implications that by having that base we are risking annihilation. Yet the Prime Minister as the leader of the Government has renegotiated an agreement which, thank heaven, is maintaining the base with all its integrity. The Prime Minister said one thing in 1963 and now acts differently in Government.  His  word, I am afraid, in respect of foreign affairs and defence cannot be relied upon. The other quote is from the same gentleman, the Prime Minister, who 8 years later almost to the day- not 22 May but 2 1 May- said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I thank the Minister for Defence for his effective work on behalf of our country in this matter as in so many others. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We know what happened to the Minister for Defence so shortly after that. Nevertheless, we can be thankful to Lance Barnard that he had the guts to stand out against the left and maintain this base and the other bases and make a giant contribution to ANZUS. He will be remembered. But it is time that the left, if it wants to undo the agreement, made its intentions clear. It should not mask itself and come in a fleeting way into a debate. For the debate on this major issue there are just 5 members of the Labor Party present in the chamber. They do not have the guts to come - </para>

When the CIA gets copies of their speeches in this debate tonight it will most proudly say: 'We have not paid out in vain'. I remember the debates in 1963 on this very important issue that affects the Australian people. I remember the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, playing down the significance of this base. He used almost identical words to those used by the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> a short while ago. The right honourable member for Bruce used the phrase: 'This is only a communications facility'. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies played down the base by saying: 'This base is not a base in the sense of a war base. It is none other than a radio station'. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable member keeps quiet he will learn something. He was not a member of this Parliament when this debate took place, and he probably will not be a member of this Parliament much longer. It is expected that each nuclear submarine would carry from 15 to 20 nuclear warheads, with a striking power at least 10 times greater than that of the bombs which were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Recently there was the 30th anniversary of the dropping of those bombs. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies endeavoured to play down this communications station by saying that it was merely a radio station, it was pointed out to him that it was more important than one or two nuclear submarines; that it was a radio station that could communicate with 15 to 20 nuclear submarines as a result of the sole decision of one man, without Australia having any say in it whatsoever. That power was invested in the  President  of the United States who could give the submarines the order to fire. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>At the time of this great debate in this Parliament a nuclear submarine was described by a member of the House of Commons as a mobile nuclear base. This is why at the time the Australian people were so concerned, although Australia, like many countries in the Western world, was then still enveloped in the Cold War. There was the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion, the contemplated invasion of Cuba. This caused Cuba to put Russian missiles onto its territory to defend itself against a contemplated invasion. This was the current of international affairs at that time, when the Labor Party had in its ranks the great divisions to which reference has been made tonight. Members of the Labor Party did not know whether or not they should wholly and solely oppose the base. I believe that the base, even more so today, is offensive to our Asian neighbours in view of the political changes that have taken place at our northern doorstep. All this legislation provides is for the Australian Government, on behalf of the Australian people, to have a greater say in the use of the base. It provides that the power of the  President  of the United States of America shall be restricted so that without consultation he cannot give orders to the base to contact nuclear submarines and give the order to fire. This has not been stated in the debate tonight. That is all we ask for. </para>
          <para>Most of the other countries that have American bases on their soil have demanded at the time of the installation of those bases some say in their use. But the present Opposition at the time of the setting up of this base was going 'all the way with LBJ' and 'Waltzing Matilda' with the successive Presidents of the United States. The previous Government virtually sold Australia down the drain. We are seeking to restore some of the dignity of this nation which has been adopting a more independent foreign policy under the leadership of Prime Minister Whitlam. I think it is very timely, if not overdue, for this legislation to come before this Parliament, particularly because of the attitude of the Philippines Government which is expressing indignation or resentment about American bases in the Philippines- the naval base at Cubic Bay and the giant airfield known as 'Clark Field '. We all should know, but members of the Opposition would not admit, that the Philippines Government at present is expressing an idea as to how they can get America to relinquish control of those bases. If the Philippines Government cannot get America to relinquish control then it wants a greater say in the use of the bases. If members of the Opposition are frank and honest they will admit that this is true. We all know this includes members of the Opposition- that at the present time the Thai Government is most urgently desirous without offending the United States of having the United States relinquish its 5 giant air bases in northern Thailand. That was the opinion expressed to me a few weeks ago when I was in Thailand. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member would not know if he was sitting on it. The Harold Wilson Government is most unhappy about the American build up in Diego Garcia. To my mind America's action is somewhat inconsistent with the attitude it adopted at the recent conference with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Helsinki about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. At Helsinki they were talking about reducing their nuclear power, but on the other hand the United States is pouring millions of dollars into a build up at Diego Garcia. I admit that through the courtesy of the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> I went one night to see a film in Parliament House which showed how Russia had expanded its bases in the Suez Canal region. I may be wrong but it is my belief that the presence of Russian nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean and in the Suez Canal region was to give a reassurance to the Arab oil states before they put the oil squeeze on the western world countries which caused so much chaos to industrialised America. The Russian submarines were there to deter an invasion of the Arab oil countries by the United States marines. I believe that because it was stated in one of the international magazines in the Parliamentary Library that  President  Ford and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rockefeller</inline> would express no opposition should the Pentagon decide or recommend to the Government that the marines should be put into the Arab oil states. I believe that could well be the reason for the USSR naval presence in the Indian Ocean; it is to deter any invasion of the Arab oil countries. </para>

          <para>I believe that this legislation will restore greater dignity to the Australian people. I believe there are millions of people in the United States who admire the courage of this Government for asking for joint say in the control of a nuclear base which could involve Australia in war, a base which is wholly and solely under the control of the United States President who can give the orders to fire. We all well know what happened to the last President of the United States and what happened in Watergate. I think this legislation should be applauded by every decent thinking Australian. The Government's attitude is that no country should be able to involve Australia in war without the Australian Government having some say. Under the present situation this radio station or naval communications station can give directions to 15 or 20 nuclear submarines and order them to fire. The Australian Government should have some say in its control. </para>

We all know, and it has been admitted by members of the Opposition, that this station can communicate with submarines at depths of up to 100 feet below the surface of the ocean. This legislation is timely. I applaud my Government for asking for joint control or a greater say in the use of the base so that Australia could not be involved in a nuclear war without the concurrence of the government of the day. </para>

            <para>-This has been a most fascinating and interesting evening. In fact, during the last 2 nights members of this House have had more opportunities to discuss Australia's defence preparedness than we have had probably in the entire <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years of the present Government's term of office. I thank, in particular, the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> for giving such an excellent exposition on tattoos and turkeys. I cannot help being amazed at how many members of the present Government become experts in the field of foreign affairs at such short notice. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We need to take particular note of the fact that the very few members of the Government Party who have bothered to speak on this most important Bill have emphasised what is better known as the view of the left wing of the Party. We have been told, for example, by the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> that 'this is not the world of the past in which the ANZUS Treaty was written' that 'the hours of peril and need are receding more rapidly than in the past' and that the present Opposition, when it was the Government of this Commonwealth, was but a satellite of the United States of America' in foreign affairs. So he went on. He was prepared to describe this piece of legislation as 'a relic of the past', saying that 'it was one of the most mischievous operations of the last Government'. </para>
          <para>Having placed the view of Government members in context I refer now to a comment about the Agreement made by a former Minister for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. What he said in 1963 is still relevant today: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Only those who live in a world of fantasy can deny the vital importance in peace-time of such a system of communication as an item of defence preparation and preparedness. Indeed, its very existence is a significant element in the deterrence of aggression. Those who are interested in peace may well set much store by this aspect of the establishment of this station. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Regardless of the situation, for many years since 1963, in fact- the Australian Labor Party insisted on renegotiating the agreements concerning foreign bases, and it based its insistence on the concept of sovereignty. However, as we can see with this legislation, the fact is that the renegotiation was nothing more than a sham to meet the dictates of a left wing dominated Australian Labor Party. The members of the Australian Labor Party Executive may no longer be faceless, but they still control that Party, just as they did in 1963 when the leaders of the Parliamentary Party were left out in the street in the middle of a Canberra winter. Regrettably, since that time the Australian Labor Party has not altered its attitude towards the base at NorthWest Cape. What we must remember, however, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, when he explained the question of sovereignty in relation to the Agreement between the United States and Australia, said that Article 3 of the Agreement performed 2 functions, and the first one was the more relevant. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It provides for consultation between the 2 Governments and it limits the use to which this station may be put. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise that point because at various stages over the last few years Labor Party organisations have suggested that atomic bombs and so forth may be kept at this base. If that ever did happen and it did not- it would have been quite contrary to the basic understanding between the then Australian Government and the Government of the United States. </para>
          <para>Last month I was in Washington and I took the opportunity while there to discuss with the Americans precisely what is the relevance of this facility in relation to their global requirements. They emphasised to me that the North- West Cape base is still of primary importance for communications, and that is all it is. It is a base for the transference of messages from Washington to naval units in the Pacific and Indian ocean areas. It also has the capacity, as the honourable member for Hunter correctly pointed out, to make contact with nuclear submarines. What is so unusual about that when all the major powers today- Britain, the United States, possibly China and certainly the Soviet Union and France have nuclear submarines and submarines with nuclear potential? It is therefore not unreasonable that any State having available any facilities of this type would use them as a means of communication with all their units and bases. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, this Government was forced by the organisational wing of the Party to go to Washington to re-negotiate this agreement, and the Minister at the time made great play of his claim that the Australian people had been sold out in 1963 and this Government was going to right a wrong. It was an act of treachery, we were told by the Minister for the Capital Territory. Where was this act of treachery? We entered into this agreement because we were requested to do so by an ally, the United States, which at that time was, as it still is, a signatory to the ANZUS Treaty. The essence of the ANZUS Treaty is that all 3 parties- the United States, New Zealand and Australia- are expected to take necessary action separately and jointly to develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack. Therefore, the establishment of this naval facility was an obvious method by which the United States could play its part under the ANZUS pact as well as meet its global commitments. As far as Australia was concerned, the provision of the site for this base gave us a capacity to live up to our side of the agreement. </para>
          <para>What this Government fails to realise is that there is no point in giving lip service to agreements such as ANZUS unless it is prepared to take an active interest in the Treaty and make it viable. It is no good regarding it just as a piece of paper that can be abrogated whenever it suits Australia. Recently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> came back from the United States and emphasised that the ANZUS Treaty remains a cornerstone of Australian foreign policy. Why did he say that? Does he really believe it or is he just trying to pander to an electorate which he should know as well as we do is very conscious of the need to build up sufficient defence capacity in this country and through our alliances so that Australia's future can be secure. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately in the last 2 years we have heard so many doubts thrown on the capacity of the ANZUS Treaty. I had reason in Washington to say to the Americans: 'Exactly what is the substance of ANZUS today?' In other words: 'Are you prepared to back Australia if we are threatened by an external power?' I was told without any equivocation that there are certain areas of the world whose future as far as the </para>
          <para class="block">United States is concerned is simply not negotiable. One of those areas, of course, is western Europe; another is Israel; the third is Japan; the fourth is Australia and New Zealand. That order has no significance. Then I went a step further and said to the State Department and Defence Department officials I was talking to: 'Under what conditions will you consider the ANZUS Treaty to be no longer- of effect?' The reply was equally cogent. They said: 'We shall consider the ANZUS Treaty to be viable and effective so long as the Australian Government is prepared to honour it and is prepared to show itself to be an ally of the United States in the full sense of the word '. This simply is a take it or leave it situation but the Government cannot have it both ways. If it wants to have the ANZUS Treaty it must accept the responsibilities and obligations of Australia as well as those of the United States and New Zealand. It is time that this Government was honest enough to tell the people whether it is prepared to live up to these responsibilities or not. </para>
          <para>This Treaty, linked in as closely as it is with such bases as the US naval communication station, cannot be seen in a piecemeal manner and it is for that reason that although the Opposition is supporting the amendments to this legislation we are not prepared to accept many of the strange concepts, cliches and shibboleths which we have heard from the Government side tonight. We are certainly not prepared to accept the claim that we committed acts of treachery when we entered into this agreement with the specific intention of honouring our obligations to the ANZUS alliance. </para>

            <para>-I have never seen government speakers less comfortable than they have been in this debate because they have not really wanted to say the truth. The truth is that their left wing demands from them and they do not all agree with this that they should renounce the United States alliance and go into the communist orbit. This is what the debate is all about, as indeed it was in 1963 when it came on with the faceless men dictating to the then Opposition. Among the contradictions in what government supporters have said I particularly noted one statement by the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant).</inline> He said that no government has a right to bind the future of Australia for so long ahead. He said it should be bound for not longer than 3 years. That came very well, did it not, from a Minister in the Government which only a couple of months ago was wanting to enter into long term loans for $4,000m to be repaid in 20 years, I think it was, for $20,000m which would have bound the whole economic future of Australia? It comes well from a government to say 'You cannot enter into long term agreements'. This is just a small instance of the insincerity of the Government of the contradictions which underlie its approach to this whole matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not want to talk about this in terms of party politics because more important things are in front of us. We are not just talking about the exercise of Australian sovereignty. We are really talking about the continued existence of the Australian nation because, use what comfortable words you like, the existence of the Australian nation is not as secure for the future as it has been in the past. Our defences in a sense are gone. The United States has decided to withdraw from the Asian area. The British fleet is no longer here and the British power can no longer protect us. Our only real defence at present lies in the existence of the United States fleet in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and without that we are virtually defenceless. </para>
          <para>We heard people tonight talk nonsense about Australia being able to be independent and being able to defend herself. This is nonsense and the tragedy is that it is being uttered by supporters of a government which has no intention of allowing Australia to regain any defence capability, a government which brought in' a Budget only a couple of nights ago which provides for a diminution in the manpower of the Australian forces, a government which knows that by ourselves we have no adequate capacity to determine the continued existence of the Australian nation. Yet this is a government which, embarrassed by its pro-communist left wing, is out to break what ties we have with the United States and to provoke the United States, insofar as it lies within its power, into abandoning the defence of Australia and the reality of the ANZUS Pact. The ANZUS Pact is not a very definite pact. Its continuation depends upon the Congress of the United States exercising its constitutional prerogative from time to time. The ANZUS Pact is only valid and only means anything insofar as the goodwill of the United States allows it to be valid or to mean anything. Under these circumstances, what do we think of a government which is trying to imperil the future of Australia by crawling to the left wing and the communists who control its own left wing in the unions? </para>
          <para>We have heard the words 'treachery' and treason' used tonight by people speaking from the centre table. I throw those words back. There is treachery; there is treason. Not all members of the Government are concerned in this, but some members of the Government who crawl to the left wing and who do so knowingly are guilty of that kind of treachery and treason. Do not let us think that we in Australia are a small prize. We are a small nation, sure. We do not have much capacity to defend ourselves, but as it happens we are a nation which has immense riches within its borders, a nation whose minerals and food may well be important to the economy of Asia. To believe that we will remain without defences or friends as a sovereign nation is to delude ourselves entirely. But this apparently is the doctrine of the left wing of the Government. </para>
          <para>Let us look at this base at North West Cape. It was established as part of a global strategy which so far has contained communist aggression. At least it has been contained in the major theatres of the world, even though it may have inched towards us in this theatre. If it had not been for this nuclear capacity being in the hands of the free world, I have no doubt that communist aggression would have gone much further and got much worse. So this is the point: The base at North West Cape was established in 1 963 as one of the pins in the whole of global strategy. It was a necessary pin in global strategy. I do not think it will be a necessary pin for very much longer because, as it happens, the development of new technologies, the development of satellites and what goes with them, will shortly be rendering the base out of date. That has not happened as yet but it will be happening within a few years' time, and the vital nature of that base to global strategy will shortly go. But during this time should we be insulting our allies? Should we be saying to the United States of America, as this Government is saying: 'We would like to get you out. We may keep you just because there is an agreement, but we do not like the agreement. We do not like you. We do not want you '. </para>
          <para>That is the attitude of the Government today. That is what we are up against. It is something which strikes a blow at the whole security of Australia. Well, it does not matter so much now because this Government has not got long to run. The damage that it is doing to the security of Australia will be remedied shortly by a change of government, and the United States and our other allies in the free world will know that once again Australia will have a government which represents the view of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people on this issue, which will not twist and determine Australia's foreign policy in the interests of the communist powers to the control of the left wing, that minority pro-communist control, which apparently is still so potent over the thinking of the Government when it comes to foreign poliCY </para>

            <para>- in reply- Tonight in this debate we have heard the echoes of the aroused passions and the emotions of over a dozen years ago. The debate, in which most honourable members have spoken, recalls that which took place in this place some 12 years ago. I want to try to look at this matter dispassionately. What concerned me were 2 misconceptions. The first was a misconception about what constitutes an ally and the sort of stance which partners in an alliance should take. The other misconception concerns the nature of the negotiations that are contained in this BUI. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us take the concept of alliances. All of us particularly members of the Opposition- can recall the days of 'AH the Way with LB J' when Australia was an obsequious satellite of the United States of America, when what was the lucky country had become the lackey country. This position that was occupied by Australia throughout the 1960s was not a credit to Australia or to the Australian Government and neither was it of advantage to the United States Government. I can recall just before I came into Parliament the words of a departing United States diplomat, an old colleague of mine, Ed Cronk, who was the United States charged 'affairs in Australia. On his departure not only from Australia but also from the foreign service of the United States State Department he was quoted in the Australian Press as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The United States does not want allies who just follow our lead. We want allies that will come up with ideas of their own. It is much healthier than one leader and a lot of followers. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a very important concept of the role of an ally in a healthy alliance. Now let me quote President Nixon- not that I am given to quoting him- in his palmier days when he was Vice-President. He said this in 1964: </para>

          <para class="block">I do not think that in any alliance we have to boast or act as though we are going through some boy scout ceremony of crediting our allegiance by lying flat on the floor and saying: 'We are your ally. We are prepared to do everything you want us to do'. I think it was this unhealthy nature of the alliance during the period of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government that affected the very real and basic relationship that exists between the people of the United States of America and the people of Australia. </para>
          <para>I want to make a couple of statements and I want to make them slowly so that they are understood completely. In terms of the global deterrent the global nuclear balance- Australia is fundamentally aligned with the United States. This United States Naval Communications Station Agreement Bill fits into that alliance. I want to say that again: The Australian Governmentthe Australian Labor Party- in terms of the global balance, the nuclear deterrent- the big league, if you like, of nuclear balance between the Soviet Union and the US- is fundamentally aligned with the US. We can regard that alliance as the wood. But within the wood there is a variety of trees. It would be very strange indeed if I, as an Australian Minister, did not from the Australian point, see issues in a perspective different from the way my counterpart in the USA, the Secretary of Defence, would see them. This is important. Australia, because of its position, has an attitude of mind; it should have an attitude of mind. Because of its position Australia should have an orientation and outlook that is not necessarily- why should it be?- exactly the same as that of the US. I believe that it is the role and the responsibility of an ally when he does see things differently to make that point of view known, and if not convince his ally of his point of view, at least to ensure that the ally is aware of what that point of view is. That is the nature of a healthy relationship between the Australian and US partners in ANZUS at the present time. </para>
          <para>I want to take up the misconceptions that flowed from some speakers in the debate about the nature of this legislation and of the previous legislation. The previous legislation which dealt with the establishment of a naval communications station at North West Cape was introduced in 1963 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. It was- I state this quite deliberately- a blatant and deliberate abdication of our sovereignty. Let me quote from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick delivered at this table in this place in 1963. He said: </para>

          <para class="block">He is talking about the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement Bill - the Australian Government permits the American Government to establish, maintain and operate for a minimum period of 25 years a naval communications station at North West Cape in Western Australia.

The station will be a United States communications station under the sole control of the US Government. </para>

              <para>- They are very strong words and I use them quite deliberately. In the letter which was concurred in by an Australian Minister for External Affairs it was said: 'Let us constrict the interpretation of consultation under Article 3 '. The letter, referring to Article 3, said: Whereas this construction is not intended to restrict the Government of Australia's rights of consultation, it is intended to spell out clearly that consultation does not carry with it any degree of control over the station or its use'. What we sought to do in the renegotiation was to establish the dignity of Australia as a partner or, as I have sought to express it, as an ally of the United States. In that we were successful because we did not, and there was never any intention to, renounce the Agreement. But we were concerned that the station was exclusively a United States concern save for the presence of a single Royal Australian Navy officer. We were concerned to change this and to secure effective Australian participation in the management and operation of the base as we considered benefitted our national status. In the arrangements which were entered into by my predecessor and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Schlesinger,</inline> the United States Secretary of Defence, in January 1974 these things were achieved: Agreement that the station would be operated as a joint facility; the appointment of an Australian  deputy  commander with status in the management of the station; the posting of Australian servicemen to key operational posts in the station. At this date there are 47 Australian servicemen at the base whereas, under the previous Government, there was one. </para>

          <para>A lot has been said about the concept of control. The North West Cape station is not an originating station. The messages that go out to the United States fleet in the Indian Ocean or to wherever the transmitter can contact it are in terms of transmission. I repeat that it is not an originating station. It is only a monitoring and repeating station. So this is not where the concept of effective co-ordination and consultation comes to pass. Of course the practical, realistic and effective mode of monitoring and control is certainly not a matter of intervention in the operations of the station. The proper focus of our effort is the United States global policy. If we know what that is about, we will have an accurate understanding of the type of message being transmitted through North West Cape. To this end what we set out to do was to establish, to regain and to get effective consultation with the United States which, by this exchange of letters, had been denied to the Australian Government. Through discussions with the United States which form the basis of the legislation which we have before us tonight we made that consultation explicit. The substantial features are to ensure, to quote from the document: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. that the Australian Government would have full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the station and their significance for Australian national interests. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That is contained in a document signed by my predecessor and by the Unites States Secretary of Defence. So what we have achieved is effective consultation. I was just recently in the United States where we had the types of consultation that are important and necessary for the effective control of the operations of the station at North West Cape- through Ministerial level, through normal diplomatic consultations. This was a form of consult a ion that the previous government was even boasting that it no longer wanted. I think it is of great concern that through nearly 2 decades of debate in Australia it seems from the Liberal-Country Party point of view that one could not really be pro-United States unless one was anti-Australian. The Opposition was anti-Australian in the attitude that it took to the derogation of sovereignty of the North West Cape transmission station. The Bill has been debated at length. I understand that the Opposition, despite all its verbosity this evening, is not opposing the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para>- I have been requested by my parliamentary colleagues to bring before the notice of the House that the honourable Fred Daly, Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House, has today served 32 years in Parliament as a member and a Minister, having been elected as a member for Martin, New South Wales, on 21 August 1943. He served as the honourable member for that electorate until 1949 when, due to the enlargement of the Parliament and the redistribution of that year, he became the member for Grayndler, which electorate he has represented for the past 26 years. He served as Party Whip for 6 years, from 1950 to 1956. He was elected to the Opposition Party Executive in 1963 and served in that position continuously until 1972. Following the election in that year, he was chosen as a member of Cabinet and was appointed Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House. Having served in this House for 20 years and 3 months, I can say with all sincerity that Fred has done more to bring about the standards of services and conditions that are now enjoyed by every member of this House and of the Senate, particularly back bench members, than has any other Minister since Federation. I do not believe that any member of the Parliament would disagree with my opinion. As a matter of fact, honourable members from both sides of the House and the Senate have spoken in laudatory terms of what he has done for them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I now wish to say a few words about the gentleman in question. The name 'Fred Daly' is a byword in the electorate of Grayndler, particularly in the suburbs of Newtown, Marrickville and Leichhardt. He is patron of the Newtown Rugby League Football Club and, as we all know, rugby league is the sport of rugged, physically well equipped young men. It has been my pleasure to have known Fred, his gracious wife Teresa, his daughter Margaret and his son Lawrence for many years. I have found Fred always to be a shy, retiring and timid person, lacking any sense of provocation.  His  speeches never invite interjections or retorts of any kind. I am informed that others wish to contribute something on this occasion; so I shall curtail my remarks. I conclude by congratulating Fred on 3 points: Firstly, his sincerity, diligence and conscientious work for the Australian Labor Party in a lifetime of dedication to a cause in which he believes; secondly, his 32 years of splendid service to the Parliament and the Australian community; and, thirdly I emphasise this again- his outstanding achievements which have provided the highest standard of conditions and amenities ever enjoyed by members and senators. </para>

          <para>- It is with considerable pleasure that I rise- not because it is the obloquy of the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> but because, in spite of the love that he so often demonstrates for me and my Party colleagues who sit in Possum Corner, we respect the man for his contribution and for his years of service. We also, of course, respect the other honourable member who I understand celebrates today his 30th year in this place and who is not present at the moment- the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley).</inline> Between them they reflect more than the years of most honourable members on this side of the House. </para>

        <para>The very memorable origins of Frederick Michael Daly were in that fair city of Currabubula, not far from the boundaries of my electorate. It was there that he learned his bushcraft, which he demonstrated so positively when on the first occasion on which he gave a political speech after his endorsement as a candidate, I am led to believe, he actually presented it in the wrong electorate. This master of electoral boundaries unfortunately had not realised that Spring Street, Bondi, at that stage was in the electorate of Phillip and not in the electorate of Marrickville, which he was contesting. However, he still attempts to persuade- and on several occasions has persuaded- the House as to the reasons for movements of electoral boundaries. Perhaps it all dates back to those original machinations. On another occasion, I understand, he worked for the Department of Works. I am told that it was he who dreamt up the concept of the Sydney Eastern Suburbs underground railway. That is one of the reasons that it is still being built. </para>
        <para>There is one characteristic of the honourable member for Grayndler that does concern me. He has so often presented himself in this chamber and elsewhere as a champion of the Irish. I thought it might be appropriate in those circumstances if I looked up the good book to find something of his family record. I am told that the origin of the clan- although it is not a clan- was the late Gore Picton of Melbourne.  His  arms are Per fess Argent and Or, a Lion rampant per fess </para>
        <para class="block">Sable and Gules, in chief two dexter Hands coupled at the wrists of the last. The only thing that comes out of the crest that appealed to me was a greyhound cour ant sable. Perhaps that goes well with his patronage of the football club. Interestingly enough, it is essentially an English family. The thing that concerns me most, however, is the motto: 'Show Fidelity to God and King'. I only wish he showed more fidelity to the Opposition than he sometimes does in this place. </para>
        <para>In all seriousness, the honourable member is the father of this House. He is a man whose parliamentary wit and wisdom keeps us in good humor- at times- and on other occasions stirs us to the point where we sometimes wish that he had seen fit to resign his seat long before his 32nd year in this Parliament. He is, of course, the father of the House. He has served this House and his electorate well. The only problem is where he goes in the future. All honourable members on this side of the House remember the occasions when he has occasionally left Australiafor his country's good- and in that particular phase, of course, he achieved some distinction for the duration of his stays abroad. But in the present context of the changed mode of parliamentary travel, perhaps it is not quite so likely that he dilly allies as much as he once was accused of doing. It might be appropriate, in concluding my remarks, to do so with good humour and high respect. As Leader of the House for the Government I believe he has served the Parliament well although there are occasions when I must admit there have been some differences between us. Essentially, however, the Parliament does work well under his jurisdiction. I only wish he would give us a little more opportunity to speak a little more about some of those matters which concern us. </para>

        <para>The honourable gentleman has spent 32 years in this place. I said to him this afternoon that by his looks and by his guile I am left the impression that he has spent exactly twice that number of years in this place. I am bound to use the House as something of a public confessional to say that the honourable gentleman represents the complete and utter exasperation of my life. I have, for some 20 years, been trying to insult him. It is impossible. I once accused him of suffering from the Munchausen syndrome. He said he thought it was a horse running at Randwick but he would check on it. I said: 'Well, we will meet at Phillipi'. He said: 'Don't you put such an indecent proposal to me but I will find out where it is.' </para>
        <para>Many years ago- I hope it is not a breach of personal confidence but something was going on in this place- he said: 'Come and have a drink '. I asked: 'Where?' He said: 'In my room'.

We went there. I said: 'Where is the drink? In the filing cabinet?' He pulled out the filing cabinet. Do honourable members know what came out? It was a bottle of Scotch whisky. Do honourable members know what it was filed under? It was ' unity tickets '. </para>
        <para>I am a card carrying member of the Irish Association and it is a matter of some anguish to me to find out that the progenitors of Frederick Michael Daly are not as Irish as he would occasionally make out. I have looked at a different family tree from the one which my friend the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has looked at. I found a Daly crest which bespeaks to this: 'On a wreath of the colours a cat's head erased at the neck and a front of a tabby colour holding in the mouth a rat sable'. After having heard that cats were associated with the honourable gentleman I found myself immediately a victim of ailurophobia which, shortly, means a morbid fear of cats. </para>
        <para>I looked at the honourable gentleman's maiden speech, which was delivered in October 1943. What a powerful and forward looking pronunciation that was. Let me recapture something of the spirit of it. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An essential of the new order- </para>

        <para>That felicitous term would have tumbled out of his mouth-  must be full time employment for all those willing to work. </para>
        <para class="block">There it is. My honourable friend is beyond insult. I have not the slightest doubt that that will go out in the next Australian Assistance Plan as the thoughts of Fred Daly. It is not as though my friend the honourable member for New England has turned his literary talent in the singular to the honourable member for Grayndler. He fell over some time ago, the House will recall, and broke his arm. I found out that he was out walking his dog- a dog which rejoices in the name of Grayndler. I sent him a telegram saying that his behaviour should be reported to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals but he was not taken aback by that. Australia's poet laureate has turned to the honourable gentleman this evening to mark his 32 years here and this is what has been produced: </para>

          <para>- The House has certainly never heard to better advantage the 2 speakers who have spoken first in the adjournment debate. They did so with splendid preparation. They had a splendid case and their good humour and their wit were enjoyed by all. Their verses, I have no doubt, will been anthologized for many years to come. It is not often realised how well read is the Leader of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly,</inline> and how often he goes back to the basis of his faith, political and otherwise. When he first stood for Parliament in a seat which was later abolished, his slogan was: Give us this day our Daly Fred'. I would not deny that he has come out with some better slogans in the succeeding 32 years. </para>

        <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party, the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> referred to Fred Daly's birth place, Currabubula.

I went back to a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> of Anzac Day, this year or last year- it does not give the year.

        <para>My old school teacher, Miss Nell Campbell, once said to me'. "You haven't any brains at all. You are sure to end up in politics".' </para>
        <para class="block">Fred Daly did end up in politics. He got in extraordinarily young. Not only is he the father of the House, as the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party has said. He is also the father of the Parliament, as the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> has pointed out. He has certainly come a long way. He is in charge of members' transport. He came into the Parliament with an interest in this matter and some expertise. I believe that his last job before becoming a member of Parliament was in the bicycle area of Bennett and Wood. But he certainly has improved the quality of members* transport. Contrary to some newspaper reports, he did not speak in Caucus on this subject at all and he voted in favour of economy travel for members of Parliament and public servants. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, last weekend I was out in the back blocks, because I love the country and I am loved in the country. I was at a place twice as far away as Currabubula. It was Eulo. The nearest large town, 42 kilometres away, is Cunnamulla. I was at the lizard derby. The local member, my good friend the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett),</inline> said to me that Fred Daly had certainly made it easier for members with large electorates to discharge their electoral responsibilities. It is now possible for private members with large electorates to have access, to a degree that was not previously possible even for Ministers, to every form of transport, including charter aircraft. Again for the first time since  he became a member 32 years ago, Fred Daly has made it possible for members to receive additional electoral assistance. Again this reform was very gravely misrepresented, and he was traduced for it. There can be no question that members who have the responsibility of looking after the numbers of people that we do in this House and the range of matters on which we have to advise as we do in this House certainly needed that additional assistance. Members of Parliament, irrespective of their politics, can be indebted to this great parliamentarian for the faculties that he has made available to them. </para>
        <para>He has been a great parliamentarian. I think I can say that nothing has given him more satisfaction than being able to demonstrate that the 4 latest members of the ministry, Senators Wheeldon and James McClelland and Messrs Riordan and Berinson, got there because they had distinguished themselves as parliamentarians. Fred Daly loves this place. He loves the colour, the confrontation of it. He constantly advocates thai members of Parliament should devote themselves to the processes of the Parliament and follow the proceedings of the Parliament. He has pointed out to so many of our colleagues with legitimate aspirations that the best way to get further is to demonstrate then prowess in the Parliament, their willingness to give it and to take it in the Parliament, to follow its proceedings and to contribute to them. </para>
        <para>He has a capacious memory. Certainly nobody could have profited more from 32 years in Parliament then he. He knows precedents. He has mulled them over. He is creative in his adaptation of those precedents. I cannot say how much I am indebted to him for his conduct of the affairs of the House. There is no doubt that our affairs, in a time of extraordinary stress, politically and economically, have been conducted with the greatest dexterity by the Leader of the House. Also, he has done so with a degree of good humour which I never thought would have been possible. Since he became Leader of the House there have been only 2 occasions when it has sat after 1 1 p.m. On those 2 occasions the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lionel</inline> Bowen, was in charge. That means that we can always be sure of having a full day, an entertaining day and a wholesome night's rest. As we go to sleep peacefully and chastely in our beds at the Kurrajong or what-have-you, we can all bear in mind the fact that our day has been entertaining and our night will be restful because of the long experience and the dedication to this institution of our colleague the honourable member for Grayndler. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>rarely have 1 heard tonight's speakers to better advantage. I thank particularly my colleague the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> for his sincere and complimentary remarks. In return, may I say that he also is a very distinguished member of this House and his cheerful acceptance of giving and taking and suffering the disappointments that go with parliamentary life should be an example to all members of Parliament. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> said that my slogan was: 'Give us this day our Daly Fred'. But the Liberals on that occasion, as usual, were very dirty in their campaign and they put out a slogan that I thought was very nasty. It was: Be healthy, be liberal, be clean, change Daly. It was a good sign but they put it up in too many places near the gas works and it did not last long. I am happy to say that very few of my girls changed Daly. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I sincerely thank honourable members for their compliments. I thank my colleague, the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair).</inline> I have a soft spot for the Country Party although it may not always be apparent. I look with great concern at Ralph Hunt and worry about how he will go in the electorate. When I lived in Currabubula the only culture was agriculture. Now, under Liberal and National Country Party representation, they have really turned the corner. When I went to Currabubula to attend an art show even I bought a few products in the company of my distinguished friend from New England. I thank him sincerely for his complimentary remarks tonight. In other circumstances and at other times and if I had been misguided- you never know- I might have been a National Country Party member. Fortunately I saw the light in time and shifted to the city. </para>
        <para>I was interested also to hear my colleague the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> speak tonight. I am always worried about Philippi because I understand that when I get to Philippi I will know my hour has come. I am always embarrassed by the honourable member for Moreton because he is so intelligent that it takes me days to know whether I have been insulted or praised by him. Whenever he says anything about me the Library goes mad. Its officers say: 'Do you want to know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> said again?' I say: 'Yes'. They say to me: 'It is all right'. So I go and rest happily. The honourable member might recollect also that with one of those gags I sometimes shoot down 58 galahs. Little did we know the talent of the honourable members opposite for poetry. Tonight we heard it even from the National Country Party. That is really notable. The honourable member for Moreton is a well known poet in this place. I thank honourable members sincerely for their very generous remarks. I thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> who made possible my occupation of my present position, for his very complimentary remarks. </para>
        <para>When I came to this place I made Paul Keating look like a heavyweight. I weighed 8 stone 6 pounds and thought I knew everything; but when I looked across the table and saw Billy Hughes, the late John Curtin, the late Ben Chifley, not to mention the late Artie Fadden, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen, Harold Holt and Larry Anthony, the father of Doug Anthony, I knew that I was not the top weight that I thought I was. Politics has given to me the opportunity to live with some of the really great men on both sides of the Parliament. I came into this Parliament at the time of the war in 1943 and was here when Douglas MacArthur walked into the dining room, where we sat tonight, and it was a case of salvation through him, America and others. They are great memories of grim and difficult times. They are memories that I cherish and for which I have a great regard. I was privileged to enter the Parliament when I was young. They were formative years and years that I have never forgotten. I had the opportunity, thanks to my membership of the Labor Party and the support of the people in my district, to mingle with the greats of Australian politics and to have not only experiences but also memories that probably come to few people. </para>
        <para>It is interesting to note that at this stage there is nobody on the staff or in the Parliament who was here when I came here. There is a certain sadness about that, but a great deal of experience and many memories are associated with the time that has elapsed since I first came to the Parliament. The National Country Party will well remember the late Joe Abbott, a famous Country Party member. In those days there were great debates. We did see fit to nationalise the banks on one occasion. That not only frightened the banks but also, I think, frightened hell out of us. Few people would know what an exciting experience it is for an honourable member who has a majority of about 150 in an electorate of 70 000 to have to listen to thousands and thousands of protests about legislation. Some of our fellows had 2 people helping them- one opening the protests and the other destroying them, they were so frightened. </para>
        <para>People tell me today that we have problems but they just do not know what was around in those days. Not many people realise that during the war years, when we were looking for a vote, it was difficult even to get a sheep's liver. First of all a woman who wanted one had to go and get a medical prescription. Then she had to send it to the rationing commission, and then the rationing commission rang up the local member to see whether she was entitled to the liver, and if she was entitled to it she sent the prescription to the butcher. Then the butcher sent it to the rationing commission and in the end I sent her a letter and said: 'The liver is all right, madam; you can live a while longer'. It sounds funny now but it kept a lot of people alive. The Indian people in Australia wanted rice. Well, one was forever racing around looking for rice packets. Those kinds of things all happened in those years of conflict, and I have great memories of them. </para>
        <para>I found when I looked up the record tonight that I have served with 8 Prime Ministers, the vast majority of them, unfortunately, Liberals. I also found that I have been here in the time of 9 Governors-General. In addition to that, of course,- 1 served with other ex-Prime Ministers in Jim Scullin and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page and others. All in all they are memories worth recalling. A night like this in the Parliament is to me a tremendous thing and I thank sincerely those on both sides of the House who have made it possible. </para>
        <para>When I was elected to Parliament I was told that I was a oncer. I ask those honourable members opposite who hold slim seats to remember that. Then I won the second time and I was a twicer. Then the electors made me a lifer, which made me happier still. The point about the thrust of politics is that it is a dangerous thing to make permanent enemies on either side or even in one's own Party because the fellow who is against you today may be with you tomorrow. Consequently while we fight bitterly here, I always think that it is like a football match. You want to be able to forget what has happened if you can. But emotions run deep, issues are great and, of course, inevitably we get into conflict sometimes in a way that involves us much more deeply than we would wish. </para>
        <para>In the Parliament we represent all sections. No matter who we might be, we are privileged and tremendously fortunate to be members of Parliament when we realise that there are only 127 of us out of a population of 13 million. When we think things are bad, we should remember that we have been chosen to act in the interests of the people whom we want to see enjoy a good way of life, free and secure economically and in every way. </para>
        <para>Generally speaking I have had great friendships on both sides of the Parliament. I will never forget how magnificent my friend the honourable member for Moreton was on one occasion. It was a magnificent occasion. Even the then Prime Minister said so. I value his friendship although I would not like him to represent me in court. But he is all right to listen to here. </para>
        <para>Having said so much, I would like to thank again sincerely members of this House. I have spoken tonight in a somewhat congenial and frivolous way but I would like honourable members to know that the way in which I have spoken does not hide the sincerity I feel tonight for the comradeship displayed in this gathering and for the sentiments expressed by all who have spoken. In every way this will be a golden day in my political career. It will be something to remember; something to record. I never thought on that long day. 32 years ago today that I would see such a day. To you all I express my sincere thanks for a really great compliment which is deeply appreciated. I will seek to restore first class air travel and also cut out the use of the gag and the guillotine as a gesture of my appreciation and goodwill to you all. </para>

          <para>- I do not wish to appear to be discourteous after what has been said but perhaps honourable members may have thought that the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> was going to retire undefeated. In this Parliament on 27 September 1973 I proposed by way of a private member's motion, which was carried, that the Australian Government and the Victorian Government get together to plan the use of our natural resources of brown coal. This objective could be achieved by way of a carefully planned program and feasibility studies into the establishment of a national project for the production of oil from coal. My request was for the Australian Government to co-operate and to assist the Victorian Government to bring this about. That move was made 2 years ago during which time the only activity of any consequence has been in Victoria. But let that not be a criticism to any great degree of the Australian Government because there are some real reservations on the part of the Victorian Government about the possibility of a Connor takeover. With the great earnestness that our Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> may have to carry out such an exercise- I am pleased that he is sitting in the chamber tonight- there would be no possibility of his doing so because of the proprietary rights which are Victoria's over the La Trobe Valley coal, and I think that the Minister might agree with me on that point. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In my earnestness to have this national project and national necessity become a reality I asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy a number of questions about this matter. Because of the information that I had acquired about the process of getting oil from coal, I made a private trip overseas to West Germany and to the German Democratic Republic. My trip has widened my vision and confirmed the points of view that I held. Obtaining oil from coal is part of a total energy concept in the German Democratic Republic. There are great opportunities for Australia to become self sufficient or independent producers of the oil which we badly need if our Federal and State governments co-operate and come together in a genuine and mutual arrangement. They could quickly put together all the available technical knowledge that is known to Germany and to Australia and the financial resources could be co opted to finance the project. </para>
        <para>Without authority I proposed to the Minister of Science and Technology and to the Foreign Minister in the German Democratic Republic that it might be possible to form a consortium. This is being considered by the German Democratic Republic. Its contribution could be the provision of machinery and know-how. I advise this course as a matter of urgency because apart from the fact that a properly financed oil from coal project can be a viable proposition in itself, it opens up great opportunities for trade. The German Democratic Republic is anxious to be a successful tenderer for the provision of the equipment and technical know-how. It made this quite plain and quite clear to me in my discussions with several of its Ministers during my visit there. </para>
        <para>I want this House and this Government to know that as a private member of this Parliament I was welcomed into serious discussions on the oil from coal requirement's, and I promised to tell this Parliament of the discussions and of the goodwill which was generated because of the frankness of the discussions. As I was eager to encourage trade - on a reciprocal basis I had with me the Australian Trade Commissioner in East Berlin, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr John</inline> Morey. I want to say here that Australia is fortunate in having a man of the quality and high integrity of this officer negotiating in every available avenue of trade. The purpose of my address to this Parliament is to alert the Government of the fact that there are great opportunities for developing potential trade. Obtaining oil from coal presents one very real avenue. The keenness of the Ministers of the German Democratic Republic to trade was kindled, but it was equally matched by </para>
        <para class="block">John Morey and myself to make it reciprocal trade. I pressed the German Democratic Republic to consider taking some of the great quantities of beef which are available in Australia, as well as our minerals. If by any chance this Government were objective enough to offer financial assistance to Victoria to get the oil project off the ground, these are some of the trading opportunities which could be successfully negotiated. </para>
        <para>Whilst I was in the German Democratic Republic I was hosted as an official representative of this Parliament. I was given every courtesy and every opportunity to see for myself the process of a total energy concept. I believe that as a private member and as a back bench member of the Opposition I have done my part in continuing to foster interest in the production of oil from coal. I believe that it is the responsibility of the Australian Government and of the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> to offer to assist the Victorian Government either by way of a direct financial grant or as a partner in a consortium to get this national project to a stage where the Victorian Government can negotiate with the suppliers for the necessary machinery and technical know-how. </para>
        <para>If the Minister for Minerals and Energy wants to see Australia independent of imported oils and totally capable of producing the heavy oil now required for refinery processes he should heed what I am saying. I have told the House before that Australia will be in a precarious position in the event of any aggression. If we were realistic we would see that this proposition as pan of our defence effort. I appeal to the Government to realise the importance of trading opportunities which should be fostered between countries. We cannot afford to close our eyes to the opportunities which are available to us. </para>
        <para>I can do no more than genuinely and seriously request that as a Federal Government, we assist Victoria to launch this oil from coal project so that our trade commissioners throughout the world can seize the opportunity to use that in trade negotiations. If anyone doubts my ability to present the facts to prove my argument, then let me say this. I have seen oU produced from coal. I have seen the different methods by which it can be produced. I have seen the residual by-products and the importance of them. Australia would be a very independent and self-sufficient country if she embarked upon the project. I hope that I shall see some positive moves before our opportunities are lost to us and our trade potential with it. </para>

              <para>The purpose of the survey, which was conducted at a sample of addresses selected from CES records, was to identify differences between the Bureau's unemployment statistics and the CES figures. In accordance with Bureau policy concerning the confidentiality of information obtained in its collections, only aggregate estimates were supplied to my Department, neither the names of individuals included in the survey nor any particulars about them being provided. At all stages it was intended that the results of the survey, except for figures subject to sampling variability too high for most practical uses, would be published by the Department of Labor and Immigration. A report along these lines is now being prepared by the Department and I will arrange for it to be released as soon as it becomes available. </para>

              <para>and (4) The Department of Social Security was advised of the intention to conduct the survey and discussions were held with that Department on the question of extending it to encompass details of registrants in receipt of Unemployment Benefits. These discussions revealed that there would have been particular problems involved in ensuring the confidentiality of survey information and at the same time producing worthwhile results. Following completion of the survey the Minister for Social Security was advised of the results and the matter was further considered but, as the individual records from the survey had been destroyed by the Commonwealth Statistician, no action could be taken. </para>
