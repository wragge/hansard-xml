              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>we on this side of the House believe that our candidate, the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins),</inline> is a most admirable and honourable member to fill the office of the  Chairman  of Committees. Unlike the previous  Chairman  of Committees, he is not a lawyer, although he does come to the Parliament with a duo of academic successes, in the fields of medicine and science. I say this because while it is not important to hold legal qualifications to be a  Chairman  of Committees, the qualifications of the honourable member for Scullin do indicate the self-discipline and objectivity possessed by him, characteristics displayed so well by the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Berinson)</inline> during his tenure of office as  Chairman  of Committees. Primarily it is parliamentary experience rather than legal experience or academic qualifications that is the prerequisite for the holder of the office of  Chairman  of Committees or of  Speaker-  and one of the tasks of the </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline>of Committees is to deputise for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I believe that the honourable member for Scullin possesses the necessary requirements- an intimate understanding of parliamentary life, of the problems of members individually and collectively, and of the atmosphere of this House. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Scullin has had a long and distinguished apprenticeship inside and outside Parliament in the way of preparation for holding this position. He has served 14 years in Australian parliaments, 8 years as the member for Reservoir in the lower House of the Victorian Parliament, and the last 6 years, since 1969, as the honourable member for Scullin in this House, having been re-elected in 1972 and 1974. I believe that in all that time he has served his electorate with dedication, sincerity and distinction. Moreover, he is a person well versed in the committee system of Parliament. He was a member of the Printing Committee of the Victorian Parliament and was  Deputy Chairman  of the Statute Law Revision Committee in that State. He was appointed  Deputy Chairman  of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation on his election to this Parliament. I have served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, under his chairmanship, for more than 2 years, as have members on the other side of the House. He has been  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System since that Committee was established 1 1 months ago. He is also a member for the Privileges Committee of this House. I have mentioned all of those matters because it is in that extraordinary record of Committee service and as one of our former  Deputy  Chairmen of Committees that we have observed the qualities that make him an ideal candidate- integrity, judgment, a sense of humour, common sense and firmness tempered with understanding. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Scullin is a man of integrity, a virtue he demonstrated when he stood down as a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees this year over a matter that has forced all honourable members on both sides of this House to re-examine their conceptions and understanding of the chairmanship of this House. The persons who preside over the proceedings of this House are the protectors of the rights of the Parliament- not of the Executive or a political party- while acknowledging that the Government must control the business of the House. </para>
          <para>In my maiden speech in this House a few years ago I said that this Parliament was in danger of being seen by the public as an anachronistic gas chamber where politicians make wordy speeches, throw around inane interjections and manipulate parish pumps. That is a constant danger. Its avoidance depends upon the members themselves and the chairmanship of this House. Honourable members on this side of the House believe that their candidate- the honourable member for Scullin- possesses the qualities required to complement your own contribution, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> towards constantly raising the standards of this place in the eyes of the public, particularly at a time when the number of supporters of the Government and the Opposition is fairly close and the potential atmosphere is highly charged. We commend his candidature to the House. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>I regard it as being an honour to commend to you and to the House the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Philip</inline> Ernest Lucock, Commander of the Order of the British Empire and the honourable member for Lyne, as the  Chairman  of Committees of this House. For the smooth and efficient running of the House I think we should be looking at the aspect of service. In this respect I do not intend to go into such detail as did the honourable member for La Trobe. Service falls into 2 parts. Over a period of 23 years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> has provided a fully effective service to those whom he represents in his electorate of Lyne. It is not given to many to have the opportunity of serving the people for such a length of time. As we all know, periodically we have to face the public. The people of Lyne have continued to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> back to this place to serve them. Over that period he has demonstrated without doubt a knowledge of and an ability in relation to matters of Federal import over a very wide field. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Further, and more importantly, I refer to the qualifications he has for the specific task for which I have had the honour to nominate him. He served for a record term in the history of this Parliament- I emphasise that- as  Deputy Speaker  and  Chairman  of Committees. That service commenced from 8 March 1961 and, without going into further detail as to the exact date, I emphasise that it continued for a period of approximately 12 years. In addition he was associated with the work of the Chair in this Parliament before he was appointed  Deputy Speaker  and  Chairman  of Committees and he has been associated with it since that time, and this has given him an association either as a  Deputy Chairman,  of Committees or, as the position used to be called, a Temporary  Chairman,  and then  Chairman  of 1 7 or 1 8 years in all. There are many members of this Parliament who have witnessed the efficient and impartial manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> has conducted his work from the Chair. </para>
          <para>I would like to go to the words not of somebody from his own political party but of somebody from outside it. I refer to the last election of a  Chairman  of Committees when the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> said:  . . . having seen both contenders for the position in operation in the chair both as the  deputy  of the  Speaker  and as the  Chairman  of Committees, I would find it very difficult, I suppose, to choose between them in respect of their competency. The honourable member for Lyne during the period of his occupancy of the chair, in my view, performed very fairly and within the Standing Orders. </para>
          <para class="block">The person with whom he was comparing him, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, was</inline> you. I feel that that speaks for itself. The honourable member&#39;s record is a magnificent one; it would be very hard to beat. I firmly believe that that record will be added to on a further occasion. I commend to the House the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lucock</inline> to the position of  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

            <para>- I rise to endorse the nomination of the honourable member for Scullin for the position of  Chairman  of Committees. I will not traverse the historical facts that have been given by the honourable member for La Trobe. However, if you will forgive me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I would like to make one or two personal reminiscences. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jenkins</inline> for many years in the Australian Labor Party and my comments relate to my personal experience with him in that period and particularly to his capacity as a  chairman.  Many of us aspire to be chairmen. We all like to think that we know how to control things and people, and I can be accused of that; but, sadly, very few people are competent in this field. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am reminded that the very first occasion on which I got to know Harry Jenkins was when he was  chairman  of a Labor Party committee that was dealing with a very controversial topic, a topic which was known to be of an explosive nature. The people appointed to the committee were all at sixes and sevens. It was a measure of Harry&#39;s skill as a  chairman  that the committee brought in a unanimous report. He has shown that same skill in his time in this Parliament as  chairman  of committees which have dealt with quite controversial topics relating to the environment. He has managed so to encourage- not suppress- the full expression of points of view, and yet at the same time to maintain relevance on the part of the contributors, that he has succeeded in getting a large measure of unanimity or consensus of opinion on most of the committees with which he has been concerned. In short no doubt I will suffer like the rest of the members of this place if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jenkins</inline> is appointed to this position because he will force me, I hope like the rest of the members of this place, to be relevant. For these reasons I endorse his nomination. </para>

When he has been in charge of proceedings the House has always run very smoothly. He has a very sound knowledge of the operations that are required of the House and he carries them out to the very best of his ability. I feel somewhat like the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> felt when he was in a similar position last year, because I realise that the honourable member for Lyne and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jenkins</inline> are people who are both very capable and very able to carry out the duties of the position. If Phil Lucock is unfortunate enough not be be elected, then I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jenkins</inline> will be a good second string. I heartily endorse and recommend Phil Lucock for the position. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>I think that nothing could be said which would detract in any way from the personal merits of either candidate for this position. I am sure that personally both honourable members are qualified to occupy the position. I think that perhaps the Labor Party has been wise in nominating one of the few of its members who is likely to retain his seat after the next general election. </para>

          <para>On a more serious note, may I say this: There is generally a tradition in this House that the  Chairman  of Committees should come from the Government side. On the whole, I think that that is a good tradition. I am wondering whether in these particular circumstances, that tradition should be observed. The particular circumstances arise because of the habit of the Prime Minister of hectoring and intimidating the occupants of the chair or the Chairmen in this House. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>on behalf of the Government, and I have no doubt on behalf of all honourable members, I should like to congratulate the honourable member for Scullin on being elected as  Deputy Speaker.  It was a difficult choice for honourable members to make because we had to choose between 2 experienced parliamentarians and 2 gentlemen who are respected by every member of the House. It was a secret ballot. I suspect that the result would have been the same if there had been a division. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Lyne has held the office of  Deputy Speaker  for, 1 believe, a record term. The honourable member for Scullin has not been a member of this House nearly so long- barely a quarter of the time- but he had been for 8 years earlier a member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. He has already been a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees for 2 years in this House. He had been a member of parliamentary committees in the Victorian Parliament and, as we all know, he has been a member of many committees- standing committees, select committees and joint committees- as a member of this Parliament. He has been a member of the House Committee, he was the  Deputy Chairman  of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation, he is the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and he is the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. He has, moreover, been a member of the Australian delegation to the annual conference of the InterParliamentary Union at Paris in September 197 1 and a member of the Third International Parliamentary Conference on the Environment in Nairobi in April last year. It will be seen that he is an experienced and diligent parliamentarian. I congratulate him, as will all honourable members. There is only one other comment I must make: He is one of those doctors who are frank in acknowledging their politics and rational in advocating them. </para>

            <para>- For the Opposition I congratulate the honourable member for Scullin who has had a wide experience and who, I believe, will serve the Parliament well. The Prime Minister pointed to the fact that it was a difficult decision for honourable members of this House and that the honourable member for Lyne also is exceedingly well qualified to fill this position. So he is. I say to the Prime Minister that the House will be given an opportunity at some stage for the decision to be reversed. I have no doubt that it will be. That in no way indicates ill will to the honourable member who has won the vote on this occasion. It is not indicating any ill will to him to say that I believe that his holding of the position will not be all that long lived. Nothing should be read into that remark. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Scullin, as  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System, has a real concern for the arrangements of this House; he has a real concern to see that there is reform, to bring the procedures and practices of the House of Representatives into the 20th century and to equip it to go into the 2 1st century. I hope that his new responsibilities will in no way delay the report which I know he has been pursuing, with his Committee members, with diligence. There is a real need for reform in many areas and avenues of the work of this House. This is not the time to canvass the sorts of things which should be done, but the need for reform is very clear. It cannot come about unless there is a government which has a will to make the Parliament work. If there is a government or a Prime Minister who seeks to by-pass the Parliament, then presumably the report of the Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System will be left aside and not acted upon. I say again that there will be a government which will be concerned for the procedures and practices of this House. I hope that the report which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jenkins</inline> will be tabling at the appropriate time will lay the ground work for reform which will complement his chairmanship of the committees of this House. </para>
          <para>The Opposition will co-operate with the  Chairman.  We will support his decisions always when we believe them to be right. We will uphold the dignity of the chairmanship, as we do in relation to yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because propriety of performance in this House is something about which I believe every honourable member is concerned. I am glad that the Government has put forward a candidate of whom I hope all members of this House can be proud in his performance in the position. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I add my congratulations to the honourable member for Scullin on being elected  Chairman  of Committees and your  Deputy.  He has had a good deal of parliamentary experience, although we have not seen a great deal of his experience in this position in the House. However, we wish him well in the new position. I know that he hopes he will be in the position for some time. I have to warn him that there is nothing very permanent about positions in this Government, where ministerial changes are a regular pattern of government and where the  Speaker  and the  Chairman  of Committees seem to hold their positions for only a very short time. However, we hope that he displays a good deal of capacity either as the  Deputy Speaker  or  Chairman  of Committees in seeing that the procedures of the House are carried out quickly and succinctly and that Ministers do not use this chamber as a forum for party political purposes or for filibustering. There would be one or two exceptions. I would not mind if Ministers were to spell out the Government&#39;s policies in a few areas. I am thinking particularly of minerals and energy, an area in which we have been waiting for <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years to hear a policy. It would be a pity, after such a distinguished record of national development, for us not even to know the policies and why we have no national development. I should like to say again that we are pleased with the election of the honourable member although we are disappointed that our own nominee was not elected. He is by far the most distinguished and the most experienced person in the House for this office. We know that in the fullness of time he will be back in that position. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>it is with some humility that I thank the House for the honour that it has paid me in electing me to this position. I thank the honourable member for La Trobe and the Minister for the Media who put forward my name to the House. I am grateful for the words they had to say. I am even more grateful, after having chaired committees of which the Minister for the Media was a member over the years, to find he admits that there may have been occasions when I had to place a rein on his exuberance. I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, for</inline> your congratulations. I thank the Prime Minister for the words he had to say. Of course I must also thank the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia for their remarks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As was indicated, I have been a member of parliament for a good many years. I have seen fortunes wax and wane. I am under no illusions about what happens in parliaments. I am grateful, however, that the Leader of the Opposition made some remarks with regard to the question of parliamentary procedures. I believe that we are facing an era in which changes have to be made. I trust that the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System, which he mentioned, will very soon be able to make worthwhile, sensible and dignified suggestions. To the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia I say that term of office does not worry me. The thing is that the task is ahead and that the task should be properly carried out. I trust that, the House having given me its confidence, I will be able to carry out my duties, to maintain the dignity of the parliamentary institution and to allow the proper conduct of its business, the business for which we are all here. I thank the House. </para>

            <para>- The question is not one which I can answer at this stage because the matter of the funding of the RED scheme is a matter contained in the Budget, as I would expect the honourable member to know. However, I do want to say that the unemployment figures were certainly disappointing but I do not believe that it is appropriate to look at them in their totality and to say there is doom, gloom and nothing more. For example, there has been a significant increase in employment in the clothing and textile industries. I think that should be emphasised. I also think it should be emphasised that, whereas the figures are quite high and unacceptably high at the present time for unemployed persons, those figures should nonetheless be considered in conjunction with the figures that have applied previously. For example, as at July 1972, let the record be clear, under the LiberalCountry Party Government there were 95 732 unemployed persons, excluding school leavers and we are, therefore, looking at something less than 150 000 extra. </para>

              <para>- I take the point of the Leader of the National Country Party: What is an extra 150 000? It is a very great number indeed. It is a matter of very great concern to this Government that such a situation should have developed. I want to say this: The right honourable gentleman has little to crow about. If he looks back through the history of his Government when in office he will see a generation of neglect in terms of employment planning and labor planning and a complete lack of any manpower policy. The point I am wanting to raise at this time is that whereas the figures are extraordinarily high- my own view is that they have reached about the height and will go little if any further, and will start to improve significantly- the fact of the matter is that under the full employment program of the Liberal-Country Party Government almost 100 000 people were out of work. That is what those opposite call &#39;full employment&#39;. I would say this: After this Government&#39;s policies are implemented and inflation is stabilised, there will be a significant improvement in the employment position. </para>

            <para>-The answer is definitely no. I am the Minister for Australia, and I do not favour any State. In particular, in the period in which this Government has held office, there has been a distinct forging ahead of coal exports from Queensland. It is a very distinct one. In the current year, of a total of 30 million tons to be exported, no less than 1 7.5 million tons will come from Queensland. As for the innuendo- and the repeated innuendo- that somehow I am favouring the South Coast district, in point of fact in this year there will be a reduction in its exports of coal from 4.5 million tons to 4 million tons. As I see the future, Queensland will forge ahead. It has huge resources easily won and, by the very nature of orthodox technology, it will continue to progress. </para>

Is it a fact that the Minister is refusing the Holyman shipping company consent to charter the roll-on roll-off vessel Wanaka and that this refusal could lead to further increased freight rates to Tasmania? Is it a fact that Tasmanian primary industry and secondary industry are being crippled by the freight rate increases approved by the Minister in recent months? Will the Minister tell the House what steps the Government proposes to take to relieve the crippling freight rate burden on Tasmania? </para>

            <para>-It is perfectly true that the William Holyman company has made several approaches to me concerning bringing new ships, or imported ships, on to the Australian coast. I have given the company a number of extensions of time with respect to a ship it already has on the coast- a ship that was built overseas and imported into Australia. I have cooperated with the company. The former honourable member for Bass, the Honourable Lance Barnard, spoke to me about this matter on a number of occasions and I co-operated with him and gave the company every assistance possible. It is true to say that at this stage I have not approved the importation of the ship from New Zealand that the company is desirous of bringing to Australia. The matter is still under consideration. It will be interesting to hear what the Opposition has to say on whether it believes in the importation of second hand ships to the disadvantage of the Australian shipbuilding industry. If the Holyman company is prepared to build a replacement ship in Australia, we will be able to give the matter more favourable consideration. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will deal now with the other part of the honourable member&#39;s question, which was about the freight rates that apply to Tasmania being crippling. Let me say to the honourable member that when the Party of which he is now a member was in government it did nothing whatsoever to assist Tasmania as far as freight rates are concerned. It continually increased freight rates and gave no assistance whatsoever in this place. As far as the actions of the present Government are concerned, the recent 40 per cent increase in freight rates was applicable throughout Australia. It was applicable not only to Tasmania but also to other people using the Australian National Line for the carriage of general cargo. That increase was necessary because of the increases that had occurred in port charges, the cost of fuel and the cost of labour and as a result of industrial disputes. Those matters placed an additional burden on the ANL and on other shipping companies. The real position, as the Prime Minister has said, is that the present Government will endeavour to assist the people of Tasmania. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the real facts. This year we will be subsidising northbound freight to the extent of $4m to $5m. That is $4m to $5m more than the Party of which the honourable member for Bass is now a member was ever prepared to pay. We are paying a subsidy of $ 1 m a year in respect of the <inline font-style="italic">Empress of Australia.</inline> That is $lm more than the honourable member&#39;s Party was ever prepared to spend. The carriage of wheat from the mainland to Tasmania will be subsidised to the extent of about $1.8m. Let us boil down the matter in facts and figures. Every Tasmanian family is receiving from the present Government a subsidy of about $80 a year. On a per capita basis that represents about $22 for every man, woman and child in Tasmania. As a result of action taken by the Whitlam Labor Government, freight rates are being subsidised. </para>
          <para>Representatives of the paper manufacturers saw me and said that they were being disadvantaged by the increase in freight rates. I asked them with whom they were in competition. They certainly are not in competition with any other Australian paper manufacturer, because there is none. I explained to them that if they were experiencing problems with respect to paper imports the way to go about overcoming them was to approach either the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Industries Assistance Commission and to seek an increase in tariff protection. That is up to them. It is not up to the Department of Transport to determine the extent and the degree of disability that they might incur. As far as the other bulk commodities that are being exported from Tasmania are concerned, the Tasmanian exporters are not in competition with anyone else. Other Australian bulk commodity handlers have to pay the increase. There is no reason why the Tasmanian bulk section should not likewise be required to carry it. As far as southbound traffic is concerned, it was clearly established in a Bureau of Transport Economics study that was carried out late in 1972 and presented to the Parliament in 1973 that a considerable amount of the southbound freight comes under price equalisation and therefore Tasmania is not disadvantaged. All the bunkum that has been printed about the effect the increase will have on prices in reality cannot be borne out by the facts. </para>
          <para>So that the people would get a fair go the Government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nimmo</inline> to carry out a study of the requirements of the situation and what should be done about it. But the real answer to the problem is the establishment of an Inter-State Commission so that the facts and figures can be established and so that all the details can be brought out. It is the Opposition which is frustrating the establishment of an Inter-State Commission. In fact if the Opposition had allowed the legislation to go through the Senate, the Inter-State Commission at this stage would have been operational and would have been in the position to carry out a detailed investigation into any disability from which Tasmanians suffer and which the Liberal and Country Party governments in 23 years of office were not prepared to tackle. </para>

              <para>- I thought it was incredible too. However, it was offered in a humourous fashion so I did not take offence. In November last year the station broke the rules as laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The breach was of the rules laid down in regard to the time for which advertisements can appear on television stations. I might point out that those rules were laid down by the Control Board long before we came into power. They are the sorts of rules that the Opposition when it was in government lived with and we are still living with them. That is not to say that the Opposition when in government necessarily liked them any more than we necessarily like them, but that is the situation. As a result of the breaking of the agreement which every other commercial television station seeks to observe- and I want to point that out- the Minister at the time wrote to this station in the following terms: </para>

          <para class="block">This is the answer to the question raised by the honourable member about which part of the Act we are operating under-  to take action to suspend the licence for the operation of the station. However, as I have stated publicly on several occasions, the Australian Government is not prepared to countenance breaches of the standards. In the present case, therefore, I have decided to take no action pending an assurance from you that steps have been taken to bring the seriousness of the matter to the attention of the management and that adequate procedures have been established to ensure that there will be no further cause for complaint in this area. </para>
          <para class="block">That was written in November 1974.

          <para>I personally do not care much about this particular regulation. I think that people who look at commercial television have to expect to view advertising. I take it that the rule was brought in because people, while they want to look at commercial advertising and are prepared to accept the screening of advertisements as a penalty for doing so, still want limitations placed upon the amount of time during which advertising can be shown. Limitations were placed by the previous Government and we are still abiding by the same rule and regulation. The station concerned gave an explanation as to why the breach had occurred and I accepted its explanation. But it does not alter the fact that the station had broken the rules. </para>
          <para>So we are faced with the question as to whether we should ignore the law. If we should, I will stop the Control Board bothering trying to implement that particular law. Why waste money having people sitting in front of television sets timing the length of advertisements if when one discovers that someone has broadcast an advertisement for longer than he should have, one does nothing about it? Let us stop pretending. However, that is a different question. </para>
          <para>The fact is that the law is as it is. So I chose to suggest to the station that I would require it to go off the air unless it could make some alternative suggestion. I will not bother reading the letter. Needless to say, I gave warning that I intended to suspend the station. I again want to point out that there is no alternative for me. I either ignore the station&#39;s transgression or I suspend the station. As one critical letter to me pointed out, any school child could have suggested an alternative penalty. I quite agree. But the law does not allow me to impose an alternative penalty. That is the fact. Needless to say, the gentlemen from the station came over to talk to me. I made it quite clear, after they had agreed that they had broken the regulations- they did not deny it- that something had to be done. I gave a very broad hint that as far as I was concerned, I had no desire to impose a penalty. If, in recognition of their transgression, they were prepared to - </para>

          <para>In view of the fact that TVT has had a very satisfactory record of compliance with the Board&#39;s Standards, you will understand that it is not my desire to exercise my power under Section 86 of the Broadcasting and Television Act to take action to suspend the licence for the operation of the station. However, as I have stated publicly on several occasions, the Australian Government is not prepared to countenance breaches of the Standards. In the present case, therefore, I have decided to take no action pending an assurance from you that steps have been taken to bring the seriousness of the matter to the attention of the management and that adequate procedures have been established to ensure that there will be no further cause for complaint in this area. </para>

          <para>Your acknowledgement of our station having a satisfactory record of compliance with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board &#39;s Standards and the statement that you do not desire to suspend our licence is very much appreciated. However, the threat and the danger is clear in what you have said. We have critically reviewed our procedures in order to ensure that breaches do not occur. </para>
          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McRae,</inline> 29 July 1975 </para>
          <para>I have received a report from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, advising me that station TVT has again been found to be in breach of the Board &#39;s Advertising Time Standards. You will recall that, in replying on 20 December 1974, to a letter from my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, regarding breaches which occurred on 10 November 1974, you stated that you had critically reviewed station procedures in order to ensure that further breaches would not occur. </para>
          <para>The latest excesses which occurred on Saturday and Sunday, 3 and 4 May, have been taken up by the Board with the station management, and in the opinion of the Board the explanations received from the station did not satisfactorily account for the breaches. </para>
          <para>Details of the breaches are set down below: </para>

          <para>I am told that your General Manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> Carter, has informed the Board that, as a result of these breaches, he has established a continuity department under the direct supervision of the station program manager, whose responsibility it will be to ensure that the Board &#39;s standards will be observed at all times. </para>
          <para>Notwithstanding this action by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carter</inline> I am satisfied that in all the circumstances the appropriate course open to me is to consider suspending the licence granted to Tasmanian Television Ltd, in respect of the operation of the station. Accordingly I am enclosing a formal notice of my intention to take such action pursuant to the provisions of Section 86 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1975. As required by sub-section 2(b) of Section 86, before reaching a final decision in the matter, I will take into consideration any action by Tasmanian Television Ltd, to prevent the recurrence of similar breaches. </para>

          <para>Thank you for your letter of 1 August, in response to my letter and notice of 29 July. </para>
          <para>I have noted your comments on the factors surrounding your station&#39;s breaches of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board&#39;s Advertising Standards. It is clear from your letter that you are in no way challenging the fact that the breaches, as outlined in my earlier letter to you, did in fact occur. I note that you have not been able to supply any information in explanation of these breaches additional to that already provided to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and to me in our meeting on 3 1 July. </para>
          <para>I reiterate my conviction, which I expressed to you at our meeting, that a licensee must assume full responsibility for the conduct of its television station. This responsibility extends to ensuring that staff, at all levels, comply with applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. The application of these provisions must be uniform and universal. It was my impression that, at our meeting, you accepted this proposition. </para>
          <para>I did, however, indicate to you that I was prepared to differentiate between an inadvertent and a deliberate infringement of a regulation in terms of the penalty applicable. On the advice tendered to me by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, I am prepared to accept that your station&#39;s breaches of the regulations were inadvertent rather than deliberate. However, I am also convinced there is an element of negligence involved. In view of this I believe 1 have no course other than to apply some form of penalty. </para>
          <para>The Broadcasting and Television Act provides only one penalty; suspension of a licence for a period not exceeding 7 days. I would rather avoid .applying such a penalty in this situation. However, I am convinced that some action must be taken. </para>
          <para>Unless I receive from you by 5.00 p.m. Thursday 7 August, an acceptable alternative suggestion as to some action you will undertake which will demonstrate public acknowledgement of the breaches and will penalise the station in some way, I am obliged to suspend your licence for an appropriate period. </para>

              <para>- Having had this informal discussion with representatives from the station, I made it clear that if they were prepared to make a gesture it would resolve the difficulty. For  example, they could refrain from having advertisements on for the period for which they had transgressed. As I got a bit of feedback that might put them in a difficult position with their advertisers, I would have let them put their advertisements on and donate the proceedings to a charity. I was perfectly happy to accept that proposal. </para>

              <para>-No, not to the Labor Party-to an acceptable charity which they could nominate themselves. I ask the honourable member not to get scungy about it. I was perfectly happy with either of those possibilities, in which case I would not have imposed a penalty. That would have signified that the station had recognised that a mistake had been made. That was all that I thought ought to be done. However, I subsequently learned- I cannot vouch for this, but I have been told- that the station representatives were leant on by somebody and told not to do this sort of thing. They had to stand up and resist the monster from Canberra, I take it. So, in my view, I had no alternative but to flick them with a feather duster. That is all it was really; let us face it. I could have taken the station off the air for a whole week. The suspension was for only 2 hours to make the point. If all the commercial networks are in an uproar about it, I am perfectly happy to meet them and discuss alternative proposals so that we can introduce a Bill into this House to change the Act. Hopefully honourable members opposite will endorse the proposal, as we will. We will then get more adult, sensible and intelligent means of control- if control is needed -for commercial stations. </para>

I have not had the benefit of discussing the matter with the Postmaster-General but I am assured that the Australian Postal Commission itself has discussed the matter. There have been a lot of groundless fears and a lot of suggestions that changes are going to be made, but I understand there is no truth in them. If there is anything I have to add which I can acertain by further inquiry, I will let the honourable member know. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable gentleman for the question because I too have had a number of inquiries about the matter and it has been the subject of speculation in the Press. Honourable members will recall the passing of the Family Law Bill through this House. It received the royal assent on 12 June 1975. There is a section in it, section 41, that requires me to confer with the various State Attorneys on the subject to give them the option of setting up family courts within the various States of the Federation. That consultation has been going on. I have attended personally on each of the State Attorneys, which has taken time in itself. The matter has been the subject of correspondence, and I can tell the House now that I have been informed by the Attorneys in each of the States, other than Western Australia, that they do not wish to set up a family court in their States. I imagine that the decisions in the States had to be considered by the respective Cabinets. New South Wales and Victoria were fairly early off the mark, but I was informed by the Minister for Justice in Queensland only a week or 10 days ago that Queensland does not wish to set up a family court in Queensland but would prefer the Family Court of Australia to operate there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNeill</inline> in Western Australia has told me that he prefers to set up a family court of Western Australia, and no doubt that will be done in due course there. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are other aspects that have to be considered. For example, the Act in its present form puts a limitation on the number of judges that may be appointed. It restricts the number to seven. In view of the developments I have outlined to the House, the number will now have to be increased. That will be the subject of regulations that I will be introducing into the Parliament in the not too distant future. There are the problems of acquiring premises, recruiting staff, having interviews, placing advertisements and providing for appeals within the Public Service for people who might want to claim that they should have a position. However, I am happy to tell the House now that the date when we hope to have, or will have, the Family Law Act operating is 5 January 1976. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor. I refer to his refusal to answer the question whether there will be an allocation of funds to the Regional Employment Development scheme in the Budget. Is the RED scheme funded by Supply until 30 November? Has the RED scheme in fact already run out of money voted for it, which was to last until 30 November, because of the huge increase in demand for RED funds resulting from the Government&#39;s causing over 250 000 people to be unemployed? </para>

            <para>- I repeat what I said earlier. The RED scheme and its future activities and funding are contained in the Budget. I want to take up again the point that the honourable gentleman raised about unemployment created by the Government. I categorically deny his assertion. Horse laughs from the Opposition do not add any more credit to that assertion. The fact of the matter is that the economy has been through a period of downturn in the same way as similar economies in western Europe, North America and Japan have gone through a downturn. The Government has illustrated over recent monthsand I believe it will illustrate it even more clearly in the immediate future- its very great concern to bring inflation under control. There is simply no doubt that the level of inflation has been responsible for a significant increase in the rate of unemployment. I believe that this is now being accepted by large sections of the community. I would simply say this to the honourable gentleman who asked the question: If he believes that unemployment in Australia can be rectified simply by having bigger and better RED schemes, I have less respect for him than 1 had previously. </para>

            <para>-I noted the comment in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> this morning. The Government was not rocked. We were well aware of the dimensions of the deficit for the month of July. It is usual for the July monthly deficit to be bulging in comparison with other months. On this occasion there was an added reason. I ought to point out that it is also usual for the development of the deficit to be more significant in the first half of the financial year than in the second half. However, there were special circumstances that affected this July. Unusually in the second half of last financial year there was a substantial increase in Government outlays consciously injected into the economy for the purpose of supporting the private sector. In fact, over the 12- monthly period the additional outlays over those proposed in the Budget were of the order of $ 1 ,600m. It is possible to identify about $ 1 ,300m of that amount as having a fairly direct stimulatory effect for the private sector. I wonder whether anyone on the opposite side of the House would argue that stimulation should not have been provided. If honourable members opposite do argue that way I would ask them: From under what sectors do they propose to pull the pins? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The facts are that the level of the deficit in July was anticipated. The people who advise us, the technical people who assist this Government, are the same technical people who assisted previous Liberal-Country Party governments. They were competent in these things then; they are competent now. We were well informed. As honourable members will discover from the Budget tonight, an appropriate calculation has been made for this and for all other factors in the economic management of the country over the next 12 months. The last proposition put forward by the honourable member is an interesting one and I will consider it. </para>

I must say that I have not followed all the vagaries of the honourable gentleman&#39;s philosophy. The one that particularly remains in my mind, of course, is this idea of imposed equality- that is, the idea that people should attain those positions to which they were born and the devil take the hindmost. It is quite clear that in the interstices of his philosophy there is an itch to dismantle those things which the Labor Government has introduced to bring equality of opportunity to all people in Australia, whether they were born here or migrated here, wherever they live in Australia and whatever their parents&#39; means were. The creation of equal opportunities should be the first task of any government, and it will continue to be the first preoccupation of the present Government. </para>

            <para>- It is not true that many thousands of young people living on the coast of Australia are drawing unemployment benefits. It is the intention of the Government to make absolutely certain that anyone who is in receipt of social security benefits receives them because they are due to him and not because he is infringing the regulations in any way. The Department of Social Security carries out work tests and makes checks on the people who are receiving unemployment benefits. In the last few months in particular many young people and others have had their unemployment and sickness benefits discontinued because they have been detected infringing the regulations. It is the Government&#39;s intention to review continuously the payment of social security benefits to make certain that they are paid only to people who are entitled to receive them. </para>

            <para>- I do not remember seeing many reports on the subject; so I will not venture to categorise any reports as mischievous. The Government did not consider the Industries Assistance Commission interim report on superphosphate. I expect that it will be doing so at the next Cabinet meeting or the one after. The honourable gentleman mentions one of the Government committees. I have no doubt that that committee would bring down an overwhelming endorsement of the majority opinion of the IAC I am equally certain that the Government Economic Committee would bring down an overwhelming endorsement of the minority IAC opinion. So, if the honourable gentleman is seeking to give the Cabinet the benefit of committee advice on this, perhaps he could get the 2 committees together. I would imagine that then we would be dealing with a majority report and a minority report. As the honourable gentleman knows, in all these matters the Government publishes the report as early as possible. It also seeks the advice of all the relevant departments. </para>

Is it true that only 4 members of the 27-man Ministry met representatives of primary industry for pre-Budget discussions and that one of those members could not or would not spare the time to sit through those discussions? Is it true that the 3 Ministers who sat through the discussions were the Minister for Environment, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs? </para>

            <para>- I do not know what one can do with people who deliberately set about to infringe an Act of Parliament and who refuse to abide by the regulations which are laid down. That is not the only thing which is happening with doctors under the Medibank system. Some doctors are refusing to refer patients to a specialist because that specialist is bulk billing. It is entirely unjust for people to suggest that we are wrong in introducing Medibank. We are trying to introduce in Australia a health scheme which the people want. For the medical profession to take the action it is taking to try to sabotage Medibank is, to me, absolutely callous, as the honourable member has said. We will continually review the activities of the medical profession and of chemists who act as agents under Medibank to see that the people of Australia receive the benefits of a health system to which they are entitled. </para>

            <para>- I have studied the results of the South Australian elections. They were very satisfactory from every point of view. They even resulted in a change of leadership in the Liberal Party. The results of the elections, particularly for the Upper House, indicated that optional preferential voting is a very effective method of giving democracy in a real way to all people in the country. I noticed that in South Australia 6 Australian Labor Party members were elected to the Upper House, with 3 Liberal Party members and 2 Liberal Movement members. Under the optional preferential system one had only to vote on a group basis for one candidate. As a matter of fact, on one occasion in this Parliament that method was suggested to this House by that outstanding radical, the honourable member for Sturt. It is a method which commends itself to a lot of people throughout the country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Until 1973 in South Australia the Liberal Party had 16 members in the Upper House and the Australia Labor Party 4 members. In other words, voting for the Legislative Council was under restrictive franchise and most undemocratic. Thanks to the optional preferential system real democracy prevails in South Australia as far as the election of members to the Upper House is concerned. It has now 10 members of the Australia Labor Party, 9 members of the Liberal Party and 2 members of the Liberal Movement. I believe the optional preferential system of voting is one of the most democratic advances which this country can endorse. It was opposed by the Opposition in another place, and here also, when we sought to introduce it for Senate elections, but in South Australia there has been no complaint by any section of the community or any political party about the result or the methods employed. </para>
          <para class="block">Might I just give a bit of advice, which I rarely give to those opposite? They should follow the example of South Australians, introduce an optional preferential system in accordance with what has been presented to the Australian Parliament by the present Government, and in that way we would get the democratic results that have come on this occasion to the South Australian Upper House. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">The customs tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed amendments to the Customs Tariff 1966-1974. These proposals formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by gazette notices during the last recess. The changes arise from the Government&#39;s decisions on the recommendations of the Textiles Authority in its report on certain yarns and textile products and of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on nitrogenous fertilizers. </para>
        <para>Also included in the proposals are the addition of further commodities to Schedule A of the New Zealand- Australia Free Trade Agreement and a modification of the developing countries&#39; preference in respect of toy balloons. Changes of an administrative nature in the footwear area of the tariff have also been made to remove certain redundant provisions. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes and the origin of each of the alterations contained in the proposals is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">On 5 June 1975, the House disagreed to the amendments that the Senate had made earlier that day to the Superannuation Bill 1975. The reasons adopted by the House for disagreeing to the amendments were: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Because the superannuation arrangements for Australian Government employees that would result from the amendments proposed would be detrimental to many existing contributors to the present superannuation pension scheme: would compare unfavourably with the superannuation schemes maintained by the State governments for their employees; and would result in complex and difficult administrative arrangements. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Senate, however, on 1 1 June 1975 decided to insist on the amendments. </para>
        <para>The Senate amendments change the new superannuation scheme in the following way: The standard Government-financed retirement pension benefit of 50 per cent of final salary would be available only on retirement at age 65 after 30 years contributory service with reduced benefits for retirement before that age so as to provide a 40 per cent of final salary pension at age 60. Because this would result in a reduction in benefits presently attainable on retirement before age 65, existing pension scheme contributors would be allowed to continue under the conditions of the present scheme providing that they contributed at the higher age 60 retirement rates. The supplementary Government-financed pension of one-half of one per cent of salary for each year of contributory service in excess of 30 years before reaching age 60, which would lift the maximum Government-financed pension from 50 per cent of salary after 30 years to 55 per cent after 40 years, would be eliminated. The one times consumer price index post-retirement updating of new age retirement pensions would be confined to the Government-financed element. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that, with the amendments of the Senate, contributors to the present pension scheme, overall, would be 9.8 per cent worse off under the new scheme. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard estimates prepared by the Treasury of capital costs of the new scheme, as amended by the Senate, compared to present scheme costs. </para>

            <para>- I thank the House. By far the worst feature of the Senate amendments is the option provision that would allow contributors to the present pension scheme to remain in that scheme providing they contributed at the higher age 60 retirement rates. The problems and defects of the present pension scheme are well documented. It is most complex and expensive to administer and is rapidly becoming unworkable. Yet the option provision would require the scheme to be continued for many years into the future, conjointly with the present scheme. Moreover, for older contributors the option would be largely worthless. The choice for the older age 60 contributors would be either to accept the lower overall benefits of the new scheme, as amended by the Senate, or to condemn themselves to penury by remaining in the present scheme and trying to meet rapidly escalating contributions in their last years of service. The older age 65 contributors would be faced with an immediate substantial increase in their contributions to the age 60 basis if they elected tc remain in the present scheme, in most cases far beyond their capacity to pay. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Older contributors therefore would have little alternative but to accept transfer to the new scheme. Younger contributors, particularly those already contributing on an age 60 basis, faced with higher immediate contributions under the new scheme and not attracted by the lower overall benefits of the new scheme, would be most likely to elect to remain in the present scheme. It is these contributors who would ensure that the present scheme would need to be continued with all the attendant administrative problems and complexities. The situation would be worse than that which existed with defence forces retirement benefits from 1959 until 1972. </para>
        <para>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement providing 34 examples, calculated by the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office, of the immediate increases in contributions, expressed for convenience as percentages of salary, that would result upon members of various ages, salaries and length of service changing from age 65 to age 60 contributions. </para>

            <para>- I thank the House. The schedule also illustrates the very low contribution rates at young ages and the punitive rates at older ages that are characteristic of the present pension scheme. There is an urgent need to replace the present superannuation scheme for Australian Government employees but the new scheme, as amended by the Senate, would not be a reasonable alternative. An already difficult situation would be aggravated and widespread dissatisfaction throughout the Public Service and the other areas of Australian Government employment already covered by the Superannuation Act would surely result. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Government considers that, in the Superannuation Bill 1975, it has a reasonable solution to the problem of superannuation for Australian Government employees. The Senate &#39;s failure to pass the legislation has meant that the new scheme could not come into operation on 1 July 1975, the date of commencement specified in the Bill. Because of the very serious difficulties that would be associated with retrospective operation of the new scheme the Govenment therefore proposes to put aside the present Bill and shortly to introduce a new Bill in the same form, but providing for the scheme to come into operation from a date to be proclaimed. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition will vote against this motion. I want to draw attention immediately to the attitude displayed by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Minister Assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> in the prepared speech which he delivered in this House, a copy of which he handed to me 2 minutes ago for the first time.  His  speech underlined the attitude taken by the Government in this matter from the beginning which is that it is the perfect scheme. The Government offers this scheme to the Parliament, to the taxpayers as well as to Government employees on a take it or leave it basis- an all or nothing approach. That has been the attitude of the Minister and of other Ministers not only in this House but in the Senate. Their attitudes have been revealed as the debate has unfolded. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We, of course, have just had a lengthy recess. This matter reached a deadlock situation because of the action taken by the Government in June this year. At no time during that recess did the Government mention to the Opposition what it was thinking about this matter. It did not indicate whether there could be a meeting of the minds on some of the points. The Government&#39;s attitude is that there is nothing to be said for any of the Opposition&#39;s amendments and that it will bring in a new Bill to deal with the situation. The Australian Labor Party is the Government. It has to govern and has to deal with the existing situation. The attitude that, after all the discussions that have taken place, Parliament should not be permitted to make any amendments to the Bill, that there ought not to be any changes to this scheme because it is of such great perfection, is obviously silly. Indeed, representations have been made to me by people relying on advice that has been given by the Government and, indeed, by some of its advisers that that is the attitude of the Government and that we, in the Opposition, had something of a cheek to disagree in any way with these proposals. If that were the case what is Parliament for? </para>
        <para>I should like to refer to one or two matters in the relatively short time I am permitted to speak because this matter will continue obviously in the future. It must. I start off with the point that an all or nothing approach was the attitude of the </para>
        <para class="block">Government. When I stood in this place last, in June, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, who is sitting at the table, could not wipe the grin off his face. He thought he had an election winner and that it would see the Government through because of the great number of Commonwealth employees concerned. The AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> who is in the chamber- I am not sure whether he made a speech or interjectedindicated he was very pleased that this situation had arisen. Now, of course, they are not so sure that they are on an election winner and the tone is more muted. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Tourism and Recreation talked about what happened on 5 June. He did not add, as he could have, that when we sought to respond on 5 June the debate was gagged by his colleagues who are sitting on the benches behind him at this moment. The Minister went on to recite the reasons adopted by the House. I hope that he will be gracious enough to recall that the Opposition voted against those reasons and that what he calls the decision of the House was a motion supported by Labor Party supporters only. Of course, the way the motion reads is biased. It talks about our proposals being detrimental to existing contributors- although that has been explained- and speaks of our proposals comparing unfavourably with superannuation schemes maintained by the State governments. We have explained ad nauseam that changes made in the schemes in two of the States flowed from the proposals of this Government. The changes in those schemes were as a result of those proposals. I believe that those States will rue the day they took that action. </para>
        <para>We in this place have a responsibility to look at Government proposals and proposed laws and to decide what is responsible and what is not. We recognise that the present superannuation scheme needs to be changed. We have emphasised every time this matter has come up for debate, and on behalf of the Opposition in Press releases and statements that I have prepared, the features of the new scheme that we think are desirable. But, when our amendments were moved, who was it who allowed the deadlock to continue so that the new scheme could not come into operation? It was the Government. The Government&#39;s insistence on that deadlock has meant members in their latter years of service will have to keep on paying the onerous contributions. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation has described these contributions as punitive rates. Of course they are punitive rates. This is the main disability in the present scheme. For the needs of most people, it must be changed. But, if the Government allows a situation to develop in which it will not accept amendments dealing with 3 areas of the whole superannuation package, that position will continue. </para>
        <para>In its statement, the Government says that it has found a reasonable solution. We believe that the solution that was found to the problems was unreasonable. In any package of superannuation proposals there is in each feature a range from generous to less generous. What the Government did in its proposals, we believe, was to choose the most generous aspect of every feature. We have pointed out four of these over-generous aspects and the Senate has agreed with three of them. We believe that those 4 aspects were overgenerous. We have sought to amend not the whole scheme but the proposals in those areas. There has been a deliberate muddying of the pool by the Government. </para>

            <para>- I was doing that. I wish to touch on some of the points which have been raised. My time is limited. No doubt the Minister for Tourism and Recreation will not seek to give me an extension of time to deal with these points which have been raised by way of criticism. </para>

        <para>I refer, first of all, to the policy of the Opposition in respect of the normal retiring age. We took considerable interest in the evidence that exists as to what should be the normal proper retiring age and came to the conclusion that the proper one was 65 years. The new scheme put forward by this Government proposed a normal retiring age of 60 years on full pension. The adoption of that retiring age would have resulted in a 30 per cent increase in the cost of the scheme. This increase would have been brought about by paying a pension for an additional 5 years and meeting the consumer price index adjustments to that pension. We referred to a schedule that was attached to the Bill as there was an indication in that schedule that people were to be encouraged later to retire at 55 years or between 55 years and 60 years. We noted that there was a discounting of 4 per cent of the pension for each year below 60 years. We thought that that was an appropriate discounting to make in respect of the pension paid to any contributor who retired at an age earlier than 65 years. That scale relating to a retiring age between 55 years and 60 years is indicative of the direction in which the Government was pointed in its approach to this matter. In this one area there would be a 30 per cent greater cost to the Australian taxpayers if a contributor was to retire at age 60 instead of age 65. </para>
        <para>We believe that the proper retiring age is 65. years. To say, as many people have, that by our proposal we are forcing employees to work to age 65 is playing fast and loose with the truth. The terms and conditions of employment are laid down in the Public Service Act and other Acts. It is for a member to decide when he wishes to retire. The question here is what amount of pension a member should receive on retirement at a given age. The Opposition says that, for a member retiring at 60 years, the payment of 80 per cent of full pension is a reasonable discounting as it is the rate of discounting which the Government was prepared to introduce for a lower age of retirement. The new scheme provides for a contributor the right to take a lump sum payment, together with other rights. The Minister would be aware that most of the conditions concerning existing members were to be covered by regulations. He has not let us see any draft regulations. We do not know what those details were to be. We would have envisaged that members who under our scheme opted to stay in the existing scheme would have perhaps some of those rights given to them including, among others that we could consider, the change in respect of the position of widows. </para>
        <para>This raises a matter of which I spoke earlier, namely, the need for some give and take and some discussion on this matter. By its whole manner and attitude, the Government has refused to do this. I might add that this is demonstrated particularly by the antagonism the Government displayed in the debate on these proposals in the Senate. As a result, these matters cannot have been fully discussed in a reasonable way because there has been no reasonable approach. Apparently we must now wait until this new Bill is presented to see what range of features it offers and how much the Government may wish to see itself in the role of buying votes and of being over-generous again. Perhaps it will be&#39; identical. </para>
        <para>At times when I hear Ministers and other Labor supporters speak about these proposals I wonder whether they really know the costs that are involved in this scheme. What about the unions representing blue collar workers and also pensioner organisations which are complaining so much about these proposals? They are properly asking: Why is it that this Labor Government should be giving such advantages to one sector of the community? Why is it putting those in the Government service in such a superior position to those in superannuation schemes outside the Government service or indeed to those who have no superannuation schemes at all? The figures from the Government Actuary- these were produced pretty well at the last minute, when the debate on this matter was last heldshowed that if the Commonwealth were to set aside money for a funded scheme, which it does not do, approximately 23 per cent of the salaries and wages paid to Government employees would be required to meet the cost of that scheme. That is based on certain long range assumptions, including an inflation rate of 3.9 per cent and an interest rate of 5.5 per cent. It is very difficult to believe in the present conditions that even over a long period such rates are likely to be the case. </para>
        <para>We recognise that there would be some members in the existing scheme who would wish to stay where they are. On the principle that a promise has been made to them in that respect we believe that it is right to say to those people that if they want to stay in it is reasonable for them to opt for the existing scheme, although frankly I do not believe that many would stay in the existing scheme, in spite of some of the comments that have been made in this place. It can be a matter of judgment only. I do not believe that many would stay in the existing scheme. I think that some contributors in their last year or two of service might contemplate it. I doubt whether younger people would want to be locked into a position in which they thought they would remain for the rest of their service. There is a limit to what can be done in relation to the making of some sort of amendment from the Opposition side of the chamber. We of the Opposition are not in the position to make sweeping changes to the scheme and to look again at some of these things from the beginning. Broadly speaking, we can only lay down the general principles of what we believe should be the case and identify areas of over-generosity. If the Government digs in its heels and will not do anythingthat has been the situation until now- there is very little that we can do about it. The AttorneyGeneral refused in writing to give drafting assistance. </para>
        <para>People can point to this aspect and to that aspect and complain, but I believe that we have tried to adopt a reasonable approach to the matter. I believe also that many of the people who have been complaining have been anxious to believe the propaganda that has emanated from the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, have been misled by a few of their own trade union leaders. I think that they do not understand the cost involved and how relatively badly off are the people outside of the service of the Government who, after all, are also paying high income taxes and having their take-home pay reduced. They are not getting into a scheme that will allow them to be index-linked- tied to the consumer price index- and proofed against the ravages of inflation that is affecting the rest of the community. I have no time to go on further. The Opposition maintains its view. It is open to further consideration of the details if that is what the Government wishes. It is the Government. It has to govern. It has to face up to the situation. I think 1 have referred to enough items to make clear the Opposition&#39;s view and in general the principles behind its adoption. </para>

          <para>- I would be remiss for no other reason than the fact that I am the honourable member for Canberra in this House if I were not to say a few words in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> who has just resumed his seat. One is continually surprised by the ability of the honourable gentleman to take a set of facts and twist them to his own advantage. The facts here are quite clear. One knows that there is indeed a great degree of inequity in the existing superannuation scheme. The honourable member for Curtin has conceded that. Yet he has said that in seeking to remove those inequities the Government is trying to win votes. The Government will always seek to remove inequities. The honourable gentleman has had the gall to say in defence of the action of his colleagues in the Senate that they are trying to save the taxpayers&#39; money and that they are trying to think of other interested groups in the community. It is well known that this proposal will not cost the taxpayers any more money. It is just a more efficient and more rational use of the existing resources of the contributions being made. </para>

            <para>- I can tell the honourable gentleman that the measure was thoroughly thrashed out in the party rooms of the Australian Labor Party before the final decision was taken on it because within the ranks of the Party there were a number of people who had expressed interest and concern lest the situation be what he had said it is. Every one of those doubts was put to rest because the measure was subjected to a thorough scrutiny and a thorough examination. It was referred to auditors and costed out. The Government went ahead with the measure in order to give a greater degree of equity to the quarter of a million or so public servants of the Australian Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Lest the honourable gentleman should underestimate the feeling on this subject, I point out that it is my understanding that the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia took the view that the Government takes on the subject and made representations to people on his side of the House not to be stubborn, not to be foolish and not to try and. win votes in the way in which honourable members opposite are obviously trying to win them- by appealing to some kind of prejudice outside against public servants. I understand that that branch of the Liberal Party made such representations but that its appeals fell on deaf ears. The arrogance that so often comes forward from the Liberal Party when it deals with its own colleagues in the Australian Capital Territory and that we saw manifested over 23 years revealed itself on this issue. </para>
        <para>I should also tell the honourable gentleman another fact of life. When one speaks with the officers of the various white collar unions that speak for public servants on these matters one finds that they are almost united and speak with almost one voice on one aspect of this matter; that is, that if the amendments in the form that they have come to us from the Senate were to be accepted their acceptance would cause an even greater amount of inequity and place an even greater financial burden on public servants than the present scheme casts upon them- the present scheme that the Government knows to be wrong and wants to change and that the Opposition knows to be wrong but, speaking with 2 voices, finds a reason for opposing. That is all I wanted to say. The facts will speak for themselves. No doubt the people of Canberra and the other parts of Australia in which public servants live and work will also speak for themselves. </para>

          <para>-The contribution that I make to this debate will be short. In view of the aspersions cast by the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> on the motives of the Opposition in relation to this matter I think it is only proper that I should say 2 things. The Opposition has not approached this matter in a political sense, in the sense of solely being concerned with currying political favour. If the Opposition had approached it in that manner the very simple, expeditious, easy option would have been to adopt the Government&#39;s scheme in toto. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Opposition realises that there has been criticism of its stand. I, along with other members of the Opposition, have received submissions which, I might say, have been in the main very courteously and helpfully put by leaders of the Public Service unions throughout Australia. We have listened to their points of view and can understand their interest in the matter. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition has decided that, having regard to all of the implications for the Australian economy at the present time, the stand it has taken is a reasonable one. In no way does it cut across the very many reforms which are contained in the 2 Bills which were debated during the last session. In no way does the Opposition&#39;s stand represent a punitive attitude towards Commonwealth public servants. The Opposition believes that it does have a responsibility to all sectors of the Australian community. It believes that it has an obligation not only to those employed in the public sector but also to those employed in the private sector. </para>
        <para>If there is one argument in the whole debate on this superannuation scheme that has not been answered by the Government and that in my belief has not been effectively answered by the leaders of the Public Service unions in Australia it is the argument that if the benefits provided under this scheme were to be matched by the private sector an intolerable financial burden, particularly in the light of present economic difficulties, would be placed upon the private sector. In all responsibility to the Australian people we cannot put aside consideration of the impact of this scheme upon the private sector. It may suit the convenience of the Government to do so but it does not suit the convenience of the Opposition. We believe that the impact of this scheme upon the private sector is a relevant consideration. That is one of the matters that weighed so heavily upon the Opposition in formulating its attitude. </para>
        <para>I want to make one other comment about the remarks of the Attorney-General. He talked about the passage of a resolution at the Canberra Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia. I know that a resolution was passed in relation to this matter and that it was carried by a vote of something like 22 to 18, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> but I really do not think that that sort of selective choosing of the actions of a particular branch of the Party really contributes very much to the debate. I could just as easily point out- I know it to be true- that some of the honourable members who sit opposite are still privately opposed to this scheme and that so are some blue collar unions. I do not think that that really contributes a great deal to the debate. It is inevitable in any matter of some controversy that there is going to be a division of opinion inside political parties, but the overwhelming consensus within the Liberal Party and the National Country Party of Australia is that whilst we warmly support the improvements contained in this scheme and the elimination of the many anomalies in it we believe that in certain defined areas it goes too far, having regard to the present economic circumstances. We believe that an intolerable financial burden would be placed upon the private sector if it tried to match the scheme. Given the newfound concern which has been expressed by some supporters of the Government towards the economic health of the private sector we are frankly surprised that they have not paid more regard to this aspect of the argument. </para>

        <para class="block">Honourable members will recall this measure which proposed to make certain changes to the Parliamentary Counsel Act. The Opposition in this House sought to impose an obligation on the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to provide certain assistance to Opposition members. The amendment proposed by the Senate is to the effect that a section of not fewer than two of the professional staff of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel should be seconded to draft proposed laws and amendments at the request of private members. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s reasons for moving that the House insist on disagreeing to the Senate amendment are the same as those which I put to the House on 3 June 1975 when the House considered the Senate amendment and disagreed to it. In short, those reasons are that the needs of private members would be less adequately met under the amendment than they are at present and that the amendment would prejudice the legislative program of the government of the day, without giving to private members a corresponding benefit. </para>
        <para>I should add once again to what I have said before, that it is the Government&#39;s intent to give every possible assistance to honourable members, including backbenchers, whether they be on the Government side or on the Opposition side. Honourable members will appreciate that the strains on the office of Parliamentary Counsel these days are immense. They are immense because of the Government&#39;s very energetic and industrious program of law reform. The measures that are put into this House which go to the Senate, sometimes to be rejected there, sometimes to have amendments made there and sometimes to pass there, cast a burden of legislative activity on the office of Parliamentary Counsel which has never been equalled in the history of Australia since Federation. Although we do try to make the services of officers available, it would be counter-productive to write in a law that they must be available in the ways in which the Opposition puts forward. As I have said before, the Government could not possibly accept that situation. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition regrets that the Government will not accept the amendment which was inserted during the Senate debate on this Parliamentary Counsel Bill 1975. The argument advanced by the Opposition is, in our belief, a very strong argument. Having regard to the remarks that were made on an earlier occasion today regarding the dignity of the procedures of this House, the Opposition wonders whether some of the things said by Government members were completely sincere. One of the important things that has to be achieved if the procedures of this House are to become more effective and if the Executive is not to have a completely untrammelled run- be it an Executive of the present Government&#39;s political persuasion or an Executive at some time in the not too different future of the opposite persuasionthen more effective parliamentary facilities must be provided for private members. I repeat what was said in the earlier debates on this measure: The Opposition is in no way critical of the efforts of Parliamentary Counsel to assist the Opposition at present. But as the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> rightly pointed out, the legislative burden at the present time is such that it is just not possible for the type of assistance that ought to be provided to be provided. In the Opposition&#39;s view, that is all the more reason for the insertion of the amendment that was placed in this Bill during the Senate debate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Attorney-General spent some time talking about the massive legislative program that the Government had undertaken. Whilst that is acknowledged, I think that many honourable members on this side of the House and people throughout the Australian community, might well think that had there been a little less legislation from this Government in many areas and a little more responsible government, we would all be a great deal better off. So it is hardly a very good excuse for the attitude that the Government is taking towards our amendment just to refer to the sheer quantity of legislation that has been passed during the lifetime of this Government. The Opposition regrets that the Government will not agree to the Senate amendment. The Opposition does not intend to change its attitude in this place on the Senate&#39;s amendment and will accordingly vote against the motion moved by the Attorney-General. </para>

          <para class="block">For too long now this Parliament has paid lipservice to the long standing goal of building a permanent Parliament House in Canberra. Once again we are on the way to being diverted from this main role. The time has come for immediate action. The Senate has transmitted a message to us today which contains an Opposition amendment seeking to add a further term of reference to the terms of reference of the proposed Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House and thus add to the Committee&#39;s task. The effect of this amendment will be to put the Committee under immediate pressure to resolve the very difficult question of accommodation in the present House. This can only mean that the special client committee will be diverted from its primary task, that is, to build the new Parliament House on Capital Hill as soon as possible. This is a goal for which we all are striving- a permanent Parliament House to serve parliamentary democracy in Australia. This is the important point we must now consider and resolve. </para>
          <para>To reassure all honourable members on both sides of the Parliament that the unsatisfactory accommodation situation at present in the House is not being neglected, I point to the existence of the Joint House Committee whose role it is to examine questions such as that raised in the Senate amendment. It would be an appropriate task for this Committee to decide as soon as possible on which departments and people could be removed from the House to ensure that the members of the Parliament have adequate facilities to carry out their elected duties until the new Parliament House is built. </para>
          <para>For these reasons the Government intends to oppose the amendment. It hopes that the Senate sees the wisdom of this and accepts the resolution of appointment as first proposed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> This will mean that we can get on with the job of building a new and permanent Parliament House without any further delay. </para>

I think one of the most important points to make is that in this matter there will be no major outlay of finance for several years, even after the decision is made to proceed. I admire the attitude that has been taken by the Minister in his attempt to get a decision made on this very important matter for Australia. I do not want to prolong the debate. I merely want to indicate where I stand myself. I believe the Minister is moving in the right direction, and I for one am completely with him. </para>

            <para>-I rise in support of the attitude expressed by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline> I very much support the remarks made by the honourable member for Ryan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drury),</inline> whose interest in this matter is well known to the House. He has expressed a consistent view over a number of years. The purpose of the proposed Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House is to get on with the job of designing and building a new and permanent Parliament House for the Parliament of Australia. The present building is inadequate. Those who live in it know that very well. The opening comment of those who visit it always is: &#39;What a very old and archaic building it is&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The comfort of honourable members is not my prime concern. It seems to me that the amendments suggested by the Senate go more to the subject of the comfort of honourable member&#39;s at the moment than it goes to what in my view is the principal subject, and that is a building far more contemporary with political life in Australia and certainly far more contemporary with a parliament in a developing country in the last quarter of the 20th century and one that we trust will serve well into the 21st century. The present building not only has limitations in accommodation for members but in my view it has grave limitations in the way in which it causes the parliamentary system to operate. The present building places a great deal of restraints and constrictions upon the very function it is supposed to assist the Parliament to carry out. It constrains and restricts the members in the carrying out of their tasks; it constrains and restricts the Parliament in its deliberation on a very wide variety of subjects. </para>
          <para>For those reasons I support the attitude expressed that the amendments suggested by the Senate ought to be rejected and that the proposition that was carried by this House is a sound one because it goes to the very root of the problem. It goes to the problem of getting a permanent Parliament House constructed on the site that has been decided by this Parliament, and that is Capital Hill. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development has pointed out already that there is in existence a committee to care for this building; that is, the Joint House Committee. If. the proposition as agreed to by this House is changed in accordance with the modification suggested by the Senate the proposed committee will start to lose its effectiveness and it will divide its efforts between 2 jobs. Some honourable members may be of the view that the committee can function properly by exercising its mind in deliberating on 2 matters at the same time, but I am afraid that that is not my view and I am sure that it is not the view of the House. As I said, there is in existence a committee to care for the present Parliament House. </para>
          <para>It is proposed that a committee be formed to look after, to investigate and to oversee the design and construction of a new parliament house. I hope that this House, without disagreement, will report back to the Senate that it does not agree with the suggested changes. I also hope that at a very early date the proposed committee will be set up so that it may get on with the task of devising a new parliament house that will be far more in line with what is required in Australia from the 1970s right through to the year 2000. It is my hopeful wish that the same sort of institution will be in existence in the year 2 100. 1 commend the motion to the House. </para>

            <para>- I basically support the resolution but I more particularly support the resolution as amended by the Senate which not only is in favour of a joint committee proceeding with plans for the new parliament house but also includes a reference to investigate and make recommendations in respect of the provision of better and reasonable facilities for members in the present building here and now. I do not believe that the Senate&#39;s amendment is contradictory. I believe that the acceptance of the suggested modification is necessary for 2 reasons. One is that no matter how quickly any committee proceeds there will be quite a time lag before a new parliament house is constructed. With the best will in the world I think it would be 10 to 1 5 years before members were able to move into the new parliament house. There is a time lag between the design specifications, the construction and the movement of members and staff to the new building. I would think that in some ways 10 to 15 years could be a conservative estimate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What is to happen to the ordinary members of Parliament who occupy this building? The facilities available to them will not improve in that time. Their work load is increasing. The membership of the House of Representatives is restricted to 127 at the present time. On many occasions while I have been a member of this House- I am sure that ordinary members who have, been here for much longer than I also have seen this- I have seen the rights of and the facilities available to the ordinary members come last in the list of priorities in what is actually provided in this building for those who occupy it. When one looks at other parliament houses and what is provided for members one can see the perhaps lavish provisions in the United States, but I will refer to Canada which is probably the most comparable country to Australia. In Canada a federal member represents about half the number of people that a federal member in this country represents. Every ordinary member of the Federal Parliament in Canada has a separate double office with a staff of two to assist him in his work, and he considers that to be by no means a generous provision. Yet ordinary members here, with twice the number of electors of Federal members in Canada generally, have no support facilities at all in this building. One sees room after room in this place occupied by two and even 3 members. </para>
          <para>I believe that the previous Government was neglectful in this area, just as it appears that the leadership of the present Government is being neglectful of the rights and privileges of the ordinary members of Parliament in this place. Putting to one side the Ministry and the facilities provided for it, if there is a restriction on space in this building then a reasonable requirement- as suggested in the Senate&#39;s amendment- is that ordinary members of Parliament should have first priority and that every other requirement for space in this building for the various officers and departments should come second. If the Parliament is to be the place for members of Parliament to carry out their duties rather than the place . for all the additional facilities and requirements that appear to have been tacked on over the years, then the rights of ordinary members of Parliament on both sides should come first. It is because of this time lag in processing details for and creating a new and permanent parliament house, even with the best will in the world, that I think it is important that this amendment of the Senate be agreed to so that something can be done. </para>
          <para>In reply to a question during question time today the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> laid stress on equality. I hope he will have a look at equality in this place and see the differences between the facilities available to himself and the Ministry and those available to ordinary members. I would say the same thing if my Party were in government because this was true when it was in office. When one talks about travelling economy class and equality, does it mean that as members of Parliament we are all to travel VIP? Does it mean that the Prime Minister also will travel economy class? One could also talk about travelling in Mercedes-Benz cars. I believe that the Senate &#39;s amendment should be supported. </para>

            <para>- I am a little surprised that the Senate, after its long battle to get some action on this matter, should delay it by this method. In a long history of parliamentary endeavour there is nothing more designed to delay things than seeking to amend running affairs. The Senate itself has played a fairly effective part in having a decision made on the location of the new permanent parliament house. I think it is fairly obvious from all our experience that if you want something done you hand it to someone whose function it is to determine that question and that question alone. This resolution from the Senate and the support from some members of the Opposition will only help to confuse matters because it is a different question altogether. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The question of accommodation in this building at the present moment is under review by the Joint House Committee, as I understand it. I also understand that submissions have been made already and are in the process of being made ready for presentation to the appropriate authorities. In fact, expenditure on this building is a matter that involves serious architectural constraints. It is a very difficult question and one which can be resolved only by close study by the appropriate authorities and the experts. There is not all that much that we can do about it. Consideration of a new and permanent parliament house and the function of the committee that we want established as soon as possible will call for the greatest possible intellectual effort and continual study, work and consideration. It will not be a sinecure. In the first instance we are going to erect a building which will be totally different from any other building in this country- not because it will be contemporary but because for the first time someone will be setting out to construct a building for a modern parliament and for that alone. </para>
          <para>I was a member of the original committee which examined the requirements of a new and permanent parliament house and brought down its report some 7 or 8 years ago on the functional relationship of the building and the accommodation that would be required. We travelled around the world and we investigated a number of other parliament houses. The thing that struck me- I presume it made the same impact upon the honourable member for Ryan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drury)</inline> who was a member of that committee- was that although some very fine buildings had been designed and built they did not cater for the functions of parliament. The Parliament House building in Kuala Lumpur, for instance, looks well on a postcard. The building in Delhi represents another architect&#39;s vision of what a parliament house ought to be, but it has been designed without much consultation with parliamentarians. In Rome and Bonn the staff are working under constraints imposed by old buildings. The British Houses of Parliament are a magnificent building but totally inadequate, as is the building in Ottawa which was mentioned by my friend the- honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd).</inline></para>
          <para>The function of parliament as an institution is totally different from its function in the past. Great demands are placed upon the people who work in it. The general public are increasingly attracted to visit it. The people in it have an increasing workload and there is an increasing work force. In a way the parliamentary institution now has to include executive functions, legislative functions and the general accommodation of the people who work in it. The Committee that has been set up has a very difficult and involved task before it. I can only hope that it will get on with the job and, in the not too distant future, produce designs which will be a substantial advance on anything that has been produced so far anywhere else. I fondly hope that it will create a new style of architecture for Australia. </para>
          <para>This matter has been fraught with unusual and unnecessary delays. The Committee produced its report about 7 years ago. This House decided by a small majority that the new parliament house ought to be on Camp Hill. The Senate decided by a large majority that it ought to be on Capital </para>
          <para class="block">Hill. I think that the majority in favour of the Capital Hill site was about thirty, there being a total of 185 members at that time. The then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> perhaps acting in concert with his Cabinet but perhaps not, just announced in the House that as the Parliament could not make up its mind about the matter the Government itself would decide on it. He said: &#39;We will put it on Camp Hill&#39;. One would have thought that even a Liberal Prime Minister would have been able to add up two simple numbers. </para>

              <para>- That is right. One would have thought that there were only two ballot boxes in that election- one in the Senate and one in the House of Representatives- and that even a Liberal Prime Minister, dedicated to electoral inequality as all Liberals are- all except my friend from Griffith- would have been able to add them together and say that the majority was in favour of Capital Hill. But he did not do that. The result is that for 7 years there has been a complete delay, and the person principally responsible must be the right honourable member for Higgins. If it had not been for his intervention in that way the building would now be half completed. So I think that it would be an important contribution to alacrity in this matter if the Opposition did not vote against the motion and if we relayed to the Senate the unanimous view of this House that the Committee should get on with the job as it was defined by this House in the first place and that the function, the subject of the Senate&#39;s resolution, be returned to the respective House committees to establish the accommodation needs. As I understand it from information I have received, submissions have been largely completed on the matter. This is a totally different function from the design of the new and permanent parliament house. Therefore I suggest that this House carry the motion without division so that the Senate will be encouraged to make its decision without delay. </para>

              <para>-Thank you, but I still take the opportunity. I will be very brief. Shortly after I arrived in this Parliament in 1 966 discussions on the siting of the new parliament house commenced. Here we are in the mid-1970s still discussing it. I feel that I share the view of the vast majority of Australians who have heard the various debates on this subject, that the nation is well convinced of the need for a new parliament house but is disgusted at the lack of ability of the Parliament itself to come to grips with making such a simple decision. I hope that today&#39;s debate will be the final one on this subject and that in the very near future we will get on with the job. </para>

            <para>- At the <inline font-style="italic">outset</inline> I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> on one of the few really good speeches I have heard him make in the Parliament. I support the view put forward by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> that we should reject the Senate&#39;s amendment. The honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Ryan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drury)-</inline> and all honourable members for that matter-must realise that no one would imagine that a parliament could be properly conducted with the sort of accommodation and facilities that are available here for members and others. It is true that we suffer greatly in comparison particularly with Canada and the United States of America. The British House of Commons does not offer much in the way of facilities for private members. As the honourable member for Griffith said, for a long time- almost since the time I entered the Parliament- there has been a demand for a new parliament house. The facilities are not available for Ministers and private members adequately to provide for the staff that is necessary. The real purpose behind the resolution, which was moved and carried by the Parliament, was to get the proceedings under way and to commence the erection of a new parliament house. I thought that we had gone a long way when this matter was decided by a vote on nonparty lines; undoubtedly this delaying tactic will upset our hopes and aspirations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The amendment refers to matters relating to facilities in this House at the present time. The fact is that at the present time a committee is investigating what can be done. But not much can be done in this building unless it is extended another storey or sideways or unless the walls are turned into concertina walls. All the inquiries in the world would reveal that it is necessary to erect another building, either by adding to this one or by building a new parliament house. Why the Senate should consider just investigating the possibility of improving the facilities here is quite beyond me. I suggest that that is completely out of order with what was meant by the original motion. Where will we get if we just keep on inquiring about what we can do in this Parliament House? Why not be more constructive and say: &#39;When can we commence to lay the foundation stone of a parliament house that will do justice not only to the people of this country but also to those who are honoured to represent them here?&#39; Those people who have seen the Canadian building appreciate what has been done there. It is a magnificent Parliament House with good facilities for members. The same thing applies in the United States Congress. </para>
          <para>We have been asked to go into certain matters in the resolution. The honourable member for Murray mentioned the neglect of accommodation for honourable members. He criticised governments in which his own Party participated but he was also somewhat critical of the present Government and said that it also had gone to sleep in regard to facilities for honourable members. I do not want to push the matter any further but all honourable members know that in the last few yea.rs, right throughout the length and breadth of the country, the facilities for honourable members in their offices in their electorates and in other places have been substantially increased, and the secretarial legislative research assistance mentioned has been provided by the Labor Government. For 23-odd years Liberal governments did not bother to do anything about that. The criticism by the honourable member for Murray does him no credit. It is easy to see that he did not suffer as other honourable members did from the complete lack of facilities not only in this Parliament but also in the electorates. </para>
          <para>This Government has not gone to sleep on the matter. It has put forward this motion regarding a new parliament house in order to improve and continue the progress it has made in providing adequate facilities for members in this Parliament. Consequently these delaying tactics do little credit to the Senate and will not help those who seek to improve conditions for honourable members here. Every Minister and every private member wants additional accommodation. Those who work within the Parliament, such as the clerks and others, need additional facilities. The staff and all those associated with Parliament who work for the people of this country certainly look forward to a better parliament house, better facilities and surroundings. I do not wish to say more than that I hope the Parliament will reject this suggestion and that the Senate, in good sense, will accept the original motion which was sent forward and let a new Parliament </para>
          <para class="block">House get under way. From what I have seen of the Senate, it could do with some improvements in its own facilities over there, as far as honourable senators are concerned. This offers the Senate that opportunity. </para>
          <para>I suggest again to the honourable member for Murray that while it does him little credit to criticise honourable members on this side of the House for what has been done, by all means he should aim his darts at those who sat on this side for a long time and those in ministries who enjoyed to the full what a Minister could get in regard to facilities. Honourable members then on this side, as well as those of us who were then in Opposition, were given nothing at all in regard to what is needed by private members. I well remember that a member of the Opposition when he was defeated said: &#39;Do not blame us if you never get anything over there. Our Ministers did not give us anything either.&#39; So it was all a one-way traffic. Under the previous Government 27 men had all the facilities that mattered and private members got nothing inside or outside the Parliament. This practical attempt by the Government to see that we get under way with the new Parliament House deserves to be supported. Motions aimed at delaying the commencement of the important construction of a new Parliament House deserve to be opposed. We should send this resolution back to the Senate. We should advise the Senate that we want to get under way and that we hope it wants the same thing and supports the original motion which was sent there. </para>

        <para class="block">As the Committee will recall, these amendments deal with a number of matters. In some cases the amendments deal with substantive matters and in other cases the amendments are consequential upon amendments dealing with substantive matters. A substantial number of these amendments are consequential upon amendment No. 32. That amendment added a schedule to the Bill setting out those matters in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to have jurisdiction immediately. The Senate amendments consequential upon Senate amendment No. 32 are Senate amendment Nos 1 and 7 to 1 3. 1 point out that some of these amendments were moved by the Government in the Senate. Senate amendment No. 2 provides for the terms and conditions of service of members of the Tribunal to be prescribed by regulation instead of being determined by the Governor-General. Senate amendment No. 3 is consequential upon this amendment. </para>
        <para>Senate amendments Nos 4, 6 and 29 are consequential upon Senate amendments Nos 20 to 28, omitting references to the Superior Court of Australia and substituting references to State and Territory Supreme Courts. Senate amendment No. 5 deleted a provision empowering the Minister administering the Act to permit a full-time member of the Tribunal to engage in outside paid employment. Senate amendments Nos 14 and 16 restrict to the Attorney-General the power to give a certificate entitling information or documents to be withheld from parties to proceedings before the Tribunal. Those amendments were moved by the Opposition. </para>
        <para>Senate amendments Nos 15, 17 and 18 clarify the grounds on which such a certificate may be given, and make consequential changes. Senate amendment No. 19 provides that a witness before the Tribunal may have legal representation. Senate amendment No. 30 inserts provisions in the Bill establishing an Administrative Review Council. The Government accepts and supports that provision completely. Senate amendment No. 3 1 amends the provisions in the Bill relating to the granting of legal aid to parties before the Tribunal. The substantial change is the omission of any specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office. On this point I take the opportunity to say that of course the Legal Aid Bill is coming along. It will be considered by this House in the not too distant future. The Government stands firmly committed to the proposition of there being an Australian Legal Aid Office although the Government recognises that at this stage the Office has no legislative context or background, save for, I think, reference in some Acts, particularly the Family Law Act. That is a matter at which the Government can look at another time in the future when, I hope, the Legal Aid Bill becomes law. </para>

          <para>-The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Bill has already been the subject of a very lengthy debate in the House and also in the Senate. The Opposition is pleased to say that it will support the amendments now moved by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby).</inline> Most of them, as the AttorneyGeneral has pointed out, are consequential upon amendments inserted during the Senate debate. The Attorney-General acknowledged that, in substance, a number of the amendments which he has just moved arose from amendments inserted by the Opposition. I am very happy to say that this Bill will, because of this debate, pass into law very soon and will bring to a legislative conclusion a process which has been going on for a long time in Australia to provide a framework for appeals against the exercise of administrative discretion. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>While, during the course of the debate, there were some substantial disagreements between the Government and the Opposition regarding the original form of the Government&#39;s Bill, I think that all honourable members will acknowledge that there has been a degree of unanimity on both sides of the House regarding the desirability of establishing an effective tribunal to review administrative decisions. In this regard the Opposition is pleased to support the amendments which have been moved by the AttorneyGeneral. We believe that they will improve the Bill. We believe in particular that it is desirable that the principal law officer of the Crown, the Attorney-General, have the responsibility of deciding whether there should issue a certificate, which in effect excludes from the operation of the Tribunal certain acts of departments or Ministers. We believe that discretion should be with the Attorney-General and not with the individual Minister concerned. That point is, of course, the substance of amendments 1, 2 and 3. </para>
        <para>The other amendments deal with the question of jurisdiction. The House will recall that, at the time the Bill was debated during the second reading and Committee stages, the Opposition was critical of the fact that no jurisdiction had been conferred upon the Tribunal, that having come so far the Government did not go the step further and confer upon the Tribunal some effective jurisdiction, that we were given a framework without any substance or a skeleton without any flesh, as I think the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> described it. Whilst the amendments now proposed by the AttorneyGeneral perhaps fall short of those originally devised by the Opposition, we are nonetheless pleased to accept them so that the Tribunal once established by this Bill when it becomes an Act will not only have an excellent framework but it will also have some substantial jurisdiction. The Opposition is pleased to support the amendments moved by the Attorney-General. </para>

            <para>-I thank the Committee. Honourable members will recall that at the time of the earlier debate and also during the Senate debate the Opposition criticised the Bill for having conferred jurisdiction on the proposed Superior Court of Australia to hear appeals on matters of law from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Honourable members will be aware that the Opposition is opposed to the establishment of the Superior Court of Australia. During the Senate debate the Opposition secured the insertion in the Bill of amendments to confer that jurisdiction on the Supreme Courts of each of the States. Whilst the Opposition still holds to the view that it would be more desirable that the jurisdiction be vested in the Supreme Courts of the various States, in the interests of the legislation coming into force at an early date and having regard to the spirit of some compromise which has been adopted by the Government in respect of other Opposition amendments, the Opposition will not oppose the proposal of the Government that the jurisdiction be given to the Australian Industrial Court, although the attitude of the Opposition in that respect should not be interpreted as any alteration of our attitude regarding the establishment of an Australian Superior Court, nor indeed our general attitude regarding the types of jurisdiction that ought to be exercised by the Supreme Courts of the various States. </para>

        <para class="block">Perhaps this is now the appropriate time for me to say a few words in reply to what the honourable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> said with leave a moment or two ago. The Government of course takes a different point of view on the notion of a Superior Court from that taken by the Opposition. The history of the Superior Court of Australia Bill is well known. The Bill has been through this chamber twice. It has been through the Senate twice and rejected twice in the Senate. There are certain other aspects that are probably not so well known, and they are these: The federal courts of Australia are in great need of reform. The Industrial Court itself is in great need of reform. The Territory Supreme Courts are in great need of reform and in particular of having an appellate court to which they can readily resort. </para>
        <para>I say, just for the assistance of honourable members and particularly the honourable member for Bennelong, that it is my intention soon to introduce legislation that will not seek to create a Superior Court of Australia but which will seek to rationalise the existing federal courts in a much more modest way than was contemplated by the Superior Court proposal. The legislation will seek to establish an Australian federal court. Above that there will be, we hope, an Australian court of appeal which will take some of the original jurisdiction away from the High Court where it has often been said it should not be and also will serve as a court of appeal from the federal court and the Territory Supreme Courts. I just mention that to the honourable gentleman because I know he has a great interest in the subject. Indeed, so do other honourable members. It has been the subject of discussions with some of the High Court judges and some of the Territory  judges. When I put the legislation forward to this House I hope it will find general support. </para>

            <para>-The Privy Council Appeals Abolition Bill 1975 (No. 2), as we are reminded in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> comes to the Parliament for the third time. I think it is necessary to put it in perspective. The perspective is this: If this Bill were passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, a request then would be made to the House of Commons and the House of Lords to pass legislation in the form contained in the Schedule to the Act. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the House of Commons and the House of Lords did so pass that requested legislation, it is very likely that it would have the effect of ending all appeals, in totality, from Australian judicial tribunals to the Privy Council. I say that in all likelihood it would have that effect because nobody can be certain that in law it would have that effect It would be subject to challenge and would need to be considered by the High Court itself. It would be considered not by the Privy Council but by the High Court. So, in any event, the matter could be determined by law. The position at present is that there can be no appeals to  the Privy Council on matters that relate to the limits of power as between the Commonwealth and the States. That is provided in the Constitution. In order to appeal to the Privy Council there must be leave of the High Court; a certificate must be granted by the High Court. No such certificate has been given since 1912. Indeed, if my recollection is correct, only one certificate has been given under that provision of the Constitution. Therefore, one can reasonably assume that such a certificate would not be issued. </para>
          <para>The next step in the process was, in 1968, to limit appeals to the Privy Council which related to Federal jurisdiction. So, there has been a limitation of the right of appeal to the Privy Council further than the practical effect of no certificate since 1912. As a companion to the present Bill, legislation was brought into the House- it was passed by the House and by the Senate- which would have meant that there could be no appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. The net result of that would be that if litigants opted to go to the High Court they could not then go on to the Privy Council. If they wished to go to the Privy Council and it was an appellable cause, they would have to go direct from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. </para>
          <para>The legislation that was passed has not yet been proclaimed and has not come into effect. Presumably it will not be proclaimed until the result of the third consideration of the current Bill is determined by this chamber and by the Senate. There are 2 methods by which there can be an end to appeals from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. One method is the course adopted in this legislation- that of requesting the British Houses of Parliament to pass an Act preventing appeals from any State court to the Privy Council. The other method is to have a constitutional referendum. There are good arguments for having a constitutional referendum. Let me deal first with the method which is adopted in this Bill. Honourable members will find that clause 7 of the Bill states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Parliament -  that is the House of Representatives and the Senate-  requests and consents to the enactment by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of an Act in, or substantially in, the terms set out in the Schedule. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Schedule sets out the terms of the Imperial Act. As I construe that Schedule, it would mean that all appeals, on whatever justiciable issue before any judicial tribunal in Australia, would end. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the way in which it is done- by request to the House of Commons and the House of Lords. If we are to emphasise the independence, which many people in Australia would emphasise, is this a reasonable way in which we should do it? The very argument that we should end all appeals is put on the basis that we are an independent country and we should end all appeals with our own judiciary and a final line of law should remain in Australia. I would support that. I think there is nobody in this chamber who would not support that. The High Court is the final court of appeal establishing the law. It is a single authority which all other judicial bodies should follow. We would all accept that I am sure. The Opposition accepts it. I most certainly do. Therefore, the argument is as to the method of doing it. If it is argued that we should have the High Court as the final court of appeal to establish law because of our independent status, is there anybody in this House who would support the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> and the Government by saying that the way in which to do it is to establish our lack of independence; to establish clearly by an act of this House and the Senate that we do not have the full constitutional independence? We are asking the British Houses of Parliament to do the job for us. We are requesting the House of Commons and the House of Lords to pass this legislation. </para>
          <para>I find it an offensive manner in which to go about it. Of course, the States find it an offensive manner in which to go about it. It pretends that it is fully in accordance with the Statute of Westminster, which is now more than 40 years old. The constitutional change in this 4 decades has been immense. Even at that time, it was undertaken by everybody who was concerned with the Statute of Westminister and the construction of it that there would be no interference in the States and that the House of Commons and the House of Lords would not be asked to do something which would alter the constitutional position of the States. If this legislation were passed and if we suppose that the British Parliament passed the legislation as requested, it would interfere with the Constitution of the States. Therefore, it is not only a wrong process in terms of the way we see the development of our Constitution but also a direct contradiction of what was undertaken clearly and without qualification at the time of the Statute of Westminster. </para>
          <para>We know that the States still hold that view very strongly, because in 1973 I think four- certainly three- of the Premiers went to the United Kingdom to petition the Queen, the Prime Minister and other Ministers in the United Kingdom not to pass any legislation of this request nature. I ask honourable members to imagine the situation: If we establish the precedent of passing this legislation- request and consent legislationthere is no area into which the British House of Commons and House of Lords could not go to pass legislation which affected the States of the Commonwealth of Australia- the 6 constituent States. It ought not to be done in that way. I am not certain whether the States would maintain a view that there should be appeals direct from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. I make it clear that I think that all appeals ought to go exclusively to the High Court and not to the Privy Council. But I am not prepared to participate in any way in a method which emphasises the dependence of Australia instead of its independence and creates a precedent for further request and consent legislation which can seriously imperil the constitutional status of the 6 constituent members of our federation. </para>
          <para>Therefore, I will call in aid for the argument which I put the words of the Leader of the Government, the very man who introduced this legislation. I quote the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> speaking in 1968 as Leader of the Opposition in respect of the limitation of appeals legislation of that year introduced by my former colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nigel</inline> Bowen as he then was, who in now Chief Judge in Equity of the Supreme Court of New South Wales As recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume 58 page 853 in that year, the then Leader of the Opposition had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is impossible for this Parliament or for the State Parliaments, by legislation, to abolish appeals from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. This is because the Australian States opted out of the Statute of Westminster. The Australian States are still British Colonies. If they wanted to abolish appeals from their Supreme Courts to the Privy Council they would have to ask the British Parliament to repeal the Judicial Committee Appeals Acts of 1833 and 1844. This would emphasise Australia&#39;s dependence on Britain. An alternative course- and I do not suggest that this is free of legal doubt- would be for this Parliament to pass a Bill for a referendum and for the Government to put that referendum to the people to abolish these appeals. This would emphasise our independence. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What was said in 1968 by the present Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, is as true today as it was then. There is not a single word offered in any second reading speech as to why this course of action should be taken; that is, to establish our dependence and to ask the House of Commons and the House of Lords to pass this legislation. </para>
          <para>Let us suppose- and I certainly hope that it will not come to pass- that this legislation did pass. There is then one necessary question to ask: Would the British Parliament- the House of </para>
          <para class="block">Commons and the House of Lords- accede to the request and pass the legislation? My own view is that the House of Commons would steadfastly refuse to do so. Why should the House of Commons in 1975 interfere in the internal constitutional arrangements of Australia? I believe that the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party would have no pan of it. Whether the Labour Party in Great Britain would respond to a request from the Labor Party in Australia to do so I am unable to say, but I feel most confident that the Labour Party in government in Britain would refuse to have any part of it. So we are probably setting about an empty exercise anyway. The emptiness of that exercise is manifested by the unwillingness on the part of Great Britain to interfere in our constitutional affairs. </para>
          <para>The way in which what is proposed should be done is to consult the people who determine the Constitution, and that is all the Australian people, voting as they can, at a referendum. They could be asked whether they are in favour of the ending of appeals to the Privy Council or, to put it in more positive language, whether they are in favour of the final court of appeal in all matters legal being the High Court of&#34; Australia. I favour it. If there was a referendum I would support it and I am quite sure that it would be supported by the people. That would have the effect of ensuring that the constituent States need not fear in a similar sort of manner anybody interfering further with the powers which were given them by the Constitution or in some way imperilling their position as constituent States of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>For these reasons this Bill should be rejected by this chamber. I would regard it as offensive if it were passed. I would regard it as embarrassing if a request was actually made by the Government of my country to the government of another country to pass legislation in its Parliament to affect us. It is embarrassing and belittling to us. Can we not solve the issue ourselves? We have had plenty of opportunities in the life of this Government to consider referendum proposals. That is the way in which it should be done instead of going on with this nonsense. No doubt what the Government wants to do is to have the legislation rejected by the Senate. Then it will claim that it has been frustrated. Such action is not frustration. It is preventing the Government from establishing a precedent of dependence of the national Parliament of Australia on the national Parliament of Britain. I will have no part of it. The Bill ought to be rejected. </para>
          <para>I recapitulate: If the Government wishes to have a referendum and to test the matter by constitutional amendment, I will support it because I very strongly believe that the final court of appeal should be the High Court of Australia. I conclude by emphasising the point that to end all appeals with the High Court would not in any way submit us to any risk of a deterioration of our legal standards in Australia, for I say without any disrespect intended whatever to the learned judges who form the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council none of them can claim greater wisdom in the law, either collectively or individually, than we can claim for our own High Court. We are not going to have any diminution in standards by the High Court&#39;s becoming the final court of appeal. What we will have if we achieve this by referendum is a determination according to the Constitution and not by reverting to some anachronistic procedure which is fraught with peril and which stands as a direct threat to the independence of the constituent States which make up the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">In doing so, I present the Budget for 1 975-76. </para>
          <para>This Budget is presented at a time of high inflation and, by Australian standards, high unemployment. </para>
          <para>Other countries have been confronted with much the same economic problems as currently bedevil Australia. Some have responded to these problems with drastic measures which, although partly successful in curbing inflation, imposed the severe social and economic costs of higher levels of unemployment and lost production to a greater degree than in any period since the Great Depression. </para>
          <para>For example, the United States of America suffered unemployment rates peaking at 9.2 per cent, and still at 8.4 per cent; and peak to trough falls of 14 per cent in industrial production and 8 per cent in real Gross National Product. In the process inflation in terms of seasonally adjusted annual rates has fallen from around 14 per cent at the peak to around 7 per cent in the most recent quarter. </para>
          <para>The costs, however, have been great. </para>
          <para>By contrast, unemployment in Australia has remained below 5 per cent and the peak to trough decline in real Gross Domestic Product was 5 percent. </para>
          <para>There are now some early signs of a recovery in the private sector. Retail sales are improving. Business inventories are falling. The home building industry is strengthening. </para>
          <para>On balance unemployment in recent monthsand notwithstanding the rise in July- has been fairly steady. The situation will be carefully watched. </para>
          <para>Meanwhile, unless appropriate economic measures are adopted now, the hopeful signs in the economy could prove illusory, and inflation could take off again from its already high level, to a thoroughly destructive effect. The private sector would find it increasingly difficult to function, with increasing business failures, and unemployment could rise to dramatically higher levels. </para>
          <para>That situation can be avoided and it was with this objective in mind that this Budget was designed. Some sacrifice and patient restraint is called for from all of us in our demands for more resources, whether it is additional public services that are wanted or higher personal incomes. </para>
          <para>We expect that as the expansion of public sector activity is restrained, the opportunities for private sector expansion will improve, though full responses to greater room for growth may take time to develop. </para>
          <para>The public sector has played an important part so far in stimulating the movement towards recovery from the recession. Furthermore, the big increases in spending on our programs in the past two years were needed to overcome decades of neglect. </para>
          <para>This Government began great programs of change in our society. The achievements are readily measurable. Incomes have risen, not only in terms of real personal disposable incomes but in terms of facilities provided to the whole community in health, in education, in social welfare. The Australian Government&#39;s record in these areas is widely acknowledged. </para>
          <para>Our reforms are enduring; they will not be reversed. Now we propose to pause to take stock of the achievements. </para>
          <para>Because of the structure of our mixed economy, where three out of four jobs are in the private sector, there are firm limits on how far the public sector should be stimulated in this recovery phase. In framing the Budget, therefore, we have exercised the utmost restraint on government spending. </para>
          <para>For these reasons, the key-note of this Budget is consolidation and restraint rather than further expansion of the public sector. </para>
          <para>On the economic front, inflation is this nation &#39;s most menacing enemy. We aim to curb it. Unless this aim is achieved, the nation&#39;s productive capacity will run down and job opportunities will diminish. </para>
          <para>Our present level of unemployment is too high. If we fail to control inflation unemployment will get worse. </para>
          <para>THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC POLICY</para>
        <para>The economic situation is reviewed in Statement No. 2 attached to the Budget Speech. Here I concentrate on the policy problems inherent in the situation. Recent developments offer some hope that 1975-76 will be a better year than its predecessor. For that, steady and responsible economic policies are needed. </para>
        <para>The objectives we seek- continued economic growth and the control of inflation- are almost universally applauded. Achieving them is another matter. In that regard, this Budget is crucial. </para>
        <para>But it is only one of several tools of economic management. Also of major importance are wages and salaries, monetary and external policies. There are important linkages between these arms of policy. </para>
        <para>In coming to our budgetary judgments, we have had those linkages well in mind. </para>
        <para>This year&#39;s budgetary considerations began, as usual, with an examination of the prospective Budget aggregates. Expenditures were projected to grow much more rapidly than revenues and the prospective deficit was nearly double that of 1974-75. Clearly, such a deficit could not be countenanced under the circumstances. </para>
        <para>In the context of an economy beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. Its acceptance would have been tantamount to abandoning concern with inflation, discarding our wages policies, condemning the corporate sector to an attack upon its profitability and threatening the future jobs of thousands of Australiansall at a time when the first signs of improvement in most of those respects are beginning to appear. </para>
        <para>We are no longer operating in that simple Keynesian world in which some reduction in unemployment could, apparently, always be purchased at the cost of some more inflation. Today, it is inflation itself which is the central policy problem. More inflation simply leads to more unemployment. </para>
        <para>Some might argue that a large deficit could be offset by a tough monetary policy- but this would mean greatly increased interest rates, disruption in financial markets, further depression of business confidence and serious company failures. That is an unacceptable option. </para>
        <para>We therefore rejected a deficit or the order implied by all the expenditure proposals before us. </para>
        <para>An alternative approach, in its own way equally extreme, would have been to seek to pull down outlays sufficiently to bring the deficit well below that of 1974-75. That would have caused severe disruption to the economy. Economic recovery would almost certainly have halted. </para>
        <para>True, such an approach would certainly have dealt a solid blow to inflationary expectations. But at what a cost! </para>
        <para>The prescription which this course would have entailed is just as unacceptable as the other prescription of letting inflation rip. This Government rejects a policy of deliberately creating massive unemployment and widespread business failures in order to stop inflation abruptly. </para>
        <para>We have therefore tried to find a middle way- a line along which we can achieve sound and sustainable growth while at the same time bringing inflation down gradually over perhaps two or three years. </para>
        <para>In the outcome, this Budget holds the share of Australian Government outlays in the total economy steady. Even to restrain that share from rising further has involved us in many painful decisions. </para>
        <para>We have sought to frame a firm Budget in which the rate of growth in outlays has been halved as compared with last year. </para>
        <para>It is a Budget neither too lax, thereby inviting a renewed acceleration of inflation; nor too harsh, causing unconscionable loss of production and the human and social costs of massive unemployment. </para>
        <para>WAGES AND SALARIES</para>
        <para class="block">The Budget is one major instrument of economic policy. Another major policy area concerns the growth in wages and salaries. </para>
        <para>If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases, the productive capacity of the economy will decline and we shall all eventually be worse off. </para>
        <para>It is too early yet to determine whether wage indexation will succeed in dampening the recent wage-price spiral. The signs are mixed. The Government intends to do what it can to make indexation work. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, however, it is clear that some wage and salary pressures are unrealistic and, when successful, harmful. It does employees generally no good to get higher and higher money incomes if the results are just higher prices, a severe squeeze on profits, a slump in new investment and a contraction of job opportunities. </para>
        <para>Wage and salary earners&#39; purchasing power is already being maintained through wage indexation and the indexation guidelines provide for increases to be sought on other specified grounds, including increases in productivity. To call as well for tax indexation, and at the same time expect the Government to provide better education, free medical services and so onwhich it can only do by increasing its claims upon our national resources- is to ask for the impossible. </para>
        <para>Let me develop that thought a little. The average employee&#39;s real after-tax earnings in 1974-75 rose by 7 per cent. When the increase in publicly provided benefits in education, health, social security and so on is added in, his total real income rose by 9.5 per cent. </para>
        <para>Now this really is a very high rate of increase. It cannot be sustained. </para>
        <para>It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots. </para>
        <para>In this Budget, we have exercised restraint. That restraint needs to be shared throughout the whole community. There must be a community will to combat inflation. There must be action to back up that will. </para>
        <para>REINING IN BUDGET OUTLAYS</para>
        <para>Last financial year, outlays increased very sharply- by 46 per cent. </para>
        <para>Whereas total Australian Government Budget outlays maintained a remarkably stable proportion of around 25 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in the decade to 1973-74, in 1974-75 that proportion increased to 30.5 per cent. There was a number of special factors present in that outcome, including the need for some fiscal stimulus during the year. </para>
        <para>There is noting sacrosanct about the particular public and private sector shares of GDP. But sharp movements in these shares can be disruptive. </para>
        <para>If Budget outlays this year were again to grow faster than total spending, a further decline in the private sector share of GDP would ensue. That would mean an accelerated deline in investment and productivity as well as a further contraction in job opportunities. </para>
        <para>This Government is committed to the present &#39;mixed economy&#39; framework. We want to strengthen that framework. To reduce unemployment lastingly, revovery in the private sector is essential. </para>
        <para>Expenditure restraint in this Budget will lay the foundations for a desirable balance between the public and private sectors. </para>
        <para>Total outlays are now estimated to increase by 23 per cent in 1975-76, half the rate of increase of last year. Little change is expected in the proportion of Budget outlays to GDP. This offers a challenge to the private sector to respond with robust attitudes towards expansion which should serve well those who adopt them. </para>
        <para>Cutting back the increase in Budget outlays is not easy. Everyone favours expenditure restraint in the abstract; few favour it when it affects them personally. </para>
        <para>Many articulate groups in the community champion their favourite causes and I know that we will soon be hearing from them. I hope that, when we do hear, they will help the Government and me by indicating what alternative expenditure cuts might have been made or what tax increases they would be willing to bear. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, in approaching the task, we have distinguished between programs of utmost priority; programs where very rapid increases in recent years now permit some consolidation; and programs which might be deferred for a time. </para>
        <para>In all this we have protected the less well-off members of the community. Inevitably in the process, many desirable expenditures have been scaled down or postponed. We know this will concern and disappoint many. That is unfortunate, but in present circumstances it is also unavoidable. </para>
        <para>The process of consolidation upon which we embark in this Budget will need to be continued through a planned approach to expenditures into the years ahead. Indeed it will not be until the next Budget that we shall be able to begin to reap the fruits of consolidation in terms of the increased budgetary flexibility which we need. I am therefore considering the institution of improved procedures to ensure that the future growth of government spending is consistent with both broad economic management requirements and with the Government &#39;s highest priority social objectives. </para>
        <para>OUTLAYS</para>
        <para>Outlays in 1975-76 are estimated to total $21,91 5m, an increase of 23 per cent over actual outlays last year. </para>
        <para>Let there be no misunderstanding. Certainly we have cut back the growth of public expenditure. But the outlays we are undertaking provide continuing support for programs of scope and imagination never envisaged, much less undertaken, by our opponents. </para>
        <para>The cuts in proposed expenditure have been painful. But unfulfilled hopes should not obscure the realities of the range of reforms which already have touched- and will touch- every area of our society. </para>
        <para>I propose here only to mention briefly the major expenditure proposals. Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget Speech sets out the expenditure programs in great detail. The facts given in that Statement will show, function by function, the detailed working out of the process of consolidation I have referred to. </para>
        <para>Additional information will be announced by the responsible Ministers. </para>
        <para>DEFENCE</para>
        <para>Defence expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $ 1,800.1m. </para>
        <para>Last year we approved the acquisition of a number of major items for the Services, including long-range maritime patrol aircraft, tanks and patrol frigates. Significantly greater expenditure will be incurred this year on capital equipment, improvements to defence installations and on housing for servicemen. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Defence will make a detailed statement on Defence matters at a later time. </para>
        <para>EDUCATION</para>
        <para>One of the most important areas in the Budget is education. </para>
        <para>In 1975-76, total outlays on education are estimated at $ 1,908m, an increase of $237m over last year. </para>
        <para>In the first full year of office of this Government, Australian Government expenditure on education almost doubled. Last year, it almost doubled again. </para>
        <para>We have therefore almost quadrupled expenditure on education in these two years, and we are maintaining in 1975-76 the high level of expenditure now reached. This advance since 1972-73 reflects our determination to make good the relative neglect of earlier years. </para>
        <para>Our initiatives include pronounced increases in expenditure on schools and teachers colleges; expansion of technical and further education; acceptance of full financial responsibility for tertiary education throughout Australia; abolition of fees for tertiary and technical education and the introduction of new student assistance measures; and increased academic salaries adopted on the recommendation of the Academic Salaries Tribunal, with effect from October 1974. </para>
        <para>This year, recurrent expenditure will be maintained at no less than the present real levels, but capital expenditure will be limited to essential projects. </para>
        <para>Ordinarily, the 1976 calendar year would have seen the start of a new triennium for the financing of universities, colleges of advanced education and schools; and the technical and further education area would have been phased into triennial financing in July 1976. However, we have decided to treat the calendar year 1976 as a year outside the triennial progression. </para>
        <para>During the period to December 1976 we will continue the programs of the education commissions and present practices on escalating appropriations for cost increases will be continued. </para>
        <para>In the meantime, the education commissions will be asked to review their recent triennial reports and to bring in revised recommendations by March next for new triennial programs to commence in January 1977. The Minister for Education will provide more details later. </para>
        <para>The remarkable quadrupling of the total education expenditure figures in just over two years has been only part of the record. Benefits in relation to the quality of education will continue to flow on a long term basis from the machinery we have established and the programs we have fostered. Budget Paper No. 8, on education, outlines our record of achievements in this area. </para>
        <para>Care and Education of Young Children</para>
        <para>The Government is providing $74m in financial assistance to community organisations and to the States towards the care and education of young children. </para>
        <para>HEALTH</para>
        <para>Medibank</para>
        <para>Medibank was launched on 1 July last. $ 1, 445m is included in the Budget for this program. </para>
        <para>This financial year, medical and optometrical benefits are estimated to cost $6 15m while the hospital side of Medibank is estimated to cost $822m. </para>
        <para>Community Health</para>
        <para>A sum of $65m is appropriated for services provided under the Community Health Program. </para>
        <para>Hospitals Development Program</para>
        <para>A further $ 108m will be made available to the States in 1975-76 by way of capital assistance for the development of public hospitals and related health care facilities. </para>
        <para>The Australian Government will maintain its contribution at least at this level during each of the remaining 3 years of the program. </para>
        <para>Nursing Home Benefits</para>
        <para>It is proposed to increase the additional nursing home benefit in three States- New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. These increases represent the first step towards a common nursing home benefit rate for all States. </para>
        <para>The effect of the increases will be that ordinary care patients in those States will receive a uniform total benefit of $66.15 a week. Rates of benefit for ordinary care patients in other States, which are already higher, will be maintained at current levels. The supplementary intensive care benefit will be increased from $21 a week to $30.80 a week in all States. This benefit has remained unchanged since January 1969. </para>
        <para>The increases in both the additional and intensive care benefits will not apply to patients in Government nursing homes. </para>
        <para>These increases, estimated to cost $10m in 1975-76, take effect from the first pension pay day in November. </para>
        <para>Medical Research</para>
        <para>The Government will increase by 39 per cent, to $24m, its support in the 1976-78 triennium for medical reseach under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $4.0m. </para>
        <para>Additional payments totalling $lm will be made to the Florey and Walter and Eliza Hall research institutes. </para>
        <para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
        <para>Since this Government came to office a great stride forward in the field of social security and welfare has been taken. Now we must take stock of our programs and consolidate our gains. </para>
        <para>To that end the Prime Minister has announced that the Government is to institute a review of Australia&#39;s income security system. </para>
        <para>Social Security Benefit Rates</para>
        <para>The standard rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased in the Spring of 1975 by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index between the December quarter 1974 and the June quarter 1975; and again in the Autumn of 1976 by the increase in the Consumer Price Index between the June and December quarters of 1975. </para>
        <para>This will mean a first increase in the standard rate of $2.75 a week. The combined married rate will be increased by $4.50 a week so as to maintain the standard rate at 60 per cent of the combined married rate. These increases will become effective from the first pension pay day in November. </para>
        <para>The basic pension has increased by 80 per cent since the December quarter of 1972, well ahead of the rate of increase in average weekly earnings 56 per cent- and consumer prices- 41 per cent. The relative improvement compared to the average wage earner is even more pronounced in after-tax terms. Since the December quarter of 1972, the increase in take-home pay of the typical family man on average weekly earnings has been 50 per cent. </para>
        <para>The increases proposed will maintain the real purchasing power of those greatly increased pensions and are estimated to cost $233m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>There will be no change in the rate of unemployment and sickness benefit payable to persons under 18 years of age. </para>
        <para>The rates of additional pension and benefit payable for dependent children, including student children, are to be increased by 50c to $7.50 a week. </para>
        <para>Abolition of the Means Test </para>
        <para>For budgetary reasons the Government will not be able to complete the final stage of the abolition of the means test- for those aged 65 to 69 years- as quickly as it had hoped. Nonetheless we intend to make as much further progress as economic circumstances allow. </para>
        <para>We have decided to abolish the means test for residentially qualified persons aged 69 years from 1 July 1976. The necessary legislation will be introduced in the Autumn sittings. </para>
        <para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
        <para>Since coming to office the Government has improved repatriation benefits substantially. Legislation providing further improvements will be introduced in the current sittings and in Autumn 1976. </para>
        <para>Further information will be announced by the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. Details are set out in Statement No. 3. </para>
        <para>Aboriginal Advancement</para>
        <para>The record level of expenditure on Aboriginal advancement achieved in 1974-75 will be exceeded in 1975-76; direct expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $193m, compared with $ 158m in 1974-75 and $98m in 1973-74. </para>
        <para>HOUSING</para>
        <para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>In the light of the recovery in private housing now in train, advances totalling $364.6m will be provided to the States for welfare housing purposes in 1975-76. Bearing in mind the $ 10.4m advanced in June on the basis that it would be taken into account in this year&#39;s allocation we are thus maintaining advances in 1975-76 at the greatly increased 1974-75 level and well above the $2 1 8.6m allocated in 1 973-74. </para>
        <para>Australian Housing Corporation</para>
        <para>Responsibility for the Defence Service Homes scheme has been transferred to the newly proclaimed Australian Housing Corporation. An amount of $ 122.5m will be available for Defence Service Homes advances in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>A further $20m has been provided for the Corporation in 1975-76. Together with the $25m remaining unspent from 1974-75, this will enable the Corporation to meet its administrative expenses and to undertake new programs in the housing field. </para>
        <para>Details will be announced later by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. </para>

        <para class="block">Postal and Telecommunications Services Since 1 July 1975, the former functions of the Post Office have been undertaken by the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. </para>
        <para>Increased postal and telecommunication charges to operate from 1 September 1975 have already been announced. The increased charges are necessary to cover significant increases in the cost of providing services and to enable each Commission to comply with the requirement, under its constituting legislation, to cover its costs and finance at least 50 per cent of its capital expenditure from internal sources. </para>
        <para>The amount to be provided from the Budget to help finance the capital programs of the two Commissions comprises $14m for the Postal Commission and $403m for the Telecommunications Commission. </para>
        <para>If the increased charges were not applied, then the costs they were to cover would have to be covered in some other way. That is, the Government would either have to increase direct or indirect taxes, or add to the deficit by printing money. </para>
        <para>Alternatively, the Goverment could cut-back further on existing programs but it is clear that additional cut-backs would be extremely difficult to make. </para>
        <para>Air Transport</para>
        <para>It was announced in the 1973-74 Budget Speech that the Government proposed to increase the rate of recovery of the costs of providing and operating airport and airway facilities to 80 per cent within 5 years. It was then estimated that a recovery rate of 70 per cent should be reached in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>Despite increases in air navigation charges, very little progress has been made towards this objective. Currently about 55 per cent of costs are being recovered. </para>
        <para>The Government does not believe that the general taxpayer should continue to subsidise air services and proposes to achieve its objective of 80 per cent recovery by 1977-78. Action will be taken to increase the recovery rate to 70 per cent this year. </para>
        <para>This will require increases in air navigation charges substantially greater than the maximum 15 per cent annual increase referred to in the 1973 Airlines Agreement. The airlines have undertaken in the Agreement to negotiate such changes as are necessary to achieve the objective of 80 percent recovery by 1978. </para>
        <para>Rail Transport</para>
        <para>An amount of $5 1.9m is being provided to finance the new Australian National Railways Commission&#39;s 1975-76 capital works program, compared with expenditure of $ 14.6m by the former Commonwealth Railways in 1974-75. This includes work on the railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs, and on the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge line. It also includes funds for the Tasmanian railways and for the South Australian railways. </para>
        <para>A further $40m is being provided to the Commission as a subsidy to cover its estimated losses in 1975-76; the Tasmanian and nonmetropolitan South Australian railways are expected to account for about 80 per cent of this loss. </para>
        <para class="block">Urban Public Transport the Australian Government has so far agreed to provide $138m under the terms of the Urban Public Transport Assistance Agreement to assist the States to upgrade their urban public transport systems. </para>

        <para class="block">Ceiling on Staff Growth </para>
        <para>Our measures to restrain the growth in spending apply particularly to staff growth. As already announced, the growth in full-time staff employed under the Public Service Act in 1975-76 is to be limited to a ceiling increase of 2.8 per cent. </para>
        <para>After allowance for the expected increase in staff on leave, the ceiling increase in operative staff is effectively 1.5 per cent. This compares with increases in operative staff of over 4 per cent in 1972-73 and 1973-74, and over 5 per cent in 1974-75.

It is estimated that the financial assistance grants payable to the States in 1975-76 under these new arrangements will total about $3,185m, an increase of $81 lm or 34.2 per cent over the grants paid in 1 974-75. </para>
        <para>In addition, the Government has accepted recommendations by the Grants Commission that special grants totalling $38.8m be paid to Queensland and South Australia in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>The Government also agreed in June to support a 1975-76 Loan Council program for State Governments of $l,291m which, after adjustments are made for special factors, represents an increase of 20 per cent over the program for </para>
        <para class="block">1974- 75. </para>
        <para>Local Government Grants</para>
        <para>The Government has already announced its acceptance of the recommendations contained in the Grants Commission&#39;s second report on unconditional financial assistance for local government totalling $79.9m, or 42 per cent more than last year. </para>
        <para>Natural Disaster Relief</para>
        <para>It is presently estimated that expenditures by the Government on natural disaster relief in 1975- 76 will total $57.6m, of which $48. lm will be for relief measures arising out of the devastation of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy. </para>
        <para>Included in this latter amount are $33m for continuation of compensation payments to Darwin residents and $12m for the maintenance of various relief measures, including emergency accommodation and loans to small businesses. </para>
        <para>We have also established the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, and provided $99.7m for the Commission&#39;s construction program in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>RECEIPTS</para>
        <para>In deciding on our revenue measures we took it as essential that there be some reduction in both personal and company income tax. At the same time we judged it necessary to reduce the potential deficit somewhat. </para>
        <para>Consequently, we have determined on a mix of tax measures, some of them increasing the revenue and some reducing it. Their net effect is to increase total tax revenue in 1975-76 by an estimated $207m. Details are given in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the individual tax measures. </para>
        <para>Beer</para>
        <para>It is proposed to increase the duty on beer immediately by the equivalent of 4c a 10 ounce glass. The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 is $234m. </para>
        <para class="block">Potable spirits </para>
        <para>Duties on potable spirits have been increased considerably over recent years and the present scope for further increase is not great. It is proposed to increase the duty on potable spirits immediately by the equivalent of lc a nip. It is also proposed to complete the third and last step in the phasing out of the differential between the rates of duty on brandy and other potable spirits. The estimated revenue yield of these measures in 1975-76 is $ 12m. </para>
        <para>Tobacco Products</para>
        <para>The duty on tobacco and cigarettes will be increased immediately by the equivalent of 6c an average packet of 20 cigarettes, with equivalent increases on other tobacco products. The estimated revenue yield in 1 975-76 is $75m. </para>
        <para>Crude Petroleum</para>
        <para>The present price of domestically produced crude oil is about one-quarter of the landed price of imported crude. The low domestic price is not conducive to rational resource usage. Yet is does not necessarily follow that increases in the domestic price should be reflected fully in corresponding increases in prices to Australian producers: the rise in world oil prices has occurred largely because governments in OPEC and other producing countries have greatly increased their taxes on production. </para>
        <para>The indigenous crude oil absorption policy, which runs for a period of 10 years from 17 September 1970, provides for a review of price after 5 years. The Government is considering and will be announcing shortly the price arrangements which will apply from 17 September next. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, the Government has decided to impose a levy of $2 per barrel on production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquified petroleum gas, with immediate effect. The levy will not fall on natural gas or refinery products although, of course, its price effects can be expected to spread through into the latter. </para>
        <para>The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 is $280m. </para>
        <para>Export Duty on Coal </para>
        <para>Following the sharp rise in oil prices, coal prices have risen dramatically in the past two years, in many cases trebling. In consequence, very large windfall profits are currently being earned by the export sector of the coal industry. The Government considers it reasonable that part of these increased profits should be channelled to the community by means of an export duty. </para>
        <para>Price movements for various classes of coal have not been uniform but higher quality coking coals have experienced much greater price increases than other coals. It is therefore proposed to levy export duty of $6 per tonne on these high quality coking coals and $2 per tonne on other coals, with immediate effect. To protect buyers in respect of prices recently renegotiated, approval to export will be in terms of those prices and no consideration will be given to adjustment of prices to take account of the duty. </para>
        <para>The revenue yield from this duty in 1975-76 is estimated to be $ 1 20m. </para>
        <para>Details of this and the other levies I have announced will be given later tonight by the Minister representing the Minister for Police and Customs. </para>
        <para>Company Tax</para>
        <para>The Government has had before it the recommendations on business taxation contained in the Mathews Report on &#39;Inflation and Taxation&#39;. These are important recommendations with complex ramifications and there is a need for further study of them before final decisions are made. Meanwhile, we are acting to alleviate business taxation and we have been aided in coming to our decisions by the Mathews Report. </para>
        <para>The first of the Mathews recommendations related to the valuation of most trading stocks for taxation purposes. Its primary purpose was to ease pressures on business liquidity in inflationary periods. </para>
        <para>After careful consideration we have decided that it is not at this time possible to act on this recommendation, partly because of its enormous revenue cost but also because of the complexity and difficulty involved in giving effect to the Committee&#39;s proposal to defer tax for individual firms on the basis of each individual firms &#39;s changing stock values. Very serious practical problems would also be created for both industry and the Taxation Office in implementing the Committee&#39;s suggestion that deferred tax be collected when stock values fall or when businesses change hands. It has not been possible to this time to resolve these difficulties. </para>
        <para>We shall, of course, keep the question of business profitability and liquidity under careful notice but, in all the circumstances, we have turned to the other alternative in this area which was mentioned by the Mathews Committeenamely, a reduction in company tax. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to adopt this alternative and proposes to reduce the general rate of company tax by 2.5 per cent to 42.5 per cent. The new rate will apply to 1974-75 income and will cost an estimated $ 120m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>We have also decided to continue the system of doubled rates of depreciation beyond 30 June 1975 and extend it to all sectors of commerce and industry. We have here taken note of the Mathews Committee&#39;s advice that: &#39;Accelerated depreciation and investment allowances are appropriate policy options for a government which wishes to influence the level or the pattern of private investment . . . </para>
        <para>The doubled rates of depreciation will be made applicable to all new plant other than motor cars and utility trucks, including plant used in industry such as transportation and construction that were excluded from the 1974-75 double depreciation provisions and from the investment allowances granted from time to time by the previous Government. The first cost to revenue of this proposal will fall in 1976-77 and will approximate $7 5m. </para>
        <para>Our decision to opt for double depreciation rather than the indexation of depreciation allowances as recommended in the Mathews Report reflected our view that it was desirable to introduce immediately a clearly understood aid to business investment. The indexation recommendation would introduce some complex new elements into the depreciation provisions and there is a need for further study as to how a practicable and equitable scheme might be worked out. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, the double depreciation provisions will without delay greatly help the business sector in the planning of its investment and cash flows. </para>
        <para>Personal Income Tax</para>
        <para>At this point I say simply that we have decided to introduce a radical new personal income tax system. We have undertaken fundamental reform of the tax system with one overwhelmingly important objective- the achievement of a more equitable distribution of the tax burden. </para>
        <para>Before explaining the features of the new scheme, I want to explain the rationale behind what is perhaps the most revolutionary change since the inception of our personal income tax system. Yet one fact will highlight the direction we are taking more than anything else I might say. Under the new system nearly half a million existing taxpayers will be freed from tax entirely. Those earning least in the community will be exempted from personal tax. </para>
        <para>A very large number of taxpayers will benefit by the changes we are making. But what is of greatest satisfaction to the Government is the fact that those in most need will benefit substantially. </para>
        <para>In the best of economic times inequalities could not be removed in one sweep. We make no pretence of doing so now. We do say that the new system represents a very considerable advance. </para>
        <para>The existing personal income tax system has persisted almost unchanged for over two decades and has about reached the end of its tether. </para>
        <para>Criticism of the present arrangements has rightly focused upon the excessive marginal rates which are imposed upon taxpayers on average incomes. For example, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a dependent wife and two dependent children and average other deductions would lose 44 cents of each dollar of his pay in higher taxation if the present rates were maintained. If he had smaller deductions his marginal rate could be as high as 48 cents in the dollar. </para>
        <para>In deciding what to do about this state of affairs we had several choices. The Mathews Report recommended that this year we introduce tax indexation or, alternatively, introduce a new tax schedule with a commitment to index it in future. The Asprey Report recommended that a quite different type of rate scale be introduced, with an initial marginal rate much higher than at present and with much lower marginal rates at intermediate ranges of income. </para>
        <para>So far as the rate scale is concerned, what we are proposing is based on the Asprey concept. But before going on, I should explain the Government&#39;s attitude to tax indexation. </para>
        <para class="block">It would not be possible to introduce tax indexation this year because of the very great revenue cost. In any case, the present rate scale is wholly unsatisfactory as a basis for indexation. Consequently we are taking up the Mathews suggestion of introducing a new tax scale to apply this year. </para>
        <para>As for next year, no Government can commit itself to a precise measure a year hence when the revenue implications are so large but the circumstances of that future time are not foreseeable. However, in framing the 1976-77 Budget the Government will take full advantage of the greater flexibility- including greater flexibility in adjusting for price increases- which this year&#39;s reform of the tax system will offer. Indexing of the new scale will thus be available as an option next year. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, so far as this year is concerned, I mention that the new scale will actually reduce marginal tax rates of taxpayers on average weekly earnings by more than would be the case if the present scale were indexed. That is, what we propose will produce a better result than tax indexation so far as the marginal &#39;tax bite&#39; is concerned. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the proposed new system. The Asprey Report drew attention to the low marginal rates of tax on low incomes and suggested that they be increased. It added: &#39;The most important advantage of an initial step of some magnitude is not that it raises much tax from the taxpayers whose total income is confined within this step; it is rather that a sizeable minimum average rate is thereby struck for all higher incomes. Without a significant rate on the lower steps, much higher marginal rates than otherwise must be imposed further up the income scale . . .&#39; </para>
        <para>This approach, of course, involves raising more tax from so-called low income earners. Many such people depend solely on their own incomes and could hardly be expected to pay more tax. Certainly this Government does not expect them to do so. </para>
        <para>But many others in this income group are members of multi-income households who might be supposed, on general social grounds, to be capable of contributing further. </para>
        <para>We have therefore devised a system designed to retain the desirable features of the Asprey suggestion but to exclude the undesirable income distribution features. Material is available describing the new system in detail. Here I outline its main features. </para>
        <para>First, there will be a new and much simplified rate scale, with only seven steps instead of the present fourteen. The marginal rates will begin at 20c in the dollar on taxable incomes up to $2,000 rising to 27c in the dollar on incomes from $2,000 to $5,000 and 35c in the dolar on incomes from $5,000 to $10,000. The marginal rates rise in four further steps to reach a maximum of 65c in the dollar at a taxable income of $25,000. </para>
        <para>On incomes from $6,000 to $25,000 marginal rates generally will fall, the greatest fall being in the $8,000-$ 10,000 income range, where the drop is from 48c to 35c in the dollar. </para>
        <para>Secondly, every individual taxpayer, whether or not he or she has dependants or spends on items which attract deductions, will receive a minimum concessional rebate of $540. This will protect low income earners from the impact of the higher marginal rates at low income levels. </para>
        <para>The minimum concessional rebate does this by, in effect, increasing the minimum taxable income from its present $1,041 to $2,520 per annum. The introduction of this rebate will make possible the elimination of the present age rebate and the new scheme provides for that. </para>
        <para>Thirdly, the present concessional allowances for dependants will be replaced by much more generous dependants&#39; rebates. For a spouse the rebate will be $400; for children it will be $200 for the first child under 16 and student children redefined to include all children under 25 receiving full-time education, and $150 in respect of other children. </para>
        <para>There will be a separate rebate of $200, known as the Sole Parent Rebate, for parents without partners, such as widows or widowers or unmarried persons, who have the sole responsibility for maintenance of dependent children. </para>
        <para>Fourthly, with some exceptions 1 shall mention, the existing concessional deductions for private expenditures will be converted to rebates calculated at 40c in the dollar of the amounts allowable under the present law. However, the minumum concessional rebate will be regarded as covering the first $540 of rebate claimable, other than for dependants. The effect of this will be that taxpayers whose rebatable expenditures are less than $ 1 ,350 will not need to itemise them as they will be covered by the minimum concessional rebate. </para>
        <para>There will be certain exceptions to these rebate arrangements, as follows. </para>
        <para>The existing housing loan interest deduction scheme will remain in its present form; that is, allowable deductions as presently prescribed will reduce taxable income. </para>
        <para>The existing provisions for gifts to charities and school building funds will also remain unaltered. </para>
        <para>There will be separate Zone Allowance Rebates over the above the $540 minimum concessional rebate for taxpayers in the prescribed zones. </para>
        <para>Finally, the allowable deduction for education expenses, now one of the concessional deductions to be converted to the rebate basis, will be increased from $ 1 50 to $250 per student child. </para>
        <para>It is not possible to outline all the benefits of the new tax system in this Speech. The main attractions, however, are as follows: nearly 500 000 taxpayers will be freed from tax entirely; there will be a very big increase in minimum taxable incomes- for example, to $5,372 in the case of a taxpayer with a dependent wife and two dependent student children; there will be a very big drop in marginal rates of tax on incomes in the range into which most full-time employees fall; taxpayers with dependants are heavily favoured as compared with the present system, particularly in the lower income ranges. For example, in his statement announcing tax cuts last November, the Prime Minister gave as an illustration the taxpayer with a dependent wife and two dependent children earning $100 a week. If his other deductions were 10 per cent of his income his tax payable would have declined from $568 in 1973-74 to $264 in 1974-75. Under the new arrangements such a taxpayer is freed from tax entirely. </para>
        <para>We believe that the new system is both more equitable and more adaptable for revenue raising and economic management purposes. </para>
        <para>Because of the extensive changes it entails, it will not be possible to have the proposed system in operation for PAYE purposes until 1 January 1976. </para>
        <para>The cost to revenue of the new system I have outlined cannot be as simply summarised as is usually the case. On a true &#39;full year&#39; basis, the cost to revenue will be $205m. </para>
        <para>However, an additional advantage of the new system to taxpayers is that it will permit a large reduction in the present degree of overdeduction of PAYE tax instalments- and a consequential reduction in refunds which, this year, are estimated at $ 1,025m. That will assist the monetary authorities by reducing seasonal swings in revenue flows; it will also reduce the need for taxpayers to make, as it were, involuntary loans to the Government. </para>
        <para>The combined effect of the taxation measures I have outlined and of the more accurate PAYE deductions which they make possible will be a substantial reduction in PAYE tax instalments for most taxpayers from the beginning of 1976. The precise instalments to be applied will be determined in due course, but I mention, for purposes of illustration, that the rise in the takehome pay of a wage-earner with a dependent wife and two children, and earning between $ 100 and $ 1 50 per week, will be well over $5 per week. There will be small rises- generally of less than $1 per week- in the PAYE instalment deductions of some taxpayers without dependants. </para>
        <para>The total estimated cost to revenue of the scheme in 1975-76 if $395m but, of this $365m is attributable to the more accurate PAYE deductions which the new arrangements will permit. </para>
        <para>Property Income Surcharge</para>
        <para>It is proposed to abolish the property income surcharge with effect from this income year. There will be no cost to revenue in 1975-76; the cost in a full year will be $25m. </para>
        <para>BUDGET OUTCOME</para>
        <para>In aggregate, Budget outlays are estimated to increase in 1975-76 by $4,084m or 22.9 per cent to$21,915m. </para>
        <para>Receipts are estimated to increase by $3, 852m or 25 .2 per cent to $ 1 9, 1 1 7m. </para>
        <para>The estimated deficit is thus $2,798m and the domestic deficit $2,068m. </para>
        <para>THE POST-BUDGET ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
        <para>Given the budgetary decisions we have made, what is the economic outlook for the period ahead? </para>
        <para>Some indications are provided in Statement No. 2 attached; here I pick up the key points. </para>
        <para>Reflecting our policy decisions, government spending at all levels will show only modest real  growth. </para>
        <para>With the exception of business investment expenditure, which remains the weakest area of prospective demand, other components of domestic spending should show a strengthening trend and prospects for exports are also reasonably good. Imports have been quite subdued but will probably pick up during the year. </para>
        <para>In recent months, consistent with the need to avoid sudden and disruptive changes in the monetary aggregates, the Reserve Bank has acted to gradually restrain the growth in bank lending and liquidity. Nonetheless the liquidity of the banking system should be sufficient to meet the basic immediate needs of the economy for finance without being fully accommodating to inflation. </para>
        <para>In this Budget fiscal policy has been brought into better balance with monetary policy; both have now appropriately shifted from earlier strong stimulus to postures of moderation. </para>
        <para>Against this background, real Gross Domestic Product is forecast to increase by about 5 per cent in 1975-76, after falling by 2 per cent in 1974-75. Prospects for employment should improve, but the improvement is likely to be gradual. </para>
        <para>The course charted has its risks and the possibility of temporary reverses cannot be ruled out. Our commitment to what I earlier called a middle way between the two extremes makes that inevitable. What I do say is that, if there is an equal commitment in the community to play its part in steering the economy back to a firmer footing, we shall be able to overcome any such temporary problems. </para>
        <para>On the matter of prices, the increased duties on beer, tobacco and potable spirits will increase prices as stocks are worked off. There will also be price increases, which cannot be calculated with precision, resulting from the passing on of the crude petroleum levy into the prices of motor spirit and other products. The increased postal and telephone charges to come into operation from 1 September next will also add a little to the CPI in the December quarter. </para>
        <para>The Government is fully aware that, in itself, the effect on prices is unwelcome. What were the alternatives? </para>
        <para>One alternative would have been to let the deficit rise even further. That would have been more inflationary and would have thrown an undue burden onto monetary policy. </para>
        <para>Another alternative would have been to refrain both from raising these indirect taxes and from reducing company and personal income taxes. </para>
        <para>We considered that course equally untenable. </para>
        <para>In theory, another alternative would have been to cut our expenditures by a further $500m or $600m. We examined that possibility but concluded that it was impracticable. </para>
        <para>I can only say that I hope that those who suggest the contrary will bring forward specific suggestions as to where we could have reined in expenditures even more stringently than we have. </para>
        <para>In drawing attention to these price effects, I add that it is the Government&#39;s firm view that, for the purposes of wage indexation, increases in prices resulting from tax measures of the sort that I have announced should be discounted. It would be self-defeating if the system of wage indexation were to attempt to insulate the community from tax measures designed to redistribute resources for the benefit of the community in the form of improved public facilities in fields such as education, health, welfare, personal benefits, urban improvement and so on. These improvements must be seen as a real improvement in people&#39;s living standards and are a non-money form of addition to their incomes. </para>
        <para>In its submissions in the recent wage indexation hearings before the Arbitration Commission the Government foreshadowed the likelihood that it would make submissions on this matter in future quarterly hearings. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding these direct price effects of the indirect tax measures, we look for a continuing downward shift in the underlying rate of inflation during 1975-76. It can hardly be more than a slow winding down within that timeframe; but our time-frame must extend beyond the immediate confines of this financial year. 1975-76 is therefore seen as a year of consolidation. Economic growth will only be restored by way of gradual policies firmly grounded upon an effective anti-inflationary foundation. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
        <para>In this Budget the Government has endeavoured to give a lead to the community. </para>
        <para>If inflation is to be curbed there are no soft options- only a choice between more or less difficult ones. </para>
        <para>For our part, our hope is that with a community appreciation of the need for restraint, we can make a real start on getting inflation under control and further raising living standards for everybody. </para>
        <para>I commend the Budget to Honourable Members. </para>

        <para>Background</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Developments in the Australian economy and associated policies in 1974-75 need to be seen against the backdrop of the events of the immediately preceding years, both at home and abroad. 1974 saw a severe cyclical downswing in most industrialised countries. The degree of coincidence of the cycle across countries was unusual and, via trade and other international linkages, helped to intensify the recession. In the same period, the price performances of most countries deteriorated further with inflation rates reaching record heights. This situation was aggravated by the significant cost-inflationary and demandcontractionary effects imparted by the large abrupt increases in oil prices in 1973-74. In the face of escalating inflation rates (and in some cases balance of payments difficulties), most major countries, were reluctant to use demand management policies to try to offset the developing recession in its early stages. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Australia had been comparatively insulated from the oil price rises; and the downturn in world activity also reflected in only muted fashion in demand for Australian exports. Of more significance to domestic developments was the surge in imports which got under way in 1974, reflecting orders placed when demand was buoyant, and which ensued with the relaxation of global capacity constraints. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In Australia the year 1973-74 had been one in which the labour market was very tight and pressures on resources acute. Many goods were in short supply. These conditions had their origins in an earlier world boom in commodity prices and induced domestic wage responses; large balance of payments surpluses; budgetary policies primarily concerned with increasing the relative command over resources by the public sector; excessive growth in the monetary aggregates in the early stages of the expansion; a build-up of demand pressures and, consequently, wage-price pressures. A variety of anti-inflationary policy measures were taken during 1973-74. With fiscal options constrained by other objectives, reliance was placed on monetary and external instruments to a much greater extent than in the past and on the operation of the Prices Justification Tribunal. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Mid-1974 proved a turning point. As 1974-75 unfolded, aggregate output declined very sharply; for the year as a whole consumer prices rose by almost 17 per cent and the unemployment rate reached a peak of almost 5 per cent. Stimulatory policy responses were quick and substantial. As a result the downturn, although pronounced, now shows signs of reversal. </para>
        <para>Activity and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The course of economic activity in 1974-75 falls into two phases corresponding to the two (half-years: a sharp downturn in the first half followed by the beginnings of a recovery in the second. The following commentary conforms to this pattern, drawing upon the accompanying charts which show half-yearly movements. Since the economy is an interrelated whole, starting the discussion with developments in real activity, though conventional, is to some extent arbitrary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">During the first half of 1974 it became increasingly apparent that excess demand had peaked. As the then Treasurer said in the House on 23 July 1974, &#34;The boom, perhaps, is already on the wane&#39;. On the other hand it was equally clear that inflationary expectations were intensifying. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Activity weakened dramatically in the opening months of 1974-75 with consequential effects in the labour market. The lift in unemployment that occurred was considerably larger than would normally be associated with the turn-around in domestic demand. This development seems principally attributable to the following factors: o The volume of money dropped sharply in mid-1974 following a restrictive domestic monetary policy stance and a sizeable outflow of funds on external account. (A more detailed discussion of monetary developments appears below.)  o  Structural adjustments in demand which were creating specific strains on the supply side. o An &#39;overhang&#39; of imports ordered in more buoyant times which, with the easing of foreign capacity constraints, significantly added to supplies in the June and September quarters. With liquidity tight and short-term interest rates temporarily high, stock-holding could not be financed easily. o The wage explosion which, in the face of weakening demand, financial tightness, heightened import competition and administrative restraint on the ability to recoup cost increases in prices, caused a very sharp squeeze on profits. o General uncertainty in the face of continued inflation.  o  A greater tendency for &#39;working wives&#39; to register with the CES on becoming unemployed than was the case in the past. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It was the concurrence of these influences, not the uniqueness of any one of them, that intensified the increase in unemployment. It should be clear, in the light of the rapid &#39;turn-over&#39; of wage negotiations that was occurring, that the removal of any or all of the policy constraints applied in that period would have allowed the wage explosion to run even further and more fully. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Examining 1974 in more detail, it is evident from Chart 1 that the growth of <inline font-style="italic">total final expenditure</inline> (panel f) was little different in the two halves of the calendar year. In the second half, <inline font-style="italic">private consumption expenditure</inline> (panel a) showed little growth, partly because of the inroads into disposable income generated by the progressive tax scale, and partly because of the influence of tight financial conditions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private investment</inline>(panels b and c) also turned down - earlier in the cycle than is normally the case - again partly because of the availability and cost of finance but, more importantly, because of the effects on confidence from the squeeze on profits conjoined with inflation. Slackening private sector expenditure was partly offset by a sharp rise in <inline font-style="italic">government expenditure</inline> (panel d) and by a resurgence of <inline font-style="italic">exports</inline> (panel e) which occurred in spite of the deteriorating world economic outlook. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although total final expenditure held up rather well during 1974, product growth fell away sharply. <inline font-style="italic">Stock accumulation</inline> (panel g), largely involuntary, remained positive but in the first half of 1974-75, made almost no contribution to growth. Growth in <inline font-style="italic">imports</inline> (panel h) more than satisfied the sluggish aggregate demand and <inline font-style="italic">domestic product</inline> fell accordingly (panel i). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Private sector <inline font-style="italic">employment</inline> fell sharply in the latter part of 1974, the manufacturing sector being particularly hard hit. Rapid growth in government employment provided some offset but seasonally adjusted registered <inline font-style="italic">unemployment</inline> climbed to 3.9 per cent by the end of the calendar year. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As unemployment increased, its relief was accorded top policy priority. Stimulatory measures were initiated as early as the September quarter and continued through to the March quarter of 1975. (A comprehensive list may be found in the Calendar of Economic Events in quarterly Treasury Information Bulletins.) External, fiscal, monetary and employment policy measures were taken, the more important being: o <inline font-style="italic">External measures:</inline> Devaluation of the $A by 12 per cent in September 1974; relaxation and then suspension of the Variable Deposit Requirement provision and removal of the overseas borrowing embargo beyond 6 months; and imposition of quotas and other restrictions on imports in certain sensitive areas where unemployment considerations were overriding. o <inline font-style="italic">Fiscal measures:</inline> Substantial cuts in personal income tax; reduction in company tax rates and introduction of accelerated depreciation allowances; very substantial additions to outlays, including significantly increased payments to the States and an advance of $150 million to banks for on-lending for housing; and temporary reductions in sales tax on motor vehicles. The 1974-75 Australian Government Budget originally allowed for an increase in outlays of 32 per cent and a deficit of $570 million. Outlays in fact increased by 46 per cent and the actual deficit was $2,567 million. o <inline font-style="italic">Monetary measures</inline> (in addition to the monetary effects of the external and fiscal measures mentioned above): The SRD ratio of the major trading banks was reduced progressively from 9 per cent to 3 per cent (a record low ratio); a special drawingfacility was created by the Reserve Bank to support bank liquidity; short-term official interest rates were substantially reduced; and regulations governing savings bank investments were amended to encourage lending for housing. o <inline font-style="italic">Employment policy measures:</inline> Specific schemes to create employment opportunities including the Regional Employment Development Scheme, special employment grants to the States, and greatly expanded subsidies for apprenticeship training. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Largely in response to these policies, <inline font-style="italic">total final expenditure</inline> rose sharply in the second half of the financial year (see Chart 1, panel f). <inline font-style="italic">Government expenditure</inline> (panel d) and <inline font-style="italic">exports</inline> (panel e) continued to grow strongly and the first signs of recovery in private sector demand appeared with a sharp jump in retail sales in January. Reflecting disposable incomes that had been boosted by the temporary doubling-up, from 1 January 1975, of income tax rate reductions, and the sales tax cut on motor vehicles, <inline font-style="italic">consumer spending</inline> (panel a) grew at above average rates throughout the second half of the financial year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Lending for housing by the major institutions increased rapidly in the December quarter and, in total, continued to grow throughout the March and June quarters. Although an abnormally large part of this lending was applied towards the purchase of previously occupied dwellings, commencements of new dwellings did pick up somewhat in the March quarter and, by the June quarter, overall <inline font-style="italic">dwelling activity</inline> had begun to rise again. <inline font-style="italic">Other private investment</inline> (panel c) continued to fall. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The upsurge in final expenditure was accompanied by a sharp fall in <inline font-style="italic">imports</inline> (panel h) and an equally sharp run-down in <inline font-style="italic">stocks</inline> (panel g). Notwithstanding a net contribution from these non-production sources of supply, aggregate output had begun to respond by the June quarter and, for the half-year, registered a moderate increase. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The prominent role in the cyclical adjustment process played by movements in inventories and imports (illustrated in Chart 1) has something of a counterpart in productivity (average output per worker) changes. Just as those former movements acted to buffer production against fluctuations in domestic sales, short-run productivity changes partly cushioned the effect on employment of swings in output. In other words, the improvement in productivity allowed production to increase at an appreciably faster rate than employment. Chart 2 provides the picture. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Although <inline font-style="italic">employment</inline> (panel a) declined throughout the first half of 1974-75, it remained a little higher on average than in the previous half-year. Accordingly, a sharp fall in <inline font-style="italic">product</inline> (panel c) was largely reflected in an even sharper drop in <inline font-style="italic">productivity</inline> (panel b) - a development that had already begun in the previous halfyear. As product began to recover in the second half of the financial year, most of the adjustment was again borne by productivity growth, with employment continuing to decline. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Seasonally adjusted registered <inline font-style="italic">unemployment</inline> rose further in the opening months of 1975, to 4.7 per cent in April, but by mid-year seemed to have reached a plateau. Specific public employment-creating schemes contributed significantly to this levelling. </para>
        <para>Balance of Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For the financial year 1974-75 there was a payments deficit of $463 million, comprised of a deficit on current account of $1,081 million and a capital account (including balancing item) surplus of $618 million. At the close of the year international reserves stood at $3.5 billion. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The external account, and its influence on the domestic economy, altered radically through the year (see Table 1). After several earlier months of deficit, the <inline font-style="italic">overall payments position</inline> moved sharply into a record deficit of $585 million in the September quarter as the import boom peaked. In the following months the payments position recovered and for the second half of 1974-75 was in overall surplus. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="096131197508194_76_11.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">During the year world trading conditions became progressively more difficult. The level of economic activity in a number of major countries declined, with particularly sharp falls in industrial production. The overall volume of world trade fell away. Despite these circumstances, the value of Australian <inline font-style="italic">export receipts</inline> expanded through the period - chiefly due to price increases but for 1974-75 as a whole, volumes rose by around 5 per cent. This performance reflected very strong growth in a few products - wheat, sugar, coal, iron ore - while markets for many other products weakened. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Bottlenecks in the supply of traded goods were removed with the easing of demand overseas early in calendar 1974. In consequence, despite weaker internal demand, the Australian market experienced an unprecedented inflow of <inline font-style="italic">imports,</inline> building up extremely rapidly in the June and September quarters of 1974. By the end of the September quarter this belated response to earlier excess domestic demand conditions was working itself out. Lower internal demand, together with the September devaluation and, to some extent, import controls, produced a dramatic falling away in imports; by the June quarter import volume had declined by about 30 per cent from the: September peak. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private capital movements</inline>were for the most part subdued and foreign investment of an equity nature remained particularly weak in 1974-75. There was some renewed interest in overseas borrowings following the September devaluation and the relaxation of the capital controls but, despite a period of relatively low interest rates overseas, net apparent private capital inflow remained well below the average experience of earlier years. </para>
        <para>Monetary Conditions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 2 sets out the main factors underlying quarterly movements in the volume of money (M3) over the past three financial years. Quarterly changes in the volume of money (seasonally adjusted) are shown in Chart 3. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1972-73 the <inline font-style="italic">volume of money</inline> broadly defined (M3) increased by 26 per cent. Reinforcing measures affecting the external account late in 1972, action was taken progressively during 1973, including increases in interest rates and the Statutory Reserve Deposit ratio applying to trading banks, to curb the growth of the monetary aggregates. Even so, the volume of money continued to grow rapidly and in September 1973 Government security yields were sharply increased in a move by the authorities to control financial conditions by means of open market operations. At this time the $A was revalued by a further 5 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These measures rapidly influenced the broad monetary aggregates. The volume of money (M3), which had grown at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 23 per cent in the September quarter 1973, grew by 12 per cent in the December quarter. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The continuing effects of the measures taken during 1973, and the greater than normal run-down in private sector holdings of LGS assets in the first half of 1974, resulted in a substantial tightening in financial conditions. In the June quarter a number of trading banks borrowed from the Reserve Bank in order to hold their LGS ratios to the conventional minimum. <inline font-style="italic">Interest rates</inline> continued to move up toward the end of 1973-74 and, with trading banks bidding competitively for funds through the issue of large denomination certificates of deposit, both private and official short-term rates increased sharply; an inverse yield structure emerged. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As can be seen from Table 2 and Chart 3, increases in <inline font-style="italic">primary liquidity</inline> (private sector LGS assets) continued to show more than seasonally normal declines as 1974 progressed. For 1973-74 as a whole, primary liquidity showed no change compared with increases of $1,644 million in 1972-73 and $1,440 million in 1971-72. Despite the tightening financial conditions during the year, M3 increased by more than 14 per cent over the year to June 1974. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the opening quarter of the new financial year a substantial balance of payments deficit intensified the tightening conditions and, in combination with a fall in advances outstanding of the major trading banks, culminated in a seasonally adjusted fall in the volume of money, broadly defined, in that quarter (see Chart 3). New lending by most financial institutions fell away to very low levels. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In recognition of the need to moderate the tightness in financial markets the <inline font-style="italic">SRD ratio</inline> was lowered in eight stages from 9 per cent to 3 per cent between June and October 1974, entailing the release of approximately $700 million to the major trading banks. Additional measures included reductions in yields on short-term Government securities and freer access to foreign funds by suspension of the Variable Deposit Requirement scheme and contraction of the embargo period for short-term overseas borrowings from 2 years to 6 months. In September the $A was devalued by 12 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A number of prominent companies extensively involved in property development failed during the period of tightness and investor activity became cautious. As a consequence some financial institutions experienced difficulties with net funds flows in the early weeks of October 1974. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The fiscal and monetary measures taken during 1974-75, along with the turnaround in the balance of payments, have substantially altered the monetary situation and outlook. At the time of the Budget in September 1974 the overall deficit for 1974-75 was estimated at S570 million; a deficit of 82,567 million eventuated. Mainly as a result of the slower tempo of domestic economic activity and the devaluation of September 1974, the balance of payments, which was sizeably in deficit in the second half of 1974, has now moved into surplus. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Primary liquidity</inline>grew by a record $2,250 million in 1974-75 and the trading banks in particular have been in a very liquid position. In June 1975 the <inline font-style="italic">LGS ratio</inline> of the major trading banks was 26.2 per cent compared with 19.2 per cent in June 1974; in seasonally adjusted terms the ratio was 29.5 per cent in June 1975 (see also Chart 3). The trading banks were directed in March not to expand their rates of new lending further and these directives were reiterated in April. The directives were reinforced early in 1975-76 when the SRD ratio increased in two steps to 4.6 per cent and banks prepaid the special drawing facility of last Otcober. In June 1974 usage of overdraft limits was 73 per cent; in June 1975 the ratio had fallen to 65 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With an easier liquidity situation, official and private sector short-term rates fell in the early part of 1975. Most banks reduced their deposit and lending rates but there has been no corresponding easing in rates offered on longer-term official or private sector securities. In fact, in July 1975 yields on longer-term Government securities rose from 9.5 per cent to 10 per cent bringing them more into line with private sector yields. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The funds position of most <inline font-style="italic">non-bank financial institutions</inline> is now relatively easy. The inflow of funds to building societies has recovered strongly in recent months after the setback late last year and societies have steadily expanded their lending. Flows of funds into finance companies have increased but, reflecting a strong liquidity preference by investors, have been mainly short-term in nature. Lending by other financiers remains generally subdued. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the year to June 1975, M3 increased by 15 per cent. The annual figure is weighed down by the negative September quarter movement. After seasonal adjustment, the volume of money (M3) grew at an annual rate of 22 per cent in the December quarter, 27 per cent in the March quarter and 17 per cent in the June quarter of 1974-75. This last figure may be somewhat understated because of technical seasonal adjustment problems associated with the changed timing for company tax payments so that the underlying rate of increase probably remains in excess of 20 per cent. </para>

Chart 6 illustrates related movements in the shares of wages and profits (gross operating surplus) in non-farm product at factor cost. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the wake of a period of excess demand pressure and build-up of inflationary expectations, a number of exceptionally large wage increases occurred in the closing stages of 1973-74. This development intensified in the opening months of 1974-75; not only were claims made for successively higher amounts but awards were re-negotiated more frequently. Both economic and administrative constraints operated to limit the full flow-on of these cost increases into prices. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Unit wage costs</inline>(Chart 5, panel a) rose even more rapidly than male <inline font-style="italic">average weekly earnings</inline> (Chart 4, panel a) throughout calendar 1974, a reflection of the more rapid growth of female award rates and a concurrent fall in productivity. Partly as a consequence <inline font-style="italic">unit profits</inline> (Chart 5, panel b) declined and, with the volume of output also falling, total profits dropped even more sharply. Current data indicate some recovery in both unit and total profits in the second half of 1974-75 leading to a levelling out in the <inline font-style="italic">profit share</inline> (Chart 6) . </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Even though weakening demand, including that for labour, and financial tightness in the first half of 1974-75 constrained the ability and willingness of employers to accede to further wage claims, the rate of growth of earnings remained relatively high. The second half of the year did, however, see something of a lull in the rate of award increases. As well as reflecting labour market conditions this was due to the timing of major award cases. The reduction in personal income tax rates, announced in November 1974 and made, in part, as an explicit element in the wages policy of the time, was also a contributing factor. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1975 National Wage Decision, which introduced a form of conditional wage indexation, represented an important development in the process of wage determination in Australia.

        <para>Pre-Budget Prospects</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pulling together the several strands of economic developments, as canvassed above, the situation as Budget policies were being formulated was, briefly, that: the recovery in some major components of private sector spending was beginning to feed through into activity and rises in employment were in prospect; there had been an apparent steadying in the rate of increase in prices and perhaps some decline in the underlying rate of increase in wages; the external account posed no immediate problems; and some initial steps had been taken to restrain the previously strongly stimulatory rate of monetary expansion. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As to policy objectives, there was an obvious need to ensure that there was a basis for continued recovery but at a pace that would not lead, once again, to the emergence of demand pressures and, more importantly, to the intensification of inflationary expectations. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Against this background, prospects for the Budget were that, on the basis of unchanged tax rates and the expenditure proposals that had been advanced, the projected deficit was of the order of $5,000 million. That was without making any allowances for desired reductions in both personal and company income taxes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The kind of economic situation that would have emerged from accepting a deficit of the magnitude initially projected is one which would be quite outside the range of Australia&#39;s previous experience. The following observations could therefore be significantly wrong in detail, particularly in chronology. None the less, and having some regard to experience elsewhere, the general implications seemed clear enough. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because of lags in the functioning of the economic system, such a Budget would have had little effect on the statistical performance of the economy over the rest of this calendar year. None the less, there would have been a pervasive psychological shock, leading to heightened inflationary expectations, with the most serious long-term consequences for the economy. The present depression of business investment would have become even more pronounced; employers would have stepped up their search for survival by yet further contraction. Before long, the economic recovery would have faltered and moved strongly into reverse. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Private investment would have become even more depressed because there would have been a strong expectation that the rate of inflation, which presently is showing tentative signs of coming under control, would have accelerated. If such an expectation had gained ground it would have tended to become self-fulfilling - in particular, it would almost certainly have up-ended the whole basis of wage indexation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Furthermore, another large lift in the share of activity accounted for by government would have further depressed business and community confidence. Continued growth in the relative size of the government sector can only be at the expense of wage and salary earners (taxpayers) or businesses or both. In the downturn of 1974-75 some increase in the relative size of the government sector was appropriate. With recovery in the private sector beginning, a <inline font-style="italic">further</inline> rapid shift of resources to the public sector would have intensified wage demands and inflation, further squeezed profits, further depressed the propensity to invest in the private sector and increased the probability of business failures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A deficit of the projected magnitude would also have resulted in an excessive increment to liquidity. Initially, this might merely have piled up in idle balances; but even with little secondary credit expansion through the banking system, there would probably have been growth in the volume of money of 30 per cent or more during 1976. For a time, this might well have strengthened the statistical aggregates but any such development would before long have seen rates of price increase significantly faster than currently being experienced. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Such a deficit would have implied an unprecedently large injection of liquidity into an economy which was already picking up, with financial conditions still easy, and when the money supply was already rapidly expanding. It would have laid a monetary foundation for inflation even larger than that which built up in 1972 and 1973 (at that time principally from external sources), and to which many of the subsequent difficulties of 1973 and 1974 can be traced. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The foregoing was thus a prospect of an unusually short-lived recovery. Unlike the former policy paradigm - in which some reduction in unemployment could always be purchased at the cost of some more inflation - it seemed clear that if inflation took off from its present high base it would almost certainly lead before long to even greater unemployment. </para>
        <para>Post-Budget Projections</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given the Budget decisions, what is now the economic outlook for the period ahead? </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The unprecedented concatenation of still very high rates of inflation and very high levels of unemployment makes the economic prospects for 1975-76 extremely difficult to foresee. It would hardly be surprising then, if the broad picture outlined here were to prove, in retrospect, an inaccurate description of 1975-76. As well as the necessity to make assumptions about many factors beyond the control of the Government and which, in the event, will not turn out as assumed, the accuracy of the picture also hinges on two intangible elements having a critical bearing on economic conditions over the next year to eighteen months. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The first of these intangibles is <inline font-style="italic">inflationary expectations.</inline> The underlying rate of inflation is now slightly lower than it was a year ago, to a considerable extent because of the easing in the rate of increase of wages and salaries. The effect this is having on inflationary expectations - a crucial determinant of what happens to future prices - is very uncertain. Measures of these expectations are crude and the forces impinging on their formation are many and varied. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The second, but related, intangible factor is <inline font-style="italic">consumer and business confidence.</inline> Business investment is possibly the most unpredictable component of final demand. There are broad relationships between investment and the actual and expected level of economic activity in relation to capacity, the cost of capital, profitability and liquidity conditions, but at any particular point of time, investment is not tightly related to these tangible factors. Investment decisions are also influenced by the state of mind of decision makers - their overall feelings of confidence, their &#39;enterpreneurial spirits&#39; - which may reflect a variey of other forces. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To a lesser extent similar feelings affect consumers, especially in relation to major discretionary items of expenditure such as large durables. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The outlook presented here is also based on a number of more specific assumptions, any or all of which may turn out differently. The more important assumptions are: o The general stance of monetary policy will remain such that the liquidity of the banking system is sufficient to meet the basic immediate needs of the economy for finance without being fully accommodating to inflationary demands. o Apart from the Budget proposals themselves, there will be no new fiscal measures during 1975-76. o During that period, there will be no significant change in Australia&#39;s external economic policies; meanwhile, the recovery just beginning in the economies of several of our major trading partners will progress at a moderate pace. e Indexation of award wages will continue throughout the period and other award increases will reflect restraint. c Seasonal conditions will be such as to produce about the same growth in aggregate farm production in 1975-76 as in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the basis of the foregoing, <inline font-style="italic">private consumption expenditure</inline> seems set to grow moderately during the rest of 1975 and 1976. Increases might be quite low at first due to the influence of the reversion, from 1 July, to the schedule of PA YE deductions appropriate to the 1974-75 rate scale, the indirect tax measures contained in this Budget and the continued unwinding of the earlier temporary sales tax cut on motor vehicles. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Investment in dwellings</inline>is recovering at present and financial flows imply continuing growth. The recovery rate envisaged is broadly appropriate given continuing concern with the re-emergence of sectoral capacity constraints and their familiar consequences. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Available anticipations and survey data suggest that <inline font-style="italic">non-residential investment,</inline> which is the weakest area of demand, will continue , declining at least until mid-1976. For instance, there are continuing reports of surplus office floor space in Melbourne and Sydney. A subsequent pick-up is in part dependent upon some dampening of inflationary expectations and recovery of confidence and profits in the business sector. If investment does not start to grow again during 1976 overall recovery beyond then would be very unbalanced. Specific capacity constraints might quickly emerge with attendant price pressures and import spill-over. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Reflecting policy decisions taken in this Budget, <inline font-style="italic">expenditure on final goods and services</inline> by all levels cf <inline font-style="italic">government</inline> will be only slightly higher (in real terms) in 1975-76 than in 1974-75. Indeed, this year-on-year comparison reflects growth which has already taken place; no growth <inline font-style="italic">during</inline> 1975-76 is contemplated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Inventories</inline>have been run down at a rapid rate recently. More moderate decumulation is expected to continue until towards the end of 1975, with accumulation resuming in 1976. The present slowing in the rate of decumulation means that inventory investment is already contributing to growth in product. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Prospective developments in the balance of payments depend importantly on the relative speed and strength of the respective recoveries in world economic activity and the domestic economy. <inline font-style="italic">Exports</inline> are forecast to continue growing in 1975-76. Although <inline font-style="italic">imports</inline> in volume terms seem likely to begin to grow again in the near future, this follows a very steep decline so that, for 1975-76 as a whole, their level will probably still be somewhat below that of 1974-75. At this stage, it seems plausible to think in terms of a current account not far from balance with some continued net inflow of private capital. Such a return to relative equilibrium in the external accounts would be influenced by, and contingent upon, the greater stability being forecast both overseas and in the Australian economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With relative equilibrium in external transactions the major influence on basic <inline font-style="italic">liquidity conditions</inline> would come from the Budget deficit. This would provide a sizeable increment but, with bank lending under a degree of restraint, growth in the monetary aggregates should not be fully accommodating to inflation at current rates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the basis of the foregoing influences, <inline font-style="italic">gross non-farm product</inline> is expected to grow by about 5 per cent for 1975-76 as a whole. This would imply stronger growth rates over the course of the year, but compared with other post-war experience does not represent a particularly strong recovery phase. This fact reflects, in particular, the state of private investment and the budgetary cut-back in the rate of growth of government outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Product growth of this order would probably be associated with an increase in <inline font-style="italic">employment</inline> of about 1 per cent in 1975-76 and a sizeable recovery in <inline font-style="italic">productivity.</inline> Given the likely growth in the labour force, the picture for <inline font-style="italic">unemployment</inline> consistent with these developments is one of slow decline from the present high levels. However, the uncertainties involved in the overall picture are such that the possibility of some unevenness in trend cannot be ruled out. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Wage indexation, provided it is honoured in practice, should contribute towards a rationalization of wage claims. Other factors, including inflationary expectations, will also influence wage developments. The extent of any possible amelioration in wage demands as a result of the revisions to personal tax scales proposed in the Budget is also relevant; in this respect it should be noted that the consequent revisions to the PAYE schedules cannot come into effect until January 1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Average weekly earnings</inline>are expected to grow more slowly in 1975-76 than in 1974-75, when the rate of increase was 26 per cent. It would be pretentious to attempt to be too precise, given the unknowns, but an outcome 4-6 percentage points below 1974-75 is not unlikely. An increase in the <inline font-style="italic">Consumer Price Index</inline> somewhat less than in 1974-75, and relatively greater reductions in more broadly based price indexes, would be consistent with this assessment of earnings prospects and the other elements of the overall outlook. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is a possibility, along the lines noted earlier, that if inflationary expectations are being revised downwards the performance of wages and prices will reflect what would now appear an optimistic assessment. In this case the tendency would be for the Budget deficit to be greater in the outcome because tax receipts would probably be reduced by more than expenditures, though it is not possible to quantify this precisely in terms of so much increase in the deficit for each one per cent reduction in the rate of increase in prices. Of course, a greater deficit in those circumstances (i.e. one resulting from a greater than anticipated decline in inflationary pressures) would not carry the same policy implications as it would in other circumstances. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Anticipated productivity gains are likely to contribute to fairly strong growth in <inline font-style="italic">profits</inline> even though overall prices are not expected to increase by as much as wages. The share of total income accounted for by profits, although probably higher than last year, is still likely to fall short of normal, long-term levels. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">This Statement presents detailed estimates of Budget outlays in 1975-76, classified according to their primary function or purpose. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget outlays in 1975-76 are estimated at $21,915 million, an increase of $4,084 million or 22.9 per cent over actual outlays in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimated Budget outlays in 1975-76, under their main functional headings, are shown in the summary table below, together with figures of actual outlays in the preceding two years. </para>

          </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for defence in 1975-76 are estimated at $1,800.1 million, an increase of 10.6 per cent over 1974-75. Estimated outlays for defence in 1975-76 represent 8.2 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays; the corresponding figure in 1974-75 was 9.1 per cent. </para>
        <para>Manpower Costs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision has been made for an increase of S3 1.7 million in manpower costs in 1975-76. The main reasons for the increase are the full-year effects of awards and determinations made in 1974-75 and a rise in the average number of service personnel (excluding Papua New Guineans). These increases will be offset in part by the assumption of financial responsibility by Papua New Guinea for its indigenous service personnel, some reduction in strengths of civilian staffs, and lower Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits payments which in 1974-75 contained a non-recurring refund of contributions amounting to S6.8 million. Manpower costs are estimated to account for 55 per cent of total defence outlays in 1975-76, compared with 59 per cent of actual defence outlays in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>Defence Equipment and Stores</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, etc.) is adequate to meet likely contingencies. Outlays on such equipment in 1975-76 are estimated at $168.5 million, an increase of $81.7 million, and relate mainly to projects already committed, including Oberon Submarines, Light Destroyers, an Oceanographic Ship and ten Sea King Helicopters for the Navy, Light Observation Helicopters, Fire Support Vehicles and Tanks for the Army and eight Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft for the RAAF. Provision has been made also for initial payments on new major equipment projects and for other equipment, details of which will be announced by the Minister. Expenditure on supporting equipment in 1975-76 is estimated at $145.9 million, an increase of $15.7 million over 1974-75. Outlays on repairs and maintenance are expected to increase by $9.1 million. </para>
        <para>Defence Facilities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading is to provide and maintain capital facilities including adequate living and working accommodation for personnel. Advances to the States for the provision of housing for servicemen and their families are estimated to total $40 million, $13.2 million more than the amount spent in 1974-75. Other significant buildings and works items include the continuation of construction of the Naval Support Facility at Cockburn Sound (W.A.) and the upgrading of facilities at HMAS Nirimba (N.S.W.), RAAF Regents Park (N.S.W.), RAAF Amberley (Qld), the Royal Australian Transport Corps Centre, Puckapunyal (Vic), Williamstown Dockyard (Vic.) and Canungra Ground Warfare Training Centre (Qld). Expenditure on these and other projects is expected to total $77.6 million in 1975-76, $16.2 million more than in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>Industrial Capacity</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main reasons for the expected decrease of $0.4 million for this purpose are reduced working capital and production assistance requirements for the NOMAD aircraft project, largely offset by the higher cost of maintaining reserve production capacity, due to wage increases in Government defence factories. </para>
        <para>Defence Science and Technology Establishments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on defence science and technology is aimed at assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in military technology and at developing weapons systems suitable for Australia&#39;s defence needs. The estimated increase of $5.1 million to $84.7 million reflects mainly wage and other cost increases. </para>
        <para class="block">Defence Co-operation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Through defence co-operation the Government aims to help friendly countries in the region of immediate interest to Australia to strengthen their own and the region&#39;s capacity for defence. Estimated expenditure of $39.2 million in 1975-76 includes $11.3 million for continuing assistance to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, at levels similar to those in past years. Military training and advisory assistance to some other countries, including Thailand and Fiji, will continue, to be provided on a small scale. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">New budgetary arrangements for providing financial assistance to Papua New Guinea for defence were introduced from 6 March 1975. An amount of $27.8 million is being provided for 1975-76 compared with $77.8 million last year. The decrease in defence aid to Papua New Guinea in 1975-76 reflects the substantial special assistance of $70 million given to that country in 1974-75 ($4 million in 1975-76) to facilitate the &#39;purchase&#39; of defence assets. (Proceeds from the &#39;sale&#39; of these assets to Papua New Guinea in 1974-75 and 1975-76 are shown under &#39;Recoveries and Repayments&#39; in the table.) </para>
        <para>Storage and Transport Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this category are removal and storage costs associated with the transfer of government employees in the defence sector and servicemen. In the past the totality of expenditure on storage and transport services was shown as a defence outlay but, with the transfer of responsibility for such services from the Department of Manufacturing Industry to the Department of Services and Property, only that expenditure attributable to the defence function is included in defence outlays. All other expenditure on this activity is now included in outlays on &#39;Common Services&#39; within the function &#39;General Public Services&#39;. Adjustments in respect of these changes have been made to data for earlier years to maintain comparability with the 1975-76 estimates. </para>
        <para>General Administrative Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This broad category of expenditure covers a wide range of items including travel, office requisites, postage and telephone services, light, power and water supplies, freight and cartage, compensation payments, and medical and dental services provided by civilian authorities. </para>
        <para>Natural Disasters, Civil Defence and Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this category are outlays on natural disasters, civil defence, war graves and various miscellaneous items. The estimated 47 per cent increase in expenditure in 1975-76 is primarily due to increased support of State Emergency Services. </para>
        <para>Overseas Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in the estimated outlay of $1,800.1 million for defence in 1975-76 is provision for expenditure overseas amounting to $212.8 million, or $75.7 million more than in 1974-75. This estimate of expenditure overseas includes provision for payments in respect of Orion and other aircraft, tanks and submarines, and on maintenance of defence forces overseas; it does not include defence expenditure in Papua New Guinea or any overseas component of the remaining $11.4 million planned to be expended on defence co-operation for overseas countries. </para>

          </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">Consistent with the high priority accorded to education by the Government, there has been an extremely rapid increase in education outlays in recent years. In 1975-76 the emphasis is on the consolidation of the various improvements so far achieved, rather than on new initiatives. Total outlays on education are estimated to increase by 14.2 per cent in 1975-76 to $1,908.2 million, equivalent to 8.7 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays. </para>
        <para>Tertiary and Technical Education</para>
        <para>Universities, Colleges of Advanced Education and -Teachers Colleges</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In May 1975, the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education presented reports recommending programs of financial assistance for the 1976-78 triennium totalling $3,463 million compared with $2,509 million for the current 1973-75 triennium (both figures at December 1974 prices). For the reasons set out in the Budget Speech the Government has decided on an alternative program for tertiary education in the 1976 academic year which aims to consolidate improvements already achieved. This approach will involve some slowing of new capital expenditure in 1976; it also involves having the new triennium begin in 1977. Total expenditure on university education is estimated at $569.8 million in 1975-76, an increase of $17.6 million, while expenditure on colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges is estimated to increase by $11.8 million to $405.0 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimated outlays in 1975-76 therefore reflect the provision of funds for programs approved for the current 1973-75 triennium (as appropriated under the <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Universities) Act</inline> 1972-75 and the <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Advanced Education) Act</inline> 1972-75) and for the further programs of financial assistance which have been approved by the Government in the light of their consideration of the recommendations of the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education. Grants to universities of $510.0 million and to the colleges of $364.0 million have been approved for 1975-76. The corresponding figures in 1974-75 were, respectively, $502.1 million and $360.7 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These estimates for 1975-76 also reflect the full-year cost (approximately $55 million) of the increased academic salaries accepted by the Australian Government on the recommendation of the Academic Salaries Tribunal which took effect from October 1974. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Prior to January 1974 grants were provided to the States for universities, colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges, and pre-school teachers colleges on a matching basis. When the Australian Government assumed full financial responsibility for universities and colleges the States agreed that appropriate offsets, to take account of payments that they would no longer have to make to these tertiary institutions, would be made in the general purpose funds provided by the Australian Government to the States. (Details of these offsets are provided in Chapters II and III of </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In January  1974  the Government introduced the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, thereby supplementing the decisions to assume full financial responsibility for tertiary education and to abolish tuition fees. This Scheme provides noncompetitive means-tested allowances to full-time non-bonded Australian students admitted to approved courses in tertiary and approved post-secondary institutions. From January  1975  living allowances under the Scheme were increased and the means test relaxed to allow for movements in salaries and wages. From November  1975  the allowances for a dependent wife and for each dependent child will be increased. The maximum benefit available under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is  $31  per week and approximately  62,800  university&#39; and college students are receiving some benefits from the Scheme. The cost of the Scheme for university and college students is estimated at  $76.5  million in  1975-76,  an increase of  $14.4  million over  1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in allowances payable under the Postgraduate Awards Scheme and the Pre-School Teacher Education Allowances Scheme were effective from January  1975.  Under the Postgraduate Awards Scheme an allowance of  $3,250  per year is paid to post-graduate students (with additional allowances for married students) and outlays under the scheme are estimated at  $8.0  million in  1975-76.  Outlays for the Pre-School Teacher Education Allowances Scheme are estimated at  $3.6  million; the maximum allowance under the scheme is  $31  per week. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From  1974  the Government has undertaken to supplement the approved programs of financial assistance to universities and colleges to allow for wage, salary and other cost increases (other than academic salary increases, which are provided for by separate supplementation) above the level provided for when the original triennial programs were determined. An allowance for retrospective cost increases has been incorporated in the grants for these institutions for  1975-76  and allowance for expected further adjustments during  1975-76  has been incorporated within a total allowance of  $70  million for prospective cost increases for universities, colleges and schools. </para>
        <para>Technical and Further Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Australian Government expenditure on technical and further education is estimated to total  $101.3  million in  1975-76,  compared with  $70.6  million in  1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Financial assistance by the Australian Government for technical and further education in  1975-76  is being provided under a program developed by the Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education for the biennium July  1974  to June  1976.  A program of  $100  million was approved for the two years, comprising  S96.5  million for allocation to the States to enhance the quality and extend the availability of technical and further education, on the understanding that the States would not reduce the level of their own activities in this area, and  $3.5  million in the Australian Capital Territory for a capital development program. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In May  1975,  the Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education submitted its Second Report on &#39;Needs in Technical and Further Education&#39;; this Report covered the <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> year period  1  July  1976  to  31  December  1978.  For the reasons set out in the Budget Speech the Government has been unable to accept the recommended level of expenditure of  $494  million at this time. Consistent with its decisions on expenditure on other levels of tertiary education in  1975-76  the Australian Government is concentrating on the consolidation of its activities in this area in the  1976  academic year. The major implications of this will be a slowing of new capital expenditure in that year and the postponement of the commencement of the first full triennium to 1977. Estimated grants for technical and further education in 1975-76 are S81 .8 million, compared with $55.0 million in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Students attending technical colleges are eligible for similar assistance to university and college students under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. The Budget provides $18.8 million in 1975-76 for these benefits, an increase of $3.4 million; about 14,200 students are expected to receive benefits. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In general, until September 1973 a prerequisite for a veteran or his dependants to be eligible for a war pension (and in certain circumstances associated benefits, including medical treatment), was that the veteran must have had service in the 1914-18 War, the 1939-45 War, or certain subsequent operations of a warlike nature and have suffered incapacity or death related to that service. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From 7 December 1972 eligibility for most repatriation benefits was extended to: o Members of the Defence Force who have completed 3 years effective full-time service on or after 7 December 1972; o Persons engaged or appointed to the Defence Force for a period of full-time service of not less than 3 years but who, on or after 7 December 1972, died or were discharged on medical grounds for reasons attributable to their defence service before the completion of 3 years service, unless their discharge occurred before the completion of 12 months effective service and resulted from a preexisting condition which was not aggravated by service; and o National Servicemen serving immediately before 7 December 1972 who complete the period of service for which they were engaged to serve or who die or are discharged on medical grounds as a result of their service prior to the completion of that period of service. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Basic eligibility varies according to the nature of service. Broadly, for those with &#39;active service&#39;, incapacity or death resulting from &#39;any occurrence&#39; during service may be accepted. For those with &#39;home service&#39;, however, the criterion is narrower, in that incapacity or death must have arisen out of, or be attributable to, that service; incapacity or death arising from a condition existing prior to enlistment may be accepted if aggravated or contributed to by the conditions of service. </para>
        <para>Classes of War Pensions</para>
        <para>Pensions are paid to eligible veterans in three main categories: o The Special Rate (known as the T &#38; PI) Pension, payable to a veteran who, as a result of service, is blinded, or is totally and permanently incapacitated so that he is unable to earn more than a neglible percentage of a living wage; o The Intermediate Rate, payable to a veteran who, because of the severity of his incapacity accepted as related to service, can work only part-time or intermittently, and in consequence is unable to earn a living wage; and o The General Rate, payable to a veteran who has an incapacity accepted as related to service, but who is yet able to work full-time, although under difficulties. The amounts payable range from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of the maximum general rate, according to the assessed degree of incapacity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pensions are also paid to the wives of incapacitated veterans and to their children. Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular veteran&#39;s incapacity. When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow&#39;s rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at &#39;orphan&#39; rates and other benefits. If a veteran&#39;s death has not been accepted as related to service, but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at one of the special rates or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service. Other dependants of deceased veterans may qualify for pensions in certain cases. </para>
        <para>Allowances</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Various allowances are provided to supplement war pensions. These allowances vary according to the type or severity of disablement and the special needs of the pensioners. </para>

The effect on expenditure of this estimated decline in numbers is more than offset by the full-year effects of increased rates of benefits introduced in 1974-75 and the increases in benefit rates announced in the Budget Speech. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The proposed changes in war pensions are estimated to cost $10.0 million in 1975-76 and $20.2 million in a full year. </para>

Like age pensions, service pensions will be increased in the Spring and Autumn in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides an amount of $84.0 million in 1975-76 for the development of various growth centres, including Albury/Wodonga, the Sydney South-West Sector and Bathurst/Orange. The assistance to be provided in 1975-76 carries forward in a significant way initiatives designed over the longer term to improve the distribution of employment opportunities and the population. The growth centres program aims to raise the level of urban life by encouraging the development of a small number of regional growth centres to provide viable alternatives to the existing metropolitan centres. From the overall allocation, $38.6 million is expected to be provided for Albury/Wodonga. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $4.6 million is being allocated for a project on land owned by the Australian Government at Holsworthy.

        <para>Urban Flood Mitigation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government agreed during 1974-75 to provide assistance to Victoria for flood mitigation works at Seymour. The lack of legislative authority prevented disbursement of the funds in 1974-75 and it is now envisaged that the full amount of $200,000 will be paid to the State in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An agreement was concluded with Queensland in 1974-75 under the <inline font-style="italic">Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act</inline> 1974-75 to provide up to $450,000 for certain flood mitigation works on various creeks in the Brisbane metropolitan area. The full amount was paid to the State early in 1975-76. A further amount of $2.2 million is provided in the Budget for this purpose in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>Area Improvement Programs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $17.7 million is included in the Budget for Area Improvement Programs. These programs were introduced originally in the western regions of Sydney and Melbourne and later extended to other regions in various States. The programs are intended to remedy deficiencies arising from a number of causes in the provision of public facilities in specific locations. The assistance will finance planning activities and projects such as municipal drainage schemes, improvements to waterways, management and provision of solid waste disposal systems, environmental protection, acquisition of parklands and open space, landscape design and construction, and public education activities on urban issues. Outlays in 1974-75 for these programs totalled $13.8 million. </para>
        <para>Land Agreements</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $64.6 million has been provided for the land agreements program. This involves provision of financial assistance to the States for land acquisition, servicing of land acquired (where these costs are not met from normal Government subventions) and urban renewal and development. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main aims of the program are to make land available for residential and associated uses at fair prices, and to facilitate the efficient planning and development of new urban areas. The assistance, chiefly in the form of loans, is conditional upon the establishment of Land Commissions or their equivalents to control or co-ordinate the acquisition and development of urban land. Land Commissions or their equivalents are now operating in five States and an agreement , with Queensland is imminent. </para>
        <para>Other Urban Development and Amenities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditures on land acquisitions and development in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern&#39; Territory are the major items included under this heading, with $37.4 million allocated for the Australian Capital Territory and $17.8 million for the Northern Territory.

Outlays on these services in 1975-76 are estimated at SI 64.9 million, an increase of $17.2 million on 1974-75. In addition to rises in wages and salaries and other operating costs, the increase reflects continued expenditure on colour television conversion and upgrading of radio and television services generally. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision is made in the estimated expenditure for the introduction of the first stage of FM radio, the continuation of the experimental &#39;rock&#39; station in Sydney (2JJ), and the Melbourne access station (3ZZ).

        <para>Communication</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Vernon Commission of Inquiry into the Post Office recommended that the Post Office be replaced by two Commissions - the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. Since 1 July 1975 postal and telecommunications services previously undertaken by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department have been provided by these two statutory authorities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Both Commissions are to operate on a commercial basis and have the financial objective of generating, by way of charges for services, such amounts as are necessary to meet all operating costs plus at least 50 per cent of total capital expenditure. The remainder is to be financed through interest bearing advances from the Budget. These advances in 1975-76 are estimated at $14 million for the Australian Postal Commission and $403 million for the Australian Telecommunications Commission. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The responsibilities provided for in the Wireless Telegraphy Act will continue to be exercised by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department.

        <para>Air Transport</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Advances by the Australian Government to Qantas Airways Ltd and the Australian National Airlines Commission mainly represent the passing on of proceeds of loans raised by the Government on behalf of the airlines to assist in the financing of aircraft. Amounts repaid by the airlines in respect of past loans are in turn repaid to the lenders. The proposed advances to Qantas of $26 million in 1975-76 are to assist in purchasing two B747 aircraft. Advances can also include new capital provided to the airlines from time to time, but no such provisions are to be made in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Department of Transport provides many services to the air transport industry, including the provision and operation of over 100 airports and associated navigational facilities. These activities account for the major portion of administrative and operational expenditure and outlays on buildings, works and equipment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in the expenditure estimates for 1975-76 are $2.7 million to complete work on the Brisbane International Terminal and the Hobart domestic terminal, $1.7 million for further work on the Sydney International Terminal and $6.0 million for further payments on three new F28 aircraft for testing of air navigation facilities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For many years the Australian Government has paid air services subsidies for &#39;essential&#39; rural services to country areas and &#39;developmental&#39; services in outback areas. Subsidies for &#39;essential&#39; rural services ceased on 30 June 1974 and &#39;developmental&#39; services subsidies are to be phased out by 30 June 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the 1973-74 Budget, the Government announced its intention to increase the rate of recovery of costs of providing airport and airways facilities to 80 per cent by 1977-78. At the time, charges to users of these facilities were recovering only about 50 p:r cent of costs. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Despite increases in air navigation charges of 15 per cent in 1973-74 and 1974-75 and tight restraint on costs, very little progress has been made towards achieving the Government&#39;s objective. At the present level of charges only about 55 per cent of costs are being recovered. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government proposes to pursue its objective of 80 per cent recovery by 1977-78. To this end, action will be taken to raise the cost recovery level in 1975-76 to 70 per cent, which was the anticipated level of recovery for this year at the time the 80 per cent objective was set. This will require an increase in air navigation charges substantially greater than the maximum 15 per cent annual increase referred to in the 1973 Airlines Agreement. However, the Agreement provided for a review of progress towards the 80 per cent cost recovery objective to be completed by September 1975 and requires the Government and the two major domestic airlines to negotiate such changes to the Agreement as are necessary to ensure attainment of the objective. </para>

The assistance, which is payable in respect of the construction of vessels in Australia following a case-by-case examination by the Australian Shipbuilding Board, is estimated at $30.0 million under both schemes in 1975-76. This will subsidise the construction of about 77 vessels, 52 of which have already been ordered or are being constructed, while the remainder are expected to be ordered in 1975-76.

        <para>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Export Payments Insurance Corporation was wound up on 1 February 1975 when the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) came into operation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In addition to the insurance and guarantee services previously provided by the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, the new export finance division of EFIC facilitates the provision of export finance for medium- and long-term credit sales of machinery and capital equipment, and the establishment of lines of credit, especially to developing countries and state trading organisations. In peforming these functions, EFIC supplements the medium- and long-term export financing facilities provided by the trading banks. . The Corporation has authority, where appropriate, to match, but not lead the financing arrangements provided by overseas government-supported export finance institutions, but EFIC may only finance a particular transaction when, in its opinion, this is desirable and the finance would otherwise not be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. Typically EFIC has supported Australian capital goods exporters in their overseas tenders by blending its funds, provided at concessional interest rates, with funds provided by the trading banks at normal commercial rates of interest. The mix of funds is apportioned so that the blended interest rate approximately matches the rates offered by foreign competitors. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Funds for EFIC&#39;s export financing operations are made available from the Budget on terms determined by the Treasurer which enable the Corporation, where appropriate, to match overseas competition. $2.0 million was advanced to EFIC in 1974-75 for this purpose and a further $2.0 million will be appropriated in 1975-76. Interest payable to the Government on these funds is 7i per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In capital goods transactions of the type financed by EFIC, considerable time elapses between the Corporation agreeing to provide concessional finance in respect of a tender and, in the event it is successful, EFIC being called upon to advance funds to finance the export. Because of these time lags the Government has determined special budgetary arrangements for EFIC under which it will set each year a maximum &#39;commitment authority&#39; which accumulates over the years (a commitment being defined as a firm legal agreement to provide funds). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The commitment authority for 1974-75 was $5.0 million and the new commitment authority for 1975-76 is $12.5 million, making a cumulative total commitment authority of $17.5 million. With participation of the Australian trading banks on a 50:50 basis, EFIC would be in a position to assist in supporting business of double this amount. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The provision of funds from the Budget to EFIC at a concessional rate of interest involves a subsidy to the extent that the concessional rate is below the comparable cost of such funds to the Government. The subsidy on the $2.0 million advanced in 1974-75 is therefore the difference between the long-term bond rate, which was at the time 9i per cent, and the rate at which funds were advanced to EPIC, i.e. <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent. On the basis of these rates the cost of the subsidy for 1975-76 is estimated at $70,000. </para>

        <para>Industry Assistance Through the Taxation System </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As mentioned earlier in this Statement, a considerable amount of assistance to industry has been provided in the past through special taxation concessions. Some of these concessions were withdrawn during 1972-73 while others were withdrawn or modified in 1973-74 and 1974-75. On the other hand, a new <inline font-style="italic">short-run</inline> concession was introduced in 1974-75  -  double depreciation on new plant used in manufacturing and primary production. As indicated in the Budget Speech, this concession is now to be continued beyond 30 June 1975 and extended in its coverage. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Such concessions result in a reduction of, or a delay in the receipt of, Australian Government revenues (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients). They are, in fact, as much a call on the Budget as equivalent direct outlays would be, and for this reason have sometimes been described as disguised expenditures. Assistance of this type through the taxation system has been provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their assessable income additional to those authorised under the general provisions of the income tax law. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1974-75 through the main taxation concessions is estimated to have been about $244 million. Details are shown below. (Pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme in respect of exports in 1970-71 and prior years are included under the heading &#39;Manufacturing Industry&#39;.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A those allowing the deduction of larger amounts than are authorised under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which, until it was withdrawn, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1974, gave a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deductions from income for this expenditure) ; </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">B those allowing certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and </para>
        <para>C those exempting certain classes of income. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main provisions in each of these classes and the estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1974-75 are shown in the following table. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly &#39;Industry Assistance&#39;. These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; drought bonds; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees&#39; amenities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. Taxpayers to whom these provisions apply are assessed on their taxable incomes for the current year at rates of tax corresponding to the average of their incomes for the current year and the preceding four years. One effect of the provisions, which is an intended effect, is to ensure that <inline font-style="italic">fluctuations</inline> in income in conjunction with progression </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">In rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but nonfluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward trend in incomes over a number of years and, even if there are fluctuations in income superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions can result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over a period of years are comparable. </para>

The scheme would apply to those classes of new plant and equipment which would have attracted eligibility for the income tax investment allowances had these still been in operation. Plant and equipment that attracted these allowances by reason of its coming under a contract signed before 22 August 1973 would not be eligible also for accelerated depreciation. </para>

            <para>This estimate is based on the deductions allowable in the 1973-74 income year in respect of purchases and appropriations in that year (net of amounts included in the 1973-74 assessable income in respect of appropriations made in the previous year) <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> the depreciation that would have been allowable in that year on the relevant plant purchases or the plant in respect of which the appropriations were made. While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. (/) This estimate is based mainly on the exemption of income under section 23 (o) - gold mining, and section 23a  -  one-fifth exemption of income from the mining of prescribed metals and minerals. Dividends declared after 21 August 1973 out of exempt profits of gold mining, mining of prescribed metals or minerals, the sale of mining rights and profits from the sale of locally produced petroleum are liable to tax in the shareholders&#39; hands. The one-fifth exemption of income from mining prescribed metals and minerals under section 23a has been withdrawn as from the commencement of the 1974-75 income year. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">NAAS, which provides incentives to employers by way of subsidies for first-year apprentice wages and for off-the-job training, accounts for the major expenditure on apprenticeship training. The outlay is estimated to increase from $16.6 million in 1974-75 to $31.3 million in 1975-76. The increase of $14.8 million reflects the fullyear cost of increased employer subsidy rates introduced from 1 January 1975 and subsequently increased further following the April 1975 National Wage Decision. The average wage subsidy paid to employers of first-year apprentices is $1,300 a year. The off-the-job training subsidy for each apprentice is $20 a week. Allowances available to first- and second-year apprentices living away from home under NAAS are to be terminated in 1975-76, this is estimated to yield a saving of $2.7 million. $6 million has been provided for the continuing wage costs of apprentices, surplus to normal requirements, undergoing training in Australian and State Government establishments.

The expected decrease is due mainly to a decline in wheat prices compared with the level of prices over 1974-75, and the completion of some programs such as contributions to the Indus Basin Development Fund. A total of $59.1 million has been provided for expenditure on bilateral aid projects, technical co-operation and related activities in 1975-76.

        <para pgwide="yes">The bulk of the estimated payments by Australia to international development finance institutions in 1975-76 represents calls on Australia in accordance with previously announced commitments to those institutions.

Australia recently took up a special increase in its capital subscription to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The paid-in portion of this increased subscription ($277,000) was paid in cash in 1974-75 and a promissory note was issued for the balance ($2,489,000). This note will be encashed in eight equal six-monthly instalments, and two further encashments under this schedule account for the provision in 1975-76. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The provision of Defence Co-operation ($39.2 million in 1975-76) represents an extension of Australia&#39;s own defence effort but it also supplements the Government&#39;s external economic aid programs in furthering the broad foreign policy objectives of helping developing countries in the Asia/ Pacific area to raise their standards of living. It serves this objective by releasing resources that the recipient Governments themselves might otherwise have devoted to defence purposes for development purposes.

Expenditures of some other departments can be regarded as a form of development assistance although they are not included in the above estimates of aid payments. Expenditure incurred by the Department of Transport in assisting Fiji upgrade facilities at Nadi International Airport would come into this category as would expenditure incurred by the Department of Overseas Trade in financing Australian consultancy services in developing countries, and in encouraging a greater flow of private direct investment in developing countries by Australian companies. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Included under this heading are the costs involved in administering these three small external territories. An increased amount has been provided for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1975-76, reflecting in part the appointment in July 1975 of an official Administrator for the Islands. An allocation of $265,000 has been made in the Budget for a continuing program for restoration of historic buildings on Norfolk Island. Provision of $179,300 has been included in the estimates to meet the cost in 1975-76 of a Royal Commission set up by the Government to inquire into matters relating to Norfolk Island. </para>

Total expenditure under this heading is expected to increase from $13.4 million in 1974-75 to $15.1 million in 1975-76.

        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this item are the administrative costs of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Australian Development Assistance Agency and the Overseas Property Bureau. The increase in 1975-76 is explained in part by the continuation of the large overseas construction program, which commenced last financial year. It reflects also the provision for a full-year effect of cost increases during 1974-75 associated with the establishment of the Australian Development Assistance Agency&#39;s State office organisation, wage and salary increases and the September 1974 devaluation of the Australian dollar and subsequent currency variations. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated net increase of $0.4 million in outlays on construction services is due mainly to increases in salaries for the Department of Housing and Construction (&#39;non-housing&#39; function), and to higher outlays on construction and maintenance of workshops and depots and purchase of furniture and fittings. </para>
        <para>Australian Government Offices</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This item reflects the costs of constructing, purchasing and maintaining Australian Government offices, including land for new offices. The exceptionally high expenditure in 1974-75 ($45.3 million) reflected an extensive acquisitions program which included building sites in Sydney and Adelaide ($10.0 million) and a new office block in Brisbane ($2.5 million). Outlays in 1975-76 include $1.0 million towards the cost of a new Australian Government office complex at Parramatta which has an estimated total cost of $47.0 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays under this heading comprise general revenue assistance for the States, State Government Loan Council programs, assistance related to State debt, certain forms of financial assistance for local government and natural disaster relief. Details of these payments are presented below; additional information on these and other payments to the States classified under various functional headings is contained in the Budget Paper <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities, 1975-76.</inline></para>
        <para>General Revenue Assistance</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">General revenue assistance is utilised for purposes determined by the States themselves. The financial assistance grants, which make up most of this assistance, are determined under a formula by which the grant to each State each year is equal to the grant paid in the previous year escalated by the percentage increase in the State&#39;s population and in average wages in the whole economy and by a further &#39;betterment&#39; factor. Between 1971-72 and 1974-75 the &#39;betterment&#39; factor was 1.8 per cent. Following re-negotiation of the financial assistance arrangements at the June 1975 Premiers&#39; Conference, this &#39;betterment&#39; factor is to be increased to 3.0 per cent for purposes of calculating the grants in 1976-77 and subsequent years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It was also agreed during the re-negotiation of the arrangements that the grants for 1975-76 would reflect a permanent addition of S220 million to the base grants. The grants for 1975-76 and subsequent years will also reflect adjustments associated with transfers of railways in South Australia and Tasmania to the Australian Government and the withdrawal of the former State from the Grants Commission system. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Special grants are paid on the recommendation of the Grants Commission, an exception to that being grants totalling SI 6.4 million made in 1974-75 to South Australia in connection with its withdrawal from the special grants system at the end of that year. Queensland and Tasmania are at present applicant States under the Grants Commission system but no payments to the latter State are provided for in the 1975-76 Budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Repayments under the- general revenue assistance heading relate to special repayable and interest bearing advances made to Victoria in 1969-70 and New South Wales in 1971-72 and 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In total, general revenue assistance (net) in 1975-76 is estimated at $3,216.9 million, an increase of $728.4 million, or 29.3 per cent, compared with 1974-75. </para>
        <para>State Government Loan Council Programs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At its June 1975 meeting the Loan Council approved a total State Government program of $1,291.0 million for 1975-76 made up of a basic program of $1,281.0 million and a special permanent addition of $10.0 million for New South Wales in recognition of the State&#39;s relatively low per head share of Loan Council programs compared with other States&#34;. Of the total program of $1,291.0 million, $860.7 million will be represented by borrowings and $430.3 million by capital grants provided by the Australian Government. . </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The programs agreed to for both South Australia and Tasmania were $6.0 million lower than they would otherwise have been to take account of savings to the States&#39; capital works programs brought about by the transfer of Tasmania&#39;s railway system to the Australian Government on 1 July 1975 and the proposed transfer of the South Australian non-metropolitan railways. The Loan Council agreed that if the South Australian transfer was not effected, both the total program and South Australia&#39;s share of it would be increased by $6.0 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The basic State Government program for 1975-76 of $1,281.0 million represents an effective increase (that is, adjusted for the effects of the railway &#39;offsets&#39; referred to above) of 20 per cent over the 1974-75 basic program. When account is taken of the special permanent addition of $10.0 million for New South Wales, the increase in the total 1975-76 program over the 1974-75 basic program becomes 20.9 per cent. </para>
        <para>Assistance Related to State Debts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the Financial Agreement the Australian Government pays $15 million each year to the States as a contribution towards interest payable on their debt and also contributes sinking fund payments. The sinking fund payments in 1975-76 are estimated to total $30.2 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Debt charges assistance grants have been made in accordance with an undertaking by the Australian Government to meet the debt charges on $200 million of State debt in 1970-71 and a further $200 million each year from 1971-72 to 1974-75. Grants totalling $57.5 million were made for this purpose in 1974-75, the last year of the arrangements. The formal transfer of the $1,000 million debt from the States to the Australian Government will be effected retrospective to 30 June 1975 when proposed amendments to the Financial Agreement have been ratified. </para>
        <para>Assistance for Local Government</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides for the payment of $79.9 million to the States in 1975-76, to be passed on to local government authorities for the purpose of reducing financial inequalities between such authorities. This assistance is based on recommendations of the Grants Commission and represents a continuation of the program of assistance for local government commenced in 1974-75 with the provision of $56.3 million. The assistance is provided to local government authorities without conditions as to the purposes for which it may be used. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In addition, the Budget provides an amount of $0.3 million in 1975-76 to assist the establishment and maintenance of regional organisations of local government authorities which make applications for assistance to the Grants Commission.

The various proposals announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to increase receipts in 1975-76 by about $207 million. Overall, total receipts are estimated to amount to $19,117 million, an increase of 25.2 per cent on actual receipts in 1974-75.

        <para>Customs Duty - Coal Exports</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As announced in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided to impose export duties of $6 per tonne on high quality coal and $2 per tonne on lower quality coal. Receipts from this duty are estimated at $120 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>Excise Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The recovery in consumer demand in prospect in 1975-76 is expected to lead to somewhat larger increases in clearances of goods subject to excise duty than those recorded in 1974-75. At <inline font-style="italic">existing</inline> rates of duty total collections are estimated to increase by 5.0 per cent in 1975-76, to $1,815 million. After allowance for the effects of the measures announced in the Budget Speech, including the new duty of $2 per barrel on the production of naturally occurring petroleum liquids including crude oil and naturally occurring liquified petroleum gas (LPG), excise duty collections in 1975-76 are estimated to increase by 39 per cent to $2,408.4 million.

Both increases reflect, in varying degrees, the temporary reductions in rates of sales tax on motor vehicles which were introduced on 29 January and are due to &#39;be phased out by 1 September 1975. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Underlying this estimate are assumptions that average weekly earnings per employed male unit will increase by 22 per cent, and average employment in male units by 2 per cent, during 1975-76. In present circumstances, this average earnings assumption is very uncertain. There are some, though as yet tentative, indications that it may be on the high side. To the extent that the assumption should prove to be an over-estimate then inflation, and the effect of inflation on the Budget, will be that much less. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Refunds of pay-as-you-earn tax instalment deductions in 1975-76 are estimated to increase by 20.9 per cent to $1,025 million. Concessional deductions to be allowed on assessment are thought to have increased at a lower rate than incomes in 1974-75 and this will act to depress refunds in 1975-76. On the other hand, refunds are expected to increase as a result of a net over-deduction by employers in 1974-75 (when three different instalment schedules operated) and because of deductions under the scheme of housing loan interest deductibility introduced last year. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">There was an overall deficit of $2,567 million in 1974-75, compared with the deficit of $570 million estimated at the time the Budget was brought down. Outlays totalled $17,831 million, $1,719 million more than the Budget estimate; receipts, at $15,264 million, were $277 million less than estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Post-budget decisions by the Government to assist particular sectors of the economy and help counter rising unemployment contributed most to the large increase over budgeted outlays. On the receipts side, too, measures taken during the year to stimulate the economy and improve employment opportunities had an impact on the outcome. Reductions in the rates of personal and company income tax in November 1974 resulted in total tax collections being lower than the Budget estimate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Many categories of outlays were affected by increases in wages and prices during 1974-75. The Budget estimates included an allowance of $150 million for the effects of increased rates of pay during 1974-75 on direct wage and salary payments by the Australian Government. In the event increased rates of pay added a little more than that to direct wage and salary payments in 1974-75; the additional payments involved have been allocated to the respective functional headings in the following table. Larger than assumed wage and salary increases raised expenditure on a number of other items, including the advance to the Post Office, recurrent grants to tertiary institutions and financial assistance grants to the States. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Defence outlays in 1974-75 were $141 million greater than the Budget estimate. Manpower costs exceeded the Budget estimate by $91 million, reflecting increases in rates of pay and higher than estimated payments from the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Fund. The latter outcome was mainly the result of more retiring servicemen opting for lump sum payments than had been assumed, and of a postbudget increase in rates of pensions. The purchase of the Leyland complex at Zetland added $19.6 million to outlays for the acquisition of sites for defence purposes. Advances to the States for the provision of housing for servicemen exceeded the Budget estimate by $11 million; additional funds were provided to the States to meet increasing costs and better than estimated progress on construction, the latter resulting from readier availability of land, labour and materials. </para>
        <para>Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays on education exceeded the 1974-75 Budget estimate by $138 million. Recurrent payments to universities and colleges of advanced education were $97 million greater than the Budget estimate. Increases in academic salaries contributed $47 million towards this increase over the Budget estimate. Capital grants for colleges of advanced education totalled $33 million more than the Budget estimate; this was partly because of rising costs and partly because of a faster than expected rate of construction of new colleges. For similar reasons, capital grants to the States for Government schools were $37 million more than the Budget estimate. On the other hand, outlays for pre-schools and child-care centres in the States were $30 million less than the Budget provision because of difficulties encountered in implementing the first year of the expanded program of assistance. </para>
        <para>Health</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for health in 1974-75 were $53 million more than estimated in the Budget. Medical benefits exceeded the Budget estimate by $10 million, reflecting an increase in the rate of benefit payable from February 1975 and greater utilisation of medical services than originally estimated. Outlays on hospital services for ex-servicemen and women were $10 million more than the Budget estimate, with increases in wage and salary costs at repatriation institutions being the major contributing factor. An increase from October 1974 in the rate of benefit payable for pensioners was largely responsible for nursing home benefits being $15 million more than estimated. Payments for pharmaceutical benefits were $13 million more than the Budget estimate; dispensing fees were increased during the year, the volume of scripts processed was higher than assumed at Budget time and arrangements were introduced in New South Wales which involve part-payment of pharmacists&#39; claims in advance of complete processing. There was a shortfall of $7 million in outlays on community health facilities because of delays in implementation of some projects. </para>
        <para>Social Security and Welfare</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for social security and welfare exceeded the Budget estimate by $241 million. The 1974-75 Budget estimate included an allowance of $70 million for pension and benefit increases following the Autumn review of benefit rates. In the event the Autumn increase is estimated to have exceeded the Budget allowance by $20 million. Supporting mothers&#39; benefits were $10 million greater than the Budget provision, mainly because of a higher than expected number of beneficiaries. Because of the sharp rise in unemployment, payments of unemployment and sickness benefits were $133 million more than the Budget estimate. The higher level of unemployment also led to increases in outlays under the Regional Employment Development Scheme - $60 million compared with $25 million included in the Budget estimates - and to the provision of $40 million to the States in special employment creating grants. Income maintenance payments under the structural adjustment assistance scheme were $39 million more than estimated at Budget time. There were small shortfalls in a number of items, including war pensions and allowances ($4 million) and the Australian Assistance Plan ($2 million). </para>
        <para>Housing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for housing were $301 million greater than the Budget estimate, reflecting in the main the Government&#39;s measures during the year to revive activity in the housing industry. Additional advances totalling $150 million were made available to the States for the expansion of their welfare housing programs. In November 1974 the Government announced that advances of $150 million would be provided to the savings banks to augment their normal lending for housing; of that amount $120 million had been drawn by the end of the year. With the more generous borrowing provisions introduced in the 1974-75 Budget, demand for defence service home loans increased sharply and advances were S15 million more than estimated. Repayments of principal of defence service home loans were $20 million less than the Budget estimate because sales of mortgaged houses and consequent discharges of liability were considerably less than assumed in arriving at the Budget estimate. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays ascribed to this function fell short of the Budget estimate by $15 million. Delays in finalising and implementing agreements with the States resulted in a shortfall of $15 million in outlays on growth centres and a shortfall of $16 million in outlays on Land Commissions. On the other hand, outlays on financial assistance to the States for sewerage programs were $13 million greater than the Budget estimate as the States stepped up their sewerage works. </para>
        <para>Culture and Recreation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for culture and recreation exceeded the Budget estimate by $9 million. Outlays on broadcasting services, which account for more than half of the total outlays within the function, were $10 million higher than the Budget estimate, largely on account of greater than estimated wage and salary payments. Outlays for wildlife and national parks fell short of the Budget estimate by $4 million; slow progress in land acquisition for nature conservation purposes was the main reason for the shortfall. </para>
        <para>Transport and Communication</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for transport and communication exceeded the Budget provision by $165 million. The advance to the Post Office was $133 million greater than the Budget provision; a larger than assumed increase in rates of pay was the main factor but other contributing factors included a shortfall in estimated receipts, increased interest payments and other cost increases. Following the Premiers&#39; Conference in February 1975, an additional $30 million was made available to the States for road grants; in the event road grants actually paid over to the States exceeded the Budget estimate by $18 million. An extra $26 million was advanced to the Australian Shipping Commission to provide for the purchase of two ships, for a progress payment on two vessels under construction overseas and for cost increases associated with the devaluation of the Australian dollar in September 1974. Total outlays on rail transport, at $27 million, were $10 million more than the Budget estimate; payments of $5 million to Tasmania and $10 million to South Australia in connection with the transfer of the Tasmanian and non-metropolitan South Australian railway systems to the Australian Government were partly offset by shortfalls in outlays on a number of items, including the proposed Parramatta railway. Assistance to the States for the upgrading of urban public transport systems fell short of the Budget estimate by $22 million, reflecting delays in implementing the program. There was a shortfall of $9 million in advances to the Pipeline Authority stemming largely from delays occasioned by adverse weather conditions and industrial problems. </para>
        <para>Industry Assistance and Development</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for industry assistance and development were 1369 million more than was provided for in the 1974-75 Budget. The major factor in this increase was advances of $276 million to the Australian Wool Corporation to support the operation of the wool floor price scheme. No allowance was made for these advances in the Budget figuring. An advance of $20 million was made to the Commonwealth Development Bank mainly to enable it to help specialist beef producers. An amount of $56 million from the proceeds of a Government loan raised in the USA was on-lent to the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the Budget estimates did not include any allowance for payments to the AIDC in 1974-75. Export incentive grants exceeded the Budget estimate by $6 million. Payments to firms under the structural adjustment assistance program were $5 million below the Budget estimate because of difficulties experienced in processing applications and fewer than expected applications for assistance. </para>
        <para>Labour and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for labour and employment were $20 million greater than provided for in the Budget. Outlays under the National Employment and Training System amounted to $30 million, an increase of $12 million on the Budget estimate. More people took up assistance for full-time training under the System than had been assumed at Budget time. </para>
        <para>Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total payments for foreign affairs and overseas aid were $9 million more than the Budget estimate. Within this total there was a shortfall of $21 million in aid payments to Papua New Guinea; payments of termination benefits to former overseas officers of the PNG public service were not as great as expected because of the delay in the timing of independence, and portion of an allowance included in the estimates for wage and salary increases for overseas staff was not required. Payments to the Asian Development Bank were $5 million more than the estimate, the devaluation of the Australian dollar in September 1974 necessitating an increase in Australia&#39;s contribution to the capital of the Bank. There was an increase of $4 million in outlays under the Colombo Plan. Food aid provided under the International Wheat Agreement was $2 million more than the Budget estimate, with increases in the price of wheat primarily responsible. A payment of $3 million made for emergency relief for Indochina was not allowed for in the Budget. Administrative expenses under this heading exceeded the Budget estimate by $11 million, largely because of the effects on expenditure overseas of the September devaluation. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">General and Scientific Research nec</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays within this sub-function were $11 million greater than the Budget estimate, mainly because of increased wage and salary costs within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. </para>
        <para>Administrative Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on administrative services exceeded the Budget estimate by $52 million. The cost of wage and salary increases since the Budget accounted for most of the increase. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A number of factors contributed to the increase of $262 million over the Budget estimate in outlays under this heading. Financial assistance grants to the States exceeded the Budget estimate by $46 million mainly because average wages increased faster than assumed at Budget time. To help maintain employment opportunities, it was agreed at the Premiers&#39; Conference in February that State Government Loan Council programs be increased by $60 million over the Budget estimates and that special revenue assistance grants of $60 million be paid to the States. Special payments totalling $26 million were made to South Australia under arrangements agreed to with the State in connection with the State&#39;s withdrawal from the Grants Commission arrangements and the transfer of the South Australian non-metropolitan railway system; as indicated earlier, part of these grants ($10 million) has been allocated to the sub-function &#39;Transport and Communication&#39;. Payments for natural disaster relief were $75 million more than estimated, largely on account of the Darwin cyclone; outlays of $66 million under this heading resulted from the cyclone. </para>
        <para>Public Debt Interest</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments of interest on public debt were $92 million more than the Budget estimate, mainly reflecting higher than forecast subscriptions to Treasury Notes during 1974-75. </para>

        <para class="block">
        <graphic href="096131197508194_180_60.jpg" />
      </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main variations from Budget estimates, and the reasons for them, are indicated briefly below. </para>
        <para>Customs Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of customs duty were $71 million more than the Budget estimate. The value of imports subject to duty was greater than assumed at Budget time with the increase in Australian dollar prices of imports following the September devaluation more than offsetting the effects of the lower than estimated value of imports in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>Excise Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Revenue from excise duty was $36 million less than the Budget estimate; clearances of all major dutiable goods were lower than assumed at Budget time. </para>
        <para>Sales Tax</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Sales tax collections were  $49  million greater than the Budget estimate. The main reason for the higher collections was larger than assumed increases in prices of taxable goods. Higher than estimated sales and a faster than estimated increase in prices of motor vehicles more than offset the effect on revenue of the reduction in rates of sales tax announced on  28  January. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax - Individuals - Pay-as-you-earn</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Gross collections of PAYE instalment deductions were  $200  million less than the Budget estimate. The Budget estimate was based on assumptions that average weekly earnings would increase by  22.5  per cent in  1974-75  and that average employment would increase by  4.0  per cent (both on a male unit basis). In the event, the increases were about  26  per cent and  2  per cent, respectively, and the net effect would have been an increase in PAYE collections over the Budget estimate but for the reductions in rates of personal income tax announced in November  1974.  It is estimated that these reductions in personal income tax rates lowered PAYE collections by around  $440  million in  1974-75.  Refunds of PAYE income tax collections were  $82  million less than the. Budget estimate. The effect on refunds of taxpayers moving into and within that part of the tax instalment schedule that has a loading in it for concessional deductions other than for dependants was greater than expected; concessional deductions allowed on assessment were also less than expected. </para>
        <para>Income Tax - Individuals - Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections on assessment of income tax on individuals were  $134  million less than the Budget estimate, in large part reflecting the lower rates of individual income tax announced in November  1974.  Higher than estimated property and other business incomes in  1973-74  offset to some extent the effect of the lower rates on collections in  1974-75. </para>
        <para>Income Tax - Companies</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Company income tax collections were  $121  million less than estimated at Budget time. The main reason for the lower than estimated level was the reduction in company tax rates announced as part of the November  1974  measures; the influence of the reduced rates was partly offset by a larger than estimated increase in company incomes in  1973-74  (assessed to tax in  1974-75). </para>
        <para>Other Taxes, Fees and Fines</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of other taxes, fees and fines exceeded the Budget estimate by  $10  million. The main variation was an increase over the Budget estimate of  $8  million in unfunded employee retirement contributions resulting from wage and salary increases for servicemen during the year. </para>
        <para>Interest, Rent and Dividends</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from interest, rent and dividends were  $30  million higher than the Budget estimate. As indicated already, the advance to the Post Office was significantly higher than the Budget estimate and interest paid on the advance exceeded the Budget estimate by  $10  million. Other factors contributing to the higher receipts were  $8  million in interest on the advance to the Wool Corporation and an increase of  $5  million in bank interest. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Net Receipts from Government Enterprise Transactions</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It was estimated at Budget time that net receipts from Government enterprise transactions would be  $4  million. The outcome in fact was a net loss of  $12  million, a difference of $16 million. Electricity supply enterprises made a loss of $6 million, $4 million more than the Budget estimate and the Australian National Railways made a loss of $7 million, $5 million more than the Budget estimate. </para>
        <para>Sale of Land and Buildings</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from the sale of land and buildings were $18 million less than the Budget estimate. Proceeds from lease sales in the Australian Capital Territory were $14 million lower than estimated. </para>

          <title>STATEMENT No. 6- BUDGET TRANSACTIONS SINCE 1965-66</title>
          <page.no>185</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">This Statement presents -Budget transactions since 1965-66 classified according to the two complementary methods of classification adopted throughout the Budget Speech and Statements. The <inline font-style="italic">functional classification,</inline> which was introduced in the 1973-74 Budget, categorises Budget outlays according to their primary objectives or purposes. This classification facilitates consideration of, and decisions on, the nature, extent and relative priorities of various Australian Government activities. The <inline font-style="italic">national accounting classification</inline> details Budget outlays by economic type and facilitates comparisons of Budget aggregates with other Australian National Accounts data. This classification is essential when it comes to assessing the overall economic impact of the Budget. </para>
        <para>Functional Classification</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Functionally classified historical Budget outlay data for the period 1965-66 to 1974-75 are presented in summary form in Table 1 on page 132, and in more detail in Table 2 on pages 133 to 139. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In bringing together categories of outlays with similar objectives or purposes, the functional classification focuses attention on the nature of Government activities and the share of resources devoted to particular objectives. It also provides a logical framework within which programs can be developed to facilitate an assessment of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. An added advantage is that the functional classification generally adopts national accounting conventions for the definition of Budget outlays and receipts. This means that the figures used for the analysis and discussion of outlays by function are broadly in line with those used in the analysis of the economic impact of the Budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The introduction of the functional classification and the concurrent adoption of national accounting conventions resulted in a number of important changes in the definition of Budget aggregates such as &#39;Total Outlays&#39; (formerly Total Expenditures) and &#39;Total Receipts&#39;. Further information on these changes and on the basis underlying the functional classification is given in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification is essentially a re-classification of appropriation data, supplemented where possible with sub-costings of appropriation items of substantial magnitude that cover several functions. However, Table 2 provides less detail than do the tables in Statement No. 3, partly for ease of presentation and partly because some of the sub-costings necessary to eliminate the effects of all changes in accounting procedures and administrative arrangements are not available. To the extent possible the definitions and concepts followed in compiling this historical series are the same as those used in Statement No. 3. <inline font-weight="bold">Major discontinuities</inline> are indicated where appropriate. </para>
        <para>Budget Sector Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays of the Australian Government Budget Sector increased at an average annual rate of 13.1 per cent over the period 1965-66 to 1974-75. Within that period, however, there were some significant changes in the rates of growth of the various functional categories of outlays. The distribution of total outlays between the broad functional categories and changes in that distribution from year to year provide some indication of the importance attached to particular programs and focus attention on changing objectives and priorities of public expenditure. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Comparisons of trends in outlays over the period shown in the tables are affected by certain major developments such as the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, &#39;offsets&#39; to grants to the States, and changes in the operation of certain retirement benefit schemes. These factors are discussed in the Notes on Tables. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The figures in the tables are in current prices and therefore reflect price increases as well as increases in resources devoted to particular functional categories. Because of differential rates of price increase between both functional categories and economic  types of outlays, these figures distort to some extent comparisons of relative &#39;real&#39; growth rates in outlays within and between functions. These considerations apply also to comparisons between public and private sector outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A comparison of outlays in the years 1965-66 and 1974-75. is given in the table below. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="096131197508194_185_62.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The average annual rate of increase of total outlays over the period has been 13.1 per cent. But, as the table indicates, outlays on Education, Urban and Regional Development and Law, Order and Public Safety have grown at substantially higher rates. On the other hand, the growth in outlays on Defence and in payments of Public Debt Interest has been significantly less than average. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Average annual rates of increase can mask movements within the period. The chart below shows the proportion of total outlays within the major functions in each of the past ten years. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">By far the most important single category of receipts is income tax on individuals, which increased from 36.3 per cent of total receipts in 1965-66 to 50.5 per cent in 1974-75. This increase stems from the growth in net pay-as-you-earn income tax, which in turn reflects the effects of the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in wage and salary incomes, despite adjustments to the rate scale in 1970-71, 1972-73 and 1974-75. Taken together customs and excise duties and sales tax receipts have declined steadily as a proportion of total receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The major reason for the contracting share of &#39;Other General Taxation* in the total is that pay-roll tax revenue after 1972-73 relates to collections in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory only, following the transfer of this tax to the States in 1971. The Government&#39;s decision, announced in the 1974-75 Budget Speech, to abolish broadcasting and television licences from 18 September 1974 also contributed to this contraction in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>The Budget Deficit</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The overall Budget deficit in each of the years 1965-66 to 1975-76 is shown in Table 1. There is a brief discussion of the Budget deficit in the next section. </para>
        <para>National Accounts Classification</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The national accounts for the economy as a whole provide a systematic summary of the transactions that take place within the economy, especially those relating to the production and use of goods and services, and to transfers of income or capital between sectors of the economy. The national accounts classify transactions into various categories and, by outlining the relationships between the categories, enable analysis of the processes by which production and expenditure are linked. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Traditional methods of presenting estimates of public sector receipts and expenditure grew out of the requirement for maintaining parliamentary control over government spending. Estimates presented in a form suitable for this purpose do not necessarily lend themselves to an assessment of the economic impact of government financial activity. By presenting Budget sector data on a basis which is conceptually consistent with, and more easily related to, the national accounts for the economy as a whole, the National Accounting presentation of Budget transactions by economic type clarifies the nature of transactions between the public sector and the rest of the economy. The classification also provides a consistent framework within which the aggregation of Australian Government and State and local authority outlays and receipts is facilitated, to produce consolidated figures for the public sector as a whole. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is no single measure of the economic importance of government transactions. In terms of national accounting categories, the most direct influence that Budget outlays have on demand is by means of expenditure on final goods and services, i.e., the resources used in the provision of public goods such as defence, education, health and community amenities. Transfers and advances from the Budget to other sectors are also important, but the impact on economic activity of these outlays depends on the spending propensities of the recipients of the transfers and advances. For Budget receipts, it is also true that any assessment of their effect on the economy has to take into account the varying impact of different taxes and other receipts. The total economic impact of the Budget is an amalgam of all these influences. In a shorthand way the Budget deficit or surplus is usually taken as a summary measure of the Budget impact; like all summary measures, however, it is subject to a number of important qualifications. </para>
        <para>Australian Government Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The contribution of the Australian Government and its authorities to recent growth in the size of the public sector has been dominated by the transactions of the Budget sector. In 1974-75, for example, the Budget&#39;s direct call on resources, in the form of final expenditure on goods and services, represented over 75 per cent of final expenditure by the Australian Government sector as a whole. Advances from the Budget to Australian Government authorities also finance a significant part of final expenditures on goods and services recorded in the non-Budget sector. Direct expenditure on goods and services, however, represents only a moderate and, in recent years declining, proportion of total Budget outlays. The bulk of the Australian Government&#39;s budgetary transactions comprise transfer payments and advances to other sectors of the economy, including other government sectors. In 1974-75 transfer payments and net advances accounted for 78 per cent of total Budget outlays, of which almost half represented grants and net advances to State Governments. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 3 attached to this Statement shows Budget outlays since 1965-66 on a national accounts basis. On this basis, transfers between different parts of the accounts of the Australian Government Budget sector are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Australian Government and the rest of the economy, including other levels of government, and overseas. The national accounts figures therefore show government transactions classified into economically significant categories comparable to those presented in the White Paper <inline font-style="italic">National Income and Expenditure</inline> 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the past decade there has been a tendency for Australian Government Budget outlays to grow somewhat faster than expenditures in the economy as a whole. The following table compares the average annual rates of growth of the main components of Budget outlays with the average annual rate of growth in gross national expenditure for the period since 1965-66. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">During the period 1965-66 to 1973-74 there was little change in the proportion of total Budget outlays to gross national expenditure, with fluctuations between a low of 24 per cent in 1965-66 and a peak of 25.3 per cent in 1972-73. In 1974-75, however, the proportion increased sharply to 30.4 per cent, reflecting the rapid growth in Budget outlays in that year. Total transfer payments have grown rather faster than direct expenditure on goods and services over the period. The patterns of growth of direct expenditure and transfers have, however, been similar. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking the period as a whole, the Budget&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline> call on resources, as measured by final expenditure on goods and services, grew strongly from 6.0 per cent of gross national expenditure in 1965-66 to 7.3 per cent in 1967-68; it declined &#39; thereafter to 5.9 per cent in 1973-74 but rose to 6.6 per cent in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In assessing the total economic impact of the Budget on final demand for goods and services it is not sufficient, however, to look only at its direct call on goods and services. This is &#39;because, as noted previously, the larger proportion of Budget outlays is in the form of transfer payments, such as payments of pensions, subsidies, interest and grants, and the call on resources from such payments depends on the uses to which the recipients put the funds. Other Budget outlays take the form of advances, (e.g., to the States) and the economic impact of these is different again. Consequently, it is necessary to take account of variations in the composition of total outlays in analysing the Budget&#39;s impact. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on goods and services declined as a proportion of total Budget outlays from a peak of 29.1 per cent in 1968-69 (associated with the strong growth in defence spending in the preceding years) to 21.8 per cent 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the other hand, cash benefits to persons have increased as a percentage of total outlays from 20.6 per cent in 1967-68 to 24.2 per cent in 1974-75. Although it is not possible to specify precisely the final use of funds transferred from the Budget in this way, it is known that many of the recipients of these benefits have very high marginal propensities to spend and thus this category of outlays is likely to have a fairly immediate impact on final demand for consumption goods. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A major proportion of Australian .Government outlays comprises payments to the States. Because of changes from time to time in the methods of making such payments, it is more useful to look at &#39;Grants to the States&#39; and &#39;Net Advances to the States&#39; as one category. Considered as a whole, payments to the States have normally accounted for about one-third of Australian Government Budget outlays. Over the last ten years, the proportion has ranged between 31.3 per cent in 1968-69 and 35.9 per cent in 1974-75. These outlays finance, inter alia, the States&#39; health and education services and their works and housing programs. As with cash benefits, it is not practicable to trace through precisely the final use of all these funds from the Budget. Moreover, the timing of outlays by the States can differ from the timing of payments to them of funds to finance those outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Advances other than to the States are distributed chiefly within the Australian Government sector itself in the form of advances to government instrumentalities operating outside the Budget. These include the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, the Australian National Airlines Commission, Qantas Airways Limited, and the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Advances to such authorities in 1974-75 amounted to $1067 million or 6.0 per cent of Budget outlays. Again, it is not practicable to trace through the precise utilisation of the funds advanced to these instrumentalities from the Budget. It is, however, possible to offset transfers between the Budget and non-Budget sectors of the Australian Government and to consolidate outlays, other than inter-sector transfers, to form a statement of the outlays and receipts of the Australian Government sector as a whole. The method of consolidation used is outlined in the September 1974 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin. Table 5 attached to this Statement sets out national accounts estimates of the main categories of receipts and outlays of the Australian Government sector as a whole for the period since 1965-66. Total outlays by the non-Budget sector amounted to $1558 million in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There are some significant differences between the relative composition of outlays of the Australian Government sector as a whole and that of the Budget sector alone. The following table details the respective compositions of outlays for 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As the table shows, final expenditure on goods and services represents a greater proportion of total Australian Government outlays than of Budget outlays. The relatively greater outlays of the non-Budget authorities for capital purposes lift capital expenditure from 2.3 per cent of Budget sector outlays to 9.3 per cent of total outlays; the pattern is reversed in the case of advances. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Total Public Sector Direct Expenditure on Goods -and Services</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking into account State Government and local authorities, the relative size of total public sector direct expenditure on goods and services remained fairly steady until 1974-75. The following table shows the trend&#39; in the public sector&#39;s share of final goods and services over the period since 1965-66. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="096131197508194_193_68.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The very sharp rise in the share of resources going to the public sector in 1974-75 reflected a combination of increased demands by governments and particularly by the Australian Government, on the resources of the economy, and the downturn in private sector activity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The growth pattern of final consumption expenditure on goods and services, however, has differed from that of capital expenditure. In most years since 1965-66, public sector final consumption expenditure &#39;has grown at a faster rate than gross national expenditure, the ratio increasing steadily from 11.2 per cent in 1965-66 to 15.4 per cent in 1974-75. Public capital expenditure growth has been more erratic; its share of gross national expenditure reached a peak of 9.8 per cent in 1965-66, and declined to a low-point of 7.9 per cent in 1973-74 before rising to 9.2 per cent in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>Budget Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total budget receipts in national accounts terms have increased at an annual average rate of 13.1 per cent over the period from 1965-66, rising from 23.3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1965-66 to 26.1 per cent in 1974-75. These receipts comprise taxes of various types together with a number of other charges, interest, rent and dividends. As with outlays, different types of receipts have different effects on the economy. Taxes on incomes, for example, influence private demand for goods and services through their effect on the level of disposable incomes; sales taxes, on the other hand, affect private demand through the prices of goods. Consequently, the &#39;mix&#39; of &#39;Budget revenues, as well as their total size, needs to be considered in any assessment of the overall impact of the Budget on the economy. </para>
        <para>The Overall Budget Result</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government has incurred deficits on its budgetary transactions over the decade 1965-66 to 1974-75 (see Table 1). Estimates of the domestic budget result (see Statement No. 1) are available only for the years since 1968-69. These estimates are shown in the following table, along with the overall Budget result for the same years. The table also shows that, expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product, the overall deficit in 1974-75 was more than twice as large as the next highest deficit over this period. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="096131197508194_194_69.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main financing transactions undertaken to meet the deficits in the Budget over the period have been domestic and overseas loan raisings, the issue of Treasury Notes, and temporary borrowings from the Reserve Bank. Details of these financing transactions are given in Table 6 attached to this Statement. </para>
        <para class="block">Notes on Tables </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To the extent practical, historical data have been adjusted to eliminate major breaks in series. However, some important changes which affect year to year comparability cannot be readily removed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the Premiers&#39; Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Australian Government would cease to levy pay-roll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own pay-roll taxes as from the same date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Australian Government pay-roll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transfer arrangements had the effect of reducing the growth of outlays and receipts below the rate that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the Tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in special purpose payments to the States are recorded under the appropriate functional heading, while &#39;offsetting adjustments&#39; to General Revenue Assistance Grants to the States are taken into account under the functional heading &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief. In the 1973-74 the assumption of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education by the Australian Government contributed to an increase in outlays classified to &#39;Education&#39;, but also involved a compensating decline in general purpose funds provided to the States. This means that the rate of increase in Australian Government resources devoted to education, as shown in the function &#39;Education&#39;, is somewhat overstated. A similar effect occurs in 1974-75, which was the first full year of the new tertiary education arrangements; these arrangements applied only to the second half of 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in the operation of the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes affect the outlays for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the function Defence, and under the receipts headings &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines - Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions&#39;. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. </para>
        <para>Notes on Tables 1 and 2: Budget Sector Outlays Classified by Function </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Australian and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations would be met, in the same way as other expenditures, by the States out. of their approved Loan Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling $160 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Tables 1 and 2 show these amounts classified to &#39;Payments to the States etc&#39; instead of &#39;Housing&#39;. However, for the purposes of the calculation of the trend rate of growth and the chart of proportions of total outlays these amounts have been included in the function &#39;Housing&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because of revisions in the classification of items to the various functional headings (see Appendix to the Budget Statements) the figures in these two tables are not directly comparable with those given in the Budget documents for previous years. </para>

          <title>APPENDIX TO THE BUDGET STATEMENTS- THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF BUDGET OUTLAYS</title>
          <page.no>211</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the functional classification is to bring together outlays with like objectives&#39; or purposes. In this way the classification aims to present information on the nature of government activities and on the share of resources devoted to particular objectives, and to facilitate assessments of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Compared with the classification used in Budget Statements prior to 1973-74, the functional classification has the added advantage of being based on national accounting conventions. There is thus a consistent conceptual basis underlying both the economic classification and the functional classification. This removes a considerable source of confusion which existed in Budget documents prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually different classifications were used - the so-called &#39;conventional&#39; classification and the national accounting classification. </para>
        <para class="block">Basis of the Functional Classification </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The conventions and principles used in the functional classification are essentially those set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts,</inline> United Nations, New York 1968. That classification is a widely accepted international standard for the classification of public expenditure by function. It is also used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a basis for the development of internationally comparable statistics on the public sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Bureau of Statistics has concurrently adopted these conventions and principles in the documents it publishes on public authority finance. While the major functional headings adopted for budget purposes are conceptually consistent with those used by the Statistician in his publications, it should be noted that the figures published by the Bureau for Australian Government outlays cover both budget outlays and outlays by Australian Government authorities which operate outside the budget sector. They therefore differ somewhat from the figures shown for the budget sector in the Budget Statements. Information on the transactions of authorities operating outside the budget sector is shown in the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Australian Government Authorities,</inline> which is published with the Budget documents. Two further differences should be noted. First, outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements &#39;net&#39; of the relevant primary industry levies and charges; these outlays are shown on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, part of the expenditure incurred by some Australian Government departments and instrumentalities operating in Papua New Guinea is classified by the Statistician as foreign aid. These outlays, however, are shown under the same functional heading in the Budget Statements as similar outlays made within Australia. Supplementary information on the functional allocation of these outlays is available in the Bureau&#39;s publication <inline font-style="italic">Public Authority Finance - Authorities of the Australian Government.</inline> With the transition to independence in 1975 this difference in treatment should disappear in respect of future years. </para>
        <para class="block">The Structure of the Functional Classification </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The major functional headings are shown in the summary table in Statement No. 3. Brief descriptions of the contents of each function are given below. These descriptions are intended to convey the scope of the outlays included under each heading rather than to be a detailed listing of the contents of each category. Further detail on each function is provided in the body of Statement No. 3. Historical data for the period 1965-66 to 1974-75 are given in summary form in Statement No. 6. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From an examination of the classification structure set out in the Budget Statements it will be evident that the functional classification is relatively aggregative in nature. On the whole it has not been possible, for example, to dissect the administrative outlays of departments and to allocate them over the particular sub-categories shown under each functional heading. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays under each functional heading in the classification have been grouped together into readily identifiable expenditure blocks. These expenditure blocks do not, as a rule, purport to represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions or programs; rather, they are meant as recognisable and meaningful groupings which lend themselves to discussion and analysis. Nevertheless, the main&#39; outlay blocks are decidedly more purpose-oriented than was the case with the categories of expenditure identified under the conventional classification used in the past. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given the need to produce a continuing and up-to-date record of actual monthly outlays and receipts which is consistent, with the overall estimates embodied in the Budget Speech and documents, it has been necessary to work largely within existing central accounting records. These records are, at present, built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than detailed costing documents. The figures presented have, therefore, been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented where necessary by a limited number of sub-costings of substantial appropriation items which cover several functions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It should also be noted that the functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. Furthermore, some outlay and receipt figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may, therefore, be classified under more than one functional heading and it will not always be possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Statements. The introduction of the functional classification does not, however, alter the structure of the appropriations or the summaries presented with the Appropriation Bills, such as the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure.</inline></para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the broad purposes for which government outlays are undertaken, it is important to note that such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions. Military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme, however, requires that an outlay be classified to the function which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example above, the primary function is considered to be defence; this is in line with United Nations recommendations. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In any single classification system, it is not possible to focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to the Government or the public. Supplementary information on particular aspects of expenditure is therefore provided in other documents; for example, details of wage and salary estimates are shown in the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure</inline> and a separate White Paper is provided on <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities.</inline> Other supplementary Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech this year deal with the Civil Works Program, Education, Urban and Regional Development and Australia&#39;s Overseas Development Assistance. </para>
        <para>The Implications of Adopting National Accounting Conventions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As indicated earlier in this Appendix, the use of definitions of budget outlays and receipts based on national accounting conventions places budget data on a basis which, in the main, is conceptually consistent with national accounting information published by the Bureau of Statistics and can be related to trends in the public sector and in the economy reflected in that information. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principles underlying the national accounting presentation of budget data are set out in the Appendix to the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities,</inline> September 1974. Concurrent with the introduction of the functional classification in 1973-74, some changes were made to the previous national accounting definitions of outlays, receipts, the deficit, and their components used in the Budget Statements. The more significant of these changes were: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>net advances to the Australian Wheat Board are now treated as outlay items rather than financing transactions as in the past. This brings the classification of these short-term advances into line with that accorded to other advances from the budget; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>purchases of land and existing buildings (including inter-departmental transfers for which a financial adjustment is made) are now treated as outlays rather than offsets to the proceeds from the sale of these assets under a receipts heading. This change permits gross outlays on these assets to be shown under the appropriate functional headings. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other conceptual changes in line with the principles set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts</inline> were also introduced. These changes relate mainly to the treatment of rents and business enterprise transactions and are indicated in the September 1974 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin. Overall, they do not have a very significant effect on the figures shown for total receipts and total outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The adoption of national accounting conventions implies that the receipts and outlay figures shown in the Statements attached to the Budget Speech relate, for the most part, to the net transactions of the budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important characteristics of the national accounting treatment shown in the Statements are: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>the transactions of various Funds forming the Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, payments to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account are not shown as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure from that Trust Account is included. The aim is essentially to record the transactions between the budget sector and the rest of the economy. Allowance is made, however, for adjustments between functions arising from the transfer of existing assets where financial adjustments for these transfers are recorded; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>receipts derived from activities which are essentially of a governmental nature, involving regulation and compulsory payment, are normally treated as revenue items. As mentioned earlier, however, the various primary industry levies and charges which are collected by the Government and applied more or less directly for the purposes of commodity stabilisation, research and promotional activities are now offset against the relevant outlays. Other recoveries and repayments are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net outlay figures. For example, repayments of principal on advances to other authorities are offset against the corresponding advances under the same outlay heading. Bringing together the revelant outlays and recoveries or repayments makes it possible to see more readily the extent of financial resources which are directed through the Budget to a particular activity. Other taxes, compulsory charges, licence fees and the like which are more of a general revenue nature continue to be treated as receipts items under the heading &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines&#39;; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>the operating revenues of activities which are carried out as business-type enterprises are shown net of operating expenses as receipts items and do not appear in the outlay tables. The current operations of enterprises are therefore reflected in the Budget Statements to the extent that they contribute to general budget revenues; and </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important of these are interest on loans raised by the Australian Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading &#39;Public Debt Interest&#39;, while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">Changes in the Functional Classification </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because the organisation for and coverage of government activity is not static, changes need to be made to the functional classification headings or their contents from time to time. For example, following the administrative rearrangements announced in June 1974, the various outlays on &#39;Immigration&#39; (shown as a separate function in Budget Statements in 1973-74) were allocated to appropriate functions, including the renamed &#39;Labour and Employment&#39; function (previously &#39;Employment Conditions&#39;). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principal changes made to the contents of the functional headings this year are indicated below: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Defence. The amalgamation of the Departments of Supply and Secondary Industry to form the Department of Manufacturing Industry (June 1974), together with the transfer of Stores and Transport and purchasing activities to the Department of Services and Property (June 1975), have necessitated reconsideration of the previous practice of classifying some outlays associated with these activities to &#39;Defence&#39;. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">A basis for apportioning these activities between defence/civil has now been determined and expenditure allocated accordingly. The civil component of &#39;Storage and Transport&#39; is now shown as a common services item, as is expenditure associated with central purchasing activities. The historical series has been adjusted, as far as data allow, to a comparable basis. </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>Rents. Previously, payments of rent for civilian accommodation leased by the Government and controlled by the Department of Services and Property were allocated on the best basis possible, to the appropriate functional headings. The costs of government-owned office accommodation however were treated as a common service and not allocated. To remove this divergence in treatment it has been decided to treat civil rent payments as a common service item also. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>Railways. The Australian National Railways (ANR) has replaced the Commonwealth Railways. In the past Commonwealth Railways has been treated as a departmental enterprise within the budget sector; its capital payments were shown as outlays under the heading &#39;Transport&#39; while operating receipts were offset against expenditure under the receipts heading &#39;Net Receipts from Government Enterprise Transactions&#39;. Under the new arrangements ANR is to be treated as an enterprise outside the budget sector, with advances for capital purposes and an operating subsidy being shown as outlays. For the moment there is a break in the series at 1975-76 but if it proves possible to do so data for earlier years will be adjusted to a comparable basis in next year&#39;s Statements. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>As already indicated, it has been decided to offset primary industry levies and charges against the relevant outlays rather than show them as receipts under the heading &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines&#39; as previously. The effect of this new treatment is to show more clearly outlays on assistance to primary industries which are financed out of general revenue. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because the functional classification is derived largely from existing appropriation accounting data, adjustments to the functional classification are constrained by availability of suitable data in that system. In particular, the major changes to departmental administrative arrangements announced in December 1972, June 1974 and June 1975 have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent set of outlay aggregates for the periods covered in the Budget Statements. Where possible, the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by the sub-costing and re-grouping of appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies and produce an entirely comparable series. This should be borne in mind when examining the tables in Statement No. 3 and, more particularly, Statement No. 6. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For all these reasons, considerable care must be exercised when comparing functionally classified data in the 1975-76 Budget Statements with those in Budget Statements for earlier years. </para>

        <para class="block">Excise Tariff proposals No. 1 and Custom Tariff Proposals No. 24 which I have just tabled introduce the tariff changes foreshadowed by the Honourable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in his Budget Speech this evening. The Proposals increase the duties of excise and customs on beer, manufactured tobacco products and spirits and impose a new excise duty on the production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas. The increases operate from 8 o&#39;clock this evening. The increase on beer represents an increase of about 4c in the duty component on a 10-ounce glass of beer. The proposals increase the rate of duty on cigarettes equivalent to 6c per packet of twenty. </para>
        <para>The increase of 86c per litre of alochol on spirits other than brandy is equivalent to lc per nip or 26c per bottle. The increase in the rate of duty on brandy is $1.26 per litre of alcohol. This increase consists of 2 factors. These are firstly an increase of 86c per litre of alcohol as in the case of other spirits and secondly an increase of 40c per litre of alcohol representing the completion of the 3-year phase-out of the duty differential between brandy and other spirits which was announced in the 1973 Budget. A summary of these alterations is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals. </para>

        <para>Customs Tariff(Coal Export Duty) Proposals ( 1975)</para>
        <para>This Proposal is designed to impose export duties on coal exported from Australia. They were foreshadowed by my colleague the Honourable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> earlier this evening. As the Treasurer mentioned, the price of coal in world markets has risen dramatically over the last 2 years in the wake of the very sharp rise in oil prices. In many cases the price is now 3 times as great as it was before the oil price increases. The Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> has returned only recently from Japan where he discussed acceptable levels of export prices, in the case of hard coking coals, of the order of $37 per tonne. Coal exporters are as a result earning very large windfall profits. The Government believes that it is only reasonable that some part of these windfall profits should be re-channelled for the benefit of the community. The duties proposed will achieve that result. </para>
        <para>Coal varies in quality and the variation is reflected in the prices which are received by exporters. The higher quality coking coals have experienced greater increases than have some of the other classes of coals. It is therefore proposed that the various coals will be classified according to their quality and duty will be levied appropriately. The higher quality coals will bear a duty of $6 per tonne. Other coals, including steaming coals, will bear a duty of $2 per tonne. </para>
        <para>The Government is concerned that those overseas buyers who have agreed to pay higher prices for our coals should be protected in respect of those prices. In other words, the Government does not wish the duty to be passed on to those buyers. It is therefore proposed that, in order to protect buyers in respect of prices recently renegotiated, approval to export will be in terms of those renegotiated prices as appropriately adjusted by escalation provisions but not including the new duty. I commend the Proposals. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The Government has great difficulty appreciating the reasons that the Opposition opposes this measure. One would have thought that in this day and age, in 1975, Australians of whatever shade of political hue or feeling would have agreed on one thing at least, namely, that Australia is a nation which today recognises, as far as its legal system is concerned, that the High Court is and should be the ultimate court of appeal from all Australian courts, whether those courts be part of the Federal system or whether they be part of the State systems. Yet, as is so often the case, the Opposition once again says that it will oppose the Bill, this time not because it claims that the measure itself is bad- no one could be heard to say that- but because somehow or other it finds offensive or objectionable the method chosen to achieve the end. One has to analyse the Opposition&#39;s motives. As so often happens when one listens to the speeches of Opposition members, one is forced to look around behind the words they choose to use to the purpose they seek to achieve. I listened with great interest to the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> who said that he would support a referendum proposal. Well, he might as an individual support such a proposal, but we all know the results of attempts made in this country to change the Constitution be referenda. This Labor Government more than any other government has tried to change the Australian Constitution by referenda, but it requires only one determined group of people, hiding behind the words with which they choose to cloak their real thoughts, to oppose a referendum for the community as a whole to oppose it. It seems that the Australian experience is that Australians vote no. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In this situation the Australian Government is using the legal means available to it. There are different points of view, it is true, on whether a challenge would succeed in the High Court were it ever to be mounted. But there are views both ways. The Australian Government takes the view that it wants to go to the limit of constitutional power because it has to change the absurd situation whereby an appellant in a State system of courts- in the New South Wales Supreme Court or the Victorian Supreme Court or the South Australian Supreme Court or the Western Australian Supreme Court or the Tasmanian Supreme Court or the Queensland Supreme Court- can bypass the High Court and go to the Privy Council, thus setting up 2 different competing lines of authority. No dignified Australian in this day and age can tolerate such a situation. Australians belong to one nation, one nation alone. Yet the Australian Government, in trying to give effect to its policies, to see the High Court of Australia as the single and only ultimate court of appeal, once again is met with arguments from the Opposition to the effect that it does not really oppose the Bill but there must be some other way in which the Government should try to do this. It is the Opposition&#39;s credit that is at issue, the credit of the Opposition when once again it says: &#39;We know that what you are trying to do is the right thing. We do not really want to oppose you, but we are going to oppose you.&#39; Then the Opposition searches, sometimes with incredible ingenuity, to find an additional reason why the measure that it recognises as being sound has to be opposed. So we see yet another example of this attitude coming from the Opposition. </para>
          <para>I am reminded of the peculiar situation that exists in Australia with its successively rigid Constitution. I have had occasion in recent times to make a number of speeches on this issue. One was a speech I gave in Perth, Western Australia, a little while ago, titled &#39;Barriers to ReformPolitics of Opposition&#39;. I tried to deal with the opportunities that are given to an Opposition that controls the Senate to thwart, frustrate and delay the proposals that are put forward by a popularly elected government. One can think of examples other than the Privy Council (Abolition of Appeals) Bill that we are discussing tonight. One thinks of the legislation that relates to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and the electoral reforms that we have tried to put through. One could go on. I think there are some 30 Bills which have been rejected by the Senate since the double dissolution in May of last year. Those Bills are resting in the bank, so to speak, and testify to the unreasoning opposition of the Opposition in the Senate in particular where the Opposition has the numbers. An Opposition that lost an election is able in the Senate to stop a Government that won an election from carrying out its policies. </para>
          <para>Surely there is no greater example to be found of this ability than in respect of this legislation. The Opposition says: &#39;Look, we know that the measure is good, but we are going to block it anyway&#39;. The Opposition comes along and says in this respect: &#39;We disapprove of this particular legal method&#39;- no one argues that is an illegal method- &#39;of achieving your end&#39;. The Opposition claims that in some way it is undignified for Australia to take this one additional step towards nationhood in this way, when such action is the only legal way open to the Government. We heard the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> say: &#39;Do not use this legal method that is open to you. Use another one&#39;, when he knows full well that the whole experience of Australia since Federation is that the method that he puts forward as the one that we should try is doomed to failure. </para>
          <para>I will not take up the time of honourable members very much longer on this matter. We know the attitude of the Opposition. We know that the Opposition has declared itself on this legislation. This is one further example of the attitude of the Opposition when its members rise in this place to say that it is right and proper- that is the effect of their words if not the meaning of their wordsthat Australians should not use their own High Court but in six different ways from six different parts- called States- of Australia should be able to appeal to a supreme judicial body in another country that increasingly is a foreign country to Australia notwithstanding its very close historic ties with Australia. The Privy Council of the United Kingdom and of the Commonwealth should rule on appeals from New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, often perhaps in different ways, when that body and the United Kingdom are obsessed with their own concerns. That is what the Opposition says. </para>
          <para>The Privy Council is not familiar really with Australian law. Australian law is going its own way. It has been going that way for many, many years now. The United Kingdom has been going ever increasingly into Europe as its entry into the European Economic Community and similar developments of that sort prove. Yet here in 1975 the Opposition- the Liberal Party and the National Country Party- is able to say that a situation should exist by which the Privy Council located in England should rule on what is the law in, say, New South Wales, or what is the correct legal solution to a problem between 2 Australian citizens living in Hobart or Perth, merely because the Australian Government, according to one view, does not have the constitutional power to say what the Canadian Government said back in about 1933. They would have this absurd and very dangerous situation continue whereby we cannot give ourselves the symbols and dignity of nationhood. </para>
          <para>This is an absurd situation in 1975, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> This attitude does not do the Opposition any credit at all. It brings discredit on the Opposition. I can only hope that people listening to the broadcast of these proceedings from the Australian Parliament, immediately after the presentation of the Budget, will realise what is happening in the House of Representatives tonight after the presentation of that Budget and not related to it at aU. The proposal to abolish appeals from the State supreme courts to the Privy Council in London is being opposed by the Opposition. No matter what the members of the Opposition say, the effect of their actions is to oppose the proposal. The Opposition says: &#39;Of course we cannot say that it is not a desirable measure, but you must find a better way to do it&#39;. But the only way the Opposition can suggest is a referendum when it knows that invariably when this Government puts forward referendum proposals the Opposition opposes them and its very opposition frustrates the attempts to change the Australian Constitution. </para>
          <para>Many people in Australia increasingly, I hope, are becoming aware of the rigidity of the Australian Constitution and its complete and total inadequacy to meet the needs of Australians in 1975. Yet here and now we see another example of Liberal-Country Party people saying: &#39;There must be some way that you can do it&#39;. They know full well that the way that they put forward will not succeed. They know that the Statute of Westminster exists. They know that the provisions contained in it have often been commented upon. They know that it is a legal way. For some reason or other they simply say: &#39;Do not use it. Use the referendum procedures&#39;, when we know that they will oppose those measures at another time. So Australia must limp along. Australia is one of the few countries in the world whose people must appeal not to its own courts but to somebody else&#39;s court in another part of the world. It may not be irrelevant if I mention tonight that there was a report, which is probably true, although not officially confirmed- I think that should not prevent me from using it- of the Bartons having succeeded in their case in Paraguay. The reason they succeeded is not unrelated to the matter about which I am talking because a United Kingdom treaty of 1908 may have been held to be not applicable to Australia in 1975. How absurd! </para>
          <para>The Whitlam Labor Government tries to make changes, tries to develop treaty relationships and tries to develop the legal apparatus appropriate for an independent nation- not for 8 different nations; not for New South Wales as a nation and Victoria as a nation, each as different from the other as France is different from the Soviet Union, as the members of the Opposition would sometimes like them to be. We do not wish that the Australian Capital Territory should be as different from the Northern Territory as Spain is from Portugal. But when we try to develop a single coherent set of courts with a single appellate system and we use the only practical and legal means available to us, the Opposition opposes us. The Opposition does not challenge the legality of those means but chooses to find some strange and political form of words to seek to use its numbers in the Senate to block the measure. In 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978, and for all we know in the year 2000 if the Opposition has its way and continues to control the Senate, Australians will still be required to appeal from the Supreme Court of, say, Western Australia not to our own High Court but to the Privy Council in England. One despairs of continuing to have patience with the Opposition when it persists with this nonsense. </para>

            <para>- I am extremely sorry that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> adopted the line of argument that he did because I do not think it reflected any credit on him or upon this debate. It seems very strange to me and, I am sure, to all members of the Opposition that a government that is so intent on breaking what the Attorney-General&#39;s predecessor described as &#39;those vestigial legal links between Australia and the United Kingdom&#39; should resort to one of the most vestigial of all those links to bring about the purposes contained in this Bill. I am referring to the Statute of Westminster. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During his remarks the Attorney-General, who became more heated about the subject as he went along, called in question the Opposition&#39;s credit. He said that we are not really genuine in saying that we want to abolish appeals from the courts in Australia to the Privy Council. Honourable members will know that at the time this Bill was introduced there was a companion Bill to abolish the final right of appeal from the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council. Was the Opposition seen to be opposing.that Bill? It was not. The Attorney-General knows that; the Government knows that. We supported that Bill and our support was consistent with our attitude that the final court of appeal should be the High Court of Australia. We supported that Bill because the correct course of action was being followed. On that occasion we were not being asked to embark upon the embarrassing exercise of reviving a 1 93 1 statute. </para>
          <para>It never ceases to amaze me that the leader of this.Government, who is so intent upon breaking what he calls the vestigial links that in government offices throughout Australia he hangs his own portrait in place of the portrait of the sovereign of this country, is prepared when it comes to his own political purposes to use a 1 93 1 statute of the Imperial Parliament- a statute which by its very description, by the history which led up to it and by the history which followed it - </para>

              <para>-I think, with respect, that the Attorney-General&#39;s point of order was not a legitimate one. I share the view expressed by the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> that is, that the High Court of Australia should be the final court of appeal. A process was initiated in 1968 by one of the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s predecessors- the Honourable Nigel Bowen- to limit appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. I certainly share the view and I believe that most members of the Opposition share the view that that process ought to be completed. But it ought to be completed in a manner which is consistent with the independence and the dignity of Australia in 1975. We are constantly being harangued that we are the people who are hanging on to unnecessary colonial links. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I return again to the Statute of Westminster. How colonial can you possibly get to resort to a statute the very purpose of which was to emphasise the legal independence of the then dominion countries of the British Commonwealth? The purpose of the Statute of Westminster was to make it clear beyond all doubt that the laws of the United Kingdom Parliament would not apply to the dominions of the British Commonwealth unless the Parliaments of those countries expressly requested that those laws so apply and consented to their applying. It was clearly believed at the time that no self respecting dominion would resort to the device to which the present Government has resorted in 1975. The present Government is intent on breaking these vestigial links but, surprisingly enough, it has resorted to this very colonial, vestigial and dependent device. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General spent a great deal of time talking about the futility of his Government putting forward referenda proposals. I was very intrigued to hear that, because bis Leader, only a few months ago in the dying hours of the autumn session of this House, reintroduced a Bill providing for a referendum for simultaneous elections. Apparently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> does not believe that it is futile to put referenda proposals to the Australian people, although I believe that certain branches of the Australian Labor Party&#39;s organisation throughout Australia believe that it is futile to do so because the Prime Minister was criticised for doing so at the time of the last double dissolution campaign. The AttorneyGeneral knows very well that a referendum proposal could be put to the Australian people to deal with this subject. It is to completely confuse the debate and to mislead the House to say that that option is not open. The Attorney-General knows that the self-respecting option open to the Government in this issue is to have a referendum. The Australian Constitution provides that that document can be changed by referendum of the people. On this occasion the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Government is in effect saying: &#39;The Constitution is not adequate; we will bypass it and revive an ancient device&#39;. I think it reflects no credit on either the political or historical approach of the Government to these matters. </para>
          <para>I am very sorry that the Attorney-General finds our constitutional setup so rigid and so frustrating. I venture to suggest that a great number of people throughout Australia have been extremely grateful over the past 2&#39;/2 years that we have had the Constitution Act of 1 90 1 because if we had not we aU know very well that the legal balance which still exists between the Federal Government and the State governments in our Federation would have been greatly disturbed. Of course the Constitution needs updating. Of course one could always improve on the basic document of our Federation. For the AttorneyGeneral to manifest so very clearly during the course of this debate his frustration and annoyance with the rigidity of the Constitution is, I think, very revealing. The Attorney-General is convinced that all referendum proposals presented by this Government are doomed to failure. I suggest that if the Government chooses to put forward a sensible referendum proposal, one which is not designed solely to accrue more and more power to the Federal Government, it might have a Utile more chance of success. </para>
          <para>So I emphasise again that the Opposition is in no way opposed to a situation in which the High Court of Australia rightly becomes the final court of appeal on all matters arising in the Commonwealth of Australia. We made this point very clear in the debate on the Bill dealing with the abolition of appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. Our credibility is not in doubt. It is the credibility of the Government on this matter which is in doubt. The use of the device which the Government seeks to use in this legislation is to remind the Australian people of a dependent status, not to remove it. It is to remind the Aus.tralian people that unnecessary colonial links still exist between Australia and the United Kingdom; it is not to remove it. We support the objective of this legislation. I support it very strongly. I have long believed that all appeals to the Privy Council should be eliminated. We deplore the device which has been used by the Government on this occasion. We believe that it could prejudice relations between this country and the United Kingdom. </para>
          <para>I believe that the points which the right honourable member for Bruce made during his remarks were most relevant. Why should we involve the United Kingdom Parliament in a domestic Australian dispute? In effect, that is what we run the risk of doing. For the first time since the Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931 we run the risk of involving the United Kingdom Parliament in a domestic Australian legal matter. How dependent, vestigial and colonial could one possibly get? Yet that is the device on which this progressive independent Government of Australia of 1975 relies. Instead of recognising the self-respect of Australia as an independent country, it resorts to this ancient and colonial device. I repeat that the Opposition supports the principle of the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. It deplores the device which has been used by the Government on this occasion. It rejects any suggestions that its credibility is in doubt. It is not in doubt. The Opposition facilitated the passage of the companion Bill which completed a process which was commenced by a Liberal Attorney-General in 1968. The Opposition will again oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>-My reason for rising in this debate is somewhat unusual. I have risen not to speak on the measure but to explain that I shall abstain from voting on this Bill if a division takes place. I want simply to explain to the House my reason for doing so. As the Prime Minister (Mr.Whitlam) said in his second reading speech, this measure has been introduced for the third time in 2 years, and 2 years ago I was the Solicitor-General. This measure was settled by me as Solicitor-General and I took part in negotiations with the British Government in relation to it. In the circumstances I think it is proper that I should abstain from voting on the measure. I say that to explain my reasons to both sides of the House. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  ( 1 ), (2) and (3) As a non-smoker myself, I have been personally interested in the development of non-smoking areas in Australian domestic aircraft. In February 1972, Ansett Airlines and TAA agreed to set aside groups of seats in both first class and economy class compartments for non-smokers, who might ask to be seated in these areas when seats were being allocated prior to the departure of the flight. At that time 1 8 seats were set aside for non-smokers in DC-9 aircraft and 20 seats in Boeing 727- 100 aircraft. </para>

          <para>Since the introduction of non-smoking seats, which I might add were not widely availed of initially, both Ansett Airlines and TAA have carried out continuous market surveys to ensure that the provision of non-smoking seats has kept pace with social trends. In this regard, non-smokers are now provided with 27 seats on DC-9 aircraft, 30 seats on B727-100 aircraft and 36 seats on Boeing 727-200 aircraft, the number of seats being proportionate between first class and economy class compartments. </para>
          <para>I am sure that you will also be interested to learn that Qantas Airways has recently doubled its seat allocation for nonsmokers and now provides up to 108 non-smoking seats on Boeing 747 aircraft and 40 non-smoking seats on Boeing 707 aircraft. Although some other international airlines do provide slightly more non-smoking seats, it is pleasing to see Qantas adapting to passenger requirements. </para>
          <para>It must be recognised however, that a significant number of air travellers do wish to smoke and would undoubtedly object strenuously to measures preventing them from doing so. The airlines are of course sensitive to this as, indeed, they are to the position of the non-smoker. The arrangements which they have introduced for the segregation of smokers and non-smokers is essentially a compromise. Nevertheless, it is an encouraging development in line with social trends and one which I am personally keen to see pursued further. </para>
          <para>As the level of community reaction against smoking increases, as hopefully it will, the arrangements made by the airlines for the accommodation of smokers on their aircraft will unquestionably reflect this changed community attitude. We might look forward, perhaps, to the assignment of smokers to seats in smoking areas, segregated from the majority of non-smokers. For the present, however, the airlines are endeavouring to ensure that their passengers, both smokers and non-smokers alike, are subject to the minimum of inconvenience </para>

              <para>1 ) The Government&#39;s policy is to guarantee political and programming independence to the ABC. Under the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act, the ABC is responsible for the content and standards of its programs in radio and television. The Commission acknowledges, but is not subject to, the program standards determined by the Broadcasting Control Board. The Commission has laid down guidelines and standards which are communicated to the program staff. If the Management of the ABC believes these standards are being misinterpreted then Management deals with the matter internally at an appropriate level. This is a long standing ABC practice. </para>

As far as I am aware, only one of 2JJ&#39;s programs has been the subject of particular complaint. I am advised that the reports of these complaints do not represent a fair review of the output of the station, which devotes a great deal of time to community service programming. In making any recommendations concerning the licensing of commercial stations, I believe the Broadcasting Control Board similarly would take account of a station&#39;s overall performance. </para>

              <para>and (4) When the Government allocated a new frequency to the ABC in Melbourne, the ABC chose to use it for access broadcasting. The new station opened on 12 May and the ABC advises me that there are no present plans to establish an ABC Rock Station in Melbourne. Although there are reception difficulties connected with its temporary use of standby equipment, 2JJ has been extremely well received by its target audience, thus proving the need for such stations despite already established commercial stations. I have been informed that 2 JJ has a significant audience in Wollongong and that even in Melbourne young people tune in to it at night. </para>

In the event the actual expenditure in 1974-75 was $592m. The table on pages 60 and 61 of the Statement attached to the 1974-75 Budget Speech provides the details of the outlays for rural industries as estimated at Budget time. Some further items were introduced after presentation of the Budget, the main ones being Wool Marketing Loan Assistance (involving in 1974-75 an expenditure of $276m against an estimate of $350m) and advances to the Commonwealth Development Bank for Rural Lending ($20m). The total outlay of $592m does not take account of the proceeds of such industry levies and charges as the wool tax and meat export charge, details of which are shown in the 1 974-75 Budget Statement No. 4. </para>

The Government has, however, accepted the recommendation of the Report on Rehabilitation and Compensation in Australia (The Woodhouse Report) that there should not be a monopoly in the provision of aids and appliances and that healthy competition will tend to increase both quality of aids and service. I have no doubt that the Working Party and the National Advisory Council on the Handicapped will take this into consideration when making recommendations concerning orthoses. </para>

              <para>On 28 August 1974, Australia contributed $30,000 to the International Red Cross for immediate relief work on Cyprus. On 28 November the Acting Foreign Minister announced a gift of 31.5 tonnes of Australian canned beef, worth $50,000 to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees&#39; appeal for aid for displaced persons on Cyprus. On 14 May 1975 Australia announced a further contribution of 39.6 tonnes of meat, worth $50,000 to the UNHCR appeal. Together with 192 tonnes of rice worth $55,000 given via the World Food Program to displaced persons on Cyprus, the total Australian official assistance for humanitarian work is now $205,000. In addition, at the request of the Government, Qantas has carried free of charge a considerable quantity of foodstuffs and other items collected by voluntary organisations in Australia for distribution on Cyprus. Besides direct aid, there have been other Australian forms of assistance. On 13 December the UN Security Council, then under the Presidency of the Australian Representative, extended until 15 June 1975 the mandate of the UN Peace Keeping Force and subsequently the Australian Government reaffirmed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations its willingness to maintain our contingent of civilian police as part of the peacekeeping force there. Australia has also taken a receptive approach to the admission into Australia of displaced persons from Cyprus. </para>

              <para>In the period since 1 January 1974 consideration of Law of the Sea questions has been carried out principally in an interdepartmental committee and an interdepartmental task force, in which all Departments directly interested in Law of the Sea questions, including Foreign Affairs and Attorney-General&#39;s, have been represented. In keeping with the considerable significance which these questions have for Australian foreign policy, and the Foreign Affairs Department&#39;s responsibilities in relation to international conferences and negotiations, these two interdepartmental bodies have been chaired by senior Foreign Affairs officers. Similarly, Australian delegations to the Caracas session of the Law of the Sea Conference in 1974 and the Geneva session in 1973 have been led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, in his absence, by a senior Foreign Affairs officer and have included a number of other Foreign Affairs officers, as well as a senior officer of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. </para>

              <para>Law of the Sea questions raise important issues which fall within the area of responsibility of a number of departments. It is for this reason that work on these issues has largely been carried out through the medium of an interdepartmental task force, so that all interested departments have been able to take part in consideration of the issues and formulate recommendations to Ministers, so discharging their responsibilities. This applies in particular to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, which has responsibilities in relation to a number of the issues involved. </para>

            <para>In selecting Foreign Affairs officers, the Department&#39;s policy is that recruits should have a substantial Australian background. Some recruits, however, while fulfilling the requirement on Australian background, have not been Australian citizens at the time they joined the Department. This is often because they belong to migrant families. Provided that, as required by the Public Service Act, they have been British subjects, there has been no formal requirement for them also to be Australian citizens in order to join the Australian Public Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs. In practice, of course, most such recruits have taken out Australian citizenship since joining the Department. A problem remains in relation to several of them: they have unfortunately found that they are not able to qualify for Australian citizenship because of their regular periods of service overseas have meant they cannot fulfil the requirement of a certain period of continuous residence in Australia immediately prior to the date they apply for Australian citizenship. The Department of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the Department of Labor and Immigration seeking an amendment to the Citizenship Act so that officers in this category are not precluded by virtue of the nature of their duties from becoming Australian citizens. </para>

              <para>The majority of the Department&#39;s Foreign Affairs Officers are recruited at the Foreign Affairs Trainee level through the normal annual selection process. Some officers recruited in this way come from other Departments but most come from outside the Australian Public Service. The preferred age for Foreign Affairs Trainees is between 2 1 and 26 but older applicants including some in their early thirties are also recruited at this lowest level. In the time frame of a lifetime career, competent older entrants are not necessarily disadvantaged by coming in at the bottom. The Department of Foreign Affairs also recruits some Foreign Affairs officers at other more senior levels, normally from within the Australian Public Service.The Department considers all applications which are made to it at every level and judges each case on its merits. </para>

          <para>It should be noted that, in addition to the above, twenty officers who were already employed in the Department of Foreign Affairs in clerical and research positions have been transferred into Foreign Affairs Officer positions. Many of these were previously employed in other Departments and with international organisations before joining the Department of Foreign Affairs. </para>
          <para>There are also some officers at present serving in the Department of Foreign Affairs who have returned to it after spending varying periods of time elsewhere- in universities, private enterprise, and other Departments. These officers are not included in the above figures.

            <para>The Government did take action immediately to curb the excessive expansion of the money supply. Within days of assuming office the Government appreciated the $A by 7 per cent and tightened controls on private capital inflow, notably via the introduction of a Variable Deposit Requirement Scheme on borrowings abroad by Australian residents. Those controls were strengthened in February 1973 and the exchange rate was further appreciated by S per cent in September of that year. Domestic monetary policy was also tightened progressively during 1973. The lagged effect of the previous Government&#39;s policies were such however, that it was not until 1974 that effective control of monetary aggregates was achieved. </para>

In respect of capital grants, payments are made to the States in connection with projects that have been approved by the Minister. The payments are in respect of actual expenditure made by the States on the approved projects or expenditure which they expect to make within a short time of the payment. The payments which have been made in 1974-75 in relation to major capital works are shown below. They are for State expenditures to complete projects which were commenced with funds provided under the States Grants (Technical Training) Acts; to undertake recently approved projects; and for the planning of projects to be undertaken in the near future. </para>
