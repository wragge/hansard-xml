            <para>That the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the House because the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have concurred in the improper disclosure of the details of the 197S-76 Budget against all established principles and practices. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">No more serious charge could be laid against a Prime Minister and his Treasurer than the accusation that the Treasurer deliberately leaked details of a Budget prior to its announcement to the Parliament and that this action had the concurrence of the Prime Minister. On Monday evening on national television the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> stated that he revealed details of this year&#39;s Budget to the  President  of the Austral a in Labor Party who is also the head of his own political party and a director of several commercial companies. No other person was given that information at that time. The inference of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was treated no differently from journalists, members of the Reserve Bank Board or State Premiers is false and misleading. </para>
          <para>I want to make it perfectly clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s treatment in this matter was entirely unique and without precedent in the history of this country. Why is it that a government which has closed up on all information has yet made the most vital financial facts known to the  President  of the Australian Labor Party? Why is it that a government which refuses to publish a White Paper on the economy and suppresses all departmental advice on the loans scandal is at the same time prepared to make the most sensitive information available to its chosen political son? Members of this House are very much aware the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is the  chairman  of directors of ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd, a company which would have a vital interest in financial information of this type. </para>
          <para>The  President  of the ALP has deep personal involvement in all aspects of the Australian Council of Trade Union&#39;s business and financial activities. The Treasurer&#39;s action without any doubt gave the ACTU&#39;s financial interests the capacity to profit by prior knowledge of the Government&#39;s financial decisions. This is without parallel in Australian history. It transgresses all precedents and practices. It was in the view of the Opposition Parties, and I believe the public at large, an act of gross impropriety. This Treasurer can no longer have the confidence of this Parliament. </para>

              <para>-The Treasurer should resign, and the Opposition Parties call on him to resign. Yesterday the Prime Minister told this House that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> had been given prior information to assist that gentleman in his television comment on the evening of the Budget. The Prime Minister said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>For years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has regularly participated in television programs on the Budget on Budget night and he takes part in these discussions  with journalists who have seen copies of the Budget in advance. Quite obviously it is better for him to be equally well briefed, and he has been, and quite properly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a disgraceful statement. How can the Prime Minister seriously allege that the head of one of this country&#39;s major political parties is entitled to prior Budget information simply to assist him in acting on television performances as a direct propagandist for this Government? This is no more than aiding a Government propagandist by improper and unprecedented means. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister&#39;s statement in question time yesterday to which I have just referred is no response to the charges which the Opposition makes about the issue which is now before the House. It is no response to the charge that the Labor Party  President  could have used the information in the interests of Bourkes Melbourne Pty Ltd or ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. It is no defence against the charge that the  President  of the Australian Labor Party could have used the information for his own personal financial gain or for that of his colleagues. The Treasurer, by his gross impropriety, placed a prominent Australian citizen in a position whereby he could have made unique monetary gain. The Treasurer told the House yesterday- at least he implied it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was treated differently because after all he is a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Once again this is no defence to the charge which the Opposition  makes. At 12.30 p.m. yesterday I telephoned the Governor of the Reserve Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Knight,</inline> concerning the leaking of Budget information to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> On the record, the Governor of the Reserve Bank stated to me that members of the Reserve Bank do not receive Budget documents and would not necessarily be in receipt of Budget documents by virtue of their office. Why is it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was the only member of the Reserve Bank Board who was given this particular information in this particular way? If it was usual to give this type of information to members of the Board, why did the Treasurer give it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> alone? Clearly there is no defence on this score. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister also sought yesterday to draw an analogy between the information given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and the way in which State Premiers are normally informed about the Budget. That analogy, characteristic of the manner in which the Prime Minister performs in this House, was false, misleading and mischievous. The Opposition has consulted with State Premiers specifically in respect of that statement by the Prime Minister. The Victorian Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer,</inline> has informed the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that he is unable to collect the Budget documents until such time as the Treasurer commences his Budget Speech. The Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, sent a telex to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday in the following terms: </para>

            <para>I confirm my advice to you by phone this morning that the  Budget Speech and papers were made available to us at the Commonwealth Treasury Perth office on a security basis 1700 hours West (5 p.m.), which is 1900 hours EST (7 p.m.), on the day when the Budget was presented to the Federal Parliament. </para>
            <para>The letters from the Prime Minister dealing with a number of special matters included in the Budget were delivered by courier to the Premier&#39;s Department at 1600 hours West (4 p.m.) which is 1800 hours EST (6p.m.) </para>

            <para>The Premier . . . said today the Prime Minister and the Federal Treasurer . . . had misled Parliament over claims that the State Premiers had been briefed in advance on the contents of the Federal Budget. </para>

            <para>The Budget is a document which must be preserved with the greatest confidentiality before it is delivered in the House by the Treasurer. The security with which it is kept is strictly policed to prevent premature disclosure to any person who does not need to know, either as a decision-taker or a decision implement or. The reason for the confidentiality is to prevent persons benefiting wrongly from prior knowledge. Those who are in possession of information relating to the Budget have a legal responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of the knowledge. It must not be disclosed to any person without a need to know in the course of his duties. Likewise that person would be under a legal obligation to preserve the confidentiality and honour bound not to use any information for personal advantage. </para>
            <para>To this requirement I am aware of three exceptions. </para>
            <para>The first is that a State may be informed of particular expenditure items contained in the Budget which affects that State and very often requires some contribution by the State towards the total expenditure. My recollection is that this has been done by letter which refers to the specific item and not to other aspects of the Budget. </para>
            <para>Secondly, there is the well-known practice of the &#34;lock-up&#34; of persons, mainly journalists, who have access to the Budget speech and attached documents in order that their commentary can be made contemporaneously with the Treasurer delivering his speech. Persons in the &#34;lock-up&#34; are not released until 8 o&#39;clock and undertake not to publish items in the Budget until it has actually been said by the Treasurer in the House. Arrangements are made for a &#34;lock-up&#34; in the States and the Budget speech and attached documents are sent to the Sub-Treasuries to conduct this process. Additional copies are available after 8 p.m. </para>
            <para>Thirdly, during the period of the last Government, it was customary for the Treasurer to give a briefing to the joint  parties on the contents of the Budget at 7.30 p.m., immediately followed by the Budget speech at 8 o&#39;clock. Arrangements were usually made to give the Leader of the Opposition a copy of the Budget at some time between 7 and 8 o &#39;clock immediately before the Budget &#39;s delivery. </para>
            <para>I am not aware of any occasion on which any person received a copy of the Budget speech before it was delivered at 8 o&#39;clock, otherwise than as I have mentioned. I have no recollection of authorising the Premiers to be provided with Budget papers before s o&#39;clock during my period as Treasurer. </para>

          <para class="block">It is clear beyond doubt that the Prime Minister&#39;s statement to the House yesterday in regard to the Budget information provided to the States was completely false. It is simply a further episode in the continuing chain of lies which the head of this Government has been prepared to perpetrate in this House. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the comments made on this matter by the Treasurer. Yesterday the Treasurer told this House that the leaking of Budget secrets to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> would facilitate trade union cooperation with the Government. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is more co-operation from the trade union movement because of the informed way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was able to articulate the ingredients of the Budget and the strategy into which it fitted; accordingly we were able to gain more support </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, this was a calculated trade-off by the Treasurer with the  President  of his own political Party. The Government decided to leak secret information to the head of the trade union movement in return for co-operation from that gentleman. It is an outrage for the Treasurer to seek to defend his position in this way. Why is it that the oil producers, the coal producers and the cigarette and beer manufacturers were not told of the Budget provisions relating to their spheres of interest, if the Treasurer is to go on in this reprehensible way? Why were the senior employers&#39; representatives not similarly informed? Why is it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was not subject to the lock-up that applied to journalists? It is clear beyond any doubt that the Treasurer colluded with the  President  of the Australian Labor Party in giving him secret information which was available to no other person and has never been available to any other person in Australian history. </para>

As the Treasurer is well aware, there are established precedents for this course of action in the Westminster system.

The Treasurer stands guilty on his own statement. On Monday night <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carleton</inline> asked the Treasurer, on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> whether he had told the Australian Council of Trade Unions before the Budget was presented.

          <para>In the United Kingdom the leaking of Budget information has entailed the most serious of consequences whenever it has occurred. I refer to the case of the British Colonial Secretary, James Henry Thomas, in 1936. The fact that large insurances had been taken out on Lloyds of London before the Budget that year pointed to a leaking of Budget secrets. A tribunal found that an unauthorised disclosure had been made by the Colonial Secretary to two of his friends. The Colonial Secretary took the traditional and only course of action open to him- he resigned from the Cabinet. More recently, as I have just mentioned, in 1947 there was the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hugh</inline> Dalton. The newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">London Star,</inline> was published on the afternoon before the Budget Speech with a forecast of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dalton</inline> was to inform the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dalton</inline> then took the honourable course of telling the House the next day that he had indicated to the lobby correspondent of the newspaper the subject matter contained in the Budget forecast. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dalton</inline> then offered his resignation to the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clement</inline> Attlee. The resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was consistent with the Westminster tradition and British practice. The resignation was accepted. </para>

              <para>-Mr Hayden, the Treasurer, as I have mentioned before, should resign in line with this precedent. He should resign because he is unable to front up to the facts of what has taken place. The deliberate leaking by the Treasurer of documents to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> provides very serious implications for those involved. I should mention here, because I have stressed that it gave the  President  of the Australian Labor Party the capacity to make financial gain, the closing times of the Australian stock exchanges. The eastern exchanges- Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane- close at 3 p.m. The Perth Stock Exchange closes at 4.45 p.m. eastern standard time. The London Stock Exchange opens at 7 p.m. eastern standard time- more than enough time for a person with prior Budget knowledge to make huge profits. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should also know, there are extensive dealings between Australia and London even when the markets are not open. It is not without reason that the Australian stock exchanges adhere to very strict principles in this regard. I quote a statement given to my office yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Valder, the  Chairman  of the Sydney Stock Exchange: </para>

            <para>It is a fundamental principle of stock exchange trading that the public be informed immediately and simultaneously of any relevant information. The stock exchange would be greatly concerned if information leaked in one quarter- and consequently not available to all parties- was used for financial advantage. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If the Government&#39;s legislation is any guide it allegedly shares that principle. I shall quote from clause 124 of the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A person shall not deal in any securities of a prescribed corporation if he is in possession of information that is not generally available . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The penalty prescribed for that offence is $10,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years. In the case of a corporation it is a fine not exceeding $50,000. There is no doubt whatever that the Treasurer&#39;s deliberate and direct action gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and a director of several commercial companies in this country- and through him to other people- an opportunity to make direct financial gain. The Opposition does not allege in this debate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> made personal financial gain. The point is, and the heavy emphasis is, that that opportunity was provided. Not only was opportunity for personal gain presented by the Treasurer&#39;s actions but also a capacity for trade union enterprises to benefit at the same time was directly available. </para>
          <para>The House is very much aware of the personal involvement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> in trade union business activities. The Opposition in no sense cavies at that fact in this debate. The information given to the  President  of the Australian Labor Party was also given, by virtue of the trade union movement&#39;s business activities, to one of Australia&#39;s significant commercial organisations. The royal commission has already made it plain that trade union business enterprises are in no sense incapable of dishonest practices. ACTUSolo Enterprises Pty Ltd, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is the  chairman  of directors, was censured by the royal commission for deliberately and knowingly misleading a Minister of the Crown. That is what is alleged by the royal commission; yet the same gentleman of course was directly involved, in an unprecedented fashion, in personal discussions with a member of the Minister&#39;s staff or with a member of the Treasury in receiving information many hours before that information was available to anyone else in this country. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer&#39;s action in leaking information to the managing director of a company which was subsequently indicted by the royal commission is clearly beyond excuse. I reiterate that it is of no consequence that profit or illegal gain may not have arisen. The point at issue here is that profit could have been made and that the Treasurer should resign because of that simple fact. If the Treasurer had stated before the Budget that a new procedure was to be adopted whereby certain people would be confidentially briefed and if that matter had been made the subject of open disclosure by the Treasurer, this censure motion may not have arisen. But the public and the Parliament have been told after the event. Why is it that the Treasurer allowed the statement to be made on the television program? Was it in fact that he was simply concerned that yet another expose and scandal would break if the information was not deliberately leaked by him on television that night? It is a further example of a government trying to close up the cupboard before further skeletons rattle out in relation to scandals time after time. </para>
          <para>The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was given this information might never have become public except for the Treasurer&#39;s inadvertent- I believe deliberate- admission on television. The Treasurer would do well to ask himself why the practice has been adopted that matters contained in the Budget should be confidential. This morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> in an editorial headed <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr Hayden</inline> was wrong&#39; summed up the position in the following way: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On August 20 Australian stock exchanges saw millions of dollars slashed from the capitalisation of coal stocks. </para>
            <para>Other companies, including market leader BHP, also suffered a decline in stock market prices. </para>
            <para>Anybody with prior knowledge of the Budget delivered at 8 o&#39;clock the previous night could have made themselves a killing on the stock market. </para>
            <para>To assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is a man of impeccable integrity, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> did yesterday, is to beg the question. </para>
            <para>The reason why budgets deserve security is not a matter of sentimental tradition nor anachronistic convention. It is simply that a Government&#39;s economic measures carry with them the potential for enormous shifts in personal fortunes and any government with an ounce of common sense has a vested interest in guarding itself from any hint of malpractice. </para>

It took 3 months of further inquiry to have the second Minister sacked. I think we can wait some days before the Prime Minister himself resigns.

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>it might come as some sort of surprise to Opposition members that I have managed to withstand the devastating onslaught of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> On balance I have concluded that the country would be better served if I, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the Government continue to stay in office. The alternatives are rather too grim to contemplate. I refer to the motion which has been moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. He said that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the House. I think that that is pre-supposing the outcome of the expression of opinion in this House. I do not want to pre-judge it, but I think that I will be able to persuade enough support to maintain the confidence in the Government of this House. I think that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has colossal cheek to come into the House and talk about improper behaviour against all established principles and practices. This country is grinding to a halt because of the improper behaviour of the Opposition in the Senate in conflict with all established principles and practices.  His  words ring with as much conviction as the discordant peal of a cracked bell. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me come to the main points that I want to make. The first and the most important one is that I volunteered the information that I had given a detailed briefing of the contents of the Budget and of the strategy behind the Budget in terms of overall economic management- that I had volunteered that information in response to a question by a television interviewer on Monday night. If I had had an equally challenging and intelligent question from the Opposition in this House earlier, I would have volunteered the same sort of information. It is no fault of mine or the interviewer that the interviewer happened to be the first to have the intelligence to ask me this question. </para>
          <para>Let me come to the pith of the reason for my arranging this detailed briefing of the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The key element was wage restraint. The key element still is wage restraint in terms of the economic management of this country. It would have been easy for that Budget to have been misunderstood and being misunderstood, to have been misrepresented as an anti-worker Budget. It proposed increases in the prices of cigarettes, tobacco, beer and petrol and at the same time proposed a substantial reduction in company taxation. It would have been easy to have misrepresented that situation as a case where the worker paid for an easing of the tax burden of private corporations. Of course that was not the situation at all. In fact workers will be considerably better off as a result of the provisions of that Budget. The workers will be considerably better off as a result of the redistribution of benefits for which this Government has been responsible. Medibank alone represents an improvement of between $2 and $3 a week in the pay packets of wage earners- a tax free improvement in their spending power. We ought to bear in mind, as an aside, that the Opposition proposes to impose a levy on the community to pay for Medibank. This is an amazing turnabout on the part of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>There were proposals in the Budget to introduce a new pay-as-you-earn income tax scheme- a complex scheme in itself, but a very worthy and important one. At the same time, there were no proposals for tax indexation. In those circumstances, it would have been easy to have had the whole concept, strategy and pitch of the Budget misrepresented and, accordingly, for the Government to have lost that crucial support from wage earners in the community. There can be no doubt that the steps that I took were outstandingly successful. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition cares to resort to quoting newspaper editorials, let me quote the editorial in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>And adverse reaction from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> would certainly have made the Government&#39;s task much more difficult, if not impossible. In the event, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> got largely the reaction he wanted. The briefing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> whether a break with tradition or not, was a legitimate action for the Treasurer to have taken. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So, if it is a case of quoting newspaper editorials, there is a vote in favour of the action I took. </para>
          <para>Let us weigh up the issues before us. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> did persuade widespread support in the community by the action he took. I was confident that the action I took would be justified and that the integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> would guarantee the secrecy which I asked him to guarantee before I would arrange any such briefing. He has a record in public office as a member of the Reserve Bank Board. I recited yesterday the long list of decisions in which he was involved. He has been involved in most of the issues which have been discussed. These are issues in respect of which he, if he were a man lacking in integrity, could have misused that information or passed it on to some other person in order to make a colossal windfall gain. That could be done with respect to a variation in the exchange rate or a movement in interest rates. All of these issues represent an opportunity for someone who is so disposed to make an illegal windfall gain either as an individual or as a member of a corporation. </para>
          <para>A number of aspersions have been made against the character and integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and other people by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition here this morning. But let the Opposition produce one tittle of evidence to support these wild, extravagant, irresponsible allegations which its members are so prone to make in the course of their desperate grasp for power and their desperate efforts to justify the unprecedented action which they have taken and which is bringing this country to a halt. If it is simply a matter of a person&#39;s having a business affiliation immediately casting doubt on himself if he is privy to confidential public decision making whereby, if he were so disposed, he could make significant personal gain, let us look at some of the people who are on the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline></para>
          <para>The first person I mention is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn, K.B.E., C.M.G. He is the managing director of Gunn Development Pty Ltd. He is a director of Gunn Rural Management Pty Ltd. He is the  chairman  of Eagle Corporation Ltd, a director of Roth mans of Pall Mall Australia Ltd, a director of Walter Reid and Co. Ltd and a director of Graz cos Co-operative Ltd. There would be many instances in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn, if he wished, could misuse the type of information to which he becomes privy as a member of the Reserve Bank Board and could stand to gain either as an office bearer in those companies or as an individual. There is no evidence that he has done so. There is no evidence that any other member of the Reserve Bank Board has done so. I mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hibberd, Mr Jackson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Pettingell- all estimable people, all people of integrity, all people who have discharged their functions in public office properly, as has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> There is no doubt that the efforts to invest in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> the confidences of the Budget strategy were made for one purpose alone; that is, in the national interest to garner support for wage restraint and to ensure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was fully briefed and could accordingly project an accurate report of the purposes of the Budget, the strategy which was involved and in the course of this the advantages which lay in it for workers in the community. </para>
          <para>In my Budget Speech I stressed at page 4 the significance of wages policy. I said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Budget is one major instrument of economic policy. Another major policy area concerns the growth in wages and salaries. </para>
            <para>If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases, the productive capacity of the economy will decline and we shall all eventually be worse off. </para>
            <para>It is too early yet to determine whether wage indexation will succeed in dampening the recent wage-price spiral. The signs are mixed. The Government intends to do what it can to make indexation work. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But if I expressed concern about the need for restraint on the wage push front the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> excelled me many times over. He mentioned in about as many pages 8 times the need for the exercise of wage restraint. At page 5 1 9 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he said:  ... the explosion of wage and salary demands which have depressed company profits to the point where there are no longer sufficient funds to expand production and investment and create jobs. </para>
          <para class="block">At page 525 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard he</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Two important objectives would be advanced by our income tax proposals. The first is incomes restraint. Unless a policy of incomes restraint is successfully pursued, the damaging rise of costs throughout Australia will continue. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He shared my concern. It is a crucial feature of economic management at the present time. But then he went on with bitter irony in the light of the behaviour of Opposition spokesmen to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We would expect the  President  of the ACTU - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline>of course  and the ACTU and the trade union leadership to play a national role in arguing for wage and salary restraint in the interests both of their members and all Australians. </para>
          <para class="block">This morning the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition goes on to cast imputations on the integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> to imply strongly that he has the capacity to be a crook if he is invested with any public responsibility. These are the people opposite who are proposing that there should be cooperation between the  President  of the ACTU, the ACTU, the more than 100 trade unions affiliated with the ACTU, the more than 1.6 million workers in unions affiliated with the ACTU and then go on to indulge in this offensive behaviour. </para>
          <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition suggested that we should rely on the examples of precedents in the Westminster system in discussing this matter this morning. This is a rather remarkable proposition for him to put. When it suits members of the Opposition they resort to examples of precedent from the United Kingdom. They neglect to mention, however, that no House of Lords would ever reject a budget or delay it and indeed would not have the capacity to do so as the Opposition is doing at the present time in the Senate. But there is no analogy between the instances cited- that of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Dalton</inline> in 1947 or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> in 1936. In both cases there was premature public disclosure and in both cases there was an opportunity for personal gain for individuals. In <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Dalton</inline> &#39;s case there was no evidence that the premature disclosure, which arose from a kerbside comment to a journalist shortly before he delivered his Budget speech and resulted in details of the Budget appearing in the papers while he was delivering his speech, had enabled any personal gain to be made. There is no doubt at all that in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> in 1 936 personal gain was derived. </para>
          <para>But the question is why has this matter suddenly erupted in the Parliament at a time when the Parliament is in the grip of constitutional crisis, at a time when the Opposition has a special visitor- a privileged visitor; its star performer in Australia- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> The reason is very simple, of course. The Opposition wants to shift the focus of public attention. It wants to blur the spotlight on its ace performer&#39;s activity in the community. The Leader of the Opposition has made threats to the Government that it is his intention to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> appear before the Senate, or is it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr &#39;Kilani&#39;</inline> as the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> says in his difficult and painful diction? It will have the opportunity now that the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> has extended for a week the visa of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> He can appear before the Senate. It is a matter for the initiative of the Opposition to ensure that he does appear and gives full details of whatever it is that the Opposition wants to produce. In the meantime, while the Opposition is trying to evade the real issues which are convulsing this country- the constitutional crisis and while the loans affair drags on in its wearisome and uninformative way, the only casualties of the Opposition&#39;s irresponsible behaviour are the ard ours of people crushed by the false innuendoes of the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the loss of economic momentum which this nation is suffering. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the instances of false innuendo and the besmirching of the character of the Deputy Prime Minister of the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> one of the most trusted and respected members of this Parliament, by the Leader of the Opposition, the man who speaks about integrity in government and proper codes of conduct, the man who talks of others as being deceitful. I regale the House again with his statement in this place on 16 October. He was talking about a document allegedly leaked to him, a certain confidential Treasury document leaked to the Opposition. Referring to the Prime Minister, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Let me tell him that it is somebody who is sitting on the front bench at this moment. The person who made the document available did so because he believes that in the national interest the Opposition ought to have that information. He did it because he is a worthy person. But the Prime Minister needs to know whether he can feel confidence in the activities of all his Ministers. Would he believe that that matter would enable trust between himself and his colleagues? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If the Leader of the Opposition said that in a court dealing with petty police offences he would be charged with perjury. Can the nation have a Prime Minister or a claimant for the office of Prime Minister who would perjure his way to the Lodge? </para>

              <para>- I withdraw it. As the House well knows, it was the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition who produced a letter which I sent to the Prime Minister, a letter which went into several departments in the course of going to the Prime Minister, a letter to which he had no right and no lawful access. The remarkable part about that document was that it was a very simple machinery matter. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, who is the expert in economic affairs in the Opposition ranks- the supreme expert bar the right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)-</inline> misunderstood the significance of the document. He alleged that we had forgotten to include in the Budget costings which were referred to in that little letter. How can the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition claim any credibility as an alternative economic manager of the affairs of this nation if he did not understand that simple little fundamental of public finance? </para>

          <para>I mentioned the falsification of evidence in the Parliament. We remember how the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition on 21 October put a question to the Prime Minister based on a newspaper article wherein <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> the Opposition&#39;s star performer, the man whom it wishes would go away at the present time, had asserted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tim</inline> Anderson had said that he had made a phone call to the Prime Minister. In the same newspaper article <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> denied that any such phone call had been made. But it never discouraged the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition from making a completely false allegation in the Parliament. If the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in their desperate bid for power are prepared to produce falsified evidence in this Parliament, are prepared to use doctored statements, are prepared to use stolen documents, are prepared to be blatantly dishonest, how can they be taken seriously as leaders of the country&#39;s affairs? </para>
          <para>Now I come to the most startling instance of all, of the manufacture of evidence by the Opposition. I refer to the instance which occurred yesterday. I regret to say that it affects a man for whom I had developed a great deal of personal respect until yesterday- the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> I wish to quote from the transcript of an early afternoon interview which the honourable member gave after detailed consideration of the Khemlani documents, as we can call them. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I can only say that there is no direct evidence in the documents I saw which involve the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para class="block">He said later: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">But when he returned to Canberra and consulted with the Leader of the Opposition he released what was termed a considered statement, or a more considered one. The statement was reported as follows: ... his inspection of the Khemlani documents which he had seen yesterday strongly supported the continuing involvement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and his Government in obtaining overseas loans after May last and as late as September. </para>
          <para class="block">Let us see how the Australian Broadcasting Commission- and I know that the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> will assert that this is further clear evidence of communist infiltration in the Commission&#39;s ranks- reported the story in the Press statement which it sent from Canberra: </para>

            <para>It&#39;s fair to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott&#39;s</inline> assertion that the Prime Minister wasn&#39;t implicated in the Khemlani papers caught the Opposition leadership by surprise. </para>

          <para class="block">So the honourable member for Wentworth returned to Canberra for what the Chinese- or should I say the mainland Chinese because we are always careful how we say this, are we not gently call thought rectification. He came back for ideological reindoctrination </para>
          <para>I challenge the Opposition- and I say this quite calmly with complete restraint: Present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> before the Senate now; stop this farce. You have held up the affairs of the country this long. You are the people who have encouraged this man. You are the people who are presenting a crisis to the social and economic fabric of this nation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> appears before the Senate there will be interesting questions which can be posed to him, in the friendliest way possible of course. For instance, how does he manage to afford his lifestyle in Australia? According to one newspaper, when he was last here a few weeks ago he stayed in a $300 a day penthouse at the Hilton. How does he afford his expensive jetting? What about the high speed car chases but then they are at taxpayers&#39; expense. Although the country is going broke because of the irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, who speaks about responsible behaviour much as people speak about bad breath or getting rid of communism or whatever it is, is able to waste the taxpayers&#39; money on this foolish charade of a high speed car chase in a Commonwealth car around Canberra. </para>
          <para>Cameron Forbes raised some interesting questions about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> in view of the high life style that he has become accustomed to in Australia. Cameron Forbes, in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 16 October, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline>is listed as an undischarged bankrupt under the name Birth Hassaram. In a December 1971 hearing Birth Hassaram put his debts at &#163;Stg10,060. The Assistant Official Receiver claimed the figure was an under-estimate. ... In 1964 his company was wound up with debts of &#163;Stg39,000. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">More recently I read in the newspapers that his associations with Palatal and Sons had been sundered. It would be very interesting to know how this happy coincidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s return appearance in Australia was orchestrated and, more importantly, how the very significant costs have been met. The fact is that the Opposition&#39;s star witness is now its major liability. As the honourable member for Wentworth said: &#39;There is no direct evidence in the documents I saw which involves the Prime Minister&#39;. The nation is increasingly disenchanted with the desperate efforts of desperate men in the Opposition who have endeavoured to pave their way to government with dishonesty. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition claims that he is concerned as much about the forms as about what is done; yet he perverts every canon of proper parliamentary conduct. He seeks to short circuit the democratic process and diminishes respect for the institution of Parliament. What sort of principles does he really espouse? What sort of unswerving commitment does he have to the principles which he has enunciated publicly? There can be no better example than his statement of 6 February 1975. 1 would like honourable members to listen to this because it will endure in history. He said: </para>

            <para>Bill Snedden has my full support. I repeat . . . I support the elected leader of the Liberal Party.

The issue was decided in November. </para>

          <para>But perhaps the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has the last word on the principles of the Leader of the Opposition. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> on 21 February 1972, with unusual insight for him, the honourable member for Moreton said, with reference to the undoing of the former Prime Minister of a former Liberal Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton:</inline></para>

          <para class="block">The cosmetic of time may or may not hide the blemish of the way in which the honourable member for Moreton was able to moralise on that occasion. More recently he has moralised on proper conduct for the Senate. Then, realising the determination of the Leader of the Opposition in casting aside proper conduct in the face of constitutional convention established over 75 years, the honourable member for Moreton jumped on the bandwagon because there was a purse of profit, as a possible Minister of the Crown, to be picked up there. The Leader of the Opposition has shown himself to be without conscience or honour in his ambitious drive for power. In this place we are all judged by our actions. The Leader of the Opposition stands condemned for the dishonest way in which he has performed in his overweening drive to grab power at any price. </para>
          <para>The real issue in this country at the present time is the constitutional confrontation which has been thrown up by the Opposition in the Senate and which, in its own way, is as powerful, as significant and as historically important as the confrontation between the House of Commons and the House of Lords over the Parliament Bill in 1911. Instead of resolving this issue, instead of facing up to the reality that the irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition is bringing this country to a halt, is precipitating a situation of social and economic crisis, the Opposition spends its time threshing about like a whale that has been beached, looking for some sort of escape from the trap that it has set for itself. There is not a tittle of justification for the Opposition&#39;s distressing the nation any further. There is not a tittle of support for the phoney proposition which has been moved by the Opposition this morning. It is merely a camouflage effort to avoid the extensive humiliation that it is experiencing because its star performance, its visiting guest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> has let it down so badly. It is not the intention of the Prime Minister, the Government or myself to resign as a result of this motion. I think the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nicholls)</inline> would agree with me that we ought to test that assertion without delay. </para>

            <para>-Order! The honourable gentleman is not in order in raising a matter the day afterwards on the basis of a written record. There are certain differences between actual proceedings in the House and a written record, and one is that a written record must have a sequence which is contained on paper. The occurrences in the House have to take place verbally and they can take place practically simultaneously, but they cannot be so listed. A point of order arising out of matters of that nature must be taken at the time and not on the next day of sitting or at some subsequent time. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>That the Bills be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>These Bills now before the House, are in every respect similar to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1975-76 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1975-76 which were presented by me to the House on the occasion of the Budget on 19 August and again on 22 October 1975 following the unprecedented step of their deferral in the Senate on 1 6 October 1975. The details of the proposed expenditures were referred to in my second reading speeches on those previous occasions and I do not think it is necessary to restate them here. </para>
          <para>In my Budget Speech, I outlined the economic policy background to the Government&#39;s Budget proposals and announced at some length what those proposals were. On 22 October I reaffirmed the Government&#39;s economic policy as reflected in those Bills, in this House. On both occasions the House has passed these important money Bills. The matters contained in them have been debated at length both here and in the Senate. Both honourable members here and senators have had adequate opportunity to examine exhaustively the expenditure proposals they contain. </para>
          <para>The Bills I have now introduced, again seek the appropriation of $6,976, 1 1 9,000 in Bill No. 1 and $2,268,980,000 in Bill No. 2 for the services of the Government for the financial year ending 30 June 1976. The wide variety of expenditures for which appropriation is sought is set out in detail in the Second Schedule of each Bill. They cover matters such as: Salary and wages for public servants and other employees of departments and of statutory authorities; student assistance programs; health services, including amounts for the operation of the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory hospitals; employment training and assistance and expenditure on projects for the relief of unemployment; maintenance of Australian representation abroad; payments to international organisations; aid programs; grants for aged persons homes and hostels; defence services and the reconstruction of Darwin. </para>
          <para>In answers to questions in this House my colleagues have pointed out the consequences in terms of personal hardship and disruption- which continual deferral of these Bills will produce. In the circumstances therefore I again plead - <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Once again I make a plea to the Opposition that it draw back from the brink of economic crisis to which it is pushing this country. One does not like stressing too much the disastrous consequences- &#39;disastrous&#39; is not too strong a word to use in these circumstances which undoubtedly will flow from the chain of events which the Opposition has set in action by its behaviour in the Senate. If the momentum of that chain of events is to continue, I am afraid that many innocent people in the Australian community are going to be severely disadvantaged. There will be inflicted upon some of them the most severe forms of personal discomfort and disadvantage. </para>
          <para>It is curious to me that an Opposition which proclaims outside this place that at least in some general or nominal way it represents primary industry and the corporate sector of the economy should take actions which will have the effect of severely disadvantaging both the primary industry sector and the corporate sector of the economy. Like other members in this Parliament I was present in Parliament last week at question time, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, when several of my ministerial colleagues pointed out to the Parliament the unpleasant consequences that are now in train. I am not suggesting that they may arise; they are now in train. We are moving inexorably towards a point where a severe crunch will be imposed on the community. </para>
          <para>I understand that the next  speaker  in this debate is to be the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and I want to put a serious question to him. I ask him, in all candour, how he can possibly support the irresponsible behaviour of his colleagues in the Senate when he knows that primary industry is going to be so greatly disadvantaged. The last Minister for Northern Australia and present Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> pointed out, when Acting Minister for Agriculture, that the beef export industry alone will come to a complete halt if there is not a flow of funds with the authority of Parliament. That flow of funds can occur only if the Senate desists from its behaviour. Why is Queensland, the most important beef producing State in Australia, to be disadvantaged in this way? What sort of opposition- or resentment if one likes to put it in a more positive sense- is it that the National Country Party has suddenly developed towards the State of Queensland that it wants to see the beef industry there brought to its knees? Literally thousands of people are dependent on the industry. I am speaking not just of the producers but of the processors and the people who service the industry or service those who work in the industry in one way or another in many large centres in Queensland. What is it in the mind of the National Country Party that has suddenly driven it to this late summer madness that it wants to bring the beef export industry throughout Australia but especially in Queensland to a complete halt? </para>
          <para>Overall the economic effects are going to be quite severe. There is evidence that significant sectors of the economy have wound down. In some cases they have wound down their level of activity in a surprisingly rapid manner. The service sector, which I mentioned in this Parliament when introducing these Bills on a previous occasion, is already showing signs of this wind down. Theatres, restaurants and other places of amusement are finding that there is almost a collapse in the level of activity in their sector. This is important because this sector gives a lead to the flow on effects that are going to seep throughout the whole of the Australian economy. Consumers are suspending spending decisions. White goods are not moving from the floors of retail outlets as rapidly as they had been. This sets in effect a chain of consequences. Stocks which have been produced in expectation of a given level of activity in fact will not be sold. They will accumulate in the warehouse and we will get back to the problem of mounting inventories. In turn this impairs the level of optimism on the part of businessmen who must make investment decisions. They will not invest. Already they are suspending their investment decisions. </para>

              <para>-As the honourable member for Barton has pointed out, Christmas orders have been suspended. It could be a very grim Christmas for Australia. It will be an extremely grim one unless the Opposition in the Senate desists in its unconstitutional irresponsible behaviour which can bring the Australian economy to its knees. We are in an unprecedented situation in which there is confrontation between the 2 Houses of Parliament. I argue, as I have argued many times before with complete justification, that the House of Representatives is the seat of government. There is only one government in the country, not two. There are not 2 chambers of government. There are not 2 Prime Ministers, only one. The Government is seated in this House of the Parliament. This is the House of the Parliament which is elected by popular franchise and which is more democratically representative of the 2 Houses. </para>

          <para>The curious election arrangements for the Senate are such that regardless of the size of a State in terms of population the same number of senators are elected for each State. A small State such as Tasmania has the same number of senators as New South Wales which is the largest State in terms of population. In turn this leads to a distortion of democratic representation in the other House- in the Senate. In the last election this </para>
          <para class="block">Government obtained 200 000 votes more than the combined votes of all of its opponents in the Senate. In spite of that it did not get a majority in the Senate. I mention this to give a clear indication of the in supportability of any assertion that the Senate is a democratically representative House. </para>
          <para>It is frequently asserted that the Senate is the States House, but long ago it ceased being the protector of the States and the representative of the smaller States. Indeed it was because the architects of the Constitution were keen to ensure that the small States had adequate representation and protection of their interests that the Senate was conceived in its present form, with its present system of representation. But if ever the Senate was the States House it certainly long ago ceased being such. The people in the Senate who are impeding the flow of business- the hostile Liberal and National Country Party senators are acting not according to the States&#39; interests but according to the stern discipline of the Liberal and Country Parties. In many cases Liberal and Country Party senators are behaving contrary to their own principles and beliefs. More importantly, they are behaving contrary to their publicly stated position in terms of the role of the Senate in its handling of money Bills such as the Appropriation Bills. </para>
          <para>Some time ago the Minister for Labor and Immigration mentioned that a projection of unemployment for the January period suggested that the maximum level would be about 400 000. That would be the worst of the 3 usual categories of economic projects- the best, the worst and the intermediate categories. The worst projection is about 400 000 unemployed in that period. Already that projection is in error. Even now, if the Opposition draws back from the unpleasant activity which it has initiated in the Senate, the level of unemployment in January and February will be much higher. Because of their behaviour in the Senate Opposition members alone will be responsible. They will be the guilty people who will bring about that position. One tends to talk about unemployment because it is a more dramatic statistic in terms of measuring the level of economic activity, but the level of unemployment is only one indicator of the level of activity and in itself is an indicator of a reduction in activity in other sectors of the economy. If unemployment were to mount to that level, quite clearly the level of retail sales- <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>

I am torn between 2 objectives: On the one hand to say the things I want to say, which will be helpful for the Government of course, and on the other hand to allow the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> to say the things he wants to say, which will be even more helpful for the Government, especially if the public hears from him and more especially if the Liberals listen to him- that is, if they can understand him. Before I received assistance from the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> I was pointing out that the course of conduct for which the Opposition is responsible in the Senate will lead to rather severe contractionary effects in the early new year, much worse than we could have anticipated even with the worst projections that we could have imagined. Even now, I repeat, if the Opposition draws back from the brink to which it has taken this country there will be a more severe crunch in the new year than we had anticipated. If it does not draw back, of course, it will be particularly severe. </para>

          <para>I suppose from an economic management point of view it is a sad storm that does not have some silver in its lining somewhere. The Opposition is concerned about the level of the deficit as the Opposition interprets it and the effects of economic management reflected in the Budget. It has been putting the point that the deficit will be considerably higher than the $2, 800m which we outlined in our Budget papers. In fact, we are holding expenditures steady, and accordingly if the deficit is larger than the $2, 800m which we had suggested- I for one hope that it will be larger because it will indicate that we are being much more successful than we had hoped for when we put the Budget together. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will recollect that the Budget projections, especially outlined in Budget Statement No. 2 of the papers attached to the Budget speech, indicated that we anticipated an increase in average weekly earnings of something like 22 per cent over the course of the year. For me this was a rather worrying projection but that is the way we saw the situation when we drew the projections together. There was a little hope that it could be a little lower than that with some luck. We have been even more successful than we had anticipated. At this point we suspect on our projections that the rate of increase in average weekly earnings could be as low as 17 per cent. It could even be lower if we have even more success than we had anticipated. I expect that it is fair enough to make the comment here that the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>

              <para>-The Minister for Labor and Immigration deserves commendation for the effective way in which he has encouraged wage restraint to be exercised by the industrial movement. Of course in doing this- to take up the point of the interjection- he is improving on a base which was well established and which was being developed successfully by his predecessor the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> who has the great distinction of having the new trade union college named after him. Perhaps the Leader of the National Country Party might like to reflect that the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who is the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs, is held in such high esteem by the trade union movement that it spontaneously sought that the college should be named after him. In any case, as I was saying, the rate of increase in average weekly earnings has eased appreciably. We are having significant success on that front. Given the general economic climate in which we expected to be working, revenue collections will be less than expected and expenditure is being held steady. Clearly this means that the deficit in money terms may be larger than we outlined in the Budget. </para>

              <para>- We are now in the curious situation that, because the economic circumstances have changed dramatically but not pleasantly or desirably, we could have a considerably lower deficit than would have occurred with the normal set of circumstances in which otherwise we would have been working. This arises very simply. At present revenue collections are proceeding, with company tax collections proceeding at the 45 per cent rate, not the 42 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent rate we proposed; but expenditure is being cut back quite significantly. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I will give one small illustration of this. I have available to me a spending authority called the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. This is a spending authority which allows me to meet the cost of unexpected items- expenditure liabilities which might crop up in the course of the year or which were not foreseen at the time the Budget was presented. We are maintaining the Public Service. It is absolutely essential that the community services be maintained. They are crucial to the operation of our social framework. I am ensuring that the money available to me in the Treasurer&#39;s Advance is used to pay the salaries of the public servants. We have to keep the Public Service functioning. An unfortunate effect of this situation is that a program such as the Regional Employment Development Program can no longer have expenses met from the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. Because of the obstructionism of the Opposition in the Senate we cannot get the money out to the local authority areas. Rural areas are amongst the most affected areas, and one wonders what it is that has caused the sudden paranoid aversion on the part of the National Country Party to rural areas. It is about to destroy the beef export industry. It seems as though it is determined also to undermine the financial viability of local authorities, especially rural local authorities. One can see a severe crunch really stifling the activity of rural local government administration. </para>
          <para>These are some of the problems which are cropping up; but, as I say, we are cutting back on expenditure. It is conceivable if the present crisis continues much longer that, as my friend the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> has pointed out, we may provide members of Parliament with an airline ticket to Canberra but not be able to provide them one to leave Canberra until the Appropriation Bills are passed. These are only small instances of the sorts of problems we have. Of course, some National Country Party members have one amazing capacity. Their intellectual vitality does not display itself in most areas, but when it comes to tax avoidance they are peculiarly successful. With the money they are able to save through tax avoidance, they may be able to afford their fares out of Canberra; but not many other people will be able to do this. </para>
          <para>The most unfortunate aspect of the present situation is that the Opposition which so often proclaims- obviously on its performance nominally proclaims- a concern about convention, about the forms, about precedent and about following proper procedures is the first, when it suits it, to abuse those conventions, those forms, those procedures and those precedents. No one has corrupted constitutional convention more than it has. It operates happily with a stacked Senate. If it were not for the fact that the Senate has been stacked by the dishonest behaviour of Liberal-Country Party governments in Queensland and New South Wales the Opposition would not be able to get away with its present fiction whereby it argues that it is not rejecting the Appropriation Bills but merely delaying or deferring them. Of course that is a totally dishonest tactic but it is bred of necessity for the Opposition. It knows that it is in no position to move confidently for the rejection of the Appropriation Bills in the Senate because a few Liberal senators have indicated that they would not be prepared to vote for the blockage of the Appropriation Bills, that is, to reject them. </para>

              <para>- I would have thought that the honourable member for Griffith would be vitally concerned about these issues. A lot of people in his electorate will feel the crunch personally shopkeepers who will find that spending is cut back, people in small retail stores, people concerned with consumer durables, small enterprises and public servants. He shows a distressing degree of indifference about those people. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Before the call for a quorum I was drawing the attention of the House to the well known dereliction of electorate responsibility on the part of the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> towards his constituents. He has the propensity to make the odd speech here and to talk for the people back home, as it were, but he does so with no ring of conviction and no ring of sincerity. </para>

            <para>- After the shameful performance of this morning when the Government tried to gag every  speaker  on the Opposition side of the House, I am glad to see that the Government&#39;s conscience is pricked. It is willing to allow at least a few minutes for me to speak. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> tried to filibuster out the whole of the time. But after a situation in which 2 members of this House were named and there was a complete uproar, I think the Government realised that the backlash from the Australian public to this jackboot type of tactic would be quite disastrous. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Treasurer is certainly having a bad day. Not only has his performance been rather pathetic, but he has been exposed for one of the greatest improprieties that any Minister of the Crown could commit, that is, breaching the trust that is placed in him as the Treasurer of this country to keep confidential the secrets of a Budget. They are secrets which, if allowed to get into unmerciful hands, could allow a person to make quite a fortune. Yet this Treasurer was prepared to bow to one of the political powers that is his master and that is the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He was endeavouring to curry favour where the power of the Australian Labor Party lies. </para>
          <para>It is not the first time that we have seen this rather young, ambitious man hitch himself to power irrespective of what the consequences are for some of his colleagues round him. We saw the way in which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> stabbed the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Lalor, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> in the back. When the honourable member for Lalor made a speech of explanation in this House what came out very clearly was that the present Treasurer disowned him, was disloyal to him, and was willing to sign on with the Prime Minister in his tactics to get rid of the honourable member. Yet these back benchers of the Labor Party are prepared to sit back while this unscrupulous Prime Minister can manipulate any front bencher for his own ends- to protect himself and to cover up for his own gross vanity and for his massive ego. The Treasurer was part of this operation. No man has been more loyal to the Labor Party than the honourable member for Lalor. I have viciously disagreed with him but I have said on a number of occasions that I have respected his honesty and his integrity. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Franklin is a deserter, too. He will rubbish the honourable member for Lalor. That is typical of him. The honourable member for Franklin will stand up for none of his colleagues. He sits beside the honourable member for Lalor in the back of the House but he will desert the honourable member if it is popular with his leader to do so. That is the sort of honourable member we have on that side of the House. They have no gumption and no stamina: It does not matter if honourable members opposite want to be sycophants or puppets standing back behind their Prime Minister. We are going to expose the Prime Minister to the Australian public. If Government supporters want him to smash their party then they should just let him be because we know where he is leading them. Every Government supporter knows it. They know that it is a fact that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> said in their Party room a few weeks ago that every major crisis that has been caused, has been caused by the Prime Minister himself. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister&#39;s word cannot be taken in this House. The honourable member for Lalor said on television the other night that the Prime Minister had lied. The Prime Minister, in speaking to the Appropriation Bills yesterday, presented the situation dishonestly. It was a phoney presentation because what he said was that the Senate was using its power to change the government. He was going to smash the authority of the Senate because it was doing this. </para>

              <para>-He ratted on the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> so one can imagine his being a little bit sensitive. What I like about members of the Labor Party is their keenness to get into the Ministry. They do not care who they rubbish in the process. If you are left behind like a corpse in the Labor Party, your colleagues will certainly tread over the top of you. What we have now is a situation in which the Prime Minister is deliberately misrepresenting this position and the authority of the Senate. The Senate has the right to reject or to block a financial measure. The effects are the same- it makes government unworkable. If that action has been taken by the Senate then any self-respecting Prime Minister would automatically go to the people either to get confirmation or to be rejected. That is what this Government will not face up to. The Senate is not changing the Government. What the Senate is doing is giving the Australian people- our masters- the opportunity of deciding who should continue to run this country. </para>

          <para>The Senate believes that this is a bad Government, that it is a Government not worthy of supporting any longer. So it has blocked the passage of financial measures. Yet we have this Government dishonestly trying to present to the Australian people the belief that it is the Senate which is going to cause hardship to the Australian people. How wrong! If I could use an analogy, it is a bit like blaming a judge for the hardship that he causes to the family of a criminal whom he had sent to gaol. The Senate is acting in a way which is trying to protect the interests of the Australian people against a disreputable government- a government which for reprehensible reasons should be compelled to go back and face the Australian people. But the Government is not prepared to do that. It is prepared to let finance run down. It is prepared to gamble with people and their jobs and to see those people go out of work. </para>

              <para>- It will lose in the long run because it will smash completely the whole Labor Party and its reputation for years to come. Government supporters stand there blindly and are led along by this Prime Minister who has already disowned two of their Ministers and said that those Ministers deceived this Parliament and lied to it. Yet on exactly the same grounds that he has sacked them on, he is not prepared to be judged himself. This is the situation that we face. Now what is the Government trying to do? It is obvious that the Prime Minister is playing the last card in the pack; he is trying to get a halfSenate election. It is the only action- a desperate action- that he can take at this stage. He would have to have a whole series of circumstances going for him to give him the chance of being able to control the Senate. The Governor-General must be aware that it is a long shot for the Prime Minister to be able to get control of the Senate by a half-Senate election. There is only one way in which this issue can be solved and that is by the legal constitutional and logical way- an election of this House. If the Prime Minister wants to do so, he could have a half-Senate election at the same time which I believe is normal and proper or, if he has the courage, he could have a double dissolution. The Prime Minister has all the grounds to seek a double dissolution. But no, he is going to try to bulldoze his way through. He does not care whether people lose their jobs. If people are put out of work, the cause will be the actions of the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para>We have only to observe the way in which the Government is managing its fear tactics. Its strategy is to continue to force its vicious vendetta against country people. It claims that meat workers will be put out of work and that the cattle industry will not be able to continue. Look, the Australian people are seeing through the Prime Minister. How much more can he be exposed than he was by the honourable member for Lalor who publicly called him a liar. I invite Government members to answer that charge. They have disowned this man who has done more for the Labor Party in the last decade than any other man, other than the Prime Minister. At least the honourable member for Lalor is respected right throughout the Labor movement. But Labor members are prepared to disown him because they are not game to stand up to the man who is leading them to disaster and destruction. That is what is happening. The Prime Minister will not even live up to his own words. We know that time and time again in the past he said that if a financial measure were to be rejected in the Senate there should be an election. </para>

              <para>-He said that indisputably on numerous occasions. The honourable member who is interjecting talks about rejection. The Government makes a lot about the question of rejection. What is the difference as far as the management of the Government is concerned between blocking such a Bill and rejecting it? There is no difference at all. But we are wise enough to know how unscrupulous this Prime Minister is and how far he will use such a rejection. He does not care at this stage because he has nothing to lose. He can harm the economy and harm the people, hoping that he can build up a reaction throughout the community which somehow or other may get him last minute support. Well, we are not going to allow the Prime Minister to have the pleasure of seeing us reject a financial measure and thus allow him to run the economy down while an election takes place. We have said quite clearly that as soon as the Prime Minister is prepared to announce the date of a general election the financial measures will go through. The Budget will be passed. There will be no hardship at all for anybody in this country. </para>

            <para>-The second reading debate on these Bills has been totally aborted because the Government has refused to present to the Parliament in a fit and adequate form one of the most significant of the measures that lie before the Australian people. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has demonstrated repeatedly that he has little regard for the truth in this Parliament, even in the presentation of these Appropriation Bills. We have seen in replies given to the Parliament at question time the difference between the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and the Prime Minister as to just what information was passed to the Premiers. The Prime Minister told us that the whole Budget had been passed to the Premiers. From the Treasurer we heard that perhaps it was not the whole Budget. The truth, of course, is that, as in past instances, prior to the presentation of the Appropriation Bills in this House only provisions relating to States grants were passed to the Premiers. That is a perfectly appropriate course. We have had the Prime Minister, however, alleging that that is not so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We also have circumstances in which both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have condoned the detail of this Budget, the one with which we are now dealing, being revealed to those who are outside the Parliament, those who are not subject to the constraints that are imposed on members of Parliament. We have the deplorable instance of one such man- the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and a director of 2 major public companies- being put in a position where, had he wished, he could have taken advantage of that prior information. These are all serious breaches of parliamentary tradition and practice. These Bills, in their presentation - </para>

              <para>- The power struggle is not between the other chamber and this chamber. The power struggle is about whether democracy itself will survive. The whole of the fabric of democracy has been subordinated by a government which, in the premature disclosure of Budget secrets to the  President  of the ALP, has disclosed to the Australian people where the real power in the country is being held. It is not the Parliament , that controls the Labor Party; it is the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the trade union movement. The premature disclosure of the most vital financial secrets of the country to the  President  of the ALP in a totally unprecedented and reprehensible manner demonstrates totally the way in which the ALP has sold its soul to an organisation outside the Parliament. The power struggle in Canberra is not just about the survival of the Whitlam Government. It is not a conflict between the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is about whether the Australian people, the Australian electorate, are to be given a chance to exercise a vote. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It is important, in examining the tyrannical exercise of the power of this present Government with its temporary majority to consider the sacking of the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> the sacking of the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> all the circumstances of their dismissal, the involvement of the Government in the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd oil deal and the circumstances of the premature disclosure of details of the Budget. The whole of the climate of what this Government is doing is totally reprehensible; yet now it is saying: &#39;But really it is the Opposition that is creating uncertainty in the electorate&#39;. We have had the recitation by successive Ministers of what might happen. Let every member of the Government be aware that we are quite prepared, because we have deferred the Budget, to reconstitute it the moment a date for a general election is set. There is no reason for anybody in the Australian community to be apprehensive about what is happening as a result of the Budget being deferred. We are totally against circumstances in which people are deprived of benefits they should receive because the Government will not answer to the people. Just where we are going depends on the Australian electorate being the people who ultimately determine what happens and where we go. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister claimed in a speech that 139 appropriation Bills passed the Senate when the government did not have a majority in the Senate. Surely that of itself demonstrates that the Senate is acting responsibly. He did not honestly explain, of course, that in respect of the passage of those 139 Bills the ALP Opposition was the minority Party with the Democratic Labor Party holding the balance of power. The point of it all of course is that the ALP has one standard of behaviour when it is in a position to take advantage of breaches of convention, but it has a totally different standard of behaviour when it thinks that it might in some way be affected. Make no mistake about it: Every one of those scared men on the other side of the House is running from the electorate. They are afraid to go to the people. That is what it is all about. </para>
          <para>Why will the honourable member for Cunningham not tell us why he resigned? What is he afraid of? Is he afraid because the Prime Minister has ratted on him? Is he afraid to tell us the truth? </para>
          <para class="block">Why will he not be as honest and as forthright as the honourable member for Lalor, who came into this House and told us why he believed he acted in an upright and honest way? One can respect the honourable member for Lalor but not a man who is not prepared to come into this House and tell the people of Australia why he resigned. I believe that that of itself is reprehensible. That is the most extraordinary of the power changes that have taken place. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Cunningham cannot sit silently there without being condemned for his silence. It is important that each one of the members of the Australian community and of his colleagues who sit around him recognise that that man has said nothing to the Parliament. He is not prepared to answer to the people. He said that he told his own Labor Caucus. Of course, and this is the point, the Labor Caucus and the trade union movement outside Parliament are more significant than the people. That is what this is all about. The honourable member for Cunningham and the Prime Minister are not prepared to be answerable to the people of Australia. They are running from the Australian electorate. That is why we in this House are opposing this Budget and that is why it is being deferred in the Senate. It is being deferred there so that it can be reconstituted. None of the fear tactics that these little men in the Government seek to provoke will be successful. </para>
          <para>It is important that the Australian people recognise the degree to which they are being misled by a government of this character. They are being led away from the true and accurate way in which a country should be led. I repeat that there are 3 significant charges that we lay against the Government. The first is the total illegality and impropriety of that original Executive Council minute giving authority to the honourable member for Cunningham to borrow a very significant sum of money- $4,000m. We were told originally that that loan was not going to attract commission. We see now from the tel exes that have been published that the Government conspired to ensure that nobody would see the commission; the interest rate was to be loaded so that the commission would be written within that added interest charge. </para>
          <para>The second of those charges relates to the way in which the Government has defrauded the Parliament in concealing a hidden payment of commission which supposedly, according to the answers given to the Parliament, would not be payable to any man. Yet the tel exes demonstrate that the Government, with the knowledge of the Prime Minister because all those tel exes passed across his desk, knew that a hidden commission was payable through an addition to the interest rate. The whole nature of those transactions was within the knowledge of 4 men. One of them has left the Parliament and gone to the High Court; two have left the Ministry; one remains as Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is involved yet he says that he knew nothing of the deals. What has happened to those documents that were in that Paris bank? What was the involvement of the Reserve Bank? Why and in what way were these overseas loan negotiations conducted? </para>
          <para>It is not just those questions that have to be answered. What about the circumstances of the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd petrol deal? To what degree are Ministers culpable in having negotiated or having given prior knowledge to members of the directorate of that company which enabled them to take advantage of that deal? To what extent has the man who was secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions been made a scapegoat of the whole affair? It seems to me that the involvement of the Government in the ACTU-Solo affair was as reprehensible as anything involved in the loans affair. </para>
          <para>The third charge is the absolutely deplorable behaviour of the Treasurer, condoned by the Prime Minister, in prematurely releasing Budget documents in a totally unprecedented fashion to the  President  of the Australian Labor Party, the master of the parliamentary members of the Labor Party. This man is a director of 2 public companies. Then we heard the reasons that were given, as my honourable friend the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> said. Why on earth was it that the Treasurer decided to reveal this only last Monday? Was it because the  President  of the Australian Labor Party had said that the answer the Treasurer gave in the House on 22 October was inaccurate and that more than those 3 men knew about that particular transaction? Honourable members will remember that the Treasurer said that only 3 men knew about it. Three men! The Treasurer said: </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>immediately before lunch, in the course of a division, the honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> moved from his seat to your chair. In accordance with standing order 202 that no member may move from his place until the result of a division is announced and invoking, I submit properly, standing order 205, 1 draw attention to that fact. You observed that on the basis of common sense the honourable gentleman was entitled to so approach you. I questioned that, I thought in a respectful manner. I drew from you a form of words which said: &#39;You are behaving like a larrikin&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> if any member in this House transgresses against the Standing Orders there is an amplitude of powers at your disposal to so discipline him. Obloquy and calumny are not among them. I have never, and I do not, object to any acerbity of language. I ask you to withdraw the imputation. </para>

            <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1 969- 1 974, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a proposed multi-storey ward block, Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, Queensland. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The proposal provides for the construction of a six storey multi-ward block designed to accommodate the requirements of 288 beds, kitchen and dining facilities, library, duty medical officers&#39; common rooms, convention room, staff change and amenities rooms, storage rooms and plant room. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $ 12.3m. </para>
          <para>The Committee, in recommending the construction of this work, has concluded that there is a need for a new ward block at the Repatriation General Hospital Greenslopes to replace outmoded and substandard ward accommodation and associated facilities and that the new ward block should be located on the site presently occupied by 11 timber buildings. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </para>

            <para>-When this Bill was first introduced into this House and the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Minister Assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> made his second reading speech I felt that this was a matter to which I should speak. I think States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bills in recent years have given us some chance of examining the financial relationships that exist between the Australian Government and State governments. However, history has rather overtaken us in that period and one finds that this is certainly not a time when one can discuss the complexity of this relationship. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I commend the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> for his effort in the debate yesterday to relate his discussions to the point of this Bill. Many of the comments which he made had great relevance to it. However, there were some with which I do not agree and which I question. It seemed to me that he was conducting the debate in somewhat of a state of euphoria. He was conducting it in a circumstance where we are talking about financial assistance for the States at a time when his own Party has put forward the proposition that financial assistance to the States could best be satisfied by imposing a system of double taxation. I know that such a system was previously suggested in Victoria where an attempt was made to introduce what was the equivalent of another State income tax. This suggestion received a resounding raspberry from the Victorian public. The honourable member for Lilley forgot to mention that. He expressed surprise that the Minister in his second reading speech said that because we are in a period when we are trying to show economic restraint the adjustment was about 20 per cent. This is what would be needed to maintain the programs at roughly the same real level as in the previous year. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Lilley went on to complain about the lack of growth factor that was in that. The same honourable member belongs to an Opposition which has suggested that there should be a 12.5 per cent cut in government expenditure across the board. Yet there he is complaining that restraint is being shown in this area and that no allowance is being made for growth. I find it very difficult to understand why honourable members opposite follow these lines. We have had the experience, not only with financial Bills but also with other Bills, of the Senate in this Parliament and the last Parliament rejecting or unacceptably amending more Bills in 3 years than previously since Federation. We have had complete obstruction of Government programs in practically every field. We put the matter to the test in May last year and the Government was returned. There was equality of numbers in the Senate but a majority of votes for the Government party. Since then the petulant little boys, deprived of the toffee apple of government after 23 years, have been unable to adjust to the fact that they are in opposition. </para>
          <para>I find it quite difficult, after a great deal of examination of Budget Paper No. 7, the details of the Bill and the Minister&#39;s speech, to think it worth while that one can be discussing Commonwealth-State relationships under these circumstances where the Australian Parliament has been dragged down to such a level by a unrepresentative House. The program outlined in the Bill has evolved over a period of years. It is one which from the States&#39; point of view guarantees the availability of finance. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> The honourable member for Maranoa, in calling for a quorum, confirms the comments I was making about the Opposition&#39;s obstructive and destructive attitude to financial legislation which is presently before the Parliament and how it has rendered superfluous any discussion of Commonwealth-State relationships. Let me return to the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill. This is one of the most important programs for the State governments. The Loan Council program represents the major source of funds for capital works for the States. Each State has autonomy in relation to the way in which it spends those funds. The important thing about capital grants is that they are capital grants and not loans. One can see the savings that must occur in debt charges. Let us look at what has happened under the present Government. I am afraid that I will have to cite some figures here. Taking capital grants as a proportion of the total works and housing program one finds that in 1970-71 it represented 24.3 per cent; in 1971-72, 24.6 per cent; in 1972-73, 25.3 per cent; in 1973-74, 26.7 percent; in 1974-75, 32.1 percent; and the present proposition represents one-third. So under the present Government substantial consideration has been given to the financial needs of the States. </para>
          <para>Further than that, it should be recalled that in 1973 it was decided to provide advances for housing outside the Loan Council arrangements. These annual advances which have been determined by the Minister for Housing and Construction after consultation with the appropriate State ministries have meant a substantial, effective increase in the moneys available to the States. Of course, these advances to the State housing authorities are at low interest over a long period. I am disappointed in many of the Statesparticularly my own- which give no recognition to the assistance that has been given by this Government. I am fed up with seeing so many programs going on that have arisen out of a more enlightened attitude by this Government, &#39;taxes at work&#39; and signs going up that suggest that these improvements and increases are due solely to State governments and not to any enlightened attitude or stimulation by the Australian Government. Despite obstruction on so many measures, this Government has been able to provide resources for the States to take action in many new areas, to provide services which have been required for decades and which were not even considered by previous governments. We heard loud blowing from my old friend and opponent, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte, when he was Premier of Victoria about the Victorian Railways and how he would be glad to get rid of them. What happened when the offer was made? There was a &#39;thumbs down&#39; from the Victorian Government. At least the South Australian and Tasmanian Governments showed some wisdom in accepting the Australian Government &#39;s offer to take over their railways which provide service particularly to outlying areas but which in themselves have caused a great deal of strain on State budgets. </para>
          <para>I have been able to touch on some matters only briefly. I wanted to go further and have a look at the flow-through of this program to various authorities other than the State governments. I regret that the petulant actions of the Opposition in this House and in the Senate have stifled proper consideration of the financial arrangements between the Australian Government and the State governments, that they have made it difficult for further advances to be made, that they have further clouded the issue by holding over the head of the Australian people the threat of a system of double taxation whereby they will have to pay tax under what has become accepted as the Australian taxation system and the State governments will, as they wish, be able to impose extra taxes. I think that this would be a very retrograde step. I am sure that, when in a fullness of time this Parliament expires, if the Opposition puts forward that proposition it will receive a resounding &#39;no&#39; to it. I trust that for the benefit of the States the Opposition will cease its obstruction and allow finances which will flow from this and other legislation to reach those areas where they will be of most benefit. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins)</inline> concerned himself with what he called &#39;the obstruction of the Senate&#39;. He said that the Government has had many aims for the States and the Senate has obstructed those aims. Of course, we know that it is fashionable to decry the fact that the Senate was designed as a States House. There is some validity in the criticism of the way in which the Senate has changed from its original intentions. But one has to ask: Is it proper for this Government or any other Federal government to become such a self-appointed expert on what the States require? Did the Government ask the States when it imposed its centralism? This Government decides what it wants to do and it tries to impose its will upon the States, and if the States or the States House resist they are accused of obstructionism, of obstructing the divine centralist will of this Federal Labor Government. Let the State governments- this is an important part of our philosophy- be judged by their constituents, not by this self-deemed enlightenment of which the honourable member for Scullin spoke- the self-deemed enlightenment of the present, or any other, Federal government. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Scullin pays tribute to that and in his own speech also contributed to some understanding of the problems. Of course, this Bill arises from the present Federal-State financial relations. It is not a situation begun by this Government, but it is a situation accentuated by this Government which leads the Federal Government to have responsibilities to the States. They are reflected in this Bill from decisions of Premiers Conferences and Loan Council meetings. But the Premiers Conferences and Loan Council meetings of recent years have shown that the States do not have the financial resources to carry out their responsibilities. This, of course, is the nub of our problem. Even with prudent housekeeping, the States are unable to raise more money than they are required to spend. State governments, therefore, are dependent upon Federal financial support for the greater part of their Budget outlays. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This Government, the present Federal Labor Government, has used section 96 of the Constitution, which provides for specific purpose grants, in a dictatoral fashion to impose the will of the Federal Government upon the States- a purpose quite unintended by the founders of the Constitution. It is intended that a future LiberalNational Country Party government will make sure that section 96 grants are used for limited special purposes and not for a general imposition of the will of the Federal government. The way in which section 96 has been used by the present Government amounts to an unwarranted intervention in or interference with the autonomy of the States. It is not only the States which are affected; it is, of course, also local government. Local government is very much caught in the crossfire between the present Federal and State governments. What is required is a new policy of federalism. We require a new definition of responsibilities and resources of the 3 arms of government. We need to strengthen the financial independence of the States. Consequently the Opposition Parties, when returned to government, will introduce a system of revenue sharing which will give the States adequate funds to carry out their proper functions and their responsibilities. This will be done without the States being made dependent upon Bills of this nature. </para>

          <para class="block">It is important to realise that in order to aid local government State grants commissions will be established. They  w3l  be needed to supervise the distribution of the revenue which we will guarantee to the States. The State grants commissions will replace the inappropriate and cumbersome local government activities of the Federal Grants Commission which is currently taking on an unreal task of trying to cater for the needs of more than 900 local government bodies. We also will replace, by virtue of the State grants commissions, the tied aid policy, the policy of aid with strings, of the present Government. </para>
          <para>It is important to realise that the local government sphere is the hardest hit of all the spheres of government. It has problems of rigidity of funds and debt servicing. Of course, there are many new cost areas which flow from the policies of the present Federal Government. Local government at the moment relies heavily upon rates as the only real source of income. This is a very unpopular measure and of course a very political measure in which it is decided, according to when local government elections are to be held, just in what manner and to what extent rates will be increased. This means that at times of hyperinflation such as we now have the income of local governments is simply unable to cope with inflation. In fact local government income in relation to that of the Federal and State governments has declined very sharply indeed. Consequently local government requires a share of this growth tax, that is, income tax.

          <para class="block">It is important again to remind the House of the difference in philosophy between the Government and the Opposition. In the eyes of the Opposition every sphere of government- Federal, State and local- should be fully responsible to its own constituents. The public surely is calling for an end to the buck passing of responsibility financially between the Federal and State governments. It is calling for an end to the sorts of criticism which have just come from the honourable member for Scullin. It is calling for an end to the begging bowl spectacle of the States coming to Canberra every year and asking for money and for the present Federal Government imposing its will even to the point of determining for which pedestrian crossings money will be made available, where traffic lights will be erected, and so on. </para>
          <para>The State Liberal Party and National Country Party Leaders, as I have said, fully support the policy which we have espoused. They were consulted on it. They were part of its formation. They have also supported the equalisation proposals and they have supported the establishment of a very important body called the Council for Inter-Government Relations. This institution is designed to eliminate duplication and waste between the various arms of government. I read again from page 6 of the policy document. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As a vital institution of co-operation within the various forms of government, we propose to establish a Council for Inter-Government relations. </para>
            <para>This will be an independent statutory body of major status. Its membership will include nominees of Federal, State and local governments and also a number of citizens. </para>
            <para>The Council will have wide-ranging advisory and investigatory powers. By reference from either Federal, State or local government, it will examine in depth the problems which emerge between the various branches of government and will consider the definition and rationalisation of functions. </para>
            <para>Its recommendations and reports will be available to all areas of government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is not a mere cliche. That is not a flimsy promise to try to hold before electors. That is a genuine establishment of a mechanism designed to eliminate the inevitable waste and duplication that occur when the 3 arms of government concern themselves with matters which concern people. Increasingly, of course, local government bodies have gone well beyond servicing merely properties; they are servicing people. All arms of government are concerned with that. This Bill of course concerns the financing of services to people. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, whilst the Opposition supports this Bill it deplores the manner in which FederalState relations have deteriorated in recent times under the present Government. We are most confident that our own federalism policy will restore responsibility and above all accountability to each State so that each State government is responsible to its own constituents, each local government body is responsible to its own constituents and so that all constituents of Australia can see precisely where their income tax is going, so that in fact it can be determined by active opposition spokesmen at local level, at State level and at Federal level how the 3 spheres of government should be judged on their performance. It is simply not enough for a Federal government to say: &#39;We have decided what is best for the country. We have decided that we want to do this. We are sorry that the States do not want to go along with it. We are sorry that the Senate does not want to go along with it. We have decided what is best&#39;. </para>
          <para>As we have a federal system, regardless of how we would draw up the Constitution if we were drawing it afresh today, it is important that we recognise that it is a system with its own checks and balances, a system which with goodwill can work, a system in which the ultimate control is that of the democratic constituents, who can determine from their own assessment of how money is spent and how money is raised how the government of the day- local, State or Federal- is carrying out its responsibilities. Our policy restores accountability to all 3 spheres of government. We believe that it will improve efficiency, and we believe that that efficiency and the accountability will be for the benefit of all constituents in Australia. </para>

As I mentioned at the outset, I want to relate to the chamber the effect that the blockage of the Budget would have on the items covered in this legislation and, therefore, at this early stage I want to point to the motivations behind the blockage of the Budget in another place and relate that to the impact that it Will have. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> in accordance with your ruling </para>

That matter is related to this Bill because the comment was made that one could get any kind of information that one wanted when one offered money for it. The Australian people would like to know the answer and I am sure that this chamber would like to know the answer. When the Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 and 2, which are inter-related with the legislation before the chamber, are blocked in another place the Australian people need to be told that I was also asked by a very responsible person why the Australian Government wanted to replace existing foreign equity in our resources with Arab equity. I replied that it had never been suggested by anyone in Australia during the overseas loans debate that existing foreign equity in Australia&#39;s resources was to be replaced by Arab equity. I said that such a proposal was not nor never had been Australian Government or Australian Labor Party policy and that I could not understand how anyone in Australia or overseas could have gained that impression. In my view any Australian who conveyed that impression abroad was denigrating and misrepresenting not only this Government but also Australia. I challenge the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to tell the truth and to reveal who communicated that impression abroad, because it was another great lie like the great lie on Vietnam that the Opposition perpetrated. </para>

          <para class="block">Lilley, Kevin Cairns and Khemlani would be a good partnership name over the door. The Opposition&#39;s proposition on new federalism or new colonialism, as I prefer to term it, would result in the ultimate in quadruple income tax. All we have to take into consideration is, firstly, that there would be a federal income tax levy; secondly, there would be a State income tax levy, the amount of which the States would determine; thirdly, there would be another tax for local government; and fourthly, if we can place any credence on the suggestions of the Opposition spokesman on social welfare matters, there would be a separate tax for Medibank. So there we have a nice complicated income tax assessment with 4 taxes on it. </para>
          <para>If we are going to question the motives of those people who blocked Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 and 2 in another place we should question their motives in telling people why equity in Australian resources is to be replaced by Arab equity. One needs to remember that a number of the services in Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 and 2 are complementary to the legislation which is now before the chamber. I refer to the $707m for Medibank; the $47.5m for payments to preschools and child care; the $108m for payments to hospitals and health services programs; the $64m for community health programs; and the $275m for urban and regional development programs. That was the note on which the previous  speaker  concluded- that there ought to be concern for local government in the financial problems that local government faces. If we are going to have that concern for local government, there ought to be concern in another place where the Opposition has a contrived majority. There ought to be concern to ensure that the Budget is passed so that the moneys can go through to local government to complement the funds that become available from the Grants Commission for the current financial year. </para>

I want to mention also that when one looks at the motive for that and the motive for setting off abroad a story which is completely untrue and obviously designed to denigrate and damage the credit standing and the borrowing capacity of this nation abroad, one sees that those people who act in that way are acting to the disadvantage of this nation. In accord with that one needs to look at the leaking of Treasury documents and tel exes and at the arrival of the honourable member for Lilley&#39;s proposed partner. The newspaper advertisements are all part of a plot to usurp this, the people&#39;s House. It is no more than a mad and desperate right wing rebellion against legitimate authority in this nation. I am sorry that people such as the honourable member for Lilley and others on his side of the chamber- men for whom I had some admiration as men of intelligence and principle have surrendered those principles to overthrow all the rights of this, the people&#39;s House, by an Upper House. I believe they will live to rue that decision. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I was being guided by your broad tolerance. I do not want to err, but just let me conclude the last point. I feel that whoever the person in the Public Service is who has seen fit to breach his oath it is a very serious matter not only for Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) and the services and operations of the departments concerned and this legislation but also for the Australian Public Service. Out of this the credibility and reputation of the Australian Public Service have been damaged. </para>

          <para>Let me return to what the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee),</inline> was saying in respect of State income tax or, as I prefer to call it and most Australians call it, a double income tax. Under a double income tax system as proposed and expounded by the honourable member obviously, because of population disparities, different States would levy different rates of income tax. With different rates of income tax taxpayers would be required to maintain records of income in each of the States in which that income was earned. A shift of population would follow from State to State depending upon the rate of income tax that was levied. There would also then be an incentive for people to try to show their major source of income in that State in which the rate of income tax was the lowest There is a very real and current example of the result of that kind of POliCY in the city of New York where, because of local taxes levied by that city, because of the wealth, because of the value of properties and because of the cost of providing services, people with the means to pay, with the capacity to pay, moved out of that city in years gone by into areas where the rate of tax was lower. Accordingly, people of lower income standing, people who were unemployed and people unable to earn higher incomes moved in. The result was that the demand for welfare services grew and the taxable or revenue capacity of the city dropped. The city of New York is now virtually bankrupt and eventually must become a charge on the federal system of the United States. That is a very good and very clear example of the ultimate result of the kind of tax propositions that the Opposition is putting to this nation. </para>
          <para>Let us go a little further and look at the propositions for local government. Members of the Opposition are suggesting that the one body that has been established since Federation and the one body that has now had 2 years to collate information on the needs of local government and its various disabilities and revenue capacities the Grants Commission- should be disbanded and carved up into half a dozen State grants commissions. Obviously those State Commissions could not have the broad view of national standards in local government The Opposition further suggests that assistance would then be granted to local government on a per capita basis. Per capita assistance to local government is quite ridiculous. The needs of local government are not dependent on population. The needs vary according to the area of the local council concerned, according to the income content of the population and according to the location of development simply within the council boundaries. To suggest that a per capita grant to local government would help to overcome local government difficulties is quite ridiculous, but then that is in accord with the Opposition&#39;s attitude towards local government. </para>
          <para>On every occasion since 1972- when I became a member of this chamber- when a matter has come before us that meant direct financial assistance to local government it has been opposed completely and vigorously by the Opposition. I refer to the referendum that would have enabled any federal government to provide financial assistance to local government. I refer to representation on the Loan Council. I refer even to the early debates on the Grants Commission. Assistance to local government must be on the basis of needs and not on a per capita basis. A per capita basis is simply a step backwards. If per capita were a workable proposition it would have been applied by the Grants Commission in its assistance to the States. It is interesting to note that since 1927 the equalisation grants for the smaller States have been based upon the equalisation principle and not on a per capita principle. I would like to conclude on the note that under the Opposition system obviously the small States of Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania would be severely disadvantaged. Therefore I do not think any real regard or serious consideration can be given to that idea. </para>

              <para>- The Bill that we are now debating is one of the machinery Bills that we discuss each year to allow the States to participate in the disbursement of funds from the national tax gathering machine- the Australian Government. The States Grants Capital Assistance program is one of recent times, having been started with an interest-free grant of $200m in 1970 by the Liberal-National Country Party government. At that time, honourable members will recall, much concern was expressed by all sectors of public activity in Australia at the growing indebtedness of the States as compared with the Commonwealth. The initiative of the Liberal-Country Party government was an honest attempt to ease the burden of interest and redemption payments on loan funds and it is true to say that from this initiative of a free enterprise government many advantages have flowed to the nation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The overall Commonwealth-State relations need a re-examination in the light of modern trends and we applaud the initiatives of the Opposition in framing the policy of true federalism which in effect is a blueprint for co-operation between the 3 tiers of government- national, State and local. For the first time positive recognition is being given to the authority of the States in a meaningful spirit of federalism and accountability, for the spending and raising of money will rest to a marked degree with the people who are elected to fulfil the requirements of the Constitution as originally envisaged. We on this side of the House fully subscribe to the point of view that government must be brought as close as possible to the people and that the people who make the decisions are fully accountable to the electors for the decisions made. </para>
          <para>It is true to say- and I say this in a spirit of constructive criticism- that in recent times too many decisions have been made by bureaucrats who are insulated from the public and who hide behind an insulated wall of non-responsibility. The nerve end of the Opposition&#39;s policies on federalism is that our policies are aimed at a meaningful spirit of co-operation and to the provision of adequate safeguards to allow government for the people, by the people and not by the Public Service. At present, no doubt due to the dictatorial attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam ), the real spirit of federalism as envisaged by the founding fathers has reached a stage where, if one breathed heavily on it, it will break. It is that weak.</inline></para>
          <para>One must be critical of the stadium like attitude that prevails each year when the leaders of the States meet with the Australian Government leaders to thrash out the allocation of funds from the Commonwealth to the States in the various areas. This is to be deplored, because after much cut and thrust of debate the Commonwealth dictates what is or what is not to be given without taking due cognisance of the vital and immediate needs and requirements of the various States. The Australian Government, I submit, exercises far too much control in what was originally a theoretical exercise but has now developed into an ironclad arrangement wherein the Commonwealth has the final say because of the position of strength from which it negotiates. </para>
          <para>The allocation to the States this year has not taken adequate account of extra amounts to cover inflation and also the need to provide improved and updated facilities. In all States there is an immediate need for capital expenditure on school buildings, police stations, railways and electricity works. It is interesting to note that the increase in the consumer price index has been of the order of 16 per cent to 18 per cent for each quarter as compared with the previous quarter in the period 1974-75. The increase in September 1974 from September 1973 was 16 per cent, in December 1974 as compared with December 1973, it was 16.3 per cent; in March 1975 as compared with March 1 974 it was 1 7.6 per cent; and in June 1975 compared with June 1974 it was 16.9 per cent. This is indicative of the increase in materials used in building other than house building as at June 1975, compared with June 1974. It is most enlightening </para>
          <para>I now refer to a summary of results of the Australian Bureau of Statistics issued on 25 August 1975. That summary shows that prices of concrete mix, cement and sand were up 24.6 per cent in the 12-month period; cement products were up 25.6 per cent; bricks and stone 2 1.8 per cent; timber board and joinery 15.4 per cent; steel and iron products 18.3 per cent; aluminium products 18.9 per cent; plumbing fixtures 18.6 per cent; miscellaneous materials 20.1 per cent; electrical installation materials 6.2 per cent; and mechanical service components 16.5 per cent. Faced  with these rising costs over which they have very little control, the States reacted to the proposals of the Commonwealth in a most predictable and just manner- with disgust. When proper allowance is made for the expected increases and also the lower labour output due to record industrial unrest and greater leave periods, it is readily appreciated why the States were most upset at the cavalier attitude of the Federal Government.&#39; The decisions of the Federal Government quite obviously went over like a lead balloon. </para>
          <para>I read with a great deal of interest- the matter would be one of almost laughable proportions if it were not so serious- that the Australian Government&#39;s best, albeit as the Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> stated in his second reading speech, very approximate, estimates of possible cost increases in the capital works field in 1975-76 was covered by a 20 per cent increase in allocations from the previous year. The Government quite obviously realises, as the Minister stated, that in the environment it has created, it is impossible accurately to plan ahead with any certainty. The Government&#39;s plan to maintain the program at roughly the same real level as in the previous year is one that surely will backfire and be misplaced. </para>
          <para>It is time that a sovereign State&#39;s. request for capital funds should meet with an acceptable response from the financial controlling bodies of Australia. It is interesting to remind the House that the Queensland Government, a responsible government, sought increases of approximately 55 per cent in its basic loan borrowing allocation and semi-governmental debenture program. It pointed out that increases in the previous year had been insufficient to compensate for the effects of inflation and spiralling costs rapidly escalating under irresponsible Federal Government control. It said that the 1975-76 program should be increased sufficiently to catch up the huge backlog and to make allowance for the further cost increases confidently predicted in 1975-76. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth decision, however, not to go beyond the 20 per cent increase leaves the States and local authorities many millions of dollars short of what would be required to restore the volume of work to its previous level. Following the downturn in activity in the private sector, crushed by impossible demands and restrictions placed on it by an inhospitable Labor Government, the time was surely ripe to set the machinery going to provide more employment for the number of people being rapidly thrown out of jobs and to allow the total capital invested in the construction industry generally to be gainfully employed. It was a wonderful opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to take up the slack spots in our economy and in the employment areas by productive and constructive work of a permanent nature rather than using the stop-go methods employed under the various schemes to alleviate the unemployment position. </para>
          <para>At a time when unemployment was running at 4.6 per cent of the total work force- it is estimated that 500 000 people will be out of work by June next year- it seems to me that it would have been eminently desirable for the Commonwealth Government to pump into the capital works of the States an increase in the allocation for capital assistance to allow existing State services to be continued and updated. The Minister, in his second reading speech, stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It should suffice to say here that the Government is convinced that an objective examination of the matter would show that the State governments and their authorities have been treated most handsomely indeed in the Budget. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I certainly take issue with this statement and in order to further my arguments and reinforce my statement, I refer to tables Nos. 8, 10 and 11 of Budget Paper No. 6 entitled &#39;Government Securities on Issue at 30 June 1975 &#39;. </para>
          <para>An examination of these tables is a most enlightening one and serves to direct the attention of the Australian people to the real truth of the situation- the kernel of the matter- that the Australian Government debt has decreased in proportion to the debt applicable to State governments. I draw the attention of honourable members to table No. 8. It shows that in 1 95 1 the debt of the Australian Government was $3,777,098,000 and at 1 975 was $5,956,152,000-an increase of $2,179,054,000. The State debt in 1951 was $2,618,712,000 and in 1975 was a mammoth $1 1,813,759,000-an increase of $9,195,047,000. 1 submit that this is a disastrous situation when the debt of the States increases over that relatively short period of a country&#39;s history by such mammoth proportions. </para>
          <para>In 1951 the debt of the Australian Government per head of population was $448.49 and at the present time is $441.06. The debt of the State governments per head in 1951 was $312.45 and at the present time it has made a huge jump to $893.62. Obviously something must be done to arrest the continuing debt of the States. I believe that this could have been done by a greater capital contribution free of interest. Obviously the Australian Government has shown no interest in this matter. It does not care about the sovereign rights of the States and shows its lack of care by not doing anything meaningful and significant to overcome those huge cost increases with regard to the total debt of the States and the total debt per head of population in the various States. Obviously something must be done to arrest the continuing debt of the States. This could have been achieved by a greater capital contribution free of interest, following on the magnificent example of the Liberal-Country Party Government when it established this principle of capital assistance to the various States. </para>
          <para>Table No. 10 shows that the interest per head in 1951 payable on the Australian Government debt was $ 12.06 and $9.64 per head was payable by the States. At the present time it is $23.32 in respect of the Australian Government and $56.28 in respect of the States. Again, these are figures which cause very great concern and give great alarm to the average person in the street who is very concerned at the ever-increasing debt that is being perpetrated on the Australian Government and the Australian people and the various State governments. </para>
          <para>An examination of the average rates of interest payable as per table No. 1 1 shows that for many years the Australian Government interest rate was very low and has only increased in later years whereas there has been a steady yearly increase in the State rates. It is noted that the interest rate applicable in 1975 to the Australian Government is 4.94 per cent as compared with 5.26 per cent in 1974 whereas the States have shown a steady increase from 3.04 per cent in 1951 to 6.31 per cent in 1975. The average rate of interest payable to June 1975 is 5.29 per cent for the Australian Government and 6.30 per cent for State governments. This again indicates the significant trend of an ever increasing cost burden being placed on the State governments. I submit that a logical explanation for this trend is that we have a bureaucratic, dictatorial government which wants to concentrate and centralise all power here in Canberra. Obviously the States are discriminated against in the interest rates that are charged. I hope that, on our return to the government benches, we will make a thorough examination and overhaul the system1 so that the States are not discriminated against. The States have rights under the Constitution; but those rights can be torpedoed and sabotaged by a hostile centralised government which does not recognise the particular position of the States in a co-operative operative federalist system. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the position of local government. Once again a most depressing picture is presented. The latest available figures indicate that the outstanding debt of local government is continuing to rise and now stands at well over $2,000m. The real problem of local government is inflation and its effect on capital works which, in effect, are the lifeblood and mainstream of local government initiatives and endeavours. One area which does deserve closer examination is the agonising position of rural ratepayers who under the present system are being grossly discriminated against. Of course, many arguments can be advanced as to relieving the burden of financing local government that is borne by ratepayers. We of the Opposition have spelt out our thrust in this matter in our policy on federalism which was so well presented by the honourable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> and the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns).</inline> I fully support the point of view that they put, just as I uphold the Opposition&#39;s policy on federalism. </para>
          <para>The rural ratepayer is at a distinct disadvantage when compared with the city ratepayer who is regularly reimbursed for cost of living increases and the effects of inflation by decisions of arbitration courts.  His  set income allows him to meet any increases in rates in line with those cost increases. He is insulated and protected. However, the rural ratepayer is not assured of a regular income.  His  crops can be destroyed by frost, by flood or by hailstorm.  His  income from beef, for instance, can be reduced drastically by matters over which he has no control.  His  position is aggravated by an unsympathetic government which obviously will not do anything to help him. In many instances the rural producer does not know how much his net income will be until the cheque is finally received for produce sold. In rural industries such as wool, meat, fruit and dairying, there is a decline in income. Consequently, many of these producers have extreme liquidity problems in paying their rates. This is an area in which much investigation in strict justice could be carried out to seek to alleviate the problems of the rural producer who has no set income and who is subject to tremendous pressures from seasonal changes in the economy and changes in overseas prices. </para>
          <para>Many of the smaller rural areas have added disadvantages insofar as the cost of sewerage services is higher to them as they are not able to participate in the schemes to sewer areas of larger populations. I submit that an extra allocation could be made to help rural local authorities to develop sewerage schemes or septic systems. If that were done, elderly people would not have to go to the large city areas when the time came for them to retire, but could retire in the areas in which they are known and to which they are deeply attached. It is to be hoped that initiatives will be undertaken to allow sewerage services to be part and parcel of the quality of life of people who live in the smaller country towns. </para>
          <para>Ratepayers, who are also taxpayers, I submit, can no longer be expected to provide out of their own resources approximately 80 per cent of the current receipts of local government. Local government must obtain its rightful share of national income as well as grants from State and federal governments for specific purposes. Roads, bridges and sewerage are still required in many areas of Australia. The pittance given to the States by this Bill will not contribute in a significant way to solving the great problems faced in these areas. Action by a concerned Federal government, with adequate consultation with the States and respecting the right of local government to fulfil its role as the government closest to the people, is the only way in which the people of this nation will be able to enjoy the quality of life which they so richly deserve. Implicit in this statement is the proposition that this can happen only under a free enterprise government. In 3 short years the Australian Labor Party has led this nation along only one way, and that is the way to ruin and to destruction. </para>
          <para>It is to be regretted that, in the final analysis, the services that should be given to people locally have not been able to be provided, because of the economic and fiscal policies of the Australian Government. True it is that many plans to update and to improve facilities are on the drawing boards. Local authorities are keen to get out and to develop these essentials; but they find that, because of the rapid escalation of costs, what they believed would be possible in the next financial year has to be postponed. The situation is then reached that continuing pressure on a cost-plus basis is exerted in respect of such activities, with the result that it obviously would appear to many local authorities that it is practically impossible to plan ahead with any degree of certainty that their aims and ambitions will be fulfilled. Such a state of affairs is to be regretted. I do hope that the Federal Government will take heed of the warnings that have been given to it by many excellent people over the period that it has been in office and that it will consult - </para>

              <para>- There is no concern for the people who want to work or for the people who want to provide for themselves and their families. There is no concern for the people who are on low incomes, who are underprivileged or disadvantaged and who will seek what is commonly known as welfare housing. So we deplore this aspect of the Budget. This is one of the reasons for our amendment. The amendment deals with the reduction amounting to $20.8m in welfare housing. The overall cutback in housing expenditure in the Budget is $69m or 10 per cent of last year&#39;s expenditure. It is a very significant cutback. But the cutback in the area of welfare housing, which is what we are talking about today, amounts to $20. 8m. </para>

              <para>- The Minister interjects and says it is not true. He has been saying this for some considerable time. It seems to me that basic English in this Budget describes what is a cutback a reduction. In reply to the Minister I refer him to question No. 2913 on the notice paper which asks whether he had said that advances for the States welfare housing programs will not be less than in the previous financial year. He said he did say that. The second part of that question asked why advances to 3 States had been cut back. I could read the answer into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but there is no sense in wasting time. The answer really was a series of paragraphs of complete gobbledegook. The Minister did not deny that allegation at all. I would like to demonstrate how impossible it is to deny it. In Queensland there has been a reduction of $ 12.8m on last year&#39;s expenditure. </para>

              <para>- Once again I appreciate the interjection. The Minister says that Queensland received an advance in June, and that is set out in the second reading speech. Perhaps I could deal with that at this stage. Let me refer to what the Minister for Housing in Queensland and the Treasurer in that State had to say about this so-called advance that Queensland got in June. Quite clearly there has been a cutback on last year&#39;s expenditure in Queensland amounting to $12.8m and an amount of $4m in Western Australia and Tasmania. The Minister in some obscure way says there have not been cutbacks. I say that is quite ridiculous. This is what the Treasurer of Queensland had to say: </para>

              <para>- It is not new for this Govern.ment but in fairness to this Minister I do not include him in the category of a deceptive Minister. He will probably pick up the disease if he stays in the Ministry for long but up to this time he has shown resistance. However, he did have something to say which tied him in with this whole sorry business. I think we must make some excuse for him because he has not been in the Ministry for very long and he has to make up for the sins of his predecessors and of the Prime Minister. At the housing Ministers&#39; Conference in Brisbane in June this year- I do not know how new he was then but he had not been in office very long- the Minister said, as recorded at page 84 of the report: </para>

              <para>- I am quoting the Queensland Minister. The point is that we are saying that in this Budget assistance for welfare housing has been decreased. The Minister in some way says that it has not been decreased. I refer him to page 55 of the Budget Speech under the heading of &#39;Housing&#39;. In respect of advances to the States for housing there is a table there setting out advances for 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76. The final column of that table indicates by a minus sign or a plus sign whether there has been a decrease or an increase. According to the Budget Speech there has been a decrease in advances to the States amounting to $20. 8m. That is set out in the Government&#39;s own Budget papers, particularly Budget Paper No. 7 headed &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities&#39; and in respect of which we have just been debating legislation. That document clearly sets out on page 68 that in round figures New South Wales last year received $125m and this year it is to receive exactly the same amount. Victoria received $99m and this year it is to receive the same amount. Last year Queensland received $44m and this year it is to receive $32m. If honourable members look at Budget Paper No. 7 they will see there is no doubt that an allocation is reduced by the amount of an advance that is made to a State. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We of the Opposition have worked out what this will mean to the end user, the low income earner, the disadvantaged, the underprivileged and so on in the States. Consider this cut back of $20.8m. Consider last year&#39;s commencements and allow for a 20 per cent inflation rate. I do not know whether the inflation rate will be 20 per cent by the time we come to the end of the year but the inflation rate is down a bit at the moment. I will bet dollars to doughnuts that it will go back up again. However, allowing for 20 per cent, we have worked out that there will be a loss not only in Housing Commission homes but also in homes for low income people built through the Home Builders Account. There will be a loss of 4500 homes compared with last year as a result of this cut back of $20.Bm </para>
          <para>In the second reading speech of the Minister for Housing and Construction there were some things that I would like to dispute. One, in particular, is relevant. The Minister has been going all over the country saying things, although perhaps not as often as his predecessor, about how much more money this Government has spent than we of the Opposition spent when in Government. </para>

              <para>- It is true. In his second reading speech the Minister said that in 1974-75, the year just ended, advances were 2 &#39;A times more than was spent on welfare housing in 1971-72 when we were in Government. I have done some calculations and it is true that when we were in Government we spent in those 2 years about $161m, or we advanced that much, for public housing. This Government has advanced $364m, which is <inline font-style="italic">2&#39;A</inline> times the sum advanced in 1971. However, in 1971 when we were in Government we produced 15 337 homes with welfare money and this Government has produced only 15 228. </para>

              <para>- We have heard such a lot of garbage today and we have been treated so badly here today that the honourable member should be grateful that now we do not debate in a sour manner as we would be entitled to do. I want to pass on from that point and perhaps be a little less friendly in the cause of truth and justice. The Minister and his predecessor, especially his predecessor, promised time and again that there would be no cut back in welfare funds. I am sure the Minister will not mind if I quote from his address on 9 July to a branch of the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales. I am not certain that the Minister addressed that gathering or whether he arranged for someone to deliver his speech. The Minister said: </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister - </para>
          <para class="block">Obviously the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is also implicated- has also indicated to the States that the Government will maintain at least the same level of expenditure under the States&#39; Housing Agreements as in 1974-75. The question will receive further consideration in the Budget context. </para>
          <para class="block">He went on to say other things but that is a straight out promise by the Minister, with the authority of the Prime Minister, that there would be no cut back in spending. I have not spent much time getting all the Press releases and all the references because there are quite a few of them but the Minister will remember putting out a Press release on 20 July in which he rejected complaints by State Housing Ministers. The heading of that statement referred to that point. The Minister said: </para>

            <para>Advances by the Australian Government for the States&#39; welfare housing programs in 1975-76 will not be less than in the previous financial year . . . </para>

          <para class="block">We really could not get anything clearer than that statement. I have had some correspondence with some of the State Ministers, as I said earlier. I have had correspondence with the Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian Ministers and also I have some material from the South Australian Minister. This correspondence is not all from Governments on our side of politics. I want to place on record what the Minister for Housing in New South Wales had to say. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The initial problems began when the Prime .Minister, at the Premiers&#39; Conference on 19 June 1975 broke with past practice and declined to disclose the amount of welfare housing funds being made available to the States, indicating at that time that the details of fund allocations would be announced &#39;in the Budget context&#39;. He did indicate then that the funds would be no less than last year- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These are not my words, they are those of the Minister for Housing in New South Wales and he is indicating what the Prime Minister said. He continued: but later informed the Premier not to rely on any specific amount from Commonwealth funds. </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister went on to say that this has placed the whole of the Housing Commission construction program in jeopardy. It has placed the construction program of every housing authority in the country in jeopardy. I have no doubt that the Minister for Housing and Construction agrees. Equally I have no doubt that he would like to be able to get more funds for welfare housing but he has some pretty tough nuts to crack in the Cabinet. I want to refer again to what the Prime Minister said at the Premiers Conference on 7 June because it is highly relevant to this debate. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We then look forward in 1974-75 to the completion of considerably more dwellings in the public sector than in 1 973-74. 1 should also say that, in the light of development in the industry as a whole as the year unfolds, including the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds to productive use in welfare housing, we stand ready to consult further with the States on the provision of additional advances. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Does the Government still stand ready to consult with the States? I know that the New South Wales Minister for Housing has begun an unusual liaison with one of the building trades unions and I know that he intends to see the Minister about raising more funds. I trust that he will have some success. I must not let the former Minister for Housing and Construction, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Les</inline> Johnson, escape without some reference. At a conference in October 1974 he gave the Housing Commissions some considerable encouragement by saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The State housing authorities should endeavour to maintain, for the next 2 quarters, the housing construction programs they nominated in May 1974 and that the Australian Government was prepared to review the need for further advances for the housing authorities during the next 3 months in the light of the capacity of each housing authority and the state of the industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Subsequently, in December 1974, the then Acting Prime Minister, the now deposed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns, one of the honest men in this Parliament, confirmed and endorsed what the then Minister had said. So we believe that the promises were undoubtedly given and were undoubtedly broken. We do not blame this Minister because we realise it must be a tremendous embarrassment for him. He in fact is simply carrying the can for the rest of the Government. </para>
          <para>I think we all realise that the effects of this cutback will be felt very severely in the low income earner area of our society. There is not time to quote all the material which the State Ministers have provided. However, the Victorian Minister is concerned about production. I would like to quote something which he said in a letter to me: </para>
          <quote>

          <para class="block">I will not read much more of what he had to say. But the position is that the State of Victoria now has $ 1 2m left for welfare housing and at the rate of $ 10m the State is not going to be able to keep going for very long. I am quite sure that the Minister realises the significance of these figures. This shows how seriously the State Housing authorities are disadvantaged. I make the point that the Victorian Minister has stated that his Government&#39;s housing program would come to a stop in six or eight weeks. </para>

            <para>This program will bring the government housing program to a stop and when added to the sorrowful situation at present existing in the private sector it does mean that the building industry both in government and private sector level has passed the stage of being on its knees because it will now be flat on its face. </para>

          <para class="block">He was saying that the building industry was very nearly settled. He went on to refer to a government supported factory-built homes proposition operating in Victoria which will have to be wound down. </para>
          <para>The New South Wales Minister has made similar remarks about the problems in that State. Normally the Housing Commission in New South Wales calls for tenders based on 120 units a week, which means an annual program of 6000 units. The Housing Commission has found it necessary to reduce that to 30 units a week, which means an annual program of 1500 units. I will not waste too much of the time of the House reading some of these other quotes because I am sure that the Minister is very well aware of them. But the New South Wales Minister chose to make a point which I think is of some significance to the people of New South Wales. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An additional and equally disturbing factor is satisfactory tenders for approximately 1034 dwelling units which were already on hand, but for which contracts had not actually been signed, will now not be proceeded with and the successful tenderers have had to be advised in writing to this effect. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is his concern. It is certainly of concern to us. He also went on to refer to the stock of rental accommodation. In fact all of the State Ministers with whom I have had any contact- which is all of them- indicate that the waiting lists for housing commission or housing trust accommodation are expanding very rapidly. The Federal Minister may remember saying just two or three months ago that there were 93 000 people on the waiting list. That is something that his predecessor used to say all the time. In fact, he started off saying it just after the 1972 elections. He has been saying it ever since. But the true position is that the waiting lists numbers 120 000 applicants. This number has in fact gone up 20 per cent since Labor has been in office. I think that we will find that such surveys as the Henderson report and plenty of others indicate that that really is just the tip of the iceberg, that there are a great many more people without suitable accommodation who are not on the waiting lists. </para>
          <para>In the moment or two left to me can I just say that these views are not confined simply to </para>
          <para class="block">Liberal or National Country Party Premiers or Ministers for Housing and Construction or Treasurers. In my own State of South Australia the Premier of a Labor Government has been as vehement in criticising this cut-back as any of the Liberal Party or National Country Party Premiers or spokesmen. On 20 August, just a few days after the Budget was announced, a newspaper article reported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> as having said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Federal Budget would mean an inevitable increase in unemployment in South Australia. . . . Home building here - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, in South Australia-  would be seriously hit, and the dropping of State unemployment relief schemes would mean a lot more people out of jobs by October. . . . </para>
          <para>Of course, that is what is happening. The report continued:  ... the only way to avoid this was increased activity in the private sector and he could not see that happening. &#39;Housing is a really big worry&#39;, he said. &#39;The Budget has hit us harder than other States because we spend very much more than other States on public housing. </para>
          <para class="block">I do not know whether that is true or not, but every State leader is concerned to put his own State point of view. Each Premier and each Housing Minister believes that he has had a worse deal than anybody else. Welfare housing, to use that general term, has probably nowhere else in Australia been promoted as successfully as it has been in South Australia. This situation has been the same whether the State has been run by Liberal Party and National Country Party governments or Labor governments because the State Housing Trust has done a tremendous job. The article then quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> as saying:  &#39;As people in S.A. rely very heavily on public housing, it is going to have a very serious effect. </para>
          <para class="block">Among other things he is reported as saying:  &#39;There will be a marked reduction in the number of houses built with State bank loans. </para>
          <para class="block">This is perfectly obvious, as I mentioned earlier. The article also reports him as saying:  &#39;It is very hard to see - </para>

            <para>- It is always very interesting to hear the comments of the Victorian Minister for Housing in regard to allocations that come from the Federal Government. If we take these comments in conjunction with the comments made by the Victorian Minister for Education we find that there is very skilful misrepresentation by both gentlemen of the amounts of money they receive. For some odd reason they seem to be unable to understand that if one maintains the level of spending one has maintained it. They always claim that there has been a cut. The Victorian Minister for Housing has been bleating for the last 8 months that he is going to have to close down the Holmesglen factory. I tell him now, as I have told him before- and I tell the Opposition- that if he ran the Holmesglen factory efficiently we would save a lot of the Australian taxpayers&#39; money that goes to the State for housing. The factory has never run to capacity. Because it is not run to capacity the end production, the concrete units that come out of it, are extremely costly. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> compared figures. He quoted a figure of $163m with which the Opposition was concerned when it was in office. He compared this figure with the value of the houses which we had built I draw his attention to the correct figures. I do not know from what he was quoting. But the correct comparison is approximately 15 000 for the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1971-72 and 22 340 for this year under this Government. This shows an approximate 50 per cent increase. I think that the honourable member&#39;s figures are out of date and I suggest that he have them checked. </para>
          <para>When the Opposition talks about how many houses can be built with a certain amount of money, it never considers the cost of land. The cost of land has escalated in every State, except South Australia, to an extraordinary degree. The Federal Government cannot control the cost of land, and the State Liberal governments will not attempt to control it. I would have been happier to hear the honourable member for Boothby advising his counterparts in the States to do something about controlling the appalling price of land, because if there is one single thing that is putting home ownership beyond the reach of young married couples, taking into account the rate of inflation, it is the price of land. This is particularly so in Victoria. The honourable member for Boothby also referred to a $20m cut in the allocation to the States. He cannot have his cake and eat it too. The Government has maintained its spending on welfare housing. Last year the States received an extra $ 10m, making a total allocation of $374m. In June this year they were advanced $10m, which made a total of $3 84m. This year they have received $364m. If one adds to that the $ 10m that was advanced in June one sees that the Government has maintained its spending. </para>
          <para>I am always pleased to be able to support the Government&#39;s initiatives on housing because, of all the problems which my constituents in Henty bring to my office, the largest single problem is housing. I notice that when the honourable members opposite talk about housing they always talk about money; they never talk about people. That seems to be one of the odd quirks about members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Boothby said that the private sector is in trouble. I pointed out to him that it will be in even deeper trouble as a result of the action of the Opposition in the Senate. Those people who have accepted Government tenders and who are waiting to be paid for them will go bankrupt while they are waiting to be paid. It will not be this Government&#39;s fault if they become bankrupt; it will be because the Opposition has chosen to tread a path that is very dangerous for it and that could cause chaos and destruction to the private sector of the building industry. </para>
          <para>No other problem causes people more misery than inadequate or over-priced housing. A home is basic to our security. We build our whole way of life on it. This Government attaches great importance to welfare housing. The amount of $364m- it is really $374m- has been allocated for welfare housing in accordance with the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. The distribution is given in the second reading speech of the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Riordan)</inline> so I will not go through it. A comparison with the figure of $ 1 6 1 m for 1 97 1 -72 -the last year of the Liberal-Country Party Government- shows that this Government gives priority to housing for people who cannot afford to buy or build through private tender. The $364m represents a real increase in spending, even allowing for inflation. The Government is looking for further improvements in the provision of welfare housing. It is interesting to note that a significant recovery is apparent in the private home building sector. Approvals for private dwellings in the June quarter exceeded 30 000, compared with 24 000 in the December quarter. I am sorry that I do not have with me the figures put out recently in Victoria which show an even greater increase that is on the way. The private sector was starting to pick up and to get into operation until recently when it was dealt this last body blow by the Senate. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para>
          <para>I thank the  Deputy  Opposition Whip for providing me with an audience. The advances to the States are apportioned by consultation between the Minister and the various State Housing Ministers. The State Housing Minister in Victoria claims that this Government itself has apportioned the money for this State and has apportioned it in such a way that the Housing Commission will be disadvantaged. I repeat that this Government does not apportion the money. It is done by consultation. This was done by agreement. Victoria asked that 70 per cent of its allocation go to the Housing Commission, which is an increase on last year, and that 30 per cent go to the home builders account, which is a decrease on last year but which was its choice. Victoria is maintaining its grant at the same level as last year and has no right to continue to threaten to close the Holmesglen construction factory because the Housing Commission money has been cut. By its own wishes, the allocation that has been maintained has been split differently and a greater amount is going into Housing Commission spending. I also repeat, because it may get through eventually, that if the Victorian Government ran its factory efficiently it would achieve value for the dollar. Perhaps the members of the Victorian Government have never been in the position of working in a factory where every month people are threatened with the sack. If they had, perhaps they would give some security to those who have worked for many years in the Housing Commission and the Holmesglen construction factory and who have given very good service. The end product depends upon the flow-through in factories such as Holmesglen. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Evidently Opposition members who have not been in the House all day are more intent on stifling debate on the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill than on listening to it. </para>
          <para>However welcome more money may be to all the State housing commissions, that is not the basic reason for the lack of housing available at reasonable rents. More money will not cope completely with the welfare housing problem. Its roots go very deep and go back into the years when the Liberal-Country Party Government was in power, uninterrupted, for 23 years. That Government did not even get down to the basic problem or the need for providing welfare housing. During its 23 years of office- I repeat, uninterrupted it did not even get down to the basic problem of attempting to harness the price of land. One big thing that sends the price of a house sky high is the uncontrolled price of land. In Victoria as I am sure is the case in other areas, it is the developers who jump onto the land and send the price skyrocketing. It has also been the practice in Victoria that enormous tracts of land are bought by the Housing Commission out of taxpayers money at greatly inflated prices and the only people who make any profit out of this are certainly not the people who should be benefiting from the welfare housing but the developer. </para>
          <para>The State control or lack of control is responsible for the tremendous increases in the price of land. The crocodile tears that come from the Opposition concerning housing for the old people or for young couples do not impress me at all. Members of the Opposition should look at their track record. It is there for everyone to see both in the Federal and the State sphere. There has been no move from honourable members opposite or from their State counterparts to hold the price of land from escalating. There are large waiting lists in Victoria for Housing Commission homes. One waits for  2  to  2Vi  years if one has  5  children or more, and one waits for  4  years if one has fewer than  5  children. The real tragedy lies with those who cannot find adequate housing. It is people we are talking about here really and people&#39;s lives, not the actual houses. Real tragedy results from paying high rents. In practically every other sphere wages have kept up with prices but certainly not in rents. Most families which are paying rent are paying one-third of their take-home pay in rent and no family budget can cope with this. </para>
          <para>Much more welfare housing should be available. If the past governments, State and Federal, had set their sights on the provision of welfare housing in their long terms in office we might now be able to hold our heads up as some of the Scan dan avian countries can and say that we can provide housing for those who cannot afford to provide it for themselves and we can provide it at a rent they can afford to pay. The provision of housing needs planning, thought and understanding. One needs to know the problems. One needs to see the suffering and the misery caused by inadequate housing. One needs to care about the people and their problems. We have to face our problems in Australia and overcome our past apathy and dedicate our efforts to caring for those who need help. </para>
          <para>I reject the idea that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that people have to learn to stand on their own  2  feet and provide for themselves. It may be news to the Opposition but many people just cannot do this. I sincerely endorse the desire of most people to own their own homes but for many it is just not possible and for many it is just not practical. The families which because of their jobs have to move regularly, rent their homes because it is more practical. As well, many older people who move from family homes into units or flats prefer to rent. We need to provide a diversity of welfare housing to suit all age groups and all aspects of living. Of course families do better in houses where there is a garden for the children to play in and marriages fare better when the family is adequately housed. Inadequate housing causes stress on marriages. We, as representatives of the Australian electorate should maintain our concentration on making welfare housing available. It will be a great contribution to the quality of life for our constituents. I commend the Minister and the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>-This is a very sad measure because the Government has decreased in a significant way the amount of funds which it will provide for welfare housing. Forget all the argumentation that has been put forward and the argumentation as to amounts of money. Let it be quite clear: The amount of real assistance to housing and to the area of welfare housing, which is only part of the market, has been decreased by an effective  20  per cent. So what has happened is that after the riot of extravagance for a year or two has come the pinch of want. That pinch has been applied with respect to housing and the places in which Australian families and households live and develop. That proposition and that fact are contrary to the whole Australian tradition. The fact that it has occurred ought to be recorded and recorded rather sadly. Nowhere is it made clearer than in the publication that came out earlier today in relation to building approvals for Australia up to September this year. Even in the field of government housing approvals over the last  2  months, for August and September of this year, have been something like  40  per cent to  50  per cent below what they were for the same  2  months of last year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>While there may be argumentation by the Government that it has in fact kept up the level of assistance in welfare housing to States, the States obviously do not feel free enough to be able to keep up the level of approvals at which houses will be commenced and at which houses will be completed as in the previous year. The cut that has occurred could not occur only in one State; it has occurred over the lot because the magnitude of the decline is too great. In August and September last year more than  2600  approvals were given for government dwellings. In August and September this year the figure is  1560.  That is a significant decline and it has to be explained. One feels rather sad that the explanation for it lies in some words which the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Riordan)</inline> uttered. He had not been in his position very long but the words tumbled out. All the State Housing Ministers know that a promise which was made to them has not been kept. I shall read the Minister&#39;s words. They are very important. They are convoluted. He was a new Minister. He did not know the consequences of what was being said. I shall read the one long sentence. He said: </para>

            <para>The funds that will now be available to Queensland and Western Australia are clearly advanced on the basis that they will be considered in the light of next year&#39;s commitments in the same way as funds that have been made available to the other States will have to be considered next year in the light of what has been achieved and what has been made available in the last year. </para>

          <para class="block">That simply means that a promise made in one year was to be kept in respect of the next year. What has occurred is that the promise has not been kept. It is as simple as that. </para>

              <para>-I am just going on the words which have been uttered. The words came out and they had no meaning. But of course it was quite legitimate that the Minister should use those words because previously during the Queensland State election campaign- the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> campaigned there strongly but he did not do very well- the Prime Minister made some comments and the Minister supported him in his statement 6 months later. The Prime Minister said that his Government would pay for every Housing Commission house for which the Queensland Government could let a contract. That is a proposition made with respect to one State which has had a real and significant cut in its allocation of funds. There were 2 statements, the statement of the Prime Minister when the Minister for Housing and Construction was a backbencher and the statement of the Minister made 6 months later. There is no retreating from the words even though $360m is being made available in money terms for this purpose this year. The rate of inflation with respect to capital dwelling expenditure calculated from the national accounts is of the order of 20 per cent up to June. If one deflates that figure of $360m one will see that what has been given is $290m in 1974-75 dollars, not $364m or anything like it. So there has been a real and a calculated drop in welfare housing. </para>

          <para>This is the kind of thinking that has bedevilled and led the Government- and regrettably split the Labor Party- to such a continued series of errors in respect of housing. Three or four years ago the Labor Party had scheme after scheme with respect to housing. Let me go through some of them. Twelve months before the 1972 election it had the celebrated scheme for a 2 per cent reduction in interest rates. Money was going to be made available from all kinds of financial institutions at 2 per cent less than the going rate. Of course it had a dreadful set of circumstances then. The long term bond rate was 6% per cent. That scheme failed and it was dropped because it was found that it just would not work. In fact, were it to have been put into operation it would have forced up the cost of money and the cost of interest rates more than otherwise would have been the case. That scheme was dropped. </para>
          <para>There was another scheme whereby money was going to be made available from savings banks, particularly the Commonwealth Savings Bank. A rate of 3% per cent was mentioned. That scheme was dropped because it was a failure. Then the Financial Corporations Bill was passed in this House last year. Part of the propaganda with respect to it said: &#39;Give us the power over all financial institutions, give us power over banks, give us power over financial corporations, give us power over building societies in the States, give us power over all the non-bank financial institutions and we will bring interest rates down&#39;. That is one of the statements that was made continually. </para>

              <para>-A multitude of your Ministers. They said: &#39;Give us this power and we will bring the cost of money down. We will make it available for you&#39;. Of course the cost has not come down to a significant extent and it is not going to remain down, because the Government has forgotten that if it interferes in this area something will break out elsewhere. That is essentially the error that has been made by the Government continually in the housing field. It always has a nice scheme but never one that works. The mortgage insurance scheme was one which was promoted by a newspaper proprietor who now does not find very much satisfaction with the Labor Party. It was always a mess because it was unfair to people. The Government, having introduced this as a principal policy in 1972, having re promoted it in 1974, is now leaving the limits at levels that are becoming quite inadequate and meaningless, compared with real wages and the cost of housing. That scheme, put up by a party bent on welfare, was designed to assist those who built the most expensive houses, who saved the least and who negotiated the highest interest rates on money. It failed. </para>

          <para>We see that over the years there has been a basic lack of understanding of what is involved in housing. An unalterable social obligation was taken on when a new era of housing was undertaken in Australia. It was held to be undertaken, quite honestly enough, by a Labor government. It was undertaken in the years towards the end and just after the end of World War II. The unalterable social obligation was that homes for people to own would be available to those who wanted to own them and homes for people to rent would be available to those who wanted to rent them. That obligation undertaken in 1945, like the obligation to secure full employment in Australia also undertaken in 1945, has been put aside. They have both been callously disregarded by the Government. </para>
          <para>The tragedy is that thousands and thousands of Australians are hurt. The tragedy is that thousands of young people recently married or contemplating marriage or hoping to form a family and set up a family are disadvantaged. Unless housing is adequately cared for and there is an understanding of the processes whereby it can be cared for, these people are hurt. If there is any area of social obligation which is as sensitive as any other, I believe it is the field of housing. You have an independently minded people and a people willing to make their own decisions only if they live in a substantially home owning Australian community. The two go together. Like the undertaking concerning full employment, the obligation concerning housing has been swept aside. It has been forgotten. It is nonsense for any government to talk about welfare and say that it is a welfare government when these 2 very basic social obligations have been forgotten. </para>
          <para>I know there are socialists in this world. Some are great reformists; some are complete socialists. One of the less creditable socialists, a theorist, was Proudhon. One can only feel that the Government is a little bit like Proudhon, whose attitude was that socialism means that property is theft. It seems to me that the Government is carrying that dictum into housing and what households should mean and what they are in Australia. </para>
          <para>There has been a continual list of failures. I put one proposition to the Government Parts of the Priorities Review Staff report are excellent. Parts of that report make it quite clear that substantially it is a flow of funds that is important in terms of housing, and one of the most important areas which is responsible for the flow of funds involves the savings banks. The Commonwealth Savings Bank is the most dominant bank in this field. I put something to the Government which I have not been able to understand since July 1973 when a list of severe monetary policy measures was put into operation by the Government. The Commonwealth Savings Bank, compared with other savings banks, has consistently held less of its assets in housing than have either the private savings banks or the State Savings Bank of Victoria. What has happened unfortunately is that the Commonwealth Housing Bank has allowed itself to become an instrument for the maintenance of the monetary policy of the Government. It has been engaged in security buying and selling and has been concerned with the loan market, inscribed stock and so on. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Savings Bank ought not to be an arm of the monetary management of this country, as other banks are. It was set up with a different charter and for a different purpose. I shall give 3 sets of figures because they are quite important. At August this year the Commonwealth Savings Bank had 33.4 per cent of its assets in housing. All the other private savings banks had an average of 38.5 per cent of their assets in housing. The State Savings Bank of Victoria had just on 35 per cent of its assets in housing. So continually one feels that the Commonwealth Savings Bank is misconstruing the purposes for which it was instituted and is doing so especially in respect of this field of endeavour. </para>
          <para>I shall make a final point which should influence the Minister. If one looks at the administration of housing policy by States, those States in which the Commonwealth Savings Bank dominates the savings bank field are obviously the most susceptible. The 2 States in which the Commonwealth Savings Bank dominates the savings bank field are New South Wales and Queensland. In each of those States the Commonwealth Savings Bank has either a little under or a little over half of the total market. It can operate as an effective oligopolist. I ask the Minister to investigate the administration of the Commonwealth Savings Bank policy in respect of housing Australia wide and to explain what has happened since July 1973. We should remember that that Bank is vitally concerned with housing and was set up as the people&#39;s bank. Those who would normally obtain their housing finance from that Bank ought not to be the victims of its administration of monetary policy. </para>
          <para>There is a warning in the Priorities Review Staff report about this administration of monetary policy. People who desire housing and who want to form homes and families ought not to be made the first and the most lasting victims of monetary policy. I know the Minister will be sympathetic to that matter. I know that the Minister desires to do all he can in this field. We know that he made one or two mistakes in June this year. A promise tumbled out from a new Minister who was entranced with the position that he held. But we forget that. We ask him to look at this field to see what he can do concerning the flow of funds between institutions concerned with housing in Australia and certainly to remember above all that we will not fix up the housing problem totally unless we fix up a distressed, alien and very severely disadvantaged economy. </para>

            <para>-We have recently had the benefit of reading the comprehensive and detailed Henderson Report on Poverty in Australia. That excellent document throws light on a subject which previous governments have preferred to brush under the carpet. Even the briefest glance at the section of the Henderson report dealing with housing leads one to the conclusion that for the lower income groups there is always a housing problem. In boom periods those economically deprived people cannot afford houses and in periods of recession they are the people who become unemployed and are still just as far from adequate accommodation for themselves and their families. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not propose to go into the detailed recommendations of the Henderson report as they affect housing. Suffice it to say that this Government has recognised the problem and has been trying to do something constructive about it since it came to office. The figures of money paid by this Government to the States for housing, compared with those of the previous Government speak for themselves. If we look back at the advances made to the States for welfare housing by the Australian Government we find a dramatic jump in the year 1973-74, the first financial year this Government was in office. The following year saw an even greater increase from $218.65m to $385.4m. In this financial year the amount allocated is $364.6m. Bearing in mind the $ 10.4m advanced in June 1975 on the basis that it would be taken into account in this year&#39;s allocation- the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Riordan)</inline> advised the State Ministers of that fact- the advances in 1975-76 will be maintained at the greatly increased 1974-75 level. The last 2 years&#39; allocation will be <inline font-style="italic">2lA</inline> times greater than the allocation for welfare housing from State loan funds in the last 2 years of the previous Government, which were $161.5min 1971-72 and$163.2min 1972-73. </para>

              <para>-They are the figures which reflect quite clearly that it is 2V4 times as much. One cannot account for that with inflation or anything else. In spite of the substantial advances in the 1975-76 financial year, already many State Housing Ministers have been squealing about a drastic cutback. If we take my State of Victoria as an example, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickie</inline> has been vociferous in his cry of a drastic cutback. The claim is patently untrue. This year the Victorian Government, under the provisions of this Bill, will get $98. 1 5m- exactly the same as last year. However, as honourable members are aware, this money is shared between the State housing Authorities- in Victoria, the Housing Commissioned the home builders&#39; account. On the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickie</inline> and with the agreement of this Government 70 per cent- $68. 7m- was allocated to the Housing Commission which is $6.9m more than last year&#39;s total. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There are of course, very good reasons why the amount of money allocated for welfare housing this year does not follow the dramatic increases of the past 2 years. One of the reasons is just the point that I have made- the dramatic increases of the past 2 years. It would be economically irresponsible to continue the increases in the government housing sector at that rate at present. The second reason is that there is now strong evidence of a recovery in the private home building sector. That has been by no means a sudden and dramatic recovery; surely nobody would want that. But it has been a recovery at a steady pace, which is what the Budget is aiming at. The September figures for building approvals reinforce the Government&#39;s strategy in this year&#39;s Budget. Dwelling approvals in September this year at 13 513 were 19 per cent above the August level of 1 1 375. In seasonally adjusted terms the increase in total dwelling approvals was less pronounced at 10 per cent. However, the September 1975 figure was the second highest figure recorded since July 1974. Also, the allocations for 1975-76 are limited by the general budgetary constraints and they are designed to bring about stability and control of inflation. </para>
          <para>It is difficult to reconcile the amendment presently before the House, which has been moved by the Opposition and which is critical of the amount of money being allocated in this Bill, with the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in relation to the Budget. He then spoke of the need to cut back $ 1,000m in Government spending. He was very careful not to be too precise about where this money would be cut back. He gave some examples, such as doing away with the Australian Legal Aid Office and the like. But what about the other $500m which was mentioned? I think we can go back to the track record of the previous Government to see what concern it had about welfare housing. We can be fairly sure that one of the casualties would be welfare housing. In spite of this, the substantial advances in the 1975-76 financial year will allow State housing authorities to complete more welfare dwellings than has been the case for many years. That is what this Bill is all about. </para>
          <para>The question is, of course, whether all these housing authorities will use this money to its greatest advantage. In my home State of Victoria I fear- in fact I know- that this has not always been the case. I wonder whether if the $98m that the Victorian Government will be allocated under this Bill will be squandered in the same way as the previous grants which have been allocated. Some may take exception to the word &#39;squandered&#39;, but I am mindful of the fact that the Victorian Housing Minister and his departmental officers have not always used this money wisely. Time and time again we have seen the Victorian Housing Com miss sion paying highly inflated prices for land which, had the Commission moved a little earlier, would have been bought much more cheaply. Time and time again we have seen that the people who are benefiting from this are the developers and not the people whom we are aiming to help with welfare housing- the poorer people in this community whom we are trying to assist to get homes. </para>
          <para>Time and time again the Victorian Liberal Government has rejected suggestions to freeze land prices, which it has the power to do. The suggestions have not been heeded. Indeed, had the Victorian Liberal Government and the parties in opposition in this Parliament had the political and economic foresight they claim to have, they would have supported this Government&#39;s referendum to control prices and incomes and we would not be faced with the inflationary situation which be devils this country today. At a recent meeting in my electorate a woman  speaker  brought up the question of the present policy of the Victorian Housing Commission in building homes costing $30,000 and the difficulties faced by people trying to buy them. There is nothing wrong in building homes costing this much, but the incredible thing about all this is that if a person is within the financial range to be eligible for one of these homes he cannot afford it and if a person has the money to be able to afford one of these $30,000 homes he is not eligible according to the Housing Commission regulations. In Victoria the needs test eligibility limit at present stands at $130 a week for a family with up to 2 children, while in New South Wales the figure is $133.71 a week. </para>
          <para>In all fairness, it should be reported that the Victorian Minister for Housing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickie,</inline> issued a denial of this in a letter to a local newspaper. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Liberal Government in Victoria is terribly proud of the fact that since coming to office in 1 955, their policy of home ownership has been instrumental in nearly 45 000 of the 85 000 home units which have been built by the Housing Commission being sold to eligible applicants. It has been the Socialist Government in Canberra . . . which has unfortunately forced upon the Liberal Government in Victoria policies whereby there are now extreme restrictions on home ownership. It has been the policies of the Socialist Government in Canberra that has forced the cost of housing built by the Housing Commission to a figure now in the vicinity of $30,000 . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is more to the Housing Minister&#39;s letter, but that is the essence of what he had to say. It is significant that the Victorian Housing Minister does not specifically rebut the charge that these $30,000 homes are beyond the reach of most Housing Commission applicants. It is equally significant that the Housing Minister makes no reference to the singularly inept way in which the Victorian Housing Commission has gone about acquiring land for these homes. One could give many examples in my home city of Dandenong of land being purchased at peak prices. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para>
          <para>Before I was interrupted by the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron),</inline> who seems particularly concerned that honourable members should be present to listen to speakers from this side of the House but who is equally determined that no one should listen to anyone on his side of the House, I was talking about the Victorian Housing Minister and the inept way in which the Victorian Housing Commission has gone about acquiring land for the homes that it builds. The Commission has paid fantastically high prices when it could have imposed a ceiling, had it wished. It has bought land in the area of Pakenham- just alongside my electorate which is said to be flood prone. The Victorian Housing Minister also makes no reference, in his terribly proud letter which I read to the House a moment ago, to the fact that there is a 4 to4&#189; years waiting period for Housing Commission homes. He also makes no reference to the fact that, when people were crying out for homes, in the private sector considerable speculative building was going on in the heart of Melbourne; skyscrapers were going up on just about every piece of land in the city. Now we are faced with a situation in which there are literally hundreds of acres of vacant office space in the city of Melbourne. It might be added that the people who own these places are content to let them remain vacant. It is cheaper, in terms of taxation, for these places to remain unoccupied than for the owners to have to pay taxes on the rents. </para>
          <para>I must confess that I can see nothing of which the Victorian Housing Commission can be terribly proud in seeing building materials, which at that time were so sorely needed for home building, being diverted into useless and vacant office blocks. This whole matter of welfare housing is of considerable importance to me. It comes close to home because it is one of the most important of the problems that exist in my electorate of Holt, which is one of the fastest developing outer metropolitan areas. Let me add one point. One of the great needs in areas such as mine is the need for emergency housing, such as overnight accommodation, housing for a week or a fortnight- any sort of housing and for a variety of reasons. I am quite certain that, if we had the full co-operation of the Victorian Liberal Government and its Minister for Housing instead of the frustration we experience now, much of the misery occasioned by this housing shortage could be overcome. I welcome this Bill because it approves more than $364m for welfare housing. It is my earnest hope that it will be used by State governments to its greatest possible advantage. </para>
