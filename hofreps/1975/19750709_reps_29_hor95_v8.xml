        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bert</inline>Milliner was held in the highest respect and affection by everyone in the Parliament. All of us, especially those, like myself, who counted him a personal and a family friend, were saddened by his death last week at the age of 63. We shall remember his endearing personal qualities of kindliness, good humour, wisdom and integrity. </para>
        <para>He was elected to the Senate in 1967 and his term began in July of the following year. For more than a quarter of a century he played an honoured role in public life, serving his union, his Party, the Parliament and the nation with dedication and distinction. He had a host of friends in fraternal, community, industrial and political circles. </para>
        <para>By trade he was a printer, traditionally the most skilled of all crafts. He loved his trade; he excelled in it; he brought added lustre to all who follow it. He took office with the printing unions in 195 1 and continued to hold office for 17 years. During this time he helped bring about the amalgamation of the major printing unions in Australia in 1966 when the Printing and Kindred Industries Union was formed. He was the Queensland Secretary of that union and of the Printing Industry Employees Union of Australia, as it was known before the amalgamation, from 1954 to 1968. He was a vice-president of the federal union from 1951 to 1968. He was a member of the Queensland Central Executive of the Australian Labor Party from 1 944 to 1 967 and  President  of the Queensland Branch from 1958 to 1967. </para>
        <para>He served the Parliament as a member of numerous committees, including the Library Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and, not unexpectedly, the Printing Committee- later known as the Publications Committee- of which he was  Chairman.  He was the  Chairman  of Directors of radio station 4KQ in Brisbane for 9 years from 1958 to 1967. He represented Australia as an adviser on trade union matters at the International Labor Organisation Conferences in 1954 and 1964. </para>
        <para>Bert Milliner was born and raised a Queenslander. He came from a fine family and he leaves a fine family. Many of us were among the hundreds of mourners who attended his funeral service in Brisbane last Thursday. Honourable members will deplore that the occasion was marred by a display of loutishness and vulgarity by sections of the media that brought great distress to his family and friends and lasting discredit to those responsible. That contemptible incident will not, however, impair the memory of Bert Milliner. He will be missed by all who enjoyed the warmth of his company, by all who worked with him, and by all who knew and admired his exemplary personal qualities. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition wishes to associate itself warmly with the expressions of sympathy given on the occasion of the death recently of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bertie</inline> Milliner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> was a quiet man who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and earned the respect of members of both chambers and on both sides of the House. He had a reputation for being a conscientious and industrious executive of the Queensland Branch of the Australian Labor Party and these qualities were displayed during his membership of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 1970 and during his period as  Chairman  of that Committee from 1973. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> as I think the Prime Minister has told us, also served on the Publications Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade and the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline>was an industrial officer and Secretary of the Queensland Branch of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union for 17 years until 1966, a member of the Queensland Apprenticeship Committee during 1965-66, and  Chairman  of Directors of the Labor Party's radio station 4KQ, as the Prime Minister also told us. He was popular amongst members of all parties and he was generous in his attitude towards members on our side of the House. The Senate and the Parliament have lost a gentlemanly person and the Opposition would want to express its warmest sympathy to his family. </para>

          <para>- I would like to associate my Party and myself with the condolence remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition at the very sad and sudden death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bertie</inline> Richard Milliner. Whilst I did not have much involvement with him my Senate colleagues speak of him as a very warm-hearted and friendly person and one for whom they had the highest regard. He was a very active senator and was involved with many committees. He entered the Senate as a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party from Queensland and had a long and active involvement with the trade union movement in that State. We are very sad to see one of our colleagues leave us so suddenly. The Prime Minister remarked on the unfortunate coverage of his funeral by the media last week. I was not in the country but I have heard a lot of remarks similar to those that the Prime Minister made and I feel sorry for his family that there was such a coverage. On behalf of my Party I would like to extend our deepest condolence to his wife and his family. </para>

          <para>- I wish to associate myself with this motion of condolence to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Milliner</inline> and the Milliner family. I met <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> almost 30 years ago because of his interest in the Boy Scouts Association, as it then was. While the record of his public life and his political career has been placed before the House this afternoon, many of us will remember him principally as a family man. While we had a long association with him in political life, we shall remember his activities in public affairs outside the political arena. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Bert Milliner was born at Kelvin Grove and lived in the Kelvin Grove and Newmarket suburbs of Brisbane all of his life. He was very active in public affairs in that district, mainly in association with his family interests. He was a former employee of the Queensland Government Printing Office and he was father of the chapel there. Prior to becoming a paid officer of the Printing Industry Employees Union he gave many long years of honorary service to that Union, which is now the Printing and Kindred Industries Union. He was extremely well regarded in his work place at the Queensland Government Printing Office.  His  trade union activities are well known to honourable members. He had a particular interest in apprenticeship and in young people. He was a member of the Queensland Apprenticeship Committee. I know from my own personal experience of Bert Milliner that he took a great interest in the problems that sometimes young apprentices meet in their careers. As the  President  of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party he brought great integrity to that position. He was always a very fair and impartial man and he ensured that the best democratic traditions of the Australian Labor Party were upheld. After being elected to the Senate he represented Queensland members and senators on the Queensland Central Executive of the Party, of which he had, of course, a very long membership. He was active, as indeed other members of his family have been, for very many years in the Masonic Lodge. He was formerly active in the Boy Scouts Association as secretary of a scout group. He was, until he died, active with the Churchill Trust. </para>
        <para>I am sure that many people in Brisbane, in callings and in areas of the community quite outside the Labor Party, will long remember Bert Milliner.  His  major recreation activity in recent times was his association with the Newmarket Bowls Club, of which his wife is  president  of the ladies section at the present time. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House will long remember Bert Milliner not only as a colleague, whether in Government or in Opposition, but also as a fine family man, a good citizen and a fine friend. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>as one who knew our late colleague very well and who knows his family very well, may I be associated personally with this motion. There were significant political differences between the late senator and myself, but he never allowed a difference in any way to diminish the friendship between the two of us. I have spent many very happy hours with him and with his family, arguing over a great variety of things; but right throughout such arguments 2 qualities always emerged- a powerful, unfailing sense of humanity and a quite unwavering sense of humour. I can recall writing to him shortly before his death, when he was stricken with an illness, to say that there was nothing very much wrong with him and that half a bottle of rum and a rub down with some of it would cure anything that was wrong with him. My friend wrote back and said that he did not believe in using rum for the purposes of embrocation. That was typical of him. Bert Milliner leaves a very devoted and very dedicated family. Our hearts and prayers go out to them today. </para>

I wish to record my deep sympathy to his widow, Thelma; to his sons, Des and Glen; to his daughters, Vanda and Jan; and to their families. Bert came into my office at approximately 1 1.45 a.m. on Monday, 30 June. He went away and returned at about 12.10 p.m. On each occasion, as always, he had a happy and friendly greeting for the girls in my office. He stayed and spoke to me until about 12.20. He talked of current political events. As usual, he was well informed and wise in his comments because, as always, he was intensely interested and involved. Within 10 minutes of his leaving I rushed to his office in answer to a call by his secretary and together we were with him as he quietly passed away, most fittingly, as he had lived for many years, working for his fellow Queenslanders. </para>

        <para>Reference has been made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Country Party to the disgraceful performance of certain sections of the media at the cremation service of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner.</inline> I will say no more than that. As one who was present and, I am sure, like the Prime Minister and so many others, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner's</inline> family, I was disgusted to see how the filming of those events was used, particularly by Channel 2 in its television program that evening. </para>
        <para>It will be a lifelong fond memory of mine that I was regarded by Bert as one of his friends. He was in every sense a gentleman, <inline font-style="italic">strong-willed,</inline> determined when necessary, capable, understanding and tolerant. I could go on and aptly describe him in many other ways as the gentleman that so many honourable senators know that he was. I conclude by saying that a great number of his fellow Queenslanders, particularly those in the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party which he served for so many years, will always look back in the knowledge that our lives have benefited in many ways from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner's</inline> efforts during his life. </para>

          <para>- I simply want to place on record the feeling of loss that I am sure the passing of Bert Milliner brings to the people of the Australian Capital Territory as well as to me, in particular, as the Minister for the Capital Territory. I wish also to place on record a tribute to the work that he did as the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. Membership of a parliamentary committee can be a mixed blessing. It can bring its frustrations. Chairmanship can do this even more so. But the people of the Australian Capital Territory can be grateful for the service that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> gave in attempting to create a formula upon which the further progress of this community towards self-government could be advantaged. I deeply regret his passing.  His  death is more than just a loss to this parliament or to his family; it is a loss to the people he was serving in the capacity of  Chairman  of that Committee. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">This House has been recalled so that once and for all the people of Australia may hear and judge any allegations of impropriety, illegality, malpractice or malfeasance against the Government or any Minister. In all the welter of information and misinformation of the past 2 weeks, in all the orgy of trivia drummed up as investigative reporting, one clear fact emerges: No responsible person has expressly or directly made any specific charge of impropriety, of illegal or corrupt conduct on the part of my Government, myself or any individual Minister. Innuendo, insinuation, the sneer, the smear, certainly; the </para>
          <para class="block">Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and his  Deputy,  willing to wound yet afraid to strike, have proved adept at it; but no specific charges. If such charges are to be made, this is the place to make them. Now is the time to make them. Now is the time to put up or shut up. </para>
          <para>The privileges of this Parliament fully protect members who believe that their information, even partial information, even suspect information, would warrant making specific charges of impropriety against Ministers which the laws of defamation might render dangerous if made outside. Here allegations can be made, persons can be named and documents can be produced with impunity and immunity. It is not only a privilege which Parliament bestows but a responsibility which it imposes. Through this Parliament Ministers are responsible to the people, but an equal responsibility rests with Opposition members, to produce their information if they have any, to formulate their charges if they have any. This is the place to make them; this is the place where they shall be answered. The inquisition by innuendo is over. This is the tribunal in which the Opposition as much as the Government will be judged- in the highest court, by the jury of the people. We are all on trial now. </para>
          <para>There is a special and overriding reason why this Parliament is the proper place. For it is upon the very question of proper parliamentary conduct that the one authentic event in a week of squalid intrigue turned- not the pseudo events of the media but the one definite event, tremendous in the life of a party, of a nation; supremely tragic in the life of a man. On 2 July I advised the Governor-General to terminate the commission of the Minister for Environment. As documents which I made public on 1 and 2 July make clear, I took that decision and was obliged to take that decision on 2 grounds. They were the sole grounds for that decision. First, there was a total discrepancy between a reply given on 4 June and a letter written on 7 March 1975. Secondly, reported activities by a ministerial officer, a government employee, would make it possible for him to make a profit from his position on his Minister's staff. I received no satisfactory explanation for these activities. </para>
          <para>The explanation I sought from the Minister did not concern the propriety or prudence of any activities he had entered into as Treasurer concerning petro-dollar loan raisings. I emphasise this to draw the contrast between my decision to transfer him from the Treasury to Environment on 6 June and my decision to advise the Governor-General to terminate his commission. </para>
          <para class="block">The first decision sprang from my belief in the unwisdom of his action. </para>
          <para>In the case of his dismissal the issue was very precise. The standards which this Government sets and upon which I insist were not upheld. The personal integrity of my colleague was not an issue and is not in doubt. The fault was grievous, but it lies not in his integrity or reputation as a man of honour. He has rendered remarkable service to his Party and the nation. But the lapse from the standards which this Prime Minister at least, and this Government at least, insist upon left me with no choice. </para>
          <para>And in this lies the supreme irony of the present occasion. The dismissal of a  Deputy  Prime Minister, for whatever reason, cannot but be damaging to any Government. This dismissal of a  Deputy  Leader, from the Ministry, particularly one held in the regard- the affection- of his Party in and out of Parliament as is the honourable member for Lalor, is a tragedy for all the Party, not least its Leader. The course was taken because it had to be taken, because of standards, because of parliamentary propriety. </para>
          <para>Yet the Government and Party which has set for itself these standards and which has shown in action how swift, complete, condign is the penalty for any lapse from them, is at the same time being smeared for improper conduct. The House can judge these matters for itself. I ask leave of the House to present papers related to overseas loan negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris and to move a motion to authorise the publication of the papers. </para>

            <para class="block">My dear Prime Minister, </para>
            <para class="block">You will recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> you and I decided some time ago that it was desirable to investigate the availability of funds from OPEC sources for loan in Australia. </para>
            <para class="block">On many occasions people wrote, phoned or otherwise communicated with me and stated that large amounts of money were available. Almost without exception I became satisfied any follow up would be fruitless. </para>
            <para class="block">I had always stated the position to be, as I informed you on several occasions, that the Australian Government is willing to borrow on terms and conditions suitable to us, that we desired only to deal directly with principals or owners of funds, not with intermediaries, and that in the event of a successful loan we would pay the proper commission. </para>
            <para class="block">In March of this year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris of 6 South Court, Bulleen, Victoria, told me he was going overseas on business and would be able to make inquiries about public borrowing. </para>
            <para class="block">He showed me a letter which he suggested I might give to him. I considered the matter but told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> that I could not provide him with this kind of letter, but instead gave him a note dated 10 March 1 975, a copy of which is attached. </para>
            <para class="block">I made it clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> that he was to inquire overseas, not to enter into negotiations in any way, and that he did not represent the Australian Government and could make no claim on the government or myself, and was merely to make inquiries and notify me of the results. </para>
            <para class="block">This he clearly understood and understands today. </para>
            <para class="block">On 15 April 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> came to see me again and showed me two more letters which had been drafted by him. I found them unacceptable and said they should be destroyed and I provided him with two letters dated 15 April 1975, copies of which are attached. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> these were the letters he should use and no others, reiterating the points I have made above. </para>
            <para class="block">On Sunday, 1 June, I examined a Treasury file 75/038. 1 saw in it copies of the three letters to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline></para>
            <para class="block">I saw also two notes signed Ed Shann, one dated 6 May, and the other 13 April 1975. Copies of these two notes are attached. </para>
            <para class="block">In Paris I received a memorandum from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, a copy of which is attached. A copy of this memorandum appears in the Treasury file 75/038. </para>
            <para class="block">I direct your attention to the fact that a typed version of two of the letters appears in the memorandum as having been sent to the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department for opinion and in that typed version the first paragraph, I submit a very significant one in regard to any opinion about any legal relationships that may exist, was omitted. </para>
            <para class="block">Despite these points <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> was allowed to go ahead and give an opinion that an agency existed. Immediately he became aware from me of the background information and of the oral communication between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> said to me that the matter 'was different and no agency existed'. This could have been established at first if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, aware of the reaction of the Attorney-General's Department, had asked me if there was any background information or any oral communication. </para>

              <para>Letter A indicates that its purpose would be to enable the bearer to make enquiries on behalf of the Minister and therefore on behalf of the Australian Government. The terms of the letter clearly imply that an Agency relationship existed between the bearer and the government for the purpose of making enquiries into, and recommendations on the availability of moneys for borrowing. However, the letter suggests that, after making the recommendations, the recipient would not have any further function in relation to the transaction which would be completed by the government. </para>

              <para>Letter B refers to payment of a "commission"- a word appropriate to a broker or other agent. 5.I therefore think that the recipient of a letter would be an agent for the purposes described in paragraph 3.

            <para>Letter A makes no references to the remuneration of the agent or reimbursement of his expenses. If letter B did not exist, and if there were no written or oral arrangements to the contrary, it would probably be inferred from letter A that the agent was entitled to reasonable remuneration and reimbursement of his expenses reasonably incurred on making enquiries on the Minister's behalf. </para>
            <para>However, letter B indicates that a commission would be paid. The amount of the commission is not stated, but a reasonable commission, assessed according to percentages or in what other manner is customary in the business of finance broking in the relevant markets would probably be payable. Whether expenses should be reimbursed in addition to the percentage fee would depend on the custom. </para>

          <para>Letter B is not in terms limited to borrowing facilitated by the recipient's enquiries and recommendations of the kind referred to in letter A.

            <para class="block">At 3 p.m. today following a request from Attorney-General's Department I discussed the Harris letters ("A" and "B"Harris' name was, of course, not mentioned) with Messrs Menzies, Scott and Byrne, all of Attorney-General's Department </para>
            <para class="block">
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline>did virtually all the talking. The main points he made were:- ? Attorney-General's are reluctant to give advice without all the background information. ? He stressed that the letters were vague and that they implied some oral contract may have accompanied them. ? A letter of the " B " type was "legally undesirable ' '. </para>
            <para class="block">Menzies then asked if the letters had been given to someone by the Treasurer. I said they had been given by a Minister who could have been the Treasurer. Menzies assumed from then on that the Minister was the Treasurer. He asked how certain was the Department of the existence and authenticity of the letters. I said that there was no doubt about either. He asked whether the matter had been raised directly with the Treasurer. I said that the matter of giving authorities to individuals was a matter which had been raised on many occasions but that the Treasurer had admitted to the Secretary that he had given such letters to an individual. Menzies asked whether the individual was known to the Treasury or to the Treasurer or whether he was just another carpetbagger. I said that he was a man of some standing in the community but that he was not principally engaged in banking or underwriting and that we therefore regarded him as a "commission agent "like any other. </para>
            <para class="block">He asked also if the Treasurer had given the Department copies of the letters. I said it had not but they had come to us in a way which created some difficulty for us. (While letter "A" came through Davey via Bunting, letter "B" was provided by Shann). </para>
            <para class="block">Menzies suggested that a solution to our problem might be for Attorney-General's to advise Enderby and for Enderby to discuss it with Cairns. I made no comment on that suggestion. </para>
            <para class="block">I emphasised to Menzies that the (political) delicacy of the situation was only one aspect and that Attorney-General 's advice was sought not only with a view to our informing the Treasurer of any implications for him ( Menzies assumed that any written Attorney-General's advice would be simply passed to the Treasurer) but with a view to Attorney-General's advising us of any difficulties which may arise with respect to paying either a commission on any loan which may arise (note the vagueness of the letter, "B" and the relevance of an oral contract), or in meeting from an appropriation any other incidental expenses which may arise. I also said we were hopeful of advice on any other wider implications which these letters might have for the Treasurer and the Treasury which they may care to give. </para>
            <para class="block">I also reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> of our earlier request for advice on the Minister for Minerals and Energy's letter to Khemlani of 16 December. (We sought Attorney-General's advice on 20 December and still have no reply). Menzies considered the "K" affair dead and said he wasn't particularly concerned to reply to that request. </para>
            <para class="block">In summary, Attorney-General's are reluctant to provide written advice on the basis of the information we have given but, as Menzies had occasion to speak to Harders during my interview with him he said he would not wish to commit the Department as to the form of their advice until he had discussed our request of 6 May with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders.</inline> He said the Department would contact us further about this matter at a later date. </para>

            <para>Mr SPEAKER - In relation to the matter raised this morning by the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> I have considered the relevant precedents including the case involving the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> as referred to by the honourable member for New England. I have concluded that the matter raised does not constitute a prima facie case of privilege. The matter which was raised is more in the nature of a matter of security and on that basis I have ruled that no prima facie case exists on the evidence which is contained in the newspaper article. </para>
            <para>Dr J F CAIRNS (Lalor - Treasurer)- I seek leave to make a statement on this matter. </para>
            <para>Mr SPEAKER - Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. </para>
            <para>Dr J F CAIRNS -The matter that was raised this morning by the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is one with which I am very much concerned. I do not think it necessary that there should be any inquiry by the Privileges Committee or in any other way because I think I can inform the House of the facts and I think the House can make up its mind. This matter arose because of the circumstances following the increase in the price of oil when money estimated by various people at from $30,000m to $60,000m had changed hands and was lying in new parts of the world, not yet under the control of the New York and Swiss banking no uses and available for investment sometimes on long term favourable conditions much better than those obtained from these institutions. This situation was considered by the Government and we decided that it was wise to investigate the possibilities there were in the new areas of the oil exporting countries to arrange suitable long term loans for Australia. We found that there were many individuals who came forward saying that they knew the location of funds. We were aware that the Saudi-Arabian Monetary Authority was a significant potential lender and we considered that it was desirable that these matters should be properly explored outside the conventional channels. So a number of individuals were interviewed, many of them- most of them, almost all of them- were found very quickly to be worthless; but some appeared to be somewhat different. In March a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris who was well known to me, to the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, and to at least one or two members of the front bench today, told me he was going to Europe and that while there he might be able to make some inquiries and give me information that might be useful. I considered that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was trustworthy and therefore I furnished him with 3 notes, one dated 10 March 1975 which read: </para>

            <para>Recently I have been concerned that persons in Europe and elsewhere claim to represent the Australian Government in negotiating loans. No such authority exists. The Australian Government is interested in borrowing on favourable conditions and should any person be able to assist us, we would be glad to hear from him. I am providing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris, holder of Australian Passport No. G740206, and whose signature appears in the margin, with this letter so that he may make inquiries for me. If it is felt necessary to confirm the authenticity of this letter, then with the consent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> this may be done by contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting, - </para>
            <para class="block">To whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was personally known- the High Commissioner in London or the Australian Ambassador in Switzerland in Berne, or direct with me by Telex, Parliament House, Canberra, Australia. In the event that he recommends that any funds are available and I am satisfied with the authenticity of such availability and the terms and conditions for lending are acceptable to me, and the funds are in amounts sufficient for our needs, I would be pleased to take the matter up. </para>
            <para class="block">On the same day I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> a letter, addressed to him, which read: </para>
            <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline></para>
            <para>In the event that the Australian Government or its representatives or nominees successfully negotiates the borrowings of overseas funds introduced or arranged by you, an appropriate commission would be paid to you or your nominees. </para>
            <para>Yours faithfully, </para>
            <para class="block">That is to say, the normal appropriate commission that would be paid in any circumstances to a person who had in fact assisted in the successful conclusion of a loan. I made clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> orally that this created no legal relationship between the two of us, no agency of any sort; it merely authorised him to make inquiries and should he be able to advise the Government in the matter so that a loan resulted from it, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> would be entitled to proper compensation for it, but until that point no relationship of any kind could be assumed to exist. This to me was a matter that required no further attention at all and the letters to which I have just referred were Sled away in my office. When I returned from overseas recently I found that the letters were not in my office; they were missing. I also found in an official Treasury file No. 75/038 a note, written on the notepaper of the Office of the Treasurer. It is written to the Secretary of the Treasury and reads: </para>
            <para>I attach for your information a copy of a letter dated IS April which was on file in this office. I understand you have already seen a copy of a letter of the same date headed 'To Whom it may Concern '. </para>
            <para class="block">It is signed 'Ed. Shann' and the date is 6 May. Also in the same file is a note to the Secretary which reads: </para>
            <para>I understand you have discussed this matter with the Treasurer. This letter was passed out to me for filing and in the circumstances I think you should be aware of it. While the letter is not stamped as having been signed by the Treasurer, the imprint of his signature is visible on the file copy and can be faintly seen on the photocopy. Do you wish me to take any follow-up action of any sort? </para>
            <para>Signed Ed. Shann 13.4.75 </para>
            <para class="block">At no point did anyone in the Treasury notify me of any interest in this matter, and at no time did anyone have consent from me to photocopy any letters or to remove them from my office. On return from a conference at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development I received a communication from the Secretary of the Treasurer which contained a letter the Secretary informed me he had received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders,</inline> the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, which shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> had been sent two letters for his opinion as to the legal relationship, if any, that they might have established. I noticed immediately on looking at letter A, which was addressed 'To Whom it may Concern', that letter A was not a photostat copy of the original letter but was a typed version of it and had 3 paragraphs instead of four. The 3 paragraphs in the letter did not contain the first paragraph which I have already read to the House which said that I had been concerned at the fact that I knew that a number of people overseas were saying that they had the authority of the Australian Government and no such authority existed. That paragraph was not in the letter that apparently had been sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders.</inline> There were some changes in the words of this letter. It was not an exact copy; the words were not significant, but I think the first paragraph was. It seems to me that in a matter where the legal relationship between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and myself was said to be of some importance, this paragraph would surely be important. </para>
            <para>Recently I have been concerned that persons in Europe and elsewhere claim to represent the Australian Government in negotiating loans. No such authority exists. </para>
            <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>understood that no authority existed between him and me and he was authorised merely to make inquiries and report to me accordingly. After my return to Australia, the Prime Minister informed me of this matter and said that he had received advice that an agency relationship did exist between me and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and that he thought that was very unwise, and, as a consequence, he considered that I should not remain as Treasurer. I informed him that I considered there was not an agency relationship, that this had been made very clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and had been accepted by him. He was merely authorised to make inquiries. The Prime Minister said: 'You had better see Harders about that. ' I did so. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> of the circumstances that I have already described to the House and pointed out that the original reference of the matter to the Attorney-General's Department appeared to have some area of uncertainty which I thought he and I could clear up. As evidence of that uncertainty I mentioned to the House that in this file there is a memorandum signed 'I. Hay', who was a senior officer of the Treasury, dated 9 May 1975, which records that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> of the Attorney-General 's Department, had said: </para>
            <para>The Attorney-General's Department are reluctant to give advice without all the background information. </para>
            <para class="block">He, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> stressed that the letters were vague and they implied some oral contract. The Department was reluctant to give advice in the circumstances and said that the letters implied some oral contract. However, I was not informed that that was the position of the Attorney-General 's Department. I was not asked by the Treasury whether there was any oral communication or background and I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> there was. I told him that the oral background was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> understood clearly that all he was authorised to do was to make inquiries, to report to me, and, if a satisfactory arrangement did ever eventuate, then and only then would some kind of legal relationship come into existence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> understood this. </para>
            <para>On being informed of this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> told me that this made the situation different and, in his opinion, there was now no agency between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and myself. The Prime Minister had taken the view, however, that there was an error on my part because I had, in fact, dealt with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> contrary to the advice of the Department. I did disagree with that and said so, but after consideration of the matter for the rest of that day I decided that the fair and proper thing to do was to accept the decision of the Prime Minister in the matter, and I so informed the Parliamentary Labor Party on Tuesday morning. I have now given the House all the facts on this matter as I know them to be. I do not think there is any necessity for any inquiry at all. It is a matter of judgment and, if I have made a mistake in judgment, I accept the consequences. </para>
            <para>Mr SINCLAIR (New England) (4.10)- I seek leave to make a short statement. </para>
            <para>Mr Speakers leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. </para>
            <para>Mr SINCLAIR - The Opposition obviously has not had an opportunity to consider the implications contained in the statement just made to this chamber by the Treasurer. It obviously canvasses a number of grounds which are distinct from those which I raised this morning with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in the suggested reference to the Privileges Committee. I think that it is necessary, however, to indicate that there is a number of areas in relation to parliamentary practices and procedures with which we on this side of the House would still be concerned. </para>
            <para>There seem to be elements regarding the disappearance of letters from the Treasurer's file. There are suggestions that a paragraph has been omitted from one of those letters in a copy that was dispatched to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders.</inline> Therefore, there are obviously matters within the jurisdiction of the Privileges Committee about which we would be concerned. We understand the nature of the ruling you have given, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> We appreciate that the Treasurer has canvassed the whole of the ambit of his assessment of the matter, but on behalf of the Opposition I express my concern that there still seem to be unanswered significant issues pertaining to the matters of fact. </para>
            <para>With respect to the dealings themselves, they obviously open an extraordinarily wide range of matters of ministerial and parliamentary responsibility. Those are matters which I believe need to be considered very carefully by this chamber and by the Australian people. I do not propose to canvass them further at this stage, but I indicate to the House that they are matters which we do not believe can be left alone and to be concluded by the statement made by the Treasurer. </para>

                <para>Letter A indicates that its purpose would be to enable the bearer to make inquiries on behalf of the Minister and therefore on behalf of the Australian Government. The terms of the letter clearly imply that an agency relationship existed between the bearer and the Government for the purpose of making inquiries into, and recommendations on, the availability of moneys for borrowing. However, the letter suggests that, after making the recommendation, the recipient would not have any further function in relation to the transaction which would be completed by the Government. </para>

                <para>Letter A makes no reference to the remuneration of the agent or reimbursement of his expenses.

            <para>Arising out of a letter dated 17 December 1974 addressed to the Treasurer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> H. Harris, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel, Deputy</inline> Secretary (Supply and General) in Treasury submitted to the Treasurer a minute dated 31 December 1974. In his minute <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> informed the Treasurer of the potential dangers associated with approaches of the kind made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and recommended that the Treasurer inform <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> that if he wished to pursue the matter he might like to get in touch with the Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> signed the letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> Further details of this episode are provided in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel's</inline> statement of 9 June 1975. </para>
            <para>Also, under date 31 December 1974, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> signed a letter to the Minister for Minerals and Energy in which he requested copies of communications to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> so that Treasury and the Attorney-General's Department would be able to give considered advice based on all relevant material. This arose out of advice which had been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> on the possible dangers of communications given to 'fringe' operators. This matter is referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel's</inline> statement of 9 June 1975. </para>
            <para>On 3 April 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris came to my attention again as a result of a letter dated 26 March 1975 from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey,</inline> Minister (Financial), at the Australian High Commission, London. I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> that day. Messrs Daniel and Prowse of Treasury were also present. I handed to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> 's letter together with a covering Minute signed by me. Further details are provided in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel's</inline> statement of 9 June 1975. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> read my minute and the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey. Dr Cairns</inline> stated that the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> 's letter was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris of Melbourne and that he had 'credentials'. </para>
            <para>Even though the activities (of which I was only broadly aware) of the Minister for Minerals and Energy under Executive Council authorisation might have been regarded as setting precedents on policies and procedures I did, nevertheless, put to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> that he should withdraw the 'credentials and that he should do so in writing. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> indicated that he would be talking to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> either that day or the next day. I understood that the matter would be ended. </para>
            <para>On 10 April I saw the Treasurer and, inter alia, discussed certain aspects of the Khemlani exercise. During the course of the discussion the Treasurer informed me that recently he had had a phone call from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris (apparently from overseas). Also, when commenting on a report from a Sydney businessman that there were now in London two persons carrying letters signed on the one hand by the Prime Minister and on the other by the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> stated categorically that no-one had a letter signed by him authorising the bearer to arrange borrowings on behalf of the Australian Government. </para>
            <para>On 14 April 1975 a photostat copy of a paper dated 10 March 1975 which appeared to have been signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and delivered to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris was brought to my notice. It was the one sentence note which is recorded at page 3461 in the Hansard of 5 June 1975 for the House of Representatives. In the light of my discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> on 3 April 1975 and 10 April 1975 I took no further action. </para>
            <para>On the evening of 22 April 1 975, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> reported to my office, by telephone from London, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had called on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting and that he had with him a letter signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> dated 15 April 1975 and which authorised him to make enquiries on behalf of the Treasurer regarding possible loans to Australia. I telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting later the same evening. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> read to me the text of the letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had presented to him and of which he <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John)</inline> had taken a copy for his files. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> enabled me to take down the text of the letter and, with his authority, a confirming copy was subsequently forwarded to Treasury, reaching my office on 29 April 1975. The letter presented to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was the 'To Whom It May Concern' letter which is recorded at page 3461 in the Hansard of 5 June 1 975 for the House of Representatives. </para>
            <para>At the time of my telephone conversation of 22 April 1 975 with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was overseas, having left the preceding day to attend the annual meeting in Manila of the Asian Development Bank. </para>
            <para>About 29 April 1975 a photostat copy of a letter dated 19 April 1975 from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> in London to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was brought to my notice. It referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> having given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> 'two letters '. </para>
            <para>On 2 May 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> informed me that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> had telephoned him the previous evening and had stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting (who was at that time away from London) wished to have further advice from Canberra against the contingency that he would after his return be requested to authenticate the 'To Whom It May Concern ' letter. </para>
            <para>I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> on the morning of 2 May 1975, he having returned the previous day. </para>
            <para>I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> of the exchanges with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting and of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John's</inline> request for guidance. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> stated that he did not think there would be any further developments in the Harris matter. Nevertheless <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> instructed that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> requested <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting to authenticate the letter he would wish <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> to do so. I arranged for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> to be informed of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> instruction. </para>
            <para>During the course of the foregoing discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> he discussed with me <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> letter of 19 April 1 975 from London ( referred to above ). <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> also stated that his 'To Whom It May Concern ' letter given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was designed only to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> to 'ferret around in business circles' and to do no more than provide a means for identifying <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> as the bearer of a document signed by him <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cairns).</inline> However there was no indication by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> that he had signed a further letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> on the matter of commission- the existence of this further letter came to my notice on 6 May 1975- the text is recorded at page 3461 of Hansard. Neither did <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> give any indication of additional oral understandings with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline></para>
            <para>On 2 May 1975, 1 decided to seek legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department on the 'To Whom It May Concern ' letter of 1 5 April 1 975. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> ' attitude was that there was nothing to worry about. However, it was not clear to me whether or not the letter could involve the Government legally in an unwarranted liability. I judged it would be prudent to obtain legal advice before deciding whether to press the matter further. I also decided that the request for legal advice should be effected in a hypothetical manner in order to maintain confidentiality. The memorandum to the Attorney-General's Department prepared in pursuance of my decision and signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse</inline> on 6 May 1975 also covered in a hypothetical way the second letter of 15 April 1975 addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> which came under notice on 6 May 1975. Details of these steps are given in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse</inline> 's statement of 8 June 1975. </para>
            <para>On 13 May 1975 I had a discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> during which he and I canvassed some of the considerations relevant to my judgment of 2 May 1975 that I should obtain legal advice before deciding whether to press the matter further. At the conclusion of our discussion I stated that I maintained my judgment. </para>
            <para>On the evening of 22 May 1975, the Acting Treasurer arranged that he and I should see you concerning the references to an overseas loan operation by Trans i a in an ABC 'This Day Tonight' television program of earlier that evening. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> also attended this meeting. Arising out of the considerable discussion on the Trans i a matter, 1 spoke generally about Ministerial involvement in contacts with 'fringe' operators and about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris. I also recall that on 16 May 1975, following the lunch for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Laurence</inline> Mclntyre, I had a brief opportunity to pursue with you certain general aspects of the Khemlani exercise and aspects of other Ministerial involvements. In my discussions with you I referred to your letter of 23 April 1 975 to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> in which you said <inline font-weight="bold">'Sir Lenox</inline> gave me an oral report of the status last night of your own October initiatives through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Murphy, which you had referred to his Minister yesterday.

            <para class="block">In accordance with your request arising out of the Prime Minister's letter of 6 June 1975I record the following. </para>
            <para class="block">On 3 1 December 1 974I submitted to the Treasurer a Minute containing comments on a letter dated 17 December 1974 which had been addressed to the Treasurer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> H. Harris, a Director of Karoo Nominees Pty Ltd. The letter had been referred to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Freney (then Private Secretary to the Treasurer). In the letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had sought from the Treasurer an indication that Treasury and Reserve Bank approval would be forthcoming in the event that he and his partner (a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Les</inline> Nagy) could successfully negotiate overseas loans for State Government authorities and these authorities were prepared to accept their own exchange risks. </para>
            <para class="block">Included in that Minute of 31 December 1974 were the following paragraphs: </para>
            <para>Governments, if they are to retain respect and keep in good standing on the international capital markets, need to avoid allowing their names to be associated with any operators in these markets other than those whose reputation and standing are beyond question. Moreover, any negotiation by the Government itself for an overseas loan could be quickly soured if it came to the notice of the underwriting group or potential lender that other parties were at the same time 'shopping' for funds on behalf of the Government or with its backing, especially in the same market. 'Going beyond this particular case, I mention that previous Treasurers, including your predecessor, found it useful to adopt a general practice of having persons who approached them about possibilities of arranging overseas borrowings for the Government or for Government instrumentalities referred at least in the first instance to the Treasury, especially if they did not directly represent a major underwriting group or bank well-known to the Government. Experience over the years has demonstrated that, when tested, the propositions that come forward from what I might call the 'fringe' operators- and there is a surprisingly large number of them- almost without exception fall to the ground or are of a kind with which no reputable borrower, especially a Government, should be associated. If you wish, I could give you a more detailed story in this regard, and I would of course be happy to talk with you on the subject at any time convenient to you.' </para>
            <para class="block">A suggested reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline> which I submitted with my Minute of 3 1 December 1 974, was signed by the Treasurer. That reply included the following:- 'Should you wish to be more fully informed as regards the procedural requirements that apply in relation to any proposal for an overseas borrowing by a State Government authority, you may like to get in touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Daniel or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> P. Bailey of the Australian Treasury. They would be happy to explain these requirements to you.' (Copies of the full text of this letter and my Minute of 3 1 December 1974 are on File 75/038.) </para>
            <para class="block">Shortly thereafter I had some discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Freney</inline> about procedural arrangements for the handling of approaches relating to possibilities of arranging overseas borrowings. On 12 January 1975 I recorded, in a Note for File, advice conveyed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Freney.</inline> This Note for File (which is on File 75/047) reads as follows:- <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Freney</inline> told me on Friday last that the Treasurer had agreed to a note he had prepared for circulation within the Treasurer's Office pointing out the need for caution in relation to approaches by people claiming to be able to arrange overseas loans for the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Freney</inline> said that the Treasurer had agreed that such approaches should be referred automatically to senior Treasury officers.

            <para class="block">In a Minute I addressed to the Treasurer on 3 April 1975 regarding an unsolicited offer of loan funds by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn,</inline> I included the following:- 'Early in January you agreed that the approaches by people offering to raise loans overseas on behalf of the Government should be referred automatically to senior officers in the Treasury. This arrangement was designed to provide for checking of the bona fides of people making offers and for provision of advice to you as to how the approaches, some of which could be from unscrupulous operators, might best be dealt with. 'We hope that you have also found this arrangement to be helpful from your point of view. It appears to us to have been working satisfactorily. ' and further 'As it seems likely that further approaches from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn,</inline> or his associates, will be made, you may consider that it would be appropriate that any such further approaches, whether they be by way of written proposals or requests for further interviews, be handled in accordance with the arrangement instituted in January-that is, they be referred to us in the first instance for follow-up action and advice to you. ' </para>
            <para class="block">The Treasurer annotated this Minute 'Yes ' with his signature and the date 8.4. 1975. (See File 70/2321 Part 11.) </para>
            <para class="block">I note that on 8 April 1975 there was a further Minute to the Treasurer- on that occasion from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse-</inline> concerning approaches made to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn.</inline></para>
            <para class="block">I also think it relevant to record that on 31 December 1974 the Treasurer signed a letter to the Minister for Minerals and Energy which I submitted to him concerning the question of what the consequences could be in the event of a claim being made on the Commonwealth by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> for expenses incurred by him and his associates. This letter included the following: 'I think it important that this question be followed up and that, as soon as practicable, we get considered advice based on all the relevant material. 'I would be glad if you would arrange for copies of all relevant communications which passed to and from your Office and your Department and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> on the one hand and the Union Bank of Switzerland on the other hand to be made available to the Treasury and to the Attorney-General's Department so that this follow-up action can be undertaken.' </para>
            <para class="block">I add that I have not sighted any reply to that letter, or to a follow-up letter signed by the Treasurer on 23 January 1 975. (See File 74/096 Part 4.) </para>
            <para class="block">I next record that, on 3 April 1975, 1 was present (as was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse</inline> also) at a meeting you had with the Treasurer. You then handed to the Treasurer a Minute (dated 3 April 1975) to which was attached a copy of a letter dated 26 March 1975 from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey,</inline> Minister (Financial), Australian High Commission, London which had been received in the Treasury on 2 April 1975. In his letter <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> had reported that a director of Morgan Grenfells had told him that Morgan Grenfells had received a call from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline> who was accompanied by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy</inline> and 'a Greek'. Davey was also told that Harris claimed to know the Treasurer, and showed Morgan Grenfells a photo-copy of a letter addressed to him and signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> authorising him to seek out funds for the Australian Government. The letter apparently contained an undertaking to pay a commission of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent if, as a result of Harris' efforts in locating a source of funds, successful negotiations were carried out, with a proviso that the interest rate should be no higher than 8 per cent. Davey 's informant also said Harris called a ' letter of accreditation' and described this as a document covered with red seals and with Harris ' name printed on it </para>
            <para class="block">The Treasurer after reading your Minute (which stated that you would appreciate an opportunity to discuss with him the question of what action might be taken in respect of this matter) and Davey 's letter, stated, inter alia, that the Harris referred to was George Harris, that he had 'credentials' and that he had been told that, if he could get funds at less than 8 per cent, 'we would be prepared to talk '. </para>
            <para class="block">You put it to the Treasurer that he should withdraw the 'credentials' and should do so in writing. (See my Note for File of 4 April 1975 on File 75/038. Your Minute of 3 April 1975 and Davey 's letter of 26 March 1 975 are also on that file. ) </para>
            <para class="block">On 13 April 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Shann</inline> handed to me, in your absence, a note by him which was addressed to you and to which was attached a photo-copy of a copy of a sheet of Treasurer's letterhead paper on which was imprinted one paragraph ('The Australian Government is willing to borrow funds from lenders overseas on terms and conditions suitable to us'), the name 'J. F. Cairns' and the date 'March 10, 1975'. There were also indistinct imprints of the Treasurer's signature and of a notation indicating that the original had been given to George Harris. I passed these papers on to you on14 April 1975. (See my Minute of 14 April 1975 on File 75/038.) </para>
            <para class="block">On 29 April 1975 (or thereabouts) <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Shann</inline> mentioned to me, in a telephone conversation, that a letter dated 19 April 1975 addressed to the Treasurer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had been received by him (Shann) and he briefly indicated the contents of it to me. Shortly afterwards, a copy of the letter was sent to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Shann.</inline> You were away from your office at the time. I passed it to you when you returned. </para>
            <para class="block">On the evening of 1 May 1975 I received a telephone call from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> in London. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> advised me that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting (who was then away from London) wished to have further advice from Canberra against the contingency that he would, after his return to London, be asked to authenticate the To Whom It May Concern' letter of 15 April 1975 which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had presented there. I reported this to you the next morning. (See my Minute of 2 May 1975 on File 75/038.) </para>

On the same day, I submitted to you a Minute in which I stated: - </para>
            <para>A possible course of action would be to ask Attorney-General's for advice whether, if a letter along certain lines were to be given to an outside person, it could be construed as an agency arrangement.

            <para class="block">You wrote on my Minute 'Do this and get a reply as soon as possible. F. W. 2.5.75'. (See File 75/038.) I then referred the matter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse</inline> 's Division for follow-up action. </para>
            <para class="block">On the morning of 2 May 1 975 you spoke with the Treasurer about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting's desire for understanding of the situation against the contingency that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> would ask him to authenticate the 'To Whom It May Concern Letter' of 15 April 1975. (Your Minute to me of 4 May 1975 on File 75/038.) Following this, I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey,</inline> Minister (Financial), London on 7 May 1975 conveying advice for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting including the instruction, which emerged from your discussion with the Treasurer, that Bunting must, if requested by Harris, authenticate the letter. (A copy of this letter was sent to the Australian Ambassador, Berne, for his personal and confidential information.) At the same time, judging that Davey should be aware of them in handling approaches there or advising the High Commissioner on such approaches, I sent to him on a personal and confidential basis copies of the letter of 10 March 1975, the Harris letter of 19 April and the letter of 15 April 1975 which referred to commission. (Copies of my two letters to Davey are on File 75/038.) </para>

This meeting took place following discussions between the Acting Treasurer and you concerning a report by Richard Carleton on the 'This Day Tonight' television broadcast the same day. The report made reference to the Trans i a Corporation and, in that connection, to you. A Note for File which I subsequently prepared records that, during the discussion in the Prime Minister's office, you spoke 'about Ministerial involvement in contacts and communications with "funny money" operators'.

            <para>HARRIS LETTER-ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT ADVICE-MEETING OF 9 MAY 1975</para>
            <para class="block">At 3 p.m. today following a request from Attorney-General's Department I discussed the Harris letters ('A' and 'B'Harris' name was, of course, not mentioned) with Messrs </para>
            <para class="block">Menzies, Scott and Byrne, all of Attorney-General's Department. </para>
            <para class="block">
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline>did virtually all the talking. The main points he made were: </para>
            <para>Attorney-General's are reluctant to give advice without all the background information. </para>
            <para>He stressed that the letters were vague and that they implied some oral contract may have accompanied them. </para>
            <para>A letter of the 'B' type was 'legally undesirable '. </para>
            <para class="block">Menzies then asked if the letters had been given to someone by the Treasurer. I said they had been given by a Minister who could have been the Treasurer. Menzies assumed from then on that the Minister was the Treasurer. He asked how certain was the Department of the existence and authenticity of the letters. I said that there was no doubt about either. He asked whether the matter which had been raised directly with the Treasurer. I said that the matter of giving authorities to individuals was a matter which had been raised on many occasions but that the Treasurer had admitted to the Secretary that he had given such letters to an individual. Menzies asked whether the individual was known to the Treasury or to the Treasurer or whether he was just another carpet-bagger. I said that he was a man of some standing in the community but that he was not principally engaged in banking or underwriting and that we therefore regarded him as a 'commission agent ' like any other. </para>
            <para class="block">He asked also if the Treasurer had given the Department copies of the letters. I said he had not but they had come to us in a way which created some difficulty for us. (While letter  A ' came through Davey via Bunting, letter ' B ' was provided by Shann). </para>
            <para class="block">Menzies suggested that a solution to our problem might be for Attorney-General's to advise Enderby and for Enderby to discuss it with Cairns. I made no comment on that suggestion. I emphasised to Menzies that the (political) delicacy of the situation was only one aspect and that Attorney-General's advice was sought not only with a view to our informing the Treasurer of any implications for him (Menzies assumed that any written Attorney-General's advice would be simply passed to the Treasurer) but with a view to Attorney-General's advising us of any difficulties which may arise with respect to paying either a commission on any loan which may arise (note the vagueness of the letter, 'B' and the relevance of an oral contract), or in meeting from an appropriation any other incidental expenses which may arise. I also said we were hopeful of advice on any other wider implications which these letters might have for the Treasurer and the Treasury which they may care to give. </para>
            <para class="block">I also reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> of our earlier request for advice on the Minister for Minerals and Energy's letter to Khemlani of 16 December. (We sought Attorney-General's advice on 20 December and still have no reply). Menzies considered the 'K ' affair dead and said he wasn't particularly concerned to reply to that request. </para>
            <para class="block">In summary, Attorney-General's are reluctant to provide written advice on the basis of the information we have given but, as Menzies had occasion to speak to Harders during my interview with him he said he would not wish to commit the Department as to the form of their advice until he had discussed our request of 6 May with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders.</inline> He said the Department would contact us further about this matter at a later date. </para>

            <para class="block">On 28 May at approximately 1 1.20 p.m. the Secretary called me to his office to assist in the transmission of a message to the Treasurer in Paris (copy of message as transmitted is on file 75/038).

            <para class="block">With reference to the Prime Minister's letter to you dated 6 June 1 975,I have prepared the following report. </para>
            <list type="decimal-dotted">
        <item label="2.">
          <para>From end January 1975 until early June 1975 I was Departmental Liaison Officer in the Treasurer's Office. </para>
        </item>
        <item label="3.">
          <para>By way of general background the following is a brief description of how papers relevant to the Treasurer's portfolio were handled in the Treasurer's Office. The description has been prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Q. Frenzy (Private Secretary to the Treasurer from December 1972 until early March 1975) and myself. </para>
        </item>
      </list>
            <para>In our experience an important duty of staff in the Treasurer's office is the orderly management of the very large volume of paper that flows through the office. It is impossible for the Treasurer personally to handle the immense volume. </para>
            <para>A very large proportion of the papers addressed to the Treasurer- indeed the vast majority of them pertain to his Ministerial portfolio. In general material in this category is forwarded to the Department (or as appropriate to other organisations in the Treasury group, including in particular the Taxation Office) for attention and necessary action. A recent assessment revealed an annual rate of about 12,000 letters referred to the Department. Inward correspondence of particular significance is also brought to the Treasurer's notice at the same time as it is referred to the appropriate action area. </para>
            <para>According to the office establishment the responsible staff member for the foregoing purposes might be the Private Secretary or, as more recently, the Departmental Liaison Officer. </para>
            <para>It is also an important duty of the responsible staff member to handle papers relating to the Treasurer's capacity as Chairman of the Loan Council, Chairman of the National Debt Commission, Governor of the International Monetary Fund, Governor of the Asian Development Bank, and any other such capacities in which he is involved. The normal requirement is for all material coming to the Treasurer in these capacities to be forwarded to the Department for the provision of advice to the Treasurer and any other necessary action. </para>
            <para>It is also the responsibility of the relevant staff member to inform the Department of the Treasurer's reactions to material, pertaining to the portfolio, that is submitted to him. Such material includes inward correspondence shown to the Treasurer, letters prepared for his signature and Departmental minutes. It is necessary to inform the Department of the decisions, actions and requirements of the Treasurer in matters pertaining to his portfolio to ensure that they are implemented and fulfilled, and also so that the Department is in a position to provide advice to the Treasurer should it consider it appropriate to do so. </para>
            <para class="block">The foregoing arrangements and procedures have been developed through experience and over time, and followed unless the Treasurer instructs otherwise. They are not, and in our experience never have been, committed to precise documentation approved in writing by the Treasurer. The Treasurer's approval of them has been of a tacit character. There have not to our knowledge been any countermanding instructions. </para>

          <item label="4.">
            <para>The only general statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> of which I am aware, about the responsibilities of the position I occupied in his office is that contained in his press statement of 29 December 1974 which read inter alia <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Roger</inline> Freney, former private secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Crean when he was Treasurer, and who is a ministerial officer grade three, will continue with me and will be in charge of all relations with the Treasury and other departments'.

            <para>The first of the three notes referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> statement in the House of Representatives on 5 June 1975 was dated 10 March 1975 and read 'The Australian Government is willing to borrow funds from lenders overseas on terms and conditions suitable to us. Signed J. F. Cairns'. The duplicate copy of that note was passed out to me on 13 April 1975 among a bundle of Departmental papers. It was on official notepaper, and had been marked by the Treasurer 'File under Harris, George'. 6.I often received documents from the Treasurer that he had marked for file. I was never instructed that any such documents or copies of them should not be sent to the Department. I therefore exercised my own judgment about how the documents should be dealt with. If I felt that they were of no relevance to the Department, I would file them in the office without sending the Department a copy. In other cases I would send the Department either the original document for filing, or a copy if the original document was being held in the Treasurer's office. The basis on which I determined whether the document or a copy of it should be sent to the Department was whether the matter that was the subject of the document was a matter pertaining to the Treasurer's portfolio and on which the Department needed to be kept informed or might wish to advise the Treasurer. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="7.">
            <para>In the case of the duplicate copy of the abovementioned note dated 10 March 1975,I kept the document for filing in the office and sent a copy of it to the Department on 1 3 April 1975.I knew that the Department had been involved in correspondence the Treasurer had previously had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> (the Department had drafted one letter which had been sent by the Treasurer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris)</inline> and that the Secretary had recently discussed with the Treasurer his correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> (The latter discussion took place on 3 April 1975 and related to a letter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> reportedly had with him overseas- see File 75/038.) 8.I sent the copy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> (in the Secretary's absence) under cover of a note addressed to the Secretary. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> later rang me and advised, in response to the question in my note about whether I should take follow-up action of any sort, that the Secretary had said no further action was needed by me. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="9.">
            <para>In sending the copy to the Department I was aware of the procedures for automatic referral to senior Treasury officers set out in the following documents- </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
              <item label="(i)">
                <para>A Note for File dated 12 January 1975 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> which recorded the following: <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Freney</inline> told me on Friday last that the Treasurer had agreed to a note he had prepared for circulation within the Treasurer's Office pointing out the need for caution in relation to approaches by people claiming to be able to arrange overseas loans for the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Freney</inline> said that the Treasurer had agreed that such approaches should be referred automatically to senior Treasury officers.' </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(ii)">
                <para>A minute dated 3 April 1975 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> to the Treasurer regarding an unsolicited offer of loan funds by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn;</inline> that minute included the following: 'Early in January you agreed that the approaches by people offering to raise loans overseas on behalf of the Government should be referred automatically to senior officers in the Treasury. This arrangement was designed to provide for checking of the bona fides of people making offers and for provision of advice to you as to how the approaches, some of which could be from unscrupulous operators, might best be dealt with. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </item>
        </list>
            <para>We hope that you have also found this arrangement to be helpful from your point of view. It appears to us to have been working satisfactorily.' and further: 'As it seems likely that further approaches from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn</inline> or his associates will be made, you may consider that it would be appropriate that any such further approaches, whether they be by way of written proposals or requests for further interviews, be handled in accordance with the arrangement instituted in January- that is, they be referred to us in the first instance for follow-up action and advice to you. ' </para>
            <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline>had annotated this minute 'Yes' with his signature and the date 6.4. 1 975. </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
          <item label="(iii)">
            <para>A minute dated 8 April 1 975 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse</inline> to the Treasurer regarding approaches by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn;</inline> that minute included the following: 'I would draw your attention once again to the fact that the vast majority of people offering unsolicited funds do so primarily to acquire evidence in writing from the Government which could be held to be a' form of authority allowing them to negotiate for funds on its behalf, without there being any concrete evidence that they could obtain funds in the amounts and on the terms stated in their proposal. In this regard special care needs to be exercised, including independent checks through established banks, in order to verify that funds are available for lending in the amounts and/or terms stated by persons who are unknown in international loan markets. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
            <para>Again, I suggest that you may consider it more appropriate that further approaches from this group of agents and any others which have had direct dealings with you and which may not have come to the attention of the Department, be handled in ac- " cor dance with the arrangements instituted in January, i.e., that they be referred to the Department for follow-up action and advice. </para>

            <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline>had annotated this minute as follows: 'No authority is to be given to any person in matters of this kind.

          <item label="10.">
            <para>In late April an inward letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> dated 19 April 1975 came to me among the ordinary incoming mail. The Treasurer was then absent at the ADB meeting in the Philippines. Mail coming into the office was distributed by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Karen</inline> Stegmar (Assistant Private Secretary) with mail of a Departmental nature being given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Handke</inline> (the Departmental Liaison Officer responsible to me) or myself. I personally handed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> letter to the Treasurer on his return, along with other papers, and said he should read it. He glanced through it, but did not comment in substance and the conversation was broken off as someone else was waiting to see him. I had already sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniel</inline> (in the Secretary's absence) a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> letter in the light of the procedures indicates above. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="1">
            <para>1. The Treasurer was of course aware I had seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> letter as I personally handed it to him and drew its contents to his notice. He gave me no instructions about whether the Department should be informed. In fact on no occasion that I remember did he ever direct me not to send particular papers to the Department. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="12.">
            <para>By way of preface to the remainder of this report I describe the filing system that operated in the Treasurer's office. 13.1 used the files kept in the outer office where the stenographers worked. All office staff used these files for keeping copies of letters prepared in the office and the files included letters prepared by the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swancott, Ms Bowden, Ms Stegmar, Ms Morosi</inline> and myself. The files contained inwards and outwards copies of correspondence on electoral matters, representations (including referrals to other Ministerial offices) and letters to and from organisations and members of Parliament Correspondence awaiting filing, and in fact all the outer office files themselves, were in a room that could not be locked and during my time in the office the filing cabinets were almost never locked. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="14.">
            <para>The filing system was in fact not well kept and has been re-organised over the last month. At the beginning of May there was a large number of loose documents awaiting placement on particular files. If one needed to find the duplicate copy of a letter that had recently been sent from the office one therefore usually needed to look through all the loose documents in order to find it. Regular searches were made when documents needed to be located. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="15.">
            <para>In general, the originals of papers prepared in Treasury were filed in the Treasury rather than held in the Treasurer s office. I held confidential Treasury and Cabinet papers in my room as it could be locked and contained a safe. Papers prepared in the Treasurer's office were generally filed in the office and where I felt the papers should be drawn to the Department 's attention I sent copies to the Treasury. Papers that dealt with matters in which the Department had a continuing interest were often prepared (and filed), without their being drawn directly to my attention. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="16.">
            <para>At the beginning of May, while searching for other papers in the outer office I found duplicate copies of two more letters to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> from the Treasurer. Both letters were dated15 April 1975. The duplicate copies were in the loose papers awaiting filing in the outer office. 1 7.I made inquiries on 6 May through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce</inline> O 'Meagher (Personal Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury) and learnt that the Treasury already had a copy of one of the letters. This was the letter dated 15 April 1975 headed 'To Whom It May Concern', a copy of which had been sent to the Department by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting, Australian High Commissioner in London. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="1">
            <para>8. So that Treasury would have full information on which to advise the Treasurer I therefore sent on 6 May a copy of the commission' letter to the Secretary. I did not send to the Department a copy of the 'To Whom It May Concern' letter in view of the advice that the Department already held the copy forwarded by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting. In my covering note to the Secretary I said that the 'commission' letter was 'on file in this office'. More accurately I should have said that the duplicate copy of that letter was <inline font-style="italic">'awaiting</inline> filing in this office'. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="19.">
            <para>I placed the duplicate copies of both letters dated 15 April 1975 back with the material that was awaiting filing in the office. I did not remove them from the office. In fact I did not see them again and I assumed that they had been filed. 20.I should record that I discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Brogan</inline> (economic adviser to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns)</inline> the Treasurer's correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris. Mr Handke</inline> was also present during some of these discussions and was therefore aware of the existence of the correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline></para>
          </item>
          <item label="21.">
            <para>Throughout, I was aware that the Department had been involved in discussing correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> with the Treasurer, and as indicated above I was aware of the procedures that had been laid down for the handling of papers relating to overseas loan approaches. In sending to the Department copies of the letters I was simply doing my job in serving the Treasurer by keeping the Department informed on a matter pertaining to the Treasurer's portfolio and enabling the Department to provide advice to the Treasurer if that was felt to be desirable. </para>

The memorandum also asked for advice whether the letters could render the Government liable to pay any expenses incurred or whether any other legal implications could arise from the existence of such letters.

            <para>1. 1 considered whether to raise the matter with the Attorney-General or with the Solicitor-General. (The Solicitor-General was at this time in Sydney in connection with important litigation in the High Court.) On the legal side, it appeared to me that no difficult questions of law were raised and that the Government 's position as regards financial obligation to a person receiving letters in the terms of letters A and B was basically the same as it had been in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> under the arrangements approved by Ministers in December 1974. As to other circumstances associated with the request for advice it seemed a fair assumption to make that these were real letters and that they had probably been given by the Treasurer or by someone on his behalf. I did not know any of the background. In these circumstances I took the view that this pan of the matter was one between Treasury and its Minister, if in fact letters in the terms of letters A and B had been given by the Treasurer to any person. In the result, I did not discuss the matter with the Attorney-General before giving advice on 28 May. </para>

            <para>On 13 May I had lunch with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler. The memorandum of 6 May was mentioned. I said that it seemed to me that if letters such as letters A and B had been given by the Treasurer to anyone the best course would be for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> first to discuss the matter with him rather than seek legal advice. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> said that he respected that view, that it was a view that could be taken but that he preferred first to know what the legal position was. (In my experience, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, more than any other Permanent Head of a Department, has followed the practice of obtaining legal advice in matters in which legal considerations may be involved.) There was no discussion between us of any of the background. I said that I would have draft legal advice prepared and then be in touch with him. This course is sometimes followed in the Department to enable the policy Department to correct or supplement any statements of fact. However, in view of the ultimate form of the advice (see especially paragraph 9 of the memorandum of 28 May) I did not show <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler a draft and I had no further discussion with him until after I had signed the advice. At that point I rang <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> and told him the advice was about to be delivered by hand to him. </para>

I did so later in the day. He showed me and gave me copies of some documents. I noted that they related only to the period up to 21 December 1974. 1 made it clear that any advice that I gave would have to be qualified in that I would have to say that the advice was given on the basis of the papers that I had actually seen. I gave oral advice qualified in that way. (On 30 May certain further Khemlani documents were produced to me and I gave further oral advice qualified in the same way.)

            <para>1 note the following points from my advice of 28 May- o The terms of letter A clearly implied that an agency relationship existed between the bearer ana the Government for the purpose of making inquiries into, and recommendations on, the availability of moneys for borrowing. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
            <para> However, the effect of letter A was that, after making the recommendation, the recipient would not have any further function in relation to the transaction, which would be completed by the Government. ° Letter A made no reference to remuneration or reimbursement of expenses. If letter B did not exist, and if there were no written or oral arrangements to the contrary, it would probably be inferred from letter A that the agent was entitled to reasonable remuneration and reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred. </para>
            <para> However, letter B indicated a commission would be paid. The amount was not stated, but a reasonable commission assessed according to percentages or in what other manner is customary in the business of finance broking in the relevant markets would probably be payable. Whether expenses should be reimbursed would depend on the custom. </para>
            <para> Though letter B was not in terms limited to the borrowing facilitated by inquiries and recommendations of the kind referred to in letter A, if the two letters were in fact given together there would be a strong presumption that the commission payable under letter B was confined to such a borrowing. ° The advice was given on the assumption that the letters would not be supplemented or affected by any oral discussions or other documents, and I confined my advice to the terms of the documents. 18.I believe that at this point I should make some observations on the subject of agency. </para>
            <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="19.">
            <para>I observe first that my advice of 28 May considered whether the bearer of letters in the terms of letters A and B would be an agent of the Australia Government for certain purposes; the Treasury memorandum specifically sought advice on that question. I observe next that there have been public references to the question of agency. It seems to me that the position has not been clearly understood. The recipient of letters A and B would be an agent for limited purposes only, namely, for the purposes of making inquiries into, and recommendations on, the availability of moneys for borrowing; a loan transaction would be concluded by the Government itself; a commission would be payable if a loan were concluded; whether expenses would be reimbursed would depend on the custom. From the financial standpoint, the Government's position would be basically the same as it was under the arrangements with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> In that case the intention was that commission would be deducted at the source out of the moneys borrowed by the Government. In the letters A and B case, commission would be payable by the Government but the net result would be the same- and presumably, similar arrangements might ultimately have been suggested regarding deduction of commission at the source. Finally, I observe that the legal relationship between the Government and any 'intermediary' could be determined only on the basis of all documentation given to the intermediary', and in certain circumstances oral discussions could also be relevant. Circumstances are conceivable where the Government, although not considering or intending an intermediary' to be its agent, could, in law, nevertheless be regarded as holding him out as its agent. Even if this result did not follow as a matter of law, documentation in the possession of the 'intermediary', if shown or given by him to third parties, might cause those parties to believe that the intermediary ' was the Government's agent. </para>

            <para>On 2 June I was with the Attorney-General in his office when you said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> would be getting in touch with me. When I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> he referred at once to paragraph 9 of my advice of 28 May in which I had said that I had assumed that letters A and B would not be supplemented or affected by any oral discussions or other documents and that I had confined the advice to the terms of the documents (letters A and B). <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> said there was other material. He showed me a note which he said was a note of conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> before letters were given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris. Dr Cairns</inline> also showed me a document which he said was the text of a telegram that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was sending to him that day from overseas. The text concluded with the words ' Letter follows. '. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> said that the letter would confirm what was in the telegram and that the letter would be given to him on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> return to Australia later in the week.

While with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> I said that the situation appeared now to be different. I said this on the basis that the telegram referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> would be received by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and in the expectation that it would be appropriately acknowledged by him. There would then be no agency. At page 3462 of the Hansard of 5 June 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> is reported as saying- 'On being informed of this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> told me that this made the situation different and, in his opinion, there was now no agency between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and myself. ' Literally, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> ' statement was correct. My intention was to convey to him that there would be no agency from the point at which the telegram had been received and acknowledged.

I am sure that if I were to have an opportunity to discuss the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> he would agree that he did not say anything to me about a missing paragraph.

            <para>Statement by Andrew Charles Collin Menzies, First Assistant Secretary, Attorney-General's Department </para>
            <para>On 7 May 1975 I was acting as the First Assistant Secretary, Adv i sings Division and in that capacity I saw a memorandum in the inward mail dated 6 May1975 from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> R. G. Prowse, First Assistant Secretary, Revenue Loans and Investment Division, Department of the Treasury. A copy of that memorandum is attached to this statement. 2.I assigned the matter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Scott who was then Acting Senior Assistant Secretary of the Constitutional and Financial Branch of the Adv i sings Division during the temporary absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> J. Rose to whose attention the memorandum had been addressed by Treasury. During5 May I was informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scott</inline> that Treasury officers had been in touch with his Branch requesting an urgent reply to the memorandum. I suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scott</inline> arrange a conference in my room with Treasury officers and myself the following day. </para>

          <item label="3.">
            <para>Early on the morning of 9 May I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scott</inline> that there could be a significant question as to the effect of oral discussions in relation to the letters referred to in the Treasury memorandum. Accordingly I requested <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scott</inline> to have some basic research carried out as to the circumstances in which oral evidence could be introduced to vary the effect of transactions committed to writing. Later that morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scott</inline> gave me some notes of research carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byrne,</inline> a Senior Legal Officer in his Branch, on this aspect. These notes appear on the departmental file. </para>

            <para>One object of the conference from my point of view was to ascertain the circumstances in which the letters referred to would be sent or had been sent (if that was the case). Nothing in the nature of definitive advice was given in the conference nor was any decision made to future action. Because of this and the fact that written advice was subsequently given, no written record was kept in thisDepartment of the discussion. 6.I questioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> as to the source of the Treasury information on which the request for advice was based but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> firmly declined to disclose this source. He did say that it was a reliable source. At the conclusion of the discussion we were left unaware of the source of the information. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> indicated that he was not quite sure that the letters quoted in the Treasury memorandum had in fact been sent, he made it clear that in his view it was probable that letters in the form quoted had been sent or given by the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> indicated that names had been omitted from the letters in order to preserve anonymity. Nothing was said to suggest any other omissions from the letters provided. </para>

          <item label="8.">
            <para>I explained that the legal effect of the letters could be affected by oral discussions and pointed out that there could also be other relevant documents. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> was unable to supply information one way or the other as to possible oral discussions or accompanying documents; I expressed some reluctance to give advice on the legal effect of the letter.

I agreed with this conclusion; I thought that my worry as to the absence of information as to collateral discussions could be met by a paragraph in the advice emphasising that our advice was confined to the terms of the document and that we had assumed that the letter would not be supplemented or affected by any oral discussions or other documents. </para>

Late on 8 May I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> concerning the memorandum. He thought that we should try and obtain some further information and suggested that I telephone Treasury officers and arrange a conference. I then telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> Bailey at Treasury and arranged for a conference to take place in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies'</inline> room at 2.30 p.m. on 9 May. Early in the morning of 9 May, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> telephoned me and suggested that oral conversations might have a bearing on the legal effect of the letters. He then asked me if I would prepare some material for the conference relating to the admissibility of oral discussions on the effect and intent of written contracts. As I was engaged on other matters, I asked my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byrne</inline> to obtain that material. Later in the morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byrne</inline> gave to me a draft paper setting out the principal rules relating to the admissibility of parol evidence.

The effect of Miss Morosi's and Miss Bowden s statements is that copies of two letters dated 15 April 1975 were placed in a filing tray kept for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> personal correspondence in Miss Moroni's office, that they were not seen by Miss Moroni after 15 April 1975 and that when she looked for them on Monday June 1 they were gone. </para>

However, it was not clear to me whether or not the letter could involve the Government legally in an unwarranted liability.

                <para>The Treasury letter seeking advice is dated 6 May 1 975. A copy is Attachment A to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders'</inline> letter to you. Omitting formal introductory matter (including a reference to subject matter), its first sentence is: 'Your urgent advice is sought whether letters along the lines which follow, if given to a private individual by a Minister including the Treasurer, could be construed as constituting, or liable to constitute, a form of agency agreement between the bearer and the Government'. A further opinion is sought in the remaining sentence of that paragraph. Obviously the sentence I have quoted asks the reader to envisage the possibility of the Treasurer in the administration of his Department handing letters 'along the lines which follow' to private individuals. Thus the advice is sought as to a legal consequence or consequences attendant upon the Minister's discharge of his constitutional duties. It is sought not by him but by his Department. </para>

                <para>I have set out in paragraph 4 the texts respectively of the hypothetical letters on which advice was sought and those given.

                <para>The letters submitted to the Attorney-General's Department differ from those then in the Treasury's possession in a number of respects. Thus, for example, the words in the 'commission' letter 'introduced or arranged by you' following and qualifying 'overseas funds' are omitted from Letter B. The result is a promise to pay commission 'In the event that the Australian Government or its representatives or nominees successfully negotiates' an overseas borrowing however arranged. Whether a Court would so construe the promise I take leave to doubt. But that omission no doubt prompted the observation in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders'</inline> advice (paragraph 8) 'Letter B is not in terms limited to borrowing facilitated by the recipient's enquiries and recommendations of the kind referred to in Letter A'.

The words last quoted appear in Letter A as 'the Government would be pleased to take the matter up'. The sentence in the 'To Whom It May Concern' letter, 'The Australian Government is interested in borrowing on favourable conditions and should any person be able to assist us, we would be glad to hear from him ' appears in Letter A as 'The Australian Government is interested in borrowing on favourable terms and conditions and should any person or company be able to assist the Government in this way it would be pleased to receive such advice'. </para>

            <para>This is not an unusual or novel view. In an opinion given in January 1944 the then Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr H.</inline> V. Evatt, said: 'It is, however, important to observe that Section 25(2) must be read subject to the fundamental and overriding principle that the constitutional head of a department of the executive government of the Commonwealth is the Minister of State administering that department (Commonwealth Constitution, section 64), and it is the Minister at the head of the department who is responsible, subject to the Cabinet and to Parliament, for that department (Cabinet Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr W.</inline> Ivor Jennings pp.88 and 89) . . . </para>
          </item>
        </list>
            <para>The true position is that section 25 (2) is intended as a general definition of the responsibility of a Permanent Head, but it must be read with the qualification that the responsibility is subject to the higher responsibility of the Minister and must be exercised subject to the Minister's direction and control. So construed, section 25 (2) conforms to the undoubted constitutional position, and subject to that qualification it stands as pan of the statute law of the Commonwealth . . . </para>
            <para>So far, I have addressed myself to consideration of section 25 (2) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act from the strictly legal aspect, but to stop there would leave consideration of the section incomplete. The point now to note is that the section must be read so as to harmonise with the practical working of our system of Government. Therefore, although the section has the force of law as regards the internal organisation of Departments of the Public Service, it is, in relation to the Government, really an administrative provision and does not operate as a legal limitation on the Minister in the execution of his responsibility as head of the department </para>
            <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jennings,</inline>whose views on Constitutional Law and Practice have considerable academic weight, discussing in the work referred to the relations between Ministers and Civil Servants, has this to say ( at page 96 ): "The problem of a Prime Minister in time of war is more difficult than that of any ordinary Minister in time of peace. Questions which depend on expertise are usually settled by experts. In any Department there must be a substantial measure of delegation; questions which come to the Minister are usually of some political importance; and upon them his own opinion is better than that of his advisers. Moreover, the Minister, has at his hand the services of his Permanent Head of his Department, who is not (except by accident) a specialist in anything, but is the general adviser to the Minister, and general manager and controller under the Minister, with the ultimate responsibility to the Minister for all the activities of the Department (and of its officials)'from a memorandum by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Warren</inline> Fisher (Permanent Secretary to the Treasury): Royal Commission on the Civil Service (1929), Minutes of Evidence, page 1272 . . . 'Sometimes, it is true, the Permanent Head acts as a selective filter which allows to pass only those things of which it approves. Yet a strong Minister can always open up the stream. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lloyd</inline> George has stated his own practice. 'I have never taken the view that the head of a Government Department is forbidden by any rule of honour or etiquette from sending for any person either inside or outside his office, whatever his rank, to seek enlightenment on any subject affecting his administration, . . .

More direct evidence of illustration of the same point, showing the breadth and decisiveness of the authority that is exercisable, and validly exercisable, by the Minister, is available in the recorded experience of the late Lord Haldane, himself a profound constitutional lawyer, when he administered the War Office as Secretary of State for War, 1905-1912 (R. B. Haldane, Autobiography pp.183-207 and pp.288 and 289; see also Public Administration Vol. 6 (1928), articles by Rt.  Hon.  Viscount Grey of Balloon and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Harris at pp. 332 to 349). </para>
            <para>So, here, precise definition of the responsibilities and powers of the Permanent Head of a Service Department, and particularly the Permanent Head of the Department of the Army, or adjustments of those responsibilities and powers relatively to other persons including the Commander-in-Chief, are, in my opinion, matters for the decision of the Minister of the Department, subject, of course, to the concurrence of other Ministers who may be concerned, or the approval of the Cabinet, where circumstances make such concurrence or approval advisable. In my opinion, section 25 (2) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act is no bar to exercise by the Minister of his authority in this matter. </para>
            <para>There is thus no need, because of the controversy to which this correspondence has given rise, to seek an amendment of that section. It is in the same terms as section 12 (2) of the original Act of 1902, and I find that, when the Bill for the latter Act was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne (Minister for Home Affairs), he said of the clause which became section 12 (2) 'Now I come to the internal administration of the different departments. The administration is to be conferred upon the permanent head . . . The clause does not mean that the permanent head is to be allowed to do exactly as he likes. The Minister must look to see that the work of the permanent head is properly done. I have inserted the clause after the experience I have had of the public service of New South Wales. We have sometimes had the head of the department fighting with the (Public Service) Commissioners and feeling that he has been oppressed by them. We could not have the work done as it should be done under such conditions'. (Parliamentary Debates Vol. l,p. 1083). Section 25 (2) as it stands, therefore, is a long standing provision, it is a part of the established administrative pattern, and, as will be clear from what I have already said, it consists with constitutional principle and usage and is not a legal limitation upon the Minister in his direction and control of administration.' </para>

In spite of learning of these other approaches, which Geneva said had struck not only them but also the 'established market generally' as somewhat 'unorthodox' behaviour, Clark's had proceeded on the basis that the Australian Government was still interested in arranging a loan through them. Hence his enquiry of last Friday. I told Geneva that the matter was under consideration in Canberra. He will, in the next few days, be furnishing us with Clark 's references. </para>

            <para>Dear Dr Cairns,</para>
            <para>Further to my telex and cable earlier today I now wish to confirm and expand on their contents. </para>
            <para>Early this year I had several discussions with you regarding my intention to investigate the possibility of obtaining private funds from overseas for potential corporate borrowers in Australia. </para>
            <para>Following a visit to the United States and Europe in March I informed you that I had located reputable private sources for loans of up to $10,000,000 and told you that I believed that much larger loans were available for Government use, and asked if you were interested in my pursuing inquiries in this area. </para>
            <para>I further informed you that I was returning to Europe to formalise the arrangements I had made in relation to corporate borrowing and suggested that I might endeavour to establish to what extent large private funds were available in Europe. </para>
            <para>You agreed that I could do this coincidental with but incidental to my private arrangements. You went to great lengths to emphasise that you would give me no commitment other than in the most general terms that you were interested in overseas borrowing. </para>
            <para>Further you stated in the most specific terms that I could not and would not be given any official status, nor be appointed an agent for you or the Government in any way shape or form, but was merely to report to you if and when I established beyond doubt that large private funds were available. </para>

            <para>May I apologise for the length of time it has taken for me to reply to your letter of 3 1 March, but I had some difficulty in talking with the Treasurer because of his unbelievably busy schedule. Parliament started its Autumn session a couple of days after we arrived back and he was unable to give me an early appointment. </para>
            <para>I believe Harry Geneva informed you of our meeting with Morgan Grenfell in London, but he may not have informed you that they were not prepared to act in this matter unless they were to deal direct with the Australian Government. For confirmation of this I enclose the letter from them which is self-explanatory. </para>
            <para>The Treasurer was not prepared to act in accordance with their request because he has consistently stated that the Australian Government will only deal with a Prime Bank. </para>
            <para>I therefore have to inform you that all of our efforts in that regard, and the introductions that were arranged through you and Ivoryy B. Clarke have aborted. We are now back in London for some meetings arranged by our own European Agents which we hope will bring about a satisfactory conclusion. In the event that they don't, I shall contact you again and maybe then we can arrange meetings with your German contacts. </para>
            <para>However, we would still like to talk with you on a continuing basis for small commercial loans ranging from 1-10 million dollars U.S. backed by Australian Prime Bank guarantees. If this is of interest to you, I would be extremely pleased to hear from you, and in the meantime, I would like to thank you for your efforts and assistance and the courtesy you showed me in New York. </para>
            <para>I earnestly hope that we can do some business together because I was impressed with your sincerity and your attitude. </para>

            <para>-Statements made in this House are central to any examination of the matter now before the House- the overseas borrowings sought by this Government, the basic facts have been stated in the Parliament in answers to questions. None of the so-called revelations, none of the photo stats, the purchased or purloined documents, none of the leaks from the disaffected or the disloyal, alter basic facts which have been well known for 5 months. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Until we recalled the Parliament for this matter, members of the Opposition relied on the Press to create an impression of new and neverending revelations. When the Parliament was sitting they initiated nothing, although the nature and amount of the proposed loan had been public knowledge from the second week of February, when the session began. On no occasion did the Opposition move a specific motion dealing with overseas loan borrowings; not until the last day of sitting did it move for the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>
          <para>For four months, while the House was sitting, the Opposition took no opportunity to raise the matter on the adjournment or by way of an urgency motion. It refused my repeated invitations to place Questions on Notice. It relied upon the newspapers to create an atmosphere, and yet at the end of it all the research team of journalists of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the paper which has been most active in the matter, had to concede the basic fact remained as I stated it in the Parliament. In yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Cole-Adams wrote from London: ... As far as we know Australia has not in fact lost any money as a result of the affair . . . </para>
          <para class="block">I could have saved the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> £stg8,000, because on 26 May I told the Leader of the Opposition: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There has been a very great deal of speculation about this. Let me nail it immediately. Not a cent has been paid to the gentleman. Not a cent has to be paid to the gentleman. Not a cent will be paid to the gentleman. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will not query them; it will just condemn. Behind that fact lie all the other basic facts which there has never been the slightest attempt to conceal. They are these: Since 14 December 1974 the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> had Executive Council authority to borrow up to US$4,000m and to determine on behalf of the Australian Government the terms and conditions of the borrowing. The Minister was also authorised to sign and deliver promissory notes for the purposes of the borrowing, or to authorise any other person in writing to sign and deliver the promissory notes. That authority was revoked on 7 January 1975 since it had not been used and it conflicted with a Deutschmark loan then pending. On 28 January 1975 the Executive Council authorised the Minister to raise a loan not exceeding US$2,000m. The authority was revoked on 20 May 1975 since negotiations were in train for a borrowing of US$1 00 m through Morgan Stanley and Company Incorporated of New York. Executive Council authorities are usually sought only when a loan matter approaches finality. This does not mean that negotiations or discussions about possibilities are precluded without Executive Council authority. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the borrowings, as set out in the explanatory memoranda for the Executive Council, was to meet the needs of the Australian Government for 'substantial sums of non-equity capital from abroad for temporary purposes, amongst other things to deal with exigencies arising out of the current world situation and the international energy crisis, to strengthen Australia's external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia's supplies of minerals and energy and to deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment in Australia'. The Australian Government intended to carry out these purposes by spending the borrowed moneys on development of the nation's energy resources. At my Press conference on 10 June 1975 I said that henceforth no person will have any authority to do anything in relation to borrowings by the Australian Government, unless it is done with the Treasurer's authority. </para>
          <para>These are the basic facts. The fundamental facts of the authorisations to the Minister, first to raise up to US$4,000m and then to raise not more than US$2,000m, were confirmed by the Minister for Minerals and Energy in Parliament on 23 April in response to a question from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> From the very outset- as early as 13 February, in this House, on this matter- I freely acknowledged that open government did not and should not apply to 2 financial matters- overseas borrowings and the value of the currency. The real financial unorthodoxy, the real breach of convention, lies with those who would assert that a responsible government should not strive to preserve confidentiality in loan negotiations. </para>
          <para>What were the international circumstances the Australian Government had to confront? In 1973 and 1974 eruptions of unprecedented magnitude shook the financial world. Balance of payments surpluses from the sale of oil began to accumulate in enormous quantities in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries world, principally in the Middle East. Surpluses amounting to no less than US$55 billion to US$60 billion are believed to have accumulated in this way in 1 974 alone. This huge shift in the location of capital greatly altered the situation of the financial institutions of New York and London which had traditionally dominated the international financial world. This is not to say, of course, that they have not struggled to maintain their hold on international financial business. Like the rest of us, however, they have had to depend on the OPEC countries- the Middle East- for funds. </para>
          <para>Let me also point out that there have been some very large borrowings of petro-dollars since the OPEC surpluses began to accumulate a year and a half ago. In August 1974 the International Monetary Fund raised US$3.4 billion, and the World Bank has made a series of quite large borrowings. We also are aware of individual borrowings of US$1 billion or more by the United Kingdom, Japan and France. But if the Australian Government seeks it- this is sinister, this is a scandal. This Australian Government is interested in obtaining loans from that source. We were last year and we still are. We make no apologies for it. It is absurd to suggest that this Government or any future Australian government will be able to ignore this potential source. No government will be able to fly in the face of economic reality for the rest of this century. </para>
          <para>Sources of overseas loans do change. Today's unconventional sources are tomorrow's traditional sources. Whenever possible, previous Australian governments have readily turned to new sources, even though at times there has been resistance and criticism, at home and abroad. In the 1920s and 1930s Australia borrowed mainly on the London market. After the War we began to look much more to the United States and Swiss markets, and even to Canada. Then, with the effective closure of the United States capital market as a result of the introduction of the interest equalisation tax in 1963, the Australian Government turned to Euro-currency raisings in the German, Dutch and Swiss markets. The previous Government also borrowed on the Japanese market. </para>
          <para>Many members, including those who served in previous governments, will be aware that unsolicited offers of overseas loans are received from time to time. The very fact that a new source of borrowings of unprecedented magnitude appeared in the Middle East has meant that there has been a great increase in the offers from people outside the traditional channels who have claimed to have access to these funds. Obviously, a government which had made clear its interest in seeking such funds, as we have, will receive a great many such offers. There is no reason in prudence or propriety why they should be ignored, or just pushed aside. Treasury records indicate that over the last 10 years there have been about five .hundred names associated with approximately 250 offers claiming access to loan funds available overseas. Almost one hundred of these offers have been received in the last 12 months, no doubt as a result of the changes that have occurred in the distribution of capital funds in the financial world. </para>
          <para>I have had a schedule prepared in the Treasury of unsolicited or unconventional offers referred to the Treasurer or the Treasury by members of Parliament between 1950 and 1975. The schedule lists approaches made within the period indicated, through then-serving 3 State Premiers, 7 Federal Ministers, 2 Senators, 5 members of the House, 2 State members, one State Treasurer and one former Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister, to be precise, through my Department. To press the point I mention that the schedule indicates approaches made through my own good offices and those, to quote living persons, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> honourable R. C. Wright, the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cramer, the honourable David Fairbairn, the honourable Ian Sinclair, the right honourable John Gorton, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Mackellar, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> honourable John Wheeldon, the honourable Les Johnson, the honourable Jim Cairns and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Armitage.</inline></para>
          <para>Sometimes the approach has been made to the Treasurer himself. For instance, in a letter dated 7 April 1961, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pisterman</inline> of Melbourne, apparently the Australian attorney of a Swiss insurance company, wrote to the then Australian Treasurer, the Right Honourable Harold Holt putting forward a proposition for a borrowing of 25 million Swiss francs in Switzerland by the Australian Government. After examination by the Treasury, there were discussions between Treasury officers, including the then Secretary to the Treasury, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pisterman</inline> about the proposition. Subsequently a senior officer of the Treasury who was overseas in connection with various loan matters visited Switzerland and had. discussions with the Swiss insurance company to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pisterman</inline> had directed him. Nothing came of the matter. Clearly this Government Government- is not alone in responding to such offers and fairly it may be assumed that the Government has, as we say, an obligation to check such references. This we have done as have previous governments. </para>
          <para>In the case of the authority to the Minister for Minerals and Energy great care was exercised, with the assistance of the Government's legal advisers, to ensure that the intermediary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> would have no claims against the Government and that the Government was protected at all points in connection with the proposed borrowings. Swiss lawyers were actually engaged to advise at the settlement stage and arrangements were made for a senior officer of the Attorney-General's Department to go to Switzerland to be present at the settlement discussions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was not an agent of the Australian Government. He has all along been dealt with by the Australian Government as a person representing undisclosed principals. </para>
          <para>The Minister will table papers relating to this second negotiation, and here, too, the House can judge for itself. I repeat: Not a cent has been paid, has to be paid, will be paid to the gentleman. </para>
          <para>There has been much deliberate confusion created about the manner of use by the Government of these overseas borrowings. Any moneys borrowed by the Government would become part of the loan fund, in the public account, requiring an appropriation by the Parliament for expenditure for the purposes of Australia. None of the moneys could have been spent except in accordance with parliamentary appropriation. </para>
          <para>Loan raisings are not normally referred to Cabinet for decision and they were not in this case. It was proper to authorise the loan raising negotiations by Executive Council instrument, and this was done. The initial Executive Council meeting comprised senior Ministers of the Government- in this instance myself, the then Treasurer, the Minister for Minerals and Energy, and the then Attorney-General. Before making their recommendation to the Governor-General, the Ministers had the advice of the first and second law officers of the Crown. It was proper for the Governor-General to act on the advice of his Ministers. </para>
          <para>It is no secret that the Treasury had reservations about my Government's intention to authorise the Minister for Minerals and Energy to investigate loan raising overseas in the terms of the Executive Council authority. I freely admit that fact, which apparently has become known to the Opposition and the electorate through the leaking of documents. In the event, we took the advice of other departments. In saying that we did not accept the Treasury reservations I make no apology, as. I make no apology for the Government's original concept of borrowing extensive petro-dollars for capital development: nor should I. It is an arrogant suggestion that a government, whatever its policies, should be frustrated in its decisions because of any bureaucratic opposition. </para>
          <para>Is there any real challenge to this view from the Opposition? Certainly there was none when it was in government. If it needs support, I need go no further than the 1968 Garran oration by the former Governor-General and <inline font-style="italic">former</inline> Minister of the Crown, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, who examined very closely the proper relationship between advisers and Ministers. </para>
          <para>There are numerous other authorities, such as those quoted by the Solicitor-General in the memorandum incorporated in today's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> This reaches to the heart of the matter- the real origins <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> this present controversy. Our decision had political objectives. It was a decision about policies. </para>
          <para>Those policies meet opposition from many quarters. Some of the opposition comes from those quarters who prefer to believe they are threatened or disadvantaged by our policies and our program. The allegations of impropriety are just a. smokescreen for the real ground of opposition. The way to destroy the policies is to destroy the men who promote them. </para>
          <para>There" is no part of the program of this Government so deplored and resisted by the business establishment- the national establishment and the international establishment, the orthodox at home and abroad- than our determination that Australians shall have the maximum share in the ownership and control of Australia's resources. </para>
          <para>Equally, there was no aspect of our program which received more support from the Australian people in 2 elections. In the 1974 election it was perhaps the decisive issue- the enemies of that policy know that the people support it. Therefore, to discourage popular support for the policy, the methods through which that policy can be implemented must be discredited. </para>
          <para>Because the loan proposals which the Minister for Minerals and Energy was given authority to pursue were to be the vehicle for carrying out those policies, the proposal itself must be discredited. The borrowings we seek for energy purposes involve projects of immense scope and great consequence to the development of Australia by Australians. Those projects involve immense sums of money. </para>
          <para>A feature of this whole affair has been the way in which figures have been wildly bandied about. The fact is that over a period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> discussed various sums with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> At no stage, however, was there authority to conclude any borrowing outside the terms of the 2 Executive Council authorities. It would be absurd to suggest otherwise. Equally, there has been much deliberate confusion about the nature of costs which might have been paid. In fact the interest rates proposed and the expenses associated with the loan, including commissions, were never at all out of the ordinary by comparison with other Government loan raisings overseas. For instance, during 1974-75 there were 10 overseas borrowings by the Australian Government in the German, Swiss and New York markets. The highest rate paid was 10 per cent for a German loan of 200 million De uts che marks in September 1974 with an issue price of 99 per cent and total expenses estimated at 2.22 per cent. As a result the yield to the investor was 10.23 per cent and the cost to the borrower 10.74 per cent. The interest rates for all the other loans were in the range of 8 per cent to 10 per cent. Expenses of borrowing have also fluctuated. </para>

              <para>- In a number of instances total expenses have exceeded 5 per cent on the face value of a loan. For instance, loans were raised in Switzerland in 1967, 1968 and 1970 when the right honourable gentleman who interjects was Treasurer. A Swiss loan raised as recently as March 1975 had a coupon rate of 8 per cent, an issue price of 100 per cent and total expenses estimated at 4.37 per cent. The proposed borrowing being negotiated through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> had a coupon rate of 8.35 per cent, an issue rate of 100 per cent, and it was understood that all expenses, including the commission, would be met by the lender. This would have meant that the yield to the lender and the cost to the borrower would also be 8.35 per cent. </para>

          <para>Further, it is suggested that sums like $2,000m are so vast as to be unmanageable or unusable. Yet only this week, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd, made a submission to the inquiry into the petroleum and mining industries being conducted by the Industries Assistance Commission. In its submission CRA claims that Australia will need to invest more than $4,000 million to boost mineral production by 1980 to maintain Australia's position in the world mineral trade. It is investment of this magnitude we have to be thinking about. Let me recall some of the matters which were concerning the Government- along with all governments in comparable countries when drafting the Executive Council minute of last December. Unemployment was rising to a level quite unacceptable to my Government. The world energy crisis had shown no signs of easing. World-wide inflationary pressures compounded both problems. </para>
          <para>We saw one opportunity to counter these temporary short-term pressures on our economy and energy sources, while at the same time reaping long-term benefits of enduring significance to Australia. If the opportunity was to be seized, we knew we should act promptly. We wanted to distribute the money we were hoping to raise quite promptly in a way which would most effectively counter the immediate problems facing the nation. These were the considerations and the circumstances which prompted our urgency. </para>
          <para>The operation of the financial agreement was of course considered. The former Attorney-General advised orally that, in the exceptional circumstances I have outlined, the borrowing could probably be regarded as a borrowing for temporary purposes within the meaning of the financial agreement. There were no requirements under the financial agreement for consultation with the State premiers for a borrowing of this kind for temporary purposes. It is of course usual and proper for loans to be sought overseas in advance of Loan Council approval. The terms and conditions of a proposed overseas borrowing are usually referred for approval to the other members of the Loan Council- the States- only when there is a firm proposition to put to them. I made our position quite clear in the House on 20 May. The Leader of the Opposition asked me when would the Government seek approval of the Loan Council for the proposed $2 billion borrowing by the Minister for Minerals and Energy. I answered:  . . . if and when the loan is made. </para>
          <para class="block">He asked: What is the purpose of the loan? I answered:  . . . for matters related to energy. </para>
          <para>Provided with the capital, Australia's vast opportunities to develop its energy resources could be quickly realised. The nation, every State and Territory would benefit from the development of our uranium, our natural gas, our coal our immense natural resources of energy. Australia's wealth of uranium resources offers vast opportunities for the establishment of an enrichment plant. We are determined to exploit Western Australia's enormous natural gas potential the North-West shelf belonging to Australiarather than selling off this vital part of Australia's farm. </para>
          <para>In order to tap the natural gas resources in South Australia, New South Wales and off Western Australia, we have under consideration proposals costing over $400m for pipelines. My Government is exploring ways of using the vast coal deposits in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria to produce oil by hydrogenation again an enormously expensive operation. The growing coal market is inhibited by the lack of adequate port facilities. We must up-grade our major coal ports. Australia is heavily dependent on foreign-owned shipping for the carriage of her trade. We are entirely dependent on foreign vessels to carry our crude oil imports. We should not be so dependent on foreign shipping for such vital resources. We need equipment to electrify our railways in Brisbane and Adelaide and many trunk lines in the eastern States. </para>
          <para>These are the great, the challenging uses to which we were contemplating putting the funds. Are we to apologise for seeking these goals? Are we to apologise for our determination- our continuing determination- to see them realised? Of course, in all such projects, nothing should be done before full investigation of their feasibility and cost benefits. Quite clearly, there is no point in investigating the feasibility of projects likely to cost at least $A3,000m if one has no prospect of raising such funds. To maintain and to increase ownership by the people of Australia of our own resources call for immense sums of money far beyond even our very high propensity to save. We need foreign capital, but as loan funds, not as equity. It is for this reason that we were and still are prepared and anxious to borrow these sums of money on the best of all possible credit, our own country and the wealth of our own resources. And the real opposition to this loan proposal comes from those hostile to that objective. </para>
          <para>It has been suggested by some of our critics that these borrowings would have been inflationary. In economic terms, of course, this is pure nonsense. The proceeds of these borrowings, would, of course, have been invested overseas until they were required, probably in New York where a good part of our international reserves are now invested and have been for years past. Does the Opposition suggest that it would be inflationary to import pipes, tankers, hydrogenation and electrification equipment, mining and milling machinery, all or most of which we must import? Would it be inflationary to purchase shares in Australian enterprises from their present owners in London and New York? </para>
          <para>We saw our opportunity through which the objectives so strongly supported by the Australian people in the last 2 elections could be pursued. That particular opportunity has not yet been realised. If the opportunity presents itself with reasonable chance of success, we shall try again. It is, of course, impossible to answer every allegation, every innuendo, thrown up by the Opposition, by the media, in all the outpourings of the last week. In the exact words of the absent right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> in a very different context, in very different days: </para>

          <para>There has been a third loan negotiation. By the way in which it has been given a sinister connotation and by way in which the name of a Minister behaving with perfect propriety has been dragged in, it epitomises the conduct and capsules the motives of the Opposition. The television program <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> on 22 May alleged that the Treasury was negotiating a loan with Trans i a Corporation Ltd. In fact that company had been informed in February by the Treasurer that the Government did not wish to take any further action in relation to its proposal. There was a further approach from Trans i a Corporation in April 1975- this time through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn, a shareholder of the company and also a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. </para>
          <para>A proposal for US$3.7 billion in loan funds was put forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> rang the Minister for Northern Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson),</inline> the Treasurer being unavailable. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson</inline> passed the message on to the Treasurer, received confirmation from the Treasurer that the Government was interested in raising loan funds and passed the response back to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn. On 20 April 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, the Secretary of the Treasury, telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> to say that the Government was taking no action in respect of proposals he had made. I was informed about Trans i a Corporation's involvement on 23 April 1975 in respect of a separate approach by the company. On this occasion the company was referred by the Treasurer's office to the Minister for Minerals and Energy, and subsequent dealings with Trans i a Corporation Ltd were conducted by the Minister's Department. The company has not been able to satisfy the Government's requirements as to verification and identification of funds, and nothing has eventuated. </para>
          <para>Papers relating to Trans i a Corporation could be tabled, but I would be reluctant to publish them. Many financial institutions are mentioned. People in the financial world are named and their standing commented on. The papers relate to transactions in a delicate area of business, and companies and individuals are entitled to feel, in dealing with the Government, that the normal confidentiality will apply. Surely there has to be an end to the attempted destruction by the Opposition of the country's good name and reputation and to these insidious imputations against Ministers, companies and individuals. Does the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> want <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn's papers to be tabled? Does he make any charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn? </para>
          <para>Of course, in that respect this has been a damaging affair. The Opposition intended it to be a damaging affair. No attempt has been made to check the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> or motives of notoriety hunters and self-seekers. Attempts to damage Ministers and the Labor Party are one thing; attempts to damage Australia and Australia's credit are another. These have failed. Of all the charges made, the one that can be most quickly and fully disproved is that the Australian Government damaged Australia's credit worthiness by seeking the petro-dollar loan. The truth is that Australia s credit has never stood higher. Last October Moody's, one of the two great New York credit rating agencies, gave Australia, for the first time, an Aka rating, the highest available. On 9 June, at a time when the international financial community was completely aware of our proposal to raise the loans which are the subject of the present controversy, that Aka rating was confirmed by Standard and Poor's, the other New York credit rating agency. </para>
          <para>For the whole period of the existence of the Executive Council Authority, our credit rating has remained at the highest. If that is not enough, let me point to the extremely successful US$1 00m loan floated in the New York market in June. New York investors expressed a confidence in Australia's credit which some Australians seem quite willing to undermine. I cannot take any responsibility for any damage our opponents' approach may have; but where it really counts and where it can really be tested, we find Australia's credit higher than at any time in our history. </para>
          <para>Let me bring all these points together in one summary of all the issues involved. At no time was Parliament misled about the nature, size or source of our loan proposals. Their purpose was to pursue policies in the interests of Australian control of Australian resources. The proposal was economically sound. Legal advice was obtained from the Government's legal advisers before the Minister for Minerals and Energy was given authority by the Executive Council to proceed with negotiations for the loan. Proper care was exercised with the assistance of the Government's legal advisers to ensure that the intermediary in this matter would have no claim against Australia or the Australian Government. Australia and the Australian Government were protected at all points in connection with the proposed borrowing. Proper checks were made on the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the gentleman involved. Not a cent has been paid or will be paid or is liable to be paid to the intermediary. There has been no impropriety on the part of the Australian Government. There have been no breaches of the law. Australia's international reputation as a Government with prime borrowing status remains unchanged, remains as high as it has ever been. These are the real matters at issue. These are the important issues. </para>
          <para>It all boils down to this: Was there impropriety in the Australian Government seeking a loan which would help promote Australia's immediate and urgent wellbeing and promote great long-term Australian objectives? Was there any impropriety in the manner in which the Australian Government sought to achieve those objectives? The objectives were proper; the means were proper. Let those who say otherwise now specify their allegations of impropriety or illegality- specify the precise charge, the precise breach. </para>
          <para>The purposes for which we sought the loan command the clear support of the Australian people. The purposes, the means, were perfectly proper. The Australian people have shown their clear support for our objectives in promoting Australian control of Australian resources, which in the final analysis is nothing short of Australian control over Australia 's destiny. </para>
          <para>In the perspective of these great objectives, the Australian people will despise the pettiness, the self-serving, of those who have chosen this issue to undermine the fulfilment of those objectives. They will quickly see that those who would use any weapon to damage this Government do not give a damn if, in the process, they damage Australia herself. That is the great impropriety m this affair- the wilful attempt to damage Australia, her credit, the people's chance to control and develop the resources of their own land. Those efforts will fail as they deserve. Australia's credit remains untarnished; and on any charge of impropriety or any toleration of impropriety, the record will show that this Government is equally untarnished. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has been as contradictory and as misleading in the statement which he has just made as he has been and his Government has been throughout the whole of this unhappy and sordid loans affair. He has even contradicted himself on the reason for sacking the present  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Labor Party because he said that discrepancies concerning letters formed the sole and principal reason for the sacking. But in certain Press conferences which he has held he said that the great difference between <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> the Minister for Minerals and Energy, was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was acting with authority and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was not. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> has had something to say about this. At a Press conference he indicated that he was acting with Executive Council approval and with the approval of legislation. As we shall show, one of the charges against the Government is that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy have in many senses acted as the former  Deputy  Prime Minister was alleged by the Prime Minister to have acted. If the Prime Minister wants to sack one Minister for one particular act why does he not sack another who has acted in the same way? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are other contradictions in the speech which the Prime Minister has just made. He said that the $4,000m was to be borrowed for inflation purposes and to cure unemployment but in another part of the speech he said it was for energy purposes. He cannot have it both ways. At another point in his speech he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At no stage, however, was there authority to conclude any borrowings outside the terms of the 2 Executive Council authorities. It would be absurd to suggest otherwise. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think it ought to be noted that those Executive Council authorities were utterly unlimited. If the Minister had wanted to agree to a 20 per cent rate of interest and utterly impossible terms he could have done it. There was no limit at all, and for the Prime Minister to put in his speech a statement which suggests that those Executive Council authorities were responsible and limiting on the Minister concerned is a sheer nonsense. That is typical of the kind of evasion and half truth we have had from the Prime Minister on this matter. He said that once and for all it will be decided today in this Parliament. Unfortunately that will not be so because we have had selected documents, selected by the person who needs to stand and tell the truth and make all the facts available. The Prime Minister said that he does not want a royal commission because a royal commission can only get at the facts. That is just what we want; that is what Australia wants and that is what the media wants- the facts in this issue- and this Parliament and the people are entitled to the facts of this sorry and sordid affair. The tabling of selected documents a large number of which are irrelevant to the main charges against the Government will not answer those charges at all. The Prime Minister said that no charges of impropriety or illegality will be made against the Government. <inline font-style="italic">( Government supporters interjecting)</inline></para>

          <para>There are other aspects of this matter which I would have thought ought to concern members of the Government side of the House. One of their colleagues has been sacked from 2 positions -almost sacked twice for the same offence- but, as I have indicated, it can be clearly demonstrated that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy themselves have not upheld the high standards which the Prime Minister claims to take to himself and his Government. The Prime Minister said that because those high standards were not upheld by the  Deputy  Prime Minister he had to be removed. The Prime Minister, as the facts will show, I believe is as guilty of those matters as was the  Deputy  Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>We heard the quite extraordinary logic of the Prime Minister when he said that not one cent has been lost, not one dollar has been spent and no commission has been paid. One could almost say that this is like a group of people planning to rob a bank, getting into the vault and finding they could not get the vault door open and because they did not get the vault door open and they failed in their attempt there is no crime, no sin. To plot and to plan a wrongful act carries with it as much blame whether it is successfully carried out or unsuccessfully carried out and it is nonsense for the Prime Minister to claim the fact that not a cent has been paid as a mark of the innocence of his Government. Then he talks about the Aka rating. He could have said how that has developed and how it is given to a country. </para>

              <para>- It has been given to this country on 2 counts. Firstly because of the performance of Australia over a 10-year period. It is a 10-year period that is reviewed. Most of that period was a time when we were in office. Secondly we got that Aka rating because of the mineral exports of this country which all were formed and developed in our time in government and which have been damaged very much by the present Government's activities. So, for the present Government to claim credit for that rating is again sheer hypocrisy and it is misleading this Parliament. </para>

          <para>We have had enough of this nonsense from the Prime Minister. We have had enough words without substance. We have had enough words without performance. He will find that performance on the stage no longer hides the great deficiencies of his Prime Ministership and his Government. If he did not get the message in Bass he will certainly get it at a later point. We have received from the Prime Minister not information but a smokescreen. We have received no real explanations. We have had red herrings and not facts. He has attempted one of the most blatant cover-up exercises in the history of this Parliament. The Prime Minister's tongue is no substitute for substance and facts, and the people of Australia will not be fooled any more. Like Premier Dunstan in South Australia they will want to disown the Prime Minister and his Government. What about this intriguing story about no Caucus meeting this morning? Did the Premier not say: 'I can put up with a meeting of Parliament, that will be bad enough, but to have a Caucus meeting reported all over the newspapers as well is impossible'. We have heard of those repeated phone calls to the Prime Minister saying: 'No, I do not need you in this election campaign. Thank you very much for offering'. Just as in Bass the Prime Minister's speech today has been irrelevant to the main issues and has been inaccurate. How many people will stand behind him? How many friends has he left? I notice the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> sitting so comfortably next to him at the moment. </para>
          <para>The Government has become ensnared in a web of incompetence and deceit and a full public and open inquiry is required. It is the only way to get at the facts. I remind the Prime Minister of what he said in other days. He said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The people of Australia no longer trust their Government. The affair arises from an appalling attempt to keep secret one of the worst scandals of Australia's history- a scandal compounded with stupefying incompetence and brazen deceit. The whole country is concerned with the ineptitude, intrigue and deception. The whole country is demanding answers. There have been Labor calls. The distinguished  President  of the Senate; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lowe,</inline> the  Deputy  Leader and Tasmanian </para>
          <para class="block">President; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burns</inline> want all the facts- a full disclosure. The Prime Minister has tried to fob the nation off with partial disclosure, misrepresentation and scapegoats. How much of what has happened to the former  Deputy  Prime Minister occurred because the Prime Minister wanted a scapegoat for another of the activities of his Government? Knowing the matter was to break he wanted to label it all on one man. How much of the meeting of this Parliament today is to try to summon support for an event on Monday? </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister stands revealed as a person more concerned with his own survival than with honest decent government for Australia or the fortunes of his own Party. I think what he said today reaffirms that. The basic issues concern the competence and honesty of the inner junta which signed the infamous Executive Council decision on 13 December 1974. The Executive Council decision is clear evidence of the most shocking incompetence and raises the most serious possibility of a deliberate conspiracy to deceive and to defraud. Perhaps the Prime Minister cannot hear it. It is a charge that can be put at rest only by the revelation of information and adv i sings that have not been made available or by a royal commission which would have access to documents and to files. </para>
          <para>It is not all that necessary to dwell at length on the first charge of incompetence because I believe every person in Australia now accepts it. The purposes attached to the Executive Council minute themselves were absurd. It was stated that it was to protect Australia against an energy crisis a year after that crisis had broken, a crisis which because of our own supplies as a result of our earlier policies had hardly touched Australia. To strengthen our external financial position: Our balance of payments position was healthy, or did not the Prime Minister know that? Australia's overseas reserves still amount to over $3,000m in spite of the extravagance of his Government and the trend was up. So why did he want to strengthen the external financial position by a borrowing of $4,000m? To deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment: The Prime Minister knows that there is an easier way of doing that without getting into hock to Middle East countries. He can do this by deficit financing, or has he not heard that his Government has been practising deficit financing over recent months with the prospect of greater use of that tactic in the forthcoming year? </para>
          <para>To protect supplies of minerals and energy: That again is absurd because Australia is one of the most resource rich countries in the world. We did not need to get into debt to the tune of $4,000m to protect Australia's supplies. What is the reason for seeking such a loan? The Prime Minister suggests that it is national development. In relation to national development, we have only to look at what has happened since his Government has been in power from 1 972 to this year. The number of oil and gas investigatory wells in operation has dropped from forty-one to eight and there are no developmental wells in operation around Australia at the present time. That is the Government's record in relation to national development. </para>

              <para>- If people do not like what they are hearing, that cannot be helped. Nevertheless, the Government's record of incompetence is unparalleled in the history of Australia. Incompetence is too weak a word to describe the action of the Government and the harm it is doing to hundreds of thousands of individual Australians, the people the Government is meant to support right around Australia. Was not Treasury advice strongly against every aspect of this loan? The former, former Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> is in the House today. On 22 November 1974 he made a famous, honest and proper speech. He said that reputable and traditional sources had access to funds. The Prime Minister, in another one of his deceptions, said that unconventional sources today become conventional sources tomorrow. He gave no examples of that and it has not happened. It is most unlikely that it will happen. That former Treasurer repeated himself two or three days ago when he said that the chickens are coming home to roost. I hope that he attacks the credit, as he ought, on Monday. The honourable member said: </para>

          <para class="block">But this was too sanguine a view. A Prime Minister and a Minister for Minerals and Energy did involve themselves. Why was Treasury advice ignored? Why was that Treasurer sacked?

He said: </para>

            <para>Many similar proposals are made each year to the Government. Experience in investigating these proposals has invariably shown that the main objective of the intermediary has been to seek to obtain some form of authority to raise funds on behalf of the Australian Government without being able to provide satisfactory verification that funds are in fact available for lending. No Treasurer could of course agree to provide such authority. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One Minister did, as did another Minister. What grounds did the Government have for believing that funds were available from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani?</inline> Nothing has been said about that by the Prime Minister. The incompetence runs into the naive and the foolish. Why did they go to a man like Khemlani when all advice and all experience indicated that substantial Middle East funds are available only through the most reputable sources? Why did they go to a man like Khemlani when British and American negotiations have been directly ministerial at the highest levels and when the Bank of England confirms that Middle East money does go through traditional and responsible sources? Why did they go to a man like Khemlani when all advice was that the money was not available? Why was the impact of the funds on the Australian economy utterly ignored? It would have increased the national debt by $1,000 for the average Australian family. The amount approaches the total income of all companies in Australia last year. It exceeds the value of all wool, wheat and sugar produced in Australia last year. It is almost as much as total government spending on welfare. No comparable loan had ever been raised. At one stroke it would have increased Australia's overseas debt threefold. Yet the Government claims to be responsible. The Government has been careless and unconcerned about fundamental national interests. Its dogma had taken charge of its commonsense. The gross incompetence of the Government, however, is beyond belief. It is sufficient alone to condemn it, but it is probably a less important charge than the other questions that are raised by the Government's actions- the questions about honesty, integrity and legality which are of fundamental concern to all Australia. </para>
          <para>Let us come to that more serious charge which goes to the very integrity of Australian institutions. Facts now before the public raise the strong possibility that there was an illegal conspiracy to defraud and to deceive. Facts now before the public indicate a deliberate devious attempt to avoid by a subterfuge the constraints of the Constitution and to defraud the States. What an irony that we debate these matters on the very anniversary of the date on which the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act was signed, 9 July 1900. The projected borrowing of $4,000m has the appearance of a massive illegality. Section 105A. (5.) states that the Government is bound to the terms of the Financial Agreement with the States regardless of anything else in the Constitution, including Section </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="61.">
              <para>The Financial Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, at clause 3 (8) requires the Commonwealth to submit loan programs to the Loan. Council unless a specified exemption applies. Clause 6 (3) of the Financial Agreement makes an exemption of borrowing for temporary purposes. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>At this point the illegality seems clear. The purposes of the loan are clearly not temporary. The documents tabled today, which many honourable members probably have not yet read, provide irrefutable evidence that at the time of the Executive Council minute there was a clear intention to enter into a long term loan for 20 years and not a loan for temporary purposes. One of those documents is the Khemlani draft acceptance document dated 16 December 1974. Earlier correspondence, I think especially with the permanent head of the Department of Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> establishes the same fact. The Prime Minister said that no one has suggested illegality -but it has been suggested. But if he had thought that, and if there was no illegality, why has not the Prime Minister tabled written legal advice that might have been obtained at the time- or was it not obtained at the time? Was there no such advice? The Opposition parties have helped to overcome the deficiencies of the Prime Minister's own actions. I should like to table advice from William Deane which would indicate quite clearly that if the funds were not for temporary purposes the actions of the Government were illegal. Other legal advice is available of the same quality and character. </para>

            <para>In this matter I have been provided with  a  photocopy  or  what purports to be a Minute Paper for a meeting of the Commonwealth Executive Council of 13 December, 1974. That Minute Paper is headed 'Department of Minerals and Energy ' and reads as follows: </para>

          </item>
        </list>
            <para>Typed beneath the above appear the names of the Prime Minister of Australia, the then Treasurer, the then Attorney-General and the then Minister for Minerals and Energy. There is nothing on the Minute Paper to indicate whether the Recommendation contained in it was, in fact, approved in Council. </para>
            <para>Attached to the Minute Paper is a document headed 'Explanatory Memorandum'. That document reads as follows: 'The Australian Government needs immediate access to substantial sums of non-equity capital from abroad for temporary purposes, amongst other things to deal with exigencies arising out of the current world situation and the international energy crisis, to strengthen Australia's external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia in regard to supplies of minerals and energy and to deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment in Australia '. </para>
            <para>I am instructed to assume that the Recommendation contained in the Minute Paper was, in fact, approved in Council without alteration or amendment, at a meeting of the Executive Council held on 13th December, 1974. I am also instructed to assume that the borrowings up to 4000 million United States Dollars, which were purportedly authorised, were to be raised outside the Commonwealth of Australia. I am, finally, instructed to assume that the proposed borrowings were outside any projected borrowings placed by the Commonwealth before the Loan Council and were quite independent of any borrowings by the Commonwealth which had been considered by or authorised by the Loan Council. </para>
            <para>I am, on the basis of the above-mentioned assumed facts, instructed to advise the Liberal Party of Australia whether in the context of the provisions of the Financial Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, the Governor-General in Council could lawfully confer upon the Minister for Minerals and Energy and his delegates the borrowing powers purportedly conferred and whether any borrowing by the Minister or his delegates in purported pursuance of such authority would have been lawful. </para>
            <para>By virtue of the provisions of Section 105 (5)of the Commonwealth Constitution, the provisions of the Financial Agreement of December, 1927 between the Commonwealth and the States (as from time to time varied) are binding upon the Commonwealth and the States notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution or in any law of the Commonwealth Parliament. Clause 4 of the Financial Agreement expressly provides that, in circumstances which at present exist, 'money shall not be borrowed by the Commonwealth or any State otherwise than in accordance with this Agreement'. It would seem clear that the projected borrowings were outside the overall borrowing program for which the Financial Agreement makes provision. It follows, in my opinion, that the projected borrowings could only be lawfully authorised if they would, if effected, come within one of the exceptions to or exemptions from the general provisions of the Financial Agreement. In my opinion, the only relevant exemptions or exceptions are those relating to loans 'for temporary purposes'. </para>
            <para>Clause 3 (8) of the Financial Agreement excludes from the amount to be set out in the programs to be submitted to the Loan Council amounts to be raised by loans for temporary purposes. Clause 6(3) exempts from the provisions of the Agreement (other than clause 6) borrowings solely for temporary purposes when such borrowings are of the type specified in clause 6(1) (a), that is to say, borrowings 'within the Commonwealth' from specified sources. </para>
            <para>It can be strongly argued that the overall effect of the Financial Agreement is to prohibit all overseas borrowings by the Commonwealth 'for temporary purposes'. On this argument, the prohibition contained in clause 4(4) upon borrowings 'otherwise than in accordance with this Agreement' will be operative unless one can find authorisation of the particular borrowing pursuant to the general provisions of the Financial Agreement dealing with Loan Council procedure or a specific exemption of the particular borrowing of the type found in clause 6 (3). If this argument were to be accepted it would lead inevitably to the conclusion that the borrowing which the Governor-General in Council purported to authorise would have been in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Agreement and, therefore, unlawful. </para>
            <para>While the question is obviously one upon which legitimate differences of opinion may exist, I have reached the conclusion that the exclusion of loans 'for temporary purposes' from the programs to be submitted pursuant to clause 3 (8) has the effect, subject to compliance with clause 6 in relation to loans 'for temporary purposes' from Australian sources, of permitting loans for such purposes to be made 'in accordance with' the Financial Agreement even though such loans are made outside <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> loan procedure laid down by that Agreement. </para>
            <para>It is clear that if the proposed borrowings had not been borrowings 'for temporary purposes' they would have been in breach of the Financial Agreement and illegal. It follows that the restriction of the authority conferred by the Governor-General in Council to borrowings 'for temporary purposes' was essential if the conferring of the authority was not to amount to a purported authorisation of an illegal act. It also follows that if, in fact, it was intended to expend the moneys borrowed for other than temporary purposes, the proposed borrowings would have been illegal as being both beyond the authority conferred by the Governor-General in </para>
            <para class="block">Council and as being in contravention of clause 4 (4) of the Financial Agreement. </para>
            <para>The facts available to me do not enable me to reach any conclusion on the question whether the purposes to which it was intended to devote the proceeds of any borrowings were, in fact, of such a nature as to make the proposed borrowings loans 'for temporary purposes' within the meaning of those words as used in the  Financial  Agreement. The most that can be said is that, in my opinion, a loan 'for temporary purposes' is a loan to supply funds for a passing or transient need. Whether or not a particular loan is or is not 'for temporary purposes' must, in each case, be a question of fact to be answered in the light of all the relevant circumstances. In some cases, the answer to the question will be uncertain even when all relevant facts have been ascertained. Apart from such borderline cases, however, the answer to the question whether a loan is or is not 'for temporary purposes' will once the relevant circumstances are known, be readily determined by the application of ordinary common sense. Thus, for example, a loan for one month to supply bridging finance would, in the context of the Financial Agreement, clearly be a loan for temporary purposes. On the other hand a loan of, for example, ten years to supply finance for the acquisition of assets which are to be held for an indefinite term or for the carrying out of work of an enduring value would not, in the context of the Financial Agreement, be such a loan. </para>

            <para>- I thank the House. The use of the formula by the Government to raise funds overseas has all the earmarks of a deliberate conspiracy to evade the Constitution for secret and disturbing political ends. The secrecy is unparallelled. Confidentiality usually applies to actual negotiations, not to the borrowing intention itself, and that was kept secret. The Prime Minister tried to say that all was known from about 12 or 14 February. But throughout the early part of this year the Government and the Minister for Minerals and Energy, who is now sitting at the table, answered minimally, refusing information, saying that it would be improper to provide information. If it were not for the persistence of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in these matters much of what is now known around Australia would have been kept quiet, would have been kept secret. The Executive Council minute was available to a Swiss bank and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> That is how it got flogged all around the world. Is it any wonder that people thought they were agents properly appointed by the Government? That document was not available to the people of Australia, but it was available in financial circles all around the world. </para>

          <para>On the basis of illegality, the Government set in motion processes which led to Australia's name being bought and sold in many places. It is time that the Government answered honestly, with a full revelation of what has happened and not with a partial record, a selective tabling of documents selected by the person who himself is in the dock over these particular matters. This illegal subterfuge was undertaken under the most sordid circumstances and in the greatest haste. Consider the dates: On 22 November the former, former Treasurer made his famous speech. He publicly came out against this kind of deal with this sort of intermediary. The same day it was leaked from the Prime Minister's office that he was going to be removed. On 3 December 1974 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> cabled that he would be able to finalise the first batch of $500m before 9 December. But where was his authority? There was no Executive Council decision by that time. So, what is the difference between that and the action of the last Treasurer who was accused of acting without authority? </para>
          <para>On 8 December <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> arrived for his second known visit in this country. On 11 December the Treasurer was dismissed. On 13 December there was the infamous Executive Council meeting. On 14 December the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt flew overseas. On 16 December <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> left, believing he had full authority to borrow on Australia's behalf. An examination of the documents, an examination of the Executive Council minute and an examination of the exchange of letters not just one letter, but the total correspondence or the total communication- between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and the Minister create a relationship of agency. That is the view, at least, of the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department who indicated that there was a relationship of agency not less and not greater than the relationship of agency established in relation to the last Treasurer's letters to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> If one was guilty, so was the other. If one was innocent, so was the other. The Prime Minister convicts one but protects and exonerates the other. Did the Prime Minister know of this? Does he now claim innocence of this? Was the former Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> sacked in the mad illegal rush for fool's gold? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> may have misunderstood the relationship, but I am sure he did not and no one in the financial world would believe he did. </para>
          <para>It now appears that, like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns, Mr Connor</inline> was engaged in raising massive loans for at least a month, and on some information for maybe two or three months, before the authority was provided. If the Prime Minister is to be evenhanded he ought to sack him in addition. In addition to that, the Minister for Minerals and Energy, who is sitting at the table, has misled the Parliament. He said that there was no agency. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> says that there is an agency, if a limited one- but an agency. It is high time that the Prime Minister was even-handed in his actions. The Prime Minister himself is the most culpable of all his team. The only way he can get out of it is by a full tabling of all the documents and departmental adv i sings; or, alternatively, if he is not prepared to do this, by a royal commission. A royal commission would, in any case, need the documents. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has consistently misled the Parliament and the Australian people by a flood of half-truths which are now engulfing him. On 20 May 1975 he said that the loan was for matters related to energy. That clearly misrepresents the Executive Council minute. Now, who is right? Was the Executive Council minute a lie or was the other statement a lie? They are not both true. On 20 May he said that approval of the Loan Council would be sought if and when the loan was made. But that is totally inconsistent with the Executive Council minute of 13 December 1974 which authorised the Minister to complete a borrowing. On 10 June at a Press conference he made the point of saying that there were no letters to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> from the Minister, but now letters are tabled. Is a letter not a letter if it is in the form of a cable? Was he merely trying to widen the false distinction between the former  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy? On 5 July at his Press conference he twice used the formula that the Minister was authorised to pursue inquiries. Well, that would not be so bad; we could almost trust the Minister with that. But it is quite clear from the Executive Council minute that he was authorised, completely and absolutely without reference to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or anyone else, to consummate a loan or to consummate a deal. The minute attempted to confer unlimited authority on the Minister for Minerals and Energy. </para>
          <para>On 5 July at his Press conference the Prime Minister said nothing was so extraordinary as to be improper about the Government's loan dealings except the sums involved. But what of the use of intermediaries, and the way people met secretly behind closed doors and in hidden places? What of the issuing of the letters of the kind that were used, the terms that were considered, the very nature of the negotiations, the use of full statements of purposes and the massive foreign exchange gamble? It is not long ago that the Minister for Minerals and Energy, who is sitting at the table, blamed Australian mining companies for writing contracts in United States dollars. When there were some changes in currency value, he said that this was their risk and their fault and that nobody with any sense would write a contract or a borrowing in United States dollars. But now we see a loan for US$4,000m or US$8,000m to be repaid in US dollars. The Minister for Minerals and Energy stands convicted by his own criticism of the mining companies which got into difficulties as a result of the revaluation of currency by this Government. </para>
          <para>What could possibly be the motives of the Prime Minister in forging this chain of deceit? Is he a man incapable any longer of confronting, knowing and understanding the simple truth. Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the Australian people as a downright lie. The half truth, the partial answer and the slipping over of the full facts are a misleading of this Parliament just as much as and maybe much more deliberately than the statement by the former Deputy Prime Minister. When the former Deputy Prime Minister answered that question in this Parliament, I doubt whether any member of this Parliament thought he was speaking anything other than the truth. The Prime Minister has indeed set the standards of his Government. By those standards, the Prime Minister is condemned. </para>
          <para>He has sought to belittle an inquiry on the grounds that it could only get the facts. That is all that we want. That is all that the Australian people want. The Prime Minister has tabled selective documents which hide many of the facts. The present situation is intolerable. There are too many serious questions unanswered. Did the Prime Minister know of the unauthorised activities of the Minister for Minerals and Energy and his Department before 13 December 1974? If so, why did the Prime Minister do nothing? What legal opinions were received by the Prime Minister on the legality of the Executive Council action? Was the legal opinion only from the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy?</inline> What were the real purposes of the $4,000m loan? We have had so many explanations; which one can be believed? </para>
          <para>What was the purpose of the original deception, if even now the latest explanation happens to be an accurate one? Did the junta of four receive advice of the likely impact of the loan on the Australian economy? What was that advice? Did the Governor-General accept without question the legality of the Executive Council minute? Indeed, was he present, or was the Vice-President of the Executive Council in the Chair? Was there indeed a conspiracy to deceive and to defraud the States and to evade the terms of the Constitution? What references did the Government have for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> at the time when it commenced dealings with him? Was the former  Deputy  Prime Minister acting with Executive Council authority as he has since claimed? Is there therefore no difference between his actions and the actions of the Government? Did the Prime Minister receive the Harris letters some weeks before he made them public? Why did he hesitate so long? Was it to wait until after the Bass by-election? Has the Australian Government been approached by any agents asking for the payment of commission they believe is due to them because of their efforts to raise loans for the Australian Government? Is the Australian Government still pursuing these vast sums of money? </para>
          <para>I now ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of significant questions which have not in fact been answered to this point. </para>

            <para>- I thank the House. A judicial inquiry is the only way to obtain full disclosure and to protect all parties. The Prime Minister owes this much to the Australian people. The Prime Minister has asked for our charges. The basic charge is this: By his actions he has called into question the very integrity of Australia's democratic institutions. He has lashed out at some of his own colleagues in a campaign designed to protect himself. He has convicted the former Treasurer without a trial. On the evidence so far the Minister for Minerals and Energy is as guilty as the former  Deputy  Prime Minister. He appears to have been the leading member of an illegal conspiracy to evade the Constitution. The only way that the Prime Minister can establish his own innocence is by a full, impartial and judicial inquiry; not by wielding the numbers of the Government in this chamber. The people of Australia have waited for the Prime Minister to offer an explanation and provide the missing information. He has treated that request with arrogance and contempt. </para>

          <para>We need to ask why he has called the meeting of Parliament today. Was it to create a smokescreen? Was it to help him for next Monday? </para>
          <para class="block">Was it to denigrate the Opposition as he sought to but just refrained from doing? Was it to show that despite Bass he can still perform? Bass showed that Labor's greatest asset has become its greatest liability. Whenever the Prime Minister gets into trouble he attacks another colleague, alienates another friend. Is the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron),</inline> already in conflict with the Minister for Minerals and Energy, going to help him now? Does the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs know that the Minister for Minerals and Energy will table documents which implicate the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs further? If he does not, he would do well to note some of the documents, of which I have copies, that will be tabled by the Minister. Is the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> going to help the Prime Minister because he shares a former Treasurer's view? What about the fellow conspirator, the Minister for Minerals and Energy? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Murphy</inline> cannot help him- he has departed. </para>
          <para>Australia has had enough of this Prime Minister. It is time that we heard the truth and that a full public inquiry was held. A royal commission is the only way by which that can be achieved; not a narrowly based inquiry which could support a cover-up as this operation today is a cover-up. The Opposition would expect to be consulted on the terms of reference of that inquiry. If the inquiry does not eventuate the Opposition will consider what action it will take. The Australian people have the right to have answers. Why did the Prime Minister try to avoid the Loan Council? Why is he being so secretive? How much has been concealed? Why has he tried to mislead the Press and the Parliament? Is his Government involved in massive illegality? Does he admit the truth of all the matters which have appeared in the Press because not one part of it has been denied? Has the Prime Minister led a deliberate conspiracy to evade the Constitution? We can only know the answers through a full and open inquiry. Accordingly, I move the following amendment to the Prime Minister's motion: </para>

              <para>- The same international forces and their Opposition puppets which frustrated the early birth of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and which destroyed Prime Minister Gorton now turn their malice, their spleen and their venom on an Australian Government which stands in their path as they seek to enlarge further their grip on Australia's resources of minerals and energy. United States Ambassador Marshall Green has said that per capita Australia is the world's most resources rich nation. Australia's proven recoverable reserves of minerals and energy are worth, on a present day calculation, $A5,700 billion-an astronomical figure. In the future they will be worth even more. They represent a security ratio of $A1,425 in assets for every $A1 of our proposed borrowing- the best security ever offered to overseas lenders. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Last week in Tokyo I negotiated with the Japanese steel mills a 5-year coal export arrangement which is worth over US$10 billion. It is over 2V4 times the value of the proposed emergency loan, the subject of this debate. The whole of the Opposition case is based on the alleged enormity of the loan transaction. Our proposal for borrowing is the proverbial 'peanuts' compared with the depth and the range of Australia's resources. The loan transaction was for the necessary infrastructure for the emergency development of those resources based on the energy crisis. The profit alone from the loan transaction would have been 1½ times the value of the loan. When one speaks in billions it is difficult for people to understand the true measure of Australia's real and potential minerals and energy wealth. </para>
          <para>Our offence in the eyes of certain international forces is borrowing through official Australian Government channels capital funds on the credit of Australia to cope with an energy crisis. Their alternative is for those funds to come into Australia as foreign investment and foreign ownership- the tragedy of Australia's development hitherto. </para>
          <para>In one of the most shabby episodes in Australian journalism rival newspapers in 'cheque book' journalism offer unheard of sums to shabby continental fringe men beyond the jurisdiction of Australian courts. The Opposition certainly would not produce them at any inquiry that it is claiming should be held. It would not be game to. It would be afraid to and it would be ashamed to. These men have been paid for fabricated documentation suitably slanted to support the motives of these newspapers. Having built the newspapers, they have then followed with their denials. </para>
          <para>Sixty-five billion Middle East petro-dollars, generated by the energy crisis, is sought to be invested yearly. In addition to that are short term investments which need to be recycled. Between $20 billion and $25 billion of this goes annually to the United States- the merest trickle to Australia. The orthodox financial institutions are unable to cope with this unprecedented flood, just as the orthodox economic advisers of some of the world's major governments were unable to anticipate the results of over dependence on cheap imported crude oil. Today they are bewildered and lack plans to correct the distortion in the world economy. Australia, although more fortunately situated than most, still imports nearly $A700 million worth of crude oil yearly. This will be further escalated by the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to further increase crude oil prices in early October, to match the impact of world inflation on their oil incomes. A projected increase of up to 35 per cent could raise Australia's payments to $1 billion annually. In this situation, which I forecast in April 1973, it was no less than my duty to present to the Prime Minister and my senior colleagues a plan for direct overseas borrowing of $A3 billion- equal to US$4 billion- to deal with this menace. </para>
          <para>I point out that $A450 million of our import bill can be replaced with the full availability of natural gas throughout Australia in substitution for imported crude. This economy alone would have aggregated in 7 years the total projected loan. The full list and cost of urgent energy items was presented not only to my co-signatories of the Executive Council minute but also in the presence of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The Secretary of the Treasury has consistently opposed the project. My name was inserted in the Executive Council minute itself in the course of the drafting. I understand that the minute itself was drafted jointly by officers of the Treasury and the Attorney-General's Department. When it was brought to the Prime Minister's Lodge for signing at the alleged clandestine meeting, my name was inserted in it. I asked there and then why the Treasurer's name was not included, out of respect to the man because that was his function. The Secretary of the Treasury then said 'No' and objected strongly, and it was agreed that my name should be included. </para>
          <para>The orthodox objections that such funds could cause distortion if admitted into the Australian economy were answered by my proposal to domicile such funds in the United States, invested in approved securities in. the name of the Reserve Bank of Australia and with the approval of the United States Federal. Reserve Bank. The United States interest rates then available were comparable with those of the proposed borrowing. The moneys would have been drawn down as the respective parts of the energy crisis program were implemented on a 'crash ' and in some cases, ' turn-key ' operation. It was only financial logic and prudence that those petro-dollars should be lodged in the home of dollars. </para>
          <para>Apart from the completion of the natural gas pipeline from Cooper Basin - Palm Valley - Dampier - Perth, provision was made for the 84 miles of submarine pipeline from Dampier to the North Rankin production platform. Provision was made in my calculations for the necessary petrochemical plant at Dampier, to extract the natural gas liquids for conversion into motor spirit and other derivatives. The cost of 3 uranium mining and milling plants in the Northern Territory and assistance to the Cooper Basin natural gas consortium, in which the Australian Government is now a partner, was included, and also the cost of the plans to economise in diesel fuel consumption by electrification of the heavy freight rail areas in New South Wales and Victoria. Of current significance was a further provision for the upgrading of the 4 major coal exporting harbours of eastern Australia- Hay Point, Gladstone, Newcastle and Port Kembla. The need for over $200m for this purpose alone is proven by the recent contract with the Japanese steel mills to which I have referred. Despite the presence in Japan of the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> doing his ineffective but unpatriotic best to discredit Australia's Government last week, I was able to negotiate a very satisfactory agreement. </para>
          <para>To maintain and increase ownership by the people of Australia of our own resources calls for immense sums of money, to which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has already referred. In our probings for loan funds we are in such well known company as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn, a member of the Reserve Bank Board, who has been busy in Europe doing the rounds. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lang</inline> Hancock has also announced his interest in such sources for borrowing for the development of his iron ore interests in Western Australia. The issue in short is: Who will own Australia? It is a major issue on which the next Federal election will be fought, ignoring the smears and the sneers of an Opposition which has, to its eternal discredit, the current majority foreign ownership or control of Australia's mineral and energy resources. </para>

Subsequently, further inquiries were made, again by the Treasury of the Morgan Guaranty company of New York. The report was that the firm of Palatal and Sons (Commodities) Ltd was owned through a dominating company registered in the Bahamas which was owned by the second wealthiest family in India. In addition, further inquiries were made, all of which were designed to smear this man. </para>

          <para>I refer to your discussions in Canberra yesterday with my Minister, the Minister for Minerals and Energy, The  Hon.  R. F. X. Connor, and the Minister for Labor and Immigration, The  Hon.  Clyde R. Cameron, and to the further discussion this morning with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and me. </para>
          <para>I am writing to confirm to you what was said by the Ministers at their meeting yesterday. The Australian Government is interested in overseas borrowings of the magnitude you mention, up to a total of approximately US$4,000m, in blocks of US$500m, repayable at the end of twenty years. The Minister has suggested that the availability of such funds for lending should be confirmed at this stage, whereupon negotiations on amounts and other terms and conditions could be commenced immediately between the principals. </para>
          <para>In order to overcome any technical difficulties, such as loss of interest, that might result from confirmation, I am sure that we could commence negotiations on receipt of authentic information of the availability of such funds from a lender. For example, a letter from Johnson, Mat they Bankers Ltd conveying this information, accompanied by an indication of the names of the principals, would be fully considered. </para>

Since the Opposition has made so much of traditional Treasury practice I ask for leave to table and to have incorporated in Hansard a Treasury statement concerning unsolicited offers of overseas funds. If honourable members will read that they will see that my purpose was to identify principals and to secure proof of availability of funds. </para>

            <para>-On 5 December <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Drover</inline> reported by telephone: 'It looks as though it will be all right. I have seen satisfactory evidence that this money is deposited with a first class bank. I have undertaken not to reveal the name of the bank at this stage'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> returned to Australia on Saturday, 7 December. He attended a meeting with myself, officers of my Department and of the Attorney-General's Department, and representatives of Darling and Co. Ltd and their legal advisers, Messrs Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, at which the drafting of documentation was discussed. I seek leave to table and to have incorporated in Hansard a copy of the Memorandum of Advice given by the representative of Darling and Co. on 8 December. This arose from some question about  the effective cost of the loan to the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

            <para>-This was the latest redraft prepared at meetings attended by officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Minerals and Energy, Attorney-General 's Department, Treasury Department, the Reserve Bank of Australia and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> prior to his departure from Australia on 16 December. We also had the benefit on 16 December of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Roland</inline> Wilson advising on the wording of the draft acceptance. Special attention was paid in the drafting to ensure that there would be no liability for payment by the Australian Government to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and that he must look to the lenders for payment, which would have been a once only payment. It would not have been applicable to the deferred interest accruing on the original borrowing which, in fact, would have become annually recurring loans over gradually decreasing periods equal to each successive interest accrual. This was explained in the memorandum of Darling and Company. In view of the false allegations made by the Opposition I also ask for leave to table and to have incorporated in Hansard a list of the net proceeds per cent of loans borrowed by the former Government between 1967 and 1972. In many cases the expenses per cent exceeded that contained in the draft acceptance. As an illustration of the borrowings by the Liberal-Country Party Government in New York, I point out that the Commonwealth loan raising in that market in December 1966 involved expenses of 2.55 per cent and that the net proceeds were 94.95 per cent. </para>

On a preliminary enquiry by the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York we were asked specifically as to the present holders of the currency and their location, and as to the derivation thereof. Accordingly, we appreciate your offer to return to Zurich, and in company with senior officers of the Reserve Bank of Australia and its London Office, to obtain details of the prime banks from which the money is being mobilised to the Union Bank of Switzerland. </para>
            <para>The Reserve Bank officers will be producing for the information of the Union Bank of Switzerland copies of the Executive Council Minute of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, authorising me to enter into the necessary documents on its behalf. The Reserve Bank officers will also have available for perusal copies of the drafts of the Promissory Note and associated documents based on the original documents which you so kindly brought for our examination. </para>
            <para>We greatly appreciate your co-operation and assistance in this transaction, and particularly in securing its earliest possible completion. </para>

            <para>-In the light of this notification, cheques and a letter referred to by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 4 July have no validity, nor is the reference to payment of commission by the Australian Government correct. That reporting is typical of the gutter snipe levels to which the has descended- to borrow the tide of its celebrated slander of the Australian Government. To add to the egg on its face I remind honourable members of the libellous editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on Saturday last suggesting the complete failure of my coal mission to Tokyo when I had in fact negotiated the best commercial arrangement in Australian history. I remind honourable members of the ungracious, grudging, half-hearted withdrawal in last Monday's editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> after it had bothered for the first time to examine the facts.

We have been examining a loan arrangement whereby we would borrow four billion United States dollars in return for promissory notes totalling in amount 19.890 16 billion United States dollars payable at the end of 20 years from date of receipt of the United States four billion dollars. All operational charges, expenses and commissions would be met directly by the lenders presumably by the amount paid by the lenders in excess of four billion dollars to which you refer in your message. We would not, of course, be concerned in the payment of that amount for such operational charges etc., and consequently would regard it as entirely a matter for the lender to direct that such amount in excess of four billion dollars be paid either to fides or otherwise at their direction. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> said he did not want to boast. I think the House is very grateful for that because this Minister and this Government have little to boast about at the present time. In fact, a good deal of explanation and the production of documentation has very much gone by default during the course of parliamentary debate up to this stage. The Minister himself directed almost 5 pages of his speech to compounding this Government's duplicity. He described the projects- the long-term projects- for which he had authority to borrow as simply 'short-term funding purposes'. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On 13 November 1972 the then Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> put the following questions to the Australian people: 'Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which has lurched into crisis after crisis, embarrassment piled on embarrassment week after week? Will you accept another 3 years of waiting for next week 's crisis, next week 's blunder? ' </para>
          <para>Never before has there been a period in Australian history when those words have been so relevant. Never before has an Australian government been so discredited by its own financial incompetence. Never before has the Australian government been so degraded by international intrigue and by international scandal. For more than 7 months the Government has conducted a deliberate campaign to cover up an unprecedented, extraordinary and illegal conspiracy. It is a conspiracy which has placed Australia's economy and its international financial standing at serious risk, a conspiracy which has involved gross ministerial incompetence, the taint of scandal, and a conspiracy which has in the process threatened the democratic system in this country. </para>
          <para>This is a government in crisis; it is a government split by deep and bitter division. It is a government which has forfeited its integrity and, I believe, its moral authority. It is a government which has failed effectively to serve this country's national interest. It is a government led by a Prime Minister without respect for parliamentary democracy or the conventions of government. The Prime Minister during the course of this issue has lost his credibility and his standing. He has chosen authority in favour of respect. He has chosen power instead of leadership. He has chosen vindictiveness instead of restraint and responsibility. In short, I believe this Prime Minister no longer has the respect of his colleagues or the nation at large. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister stands today, in this debate, as a man condemned for aiding and abetting a web of half truths and continuing fabrications. I believe that in this debate he has deliberately misled the Parliament, his party colleagues, the Press and the nation at large. He has sought to avoid a judicial inquiry because concealment of the essential facts, which are yet to be uncovered, is his only defence. Ironically, this is the Prime Minister who pledged in December 1972 an era of open government in these terms: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Nothing points more to the deceit and the hypocrisy of that statement than the issue before this House today. The Prime Minister himself has been a party to the most infamous conspiracy of silence in Australian political history. Why has this Government indulged in more than 7 months of deceit, secrecy and continuing evasion? Why were answers not provided to the Opposition in December 1974 or during February and April of this year in response to a series of specific questions? This issue, this degrading scandal, would not now be a matter for major parliamentary debate if the Prime Minister had established proper procedures and guidelines for the behaviour of his Ministers and their personal staff. It would not now be a matter for debate if the Prime Minister had been prepared during the whole of the period in which this has become a national scandal to take the Parliament and the people into his confidence. The Parliament and the people deserve and demand no less. </para>
          <para>No Prime Ministerial statement can stand as an adequate response to the extraordinary revelations which have been made in this country in recent months. The Prime Minister's statement, selective and misleading, has not answered the questions which today demand to be answered in the national interest. It was a statement designed to avoid blame rather to adequately inform this national Parliament. It was a statement contrived to denigrate some and to excuse others. The Australian media has been unanimous in its demand for an independent judicial inquiry. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> editorial on 2 July said, a satisfactory explanation can come only through a royal commission or judicial inquiry. Senior members of the Australian Labor Party have supported this demand and the question which must therefore be reasonably asked is: Why has the Prime Minister denied the opportunity for a full and open inquiry? What is he hiding and who is he in fact protecting? Nothing said by the Prime Minister today and none of the documents which he has selectively tabled can take the place of a full judicial inquiry. The Government must, we believe, move to establish a royal commission or be subject to the continuing charge of monumental and massive cover-up of the type that we have seen during this parliamentary debate. What the Opposition parties seek- what I believe the public and the media require- are the facts in relation to the Government's recent loan raising activities. Then, and only then, can this House make a proper judgment. It cannot do so today on the basis of the information which the Government has been prepared to put before the House. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister, of course, is the central figure in this debate. He is the Minister who must carry the ultimate responsibility for the scandalous actions of his Government. He is one of the 4 ministers who signed on 13 December the Executive Council Minute which sought to achieve by an unlawful process a borrowing of up to $4,000m.  His  conduct amounts to a conspiracy. What was the purpose of the 4 ministers who, without any reference to .this Parliament and without any reference to Cabinet, conspired to provide the Minister for Minerals and Energy with unrestrained and unprecedented authority to borrow up to $4,000m from overseas sources? By unlawful means, by contemptuous evasion of the financial agreement, the Loan Council and the States, they embarked upon a secret fund raising venture. Does the high office of the Prime Minister of this country exculpate him any more than the high office of the former  President  of the United States was deemed to exculpate that gentleman from criminal charges? The fact that the loan was not raised cannot be seen or be interpreted to represent any form of defence, because what was being proposed was unlawful. As the legal opinion tabled by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> indicated, the whole basis of the loan was constituting an unlawful act. </para>
          <para>Why was section 105A of the Constitution ignored? That section binds the government to the terms of the financial agreement, notwithstanding anything else in the Constitution, including section 61. Why was clause 38 of the financial agreement ignored? That clause clearly requires the Federal Government to submit loan programs to the Loan Council in the absence of a specified exception. There are no grounds for claiming that clause 6 of the financial agreement, which provides for an exception for 'temporary purposes', could have applied in this particular case. Previous administrations did not make overseas borrowings without consulting the State premiers and without permission from the majority of the States being received. In every case a majority of the State governments agreed. The most frequent objector, I understand, to loans raised by the Australian Government ironically has been the South Australian Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan.</inline> I understand that the South Australian Premier has objected to previous loans- loans sought for Papua New Guinea- but he has remained uncharacteristically silent on this occasion. Why has he remained silent while the other premiers have been prepared to speak out on behalf of the interests of the people in their States. </para>
          <para>Section 61 of the Constitution has never been used in this way before. No explanation has been given as to why the loan was sought for what the Executive Council minute described as 'temporary purposes'. The concept that the funds in question- the $4,000m- were for temporary purposes can be described only as the height of deceit. How does that stand against the draft acceptance taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> on 16 December 1974 which identifies in the most unequivocal terms that the loans sought were for up to 20 years? How does that stand against the subsequent evidence that in 1994 the taxpayers could have been liable for a payment of almost $20,000m? Does this Government honestly believe that $4,000m is available for purposes of short term investment? If the funds were for short term investment in Australia there could have been a total and catastrophic economic collapse. </para>
          <para>The alleged purposes for the loan revealed in the Executive Council minute of 13 December have, in fact, no economic foundation. Australia was not suffering from a critical balance of payments deficit in December 1974. That situation did not require the immediate borrowing of substantial loan funds. <inline font-weight="bold">Major changes</inline> in the direction of Government fiscal and monetary policy had already taken place. Further initiatives of the scale proposed would have led to severe economic instability. There was no immediate need to protect our sources of energy supplies. The energy crisis internationally had only a limited impact on the Australian economy. Unemployment was, of course, the most severe since the Second World War; but unemployment benefits could have been and have been financed by normal Budget mechanisms. In other words, the case put according to that Executive Council minute has no economic foundation whatsoever. Only 3 weeks before the Executive Council minute was signed, the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> in a major policy statement on behalf of the Government, stated: </para>

          <para class="block">In a matter of days <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> of course, was removed from office. One wonders out loud whether in fact that removal had any relationship to the conspiracy which was, in a matter of a few days, to take place through the meeting of 4 Ministers in Executive Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline> advised the Government against this course of action. The Treasury advised against it. The Reserve Bank of Australia advised against it. Why has the Prime Minister failed to table, failed to make public, the advice which he has received from his own Treasurer, from the Department of the Treasury and from this Government's other principal financial advisers? The reason is that that advice explicitly warned the Government against the actions upon which it chose to embark. The reasons for those warnings have become dramatically clear in recent weeks. The danger of giving one man- not the Treasurer- immense and unrestrained power has never been more apparent. This country has been the deliberate and sustained target of funny money dealers from all parts of the earth, with cheques for commissions of $20m to be drawn on the First National City Bank and hundreds of mandates and authorities circulating like confetti in the name of the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>Because the Executive Council minute was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> to the Union Bank of Switzerland and to the Moscow Narodny Bank, financial institutions were able to state, as the Moscow Narodny Bank did in numerous examples of its correspondence: </para>

If the honourable gentleman who interjected wants to criticise in this House the head of the Federal Treasury, as some of his colleagues in another place did so irresponsibly, let him participate in the debate and let him be prepared to have the advice of the Treasury tabled in this House so that that advice will be subject to no misapprehension of the type that the honourable gentleman might have in mind.

              <para>- Is the Minister accusing me of accepting or taking documents from the Federal Treasury? If he is, by way of interjection, it is part of a typical campaign of irresponsibility upon which he and his colleagues have embarked. I take the opportunity to say that at no time were any documents provided to me or members of my staff by any member of the Federal Treasury. Where are the Executive Council minutes authorising the Treasurer in respect of a De uts che mark loan, a United States loan and borrowings for the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the associated letters and documents? Where is the advice to the Government in respect of loan raisings from the Treasury, the Department of Minerals and Energy, the Australian Industry Development Corporation and finally the Commonwealth Bank? Where is the advice from former Treasurer Crean? Where is the advice to the Government from the Reserve Bank? Where is the advice to the Government about the legality of the Executive Council minutes? Where is the Treasury advice on the impact of a $4,000m loan? </para>

          <para>I simply say to this House today that these questions and the request for this information is only part of what the Opposition seeks to put before this House today. We do it in brevity because of the question of time. No parliamentary debate of this type can reveal the total truth and the complete story of this Government's duplicity. The only way in which this Government, this Prime Minister, can dispel the taint of scandal which now surrounds his Government is through the medium of a royal commission. Unless such an inquiry is established more documents and more evidence of his Government's conspiratorial activities will inevitably be made public in the period ahead. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline>Harris of Melbourne was employed by a company called Al co International Ltd of which I was a 60 per cent shareholder and he was a 40 per cent shareholder. He has been employed by that company since 1 March. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>is both my employee and my partner. Sometime late in December or early January, I received a phone call from a man well known to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roger</inline> Lockwood, who said that he knew of a source of funds for a project I was involved in but first he asked if I had in my employ a man named George Harris. I said I did and he suggested that a meeting could be arranged with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Thompson of </para>
            <para class="block">Sydney, who could be of assistance. He insisted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> be present. </para>
            <para>At the meeting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thompson</inline> said he knew that the Australian Government was seeking $4,000,000,000 from overseas and, if this was so, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thompson</inline> believed that he could arrange for that loan. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>was believed to know <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and he agreed to speak to him. </para>
            <para>Later Harris stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> had said the government was still interested in the loan but it would not deal with intermediaries. </para>
            <para>On March 7 1975 1 went with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> to the office of the Treasurer in Melbourne to keep an appointment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> for about half an hour and he was shown one telex and one letter. The telex was from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fensore</inline> of a company by the name of Sunlight, New, York. It was addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> at telex AA22796 and indicated that the $4,000,000,000 was available at 7.7 per cent at an emission rate of 99.5 percent and with a once only brokerage of 2.5 per cent. The letter was from Commerce International Co. to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fensore.</inline> I have supplied a copy of the telex and the letter. </para>
            <para>The purpose of our visit to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was to obtain from him two letters in terms of this telex-one, a Letter of Authority, and the other, an agreement by the Australian Government to pay a brokerage or commission of 2.5 per cent. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline>made it very clear in the interview that he did not believe that a loan could be arranged in accordance with the terms mentioned in the tel exes. He said the terms were unbelievable. He used the word 'fairytale' to describe the documents, rejected the idea and said we would be wasting our time. </para>
            <para>He said he would give us something upon which we could make enquiries and called in a typist, 1 believe to be Miss Karen Stellar. Harris knew Miss Stellar well. </para>
            <para>Dr J F CAIRNS asked Miss Stellar to take some notes to compose a draft letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> It was not to be addressed to Al co International. </para>
            <para>While Miss Stellar took notes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> did most of the talking- I said a little. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> objected to a number of points. </para>
            <para>The girl left to prepare a draft of two letters, each of which was to be in general terms. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>and I left <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> office and went to wait in part of the office where two girls, one was Miss Stellar were sitting. Harris went over and stood near Miss Stellar and began to talk to her. On two occasions she removed paper from the typewriter and destroyed it and inserted new paper. When a letter appeared to have been agreed upon, the girl and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> moved towards <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> office. She appeared to be carrying a bundle of letters. The girl went into <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> office and came out within two or three minutes with Harris, who then came to me and said, 'We've got the letter, let's go'. </para>
            <para>When we were outside, I asked him to show me the letter and he showed me the letter dated March 7, which was addressed to Al co International Pty Ltd and which stated that the Australian Government was interested in overseas funds and in the event of a successful negotiation being arranged and provided the interest rate for a loan did not exceed 8 per cent in total, the government would be prepared to pay a once only brokerage of 2V4 per cent. </para>
            <para>I was pleasantly surprised at the terms of the letter as I had gained the impression whilst in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> office that he would not concede to most of our requests. I had expected him to deliberate on the terms and conditions of the drafts before issuing the final letters to us. </para>
            <para>I asked him about the second letter which was also required, and he said, 'Let's get out of here now, I'll come back on Monday, I can get that at any time '. </para>
            <para>In order to get the second letter we had to go to Sydney to see <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> on the Monday following, March 10. He made this appointment with Miss Stegmar. We went to his office in Sydney and Harris asked him for a letter indicating in general terms that the government was interested in borrowing. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> said to us that it was no good asking for anything in the way of an authority from the Australian Government and all he would give was a statement that the government is willing to borrow funds from overseas on suitable terms and conditions. </para>
            <para>A letter to this effect was prepared. It was dated 10 March 1975 and was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> He told Miss Moroni in the outer office to change the addressee to Al co International but she said, 'That's what the boss dictated and that is all I am permitted to give you'. We then left the office. </para>
            <para>Harris a little later went to America and I went to London. Harris informed me in London by telex dated 15 March 1975 that he had concluded an arrangement to obtain the funds from Ivoryy B. Clarke Incorporated, the English partner of P. Murray- Jones Ltd. I have provided a copy of that telex. The telex said that Harris would go to London with a representative, a Vice <inline font-weight="bold">President, Mr Ginena,</inline> of Ivoryyy B. Clarke, to conclude the deal. Harris came to London and after waiting for some ten to twelve days in London, no representative of Ivoryyy B. Clarke turned up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginena</inline> phoned almost every day with some excuse why he did not come, until finally he said he could not come because the King had been assassinated. I have received no satisfactory explanation as to why the money was not made available. </para>
            <para>I believe that loan funds at an all up rate of 8 per cent, including commission, were never available. 1 have been introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> to many important people. I was bedazzled by his familiarity with many important people. </para>
            <para>On one occasion when my wife and I were staying at the Southern Cross Hotel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> took us to a private dining room where he was having dinner with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, Dame Patti, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Jean</inline> Harris and two other couples whose names I do not recall. He also introduced me to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ray</inline> Meagher. We had a luncheon meeting at the Southern Cross concerning our Melbourne property. </para>
            <para>Whilst we were in London Harris, Guinea and myself were to go to Saudi Arabia, so I had to obtain a visa for that country. I found it very difficult to do so. So Harris took me to see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting, whom I had never met before. At that time it was a cordial visit and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> appeared to know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> very well. The following day when we found that visas for Saudi Arabia were so impossible, we went to see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting again. We made no appointment to see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting- we just bowled in without an appointment. </para>
            <para>On the second occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> was not in but we had a discussion with his private secretary. George told him we had to go to Saudi Arabia and we needed a letter each from the High Commissioner to obtain our visas quickly. Later the same day we returned and spoke to the private secretary and were given a letter each. A copy of the letter concerning me is provided. </para>
            <para>Although I had met <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting only once, the letter states <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Nagy,</inline> who is of Christian faith, is well known to me . . .' </para>
            <para>We later returned to Australia and arranged a further appointment to see <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline></para>
            <para>On April 15,1 accompanied <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> to his office in Canberra where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> gave a written draft of a letter to Miss Moroni. After a while Miss Moroni re-appeared and said, 'There's the draft and, as you can see, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> altered it quite substantially and he is not prepared to concede any further points on the matter'. </para>
            <para>Subsequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> came out and said, 'The letter is being typed now, George. I have to go to Question Time and on my return I will sign it for you. I don't expect to be more than half an hour'. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline>later returned. The letters were signed and brought out to us by Miss Morosi. Having read the letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> told Miss Moroni this is insufficient for our purposes and insisted that he wanted to see <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline></para>
            <para>Within minutes, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> saw us and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> tried to persuade him that certain points as per George Harris' draft letter recommendation were important to be included. After some five minutes discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> flatly rejected our requests, whereupon we departed. </para>
            <para>The draft letter brought in by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was kept by Miss Morosi. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>had his draft letter typed at the Carlton Football Club. </para>
            <para>On April 16, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and I went to London where we commenced negotiations with my European connections to obtain a loan for the Australian Government. Two days later my brother-in-law, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr William</inline> Hanna, joined us to help us with our work. At <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> request, we went to see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting once again at Australia House where a meeting took place between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John, Mr Harris</inline> and myself and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> gave the originals of both of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> letters to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting to show him what our mission was. Harris then explained, at great length, to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> about the Khemlani affair. He gave him certain names and said should anybody contact him regarding loans, he should beware as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> only, himself, was authorised to seek out loan funds. He told <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> that even he was not empowered to negotiate, but on locating any funds, he was to report to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline></para>
            <para>Harris repeated to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting a remark made to him (Harris) and me when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> had said, 'I'm not going to give you any authority, anything stronger than that. I've got enough trouble trying to get the government out of this bloody Khemlani mess '. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>then called in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Neil</inline> Davey, Minister (Financial). Australian High Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> introduced us. As we were leaving <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> said to Davey, 'You best talk to these people. Take them into your office'. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> said, 'I already have copies of the letters from the Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> supplied me with them'. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>said, 'Look after them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> is an old friend of mine'. </para>
            <para>We then went into <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey's</inline> office where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> repeated verbatim what he had told <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>explained that there may be bankers wishing to check his credentials and in accordance with paragraph 3 of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns'</inline> letter, neither <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Davey</inline> should give any information to anyone unless prior approval was obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> He stressed this point a number of times. </para>
            <para>We saw a number of bankers in London and on the Continent and eventually we obtained offers of two separate loans-one from the Excel Bank, for $1,000,000,000, the representative of the lender being Who Trust of Zurich. </para>
            <para>On receipt of a letter from Bank Excel about this matter, which I have provided, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> left on May 16 for Australia to present the letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline> On Monday, 1 9th May, or Tuesday, 20th May, whilst I was staying at the Bayer is her Hoff Hotel in Munich, I received a telephone call from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> in Australia. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> has approved the transaction and said that, provided the facts are as in the letter of Bank Exel, he will despatch officers of the </para>
            <para class="block">Treasury Department to handle the matter with the bank. This can be corroborated by my brother-in-law, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna.</inline> Upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris'</inline> phone call, I arranged for a further $6,000 to be sent to him to cover his salary, air fares and expenses. On May 23rd, I obtained the Who Trust confirmation for this transaction, the original of which is in my possession. A copy is provided. </para>
            <para>On Saturday, 23rd May, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> arrived back in Zurich and told my brother-in-law and I that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> would be arriving in Paris the following week and that he was staying at the George Fifth Hotel and that he had arranged to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> in Paris. </para>
            <para>In the meantime, we obtained a further offer for the sum of $502,775,000 from the Neue Bank of Zurich and Harris was to submit this offer to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> in Paris. We waited in Zurich until Friday, 30th May. Harris told me that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was coming to Zurich and he was going to see him there. I returned to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> went to Frankfurt for the weekend and was to have come back to Zurich to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> on Tuesday, May 3rd. </para>
            <para>On my return to Australia, the newspapers reported that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was cutting short his trip and returning to Australia because of the loan controversy. I rang <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> at Hotel Zurich early the following week to tell him about the media playing up the case and that his name had been published m practically every newspaper. </para>
            <para>My brother-in-law, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna,</inline> at my request, met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> at the airport in Sydney to update him on the latest developments in the controversy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna</inline> told me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had said don't worry, he had had three telephone conversations with Miss Moroni and two with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and the whole thing was a three day wonder. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline>informed me that he saw <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> about June 1 1th and said he had given the two offers to him. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> would acknowledge them and pass them on to the new Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> for follow up. </para>
            <para>After that date there were several conversations between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and myself in which he reassured me everything was' all right and the deals were going ahead well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna</inline> told me he had received similar calls from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline></para>
            <para>During the week ending Friday, 20th, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna</inline> and I flew to Melbourne and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> picked us up at the airport and drove us to the Carlton Football Club and we held a meeting in the President's office where we questioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> as to what he was doing about the loan matter. He said he was still certain the government would accept the loans but at the same time, in order to ensure that our loan deal does not receive any unfavourable publicity, he had made a deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> with prior consent of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> to supply him with details on the so-called Khemlani deal, in return for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> would soft pedal on the so-called Harris deal. </para>
            <para>On Thursday, June 26th, a further meeting took place between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris, Mr Hanna</inline> and myself in my Sydney office, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> again reiterated that our loan was progressing well and on Tuesday, 1st July, I flew to Melbourne where I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> at the Southern Cross Hotel, where we had lunch and later had a discussion about my Melbourne property. One other person was present. Harris said you will have to excuse me for an hour or so. I have an appointment with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline></para>
            <para>In due course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> returned and I said I would like to talk to him on his own. He offered to drive me to the airport and he said this will give us an opportunity to talk privately. </para>
            <para>During this drive I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> that only the night before Iliad heard on the radio or TV that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had been seen with the  Deputy  Opposition Leader. I told him that was most unwise and that quite frankly I no longer believe that the government has any intention of taking this loan. He accused me of being an idiot and that he had handled the Australian end of the deal and that I should remember he was acting in the interests of all of us. </para>
            <para>He further said that during the meeting of the same day with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> he had passed over the names and addresses of banking people we had dealt with in Europe, whom he believed will be able to supply <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> on his forthcoming trip to Europe with plenty of ammunition concerning the Khemlani loan affair. After questioning, he further informed me that it was he who passed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> the photocopy of the telex that was published previously in the media concerning the Moscow Narodny Bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> said to me, 'Cairns is finished. The government is finished. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> said he will take up the loan when he becomes Treasurer'. </para>
            <para>I returned to Sydney and on my arrival I arranged with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna</inline> to see me at my home the following morning and I explained to him what had transpired between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and myself. He said this sounds so fantastic, I can't believe it. My wife was also present. I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna,</inline> if you don't believe me, ring him right now. </para>
            <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hanna</inline>then dialled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and had a conversation with him. When he finished he said that he was now forced to belief in that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> had confirmed all that I had said about the Lynch-Harris meetings. </para>
            <para>I then chewed over this matter and later I placed a call to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> He was out. I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Harris</inline> who assured me he would ring me back the following day. On Thursday, 3rd, I rang <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> again and was told he had left for Adelaide and he would not be back until Sunday evening. I asked that she ask him to phone me. I have not yet received any reply to my calls. </para>

            <para>-I thank the House. It is rather inconvenient from up here. It is my responsibility and duty in this national Parliament today to defend myself. I do not intend to talk politics. I do not intend to use the exaggerations for political reasons that we have heard recently from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> I intend to be fairly precise. I intend to seek to defend myself with the full sense of responsibility to the Government and to the Australian Labor Party of which I am part. If it were not for that I would not be here. I am not concerned with a collection of letters, a collection of international communications and meetings here and there. I am concerned first of all with one matter, that is, whether I misled this House on 4 June 1975. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I thank the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> for what I understood he was saying about that when I think he said that no-one would believe that I did mislead the House. But I have a responsibility of convincing honourable members about that and of convincing the people of Australia as well. On 4 June 1975 I answered a question in this House from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and by interjection from the Leader of the Opposition whether in a letter dated on or about 5 March I had offered a commission or brokerage fee of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent on any loan money arranged by the recipient of the letter or his company. I answered that question by saying no. I said that at no stage did I offer a commission or brokerage fee at 2 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent or any other amount. </para><para>I have stated continuously since 4 June that I would explain this matter to this House alone and to no one else. I found myself compelled to depart from that when the Prime Minister demanded an explanation, but it is to the House and to the House alone that I propose to explain publicly. Had the House been in session when I discovered there was evidence that I may have signed a letter referring to a brokerage fee of 2Vi per cent under certain conditions, I would have come back to the House and said: 'On 4 June I answered a question truthfully to the best of my recollection but I have now seen evidence that perhaps I might have been wrong. If I was wrong I want to correct that impression and say to the House: 'Please accept my apology'.' I would have done the same thing as I have heard other honourable members do on dozens of occasions during the 20 years in which I have been a member of this House. The House no doubt would have accepted by explanation, as it has accepted theirs. I take now the first opportunity I have had since 4 June 1975 to explain to the House about this matter. </para><para>I did have authority to have discussions with people about overseas loans. I had that authority in terms of an Act of this Parliament authorising the Government to borrow $2 50m on behalf of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and I had that authority in terms of an Executive Council minute authorising me to do that. On 7 March I had interviewed George Harris and Leslie Nagy in my office in Melbourne. They asked me to provide them with a letter offering a brokerage fee of 2½ per cent, provided that a loan could be arranged at a total cost of 8 per cent. I made it clear to them that a loan could not be arranged under those conditions, that they would be wasting their time if they thought so, and that I would not provide any letter or other document making an offer of this kind. I have a clear and positive recollection of rejecting the proposal about the 2Vi per cent brokerage fee and the 8 per cent interest rate. When I answered the question in this House on 4 June 1975 I had this clear recollection. I answered the question in accord with that recollection. This is still my clear and positive recollection of the matter. I have no recollection that I offered to anyone at any time a brokerage fee of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent or any other amount. Since then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> has given me a letter dated 7 March 1975, which apparently bears my signature, which does offer a brokerage fee of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent, provided a loan was obtained which did not exceed an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum in total. I assure the House that I have no recollection whatever of having signed this letter and it was completely contrary to my expressed intention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy,</inline> and indeed to several others, both prior to and after 7 March 1975. </para><para>On many occasions I have been approached by people who said they could find funds overseas from oil country sources on terms and conditions much better than the conventional ones from the United States or from Western Europe. I believed this to be true and I still believe it to be true, and I believe that if we seriously followed up the opportunities that are available it would be possible for this nation to gain a very great amount from entering into new financial relations with Middle Eastern countries. I was convinced that it was in the interests of Australia that this matter should be fully explored. I agreed with the initial decision by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> and the then Attorney-General, at a meeting at the Lodge early in December that this should be done. From discussions with other Ministers, and on my own behalf as Treasurer, I decided that the position I should take was that we should allow certain people to make inquiries on our behalf to ascertain if loan funds were available and to report back to us if they found good prospects. The Prime Minister fully accepted this approach. </para><para>In my own discussions with the many persons who approached me, in every case I laid down a number of conditions. First was the one that the Australian Government gave no one the right to negotiate or act as its agent in respect of any loan. They were entitled only to look around and to report back to us, and I usually emphasised that it should be to me. Further, I emphasised in all cases that I would not agree to any conditions in advance- interest, emission, brokerage or commission. On more than one occasion- in fact, I suppose on many- I rejected proposals by people who wanted me to be specific about these matters as I rejected them to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy.</inline> I told those I thought were reliable: 'Find out what you can and let me know. If the prospects look reasonable I will then ensure that Treasury, Reserve Bank or Commonwealth Bank officials take up the matter and decide whether the money is available and decide what we should pay for it in interest, commission or brokerage'. On several occasions this is precisely what was done. </para><para>At no stage did I ever attempt to conduct negotiations. At every stage I made it clear to everyone to whom I spoke that no agency obligation or responsibility could possibly arise until a loan acceptable to the Australian Government was actually undertaken. I was clear and specific in this respect in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy</inline> as in every other. I believe that nothing whatever they may consider they had in terms of a letter could possibly be claimed to have any validity in excess of what I said to them verbally, with clarity and with emphasis. </para><para>Indeed, I did not consider I had to be suspicious or careful about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> He had come to me with a letter which stated he had established relations with several Victorian State Government authorities, including the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. I knew he had easy and close access to Victorian Ministers, including the Premier. He appeared to be a personal friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. On 7 March 1975 I had no reason to suspect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris could be capable of" any deception. Perhaps I do wear my heart too easily on my sleeve. Perhaps I am too willing to encourage those who want to break through the rigours of the establishment, but on 7 March 1975 I had no reason to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Harris would do anything that was inconsistent with my clearly expressed verbal desires and intentions. Perhaps I do wear my heart too easily on my sleeve. Perhaps if I do that I am not suitable to be a Minister of this nation. If that is the decision of the Government of the nation I accept it because I will not cease to wear my heart on my sleeve. </para><para>I ask honourable members to look specifically at the position on 4 June 1 975 when I said in this House that I had not offered anyone a commission or a brokerage fee of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent or any other amount. I had already seen what purported to be a photostat copy of a statutory declaration by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alexander</inline> Daniel Thomson of Warriewood in New South Wales which did not contain any copy of my signature but merely a typewritten name. I knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> was closely connected with the Liberal Party and must have been in touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> who had asked me the question or perhaps with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> who asked the question more accurately. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> had tried, I think unsuccessfully, to put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> in touch with me and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> had been a co-director of a company with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> and a shareholder of many shares in this company which showed a very substantial loss. I knew that had I made an offer or given a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> in the terms described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> or more accurately as I said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser, Mr Harris</inline> would use that letter. I knew its use would become well known in Europe and in Australia, especially to people like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson.</inline></para><para>I ask the House: Would I, in those circumstances, have denied that I had given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> that letter if, in fact, I had known that I had done so, knowing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> would have used such a letter to locate funds overseas or attempt to do so and knowing that it had already become known to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch?</inline> Would I have been stupid enough to deny it had I remembered or known that I had signed it? I have been severely punished for my association with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris.</inline> I was deprived of my position of Treasurer of this country for asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> to inquire in Europe whether funds were available for Australia on terms and conditions favourable to us on the payment of an appropriate commission. But I did not knowingly mislead this House. </para><para>I have been told also to account for the conduct of my son Phillip who is said to have placed himself in a position in which he could profit from his position on my staff. This is apparently because he agreed to take one share in a nonprofit organisation- Sunshine Migrant Services Pty Ltd. He provided me with a statement when I was asked by the Prime Minister to get the statement. It reads as follows: </para><quote>

My association with the private company, Sunshine Migrant Services Pty Ltd, was to see that the concept of leasing sub-division and low cost housing with a fully integrated community type development could be achieved. The company was not to be involved in profit making of any kind and there was no possibility of profit to me from association with it. The issue to me of one share was to allow me to sit on the board of the company to help ensure that the objectives of the company were achieved. </para><para>I was in no way associated with any suggestions that I should receive a share of commission on an overseas loan and I have in my possession an affidavit signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sear</inline> Cowls- the signatory of the tel exes which have been published- which can be made available and which indicates clearly that I was not involved in any way. I did not intend to accept, nor would I have accepted, any commission on any overseas loan. I have not received at any time any remuneration outside my government salary and I have never used my position to further my personal interest or to obtain any personal gain or reward. I have not, nor would I take part in activities which could make it possible for me to profit from my position on your staff. </para><para>I was not aware that my son Phillip held one share in Sunshine Migrant Services Pty Ltd. I was not aware that any tel exes had been sent from Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sear</inline> Cowls. I have to be responsible for the actions of a member of my staff but when I was asked for an explanation I was not aware of those activities. If I was satisfied that Phillip Cairns or anyone else had tried to profit or put himself in a position of profiting from a position on my staff he would have been dismissed immediately, no matter who he was. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and gentlemen, whatever I might think of this matter I was not going to dismiss Phillip Cairns last week in an attempt to save myself. </para><para>I would like to return to the more important matter that I might have misled this House and the circumstances associated with it. I ask the House, the Government and the nation: As Treasurer of this nation was I or was I not able and qualified to give 2 letters to a man apparently of the best standing, but enterprising and active, to inquire about overseas loans and to report back to me? That man has written above his own signature as late as 2 June, and has widely stated in the media, that he never had any right or authority in excess of that or ever intended to assert or use it. I ask the House: Was it not a reasonable exercise of my power as Treasurer to give letters to a private individual asking him to try to find available funds for the nation, and that if he were successful appropriate commissions could be paid? Even if this did establish a legal relationship, is the Treasurer of the nation not entitled to do that? No one has shown me any law which says that is not so. </para><para>In the case of my own Government, was the Treasurer not entitled to do that when the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers had turned to private individuals in December 1974? Was it wrong for me not to involve Treasury officials in a decision with a private individual when the Prime Minister, other senior Ministers and I had decided to choose an alternative to the Treasury in December 1974? Frankly, I did not have confidence that conventional officials would treat seriously anything that private individuals could do in the search for overseas funds. </para><para>Is this not an important matter? Is it not important to explore the new world of available capital? Was it not important in the interests of the Australian nation, as I stated to this House on several occasions in explanation and justification of what the Minister for Minerals and Energy had done, to realise that as much as $60,000m of liquid funds has been diverted from conventional financiers in New York and in Western Europe to the Middle East? Was it not important to realise that the conventional financiers in New </para><para class="block">York and Western Europe would seek to regain control of those liquid funds and prevent countries like Australia from gaining direct access to them in the Middle East? Was it not important to realise that conventional officials working with these New York and Western European financiers are not ideally equipped to break through? Were we not justified in trying to break through even by asking unconventional private individuals to make inquiries and to report back to us. What was all the fuss about? </para><para>I do not know the truth, but I was assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy</inline> that their efforts were successful, that they had been successful in finding funds of over $ 1,500m available on favourable terms and conditions for Australia. But this matter has now become paralysed. I was successful in receiving an initial offer from the Saudi Arabia monetary authority of $250m under more favourable conditions as I corresponded with that authority. This prime opportunity to establish relations with a country with liquid reserves greater than the United States of America has too become paralysed by the Australian media and by the way in which many in turn have been paralysed by the media. Australia has been deprived of these funds by Press hysteria and by the acceptance of it by' men who should know better. </para><para>The reaction to my 2 letters to the apparently much respected and influential <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> is not the end of it. I have heard little from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline> but I have heard much in writing from some who were very closely associated with him in these activities. I have tabled a statutory declaration made by a man, at considerable risk to himself, who says that he is a supporter of the Liberal Party and an opponent of the Labor Party but that he is convinced that a great injustice has been done. </para><para>The removal of me from the position of Treasurer of this Government was not the end of it. I have been removed from the position of Minister for Environment for a reply to the Prime Minister, which he considered unsatisfactory, on whether I had misled the House in my answer to questions on 4 July. I ask this House: Does it consider that I should pay any further penalty? I ask the House to consider a little my position. How many Ministers or members are subject to the pressures which have been applied to me? How many others are in a position like mine, in which the editor of a responsible newspaper like the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> admitted to me that his paper paid £8,000 for documents which were used against me without reference to me in any way but one which would have damaged me still further? </para><para>Does any Minister or member of this House have a member of his staff who has been offered, as Miss Glenda Bowden has been offered by the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> a sum increasing from $3,000 to $15,000 as the bid went up to write articles about the personal details of my office and of my life? Does anyone have a member of his staff who would refuse such an offer as Miss Bowden has refused this offer? I wonder how well some of the Ministers and members of this House would look if they were subject to that kind of scrutiny. I do know that members of my staff have been offered money even to provide telephone numbers and other information, which they have refused. I know that countless details appear distorted unfairly in the Press all over Australia about me and about members of my staff. I have heard that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent by the Press in Australia and in many overseas countries with a view to damaging me and the Australian Government. What have they discovered as a result of this intense scrutiny, this enormous expense, this vast spread of publicity? That I have employed some attractive women- women, more unfairly misrepresented about this nation than any other people in it, who have served me with a loyalty and dedication that I have not experienced up to now, and I do not intend to be intimidated about any one of them. They have discovered that I have employed my son, and it is said that I have become inaccessible. I wonder if any Minister in this House can claim to have been seen by more people than I have over the last 6 months or can claim to have had his heart more on his sleeve than I have had. I also have explored unconventional areas of international finance. All this criticism has been made by people, most of whom are delighted at any of my failures. </para><para class="block">I think it is time that this Parliament looked seriously at these activities and these pressures and decide whether there is to be any limit to the power of the Press to destroy or to damage prime ministers, deputy prime ministers or members of the national Parliament by these methods and by the use of the power of money. I think the average citizen also should take note of the power of the media and of the power of money. If the media can do what it has done, or has caused to be done, to me, what can it do to the individual citizen? What can it do to the people? </para><para>I take it that I have one main point on which to satisfy this House now. The Prime Minister said that my explanation of the answer I gave to this </para><para class="block">House on 4 June was unsatisfactory, and I take it that that is the main reason why I am no longer a member of this Government. My reply may have been unsatisfactory in the sense that I should have been more careful in some letter which I may or may not have signed; perhaps I should not have worn my heart so easily on my sleeve. If that is the reason for the unsatisfactory nature of the reply, I accept it. But the charge, as I understand it, is that I misled the House. All I can say is that I have a clear and positive recollection of rejecting a proposal for a <inline font-style="italic">2y2</inline> per cent brokerage fee put to me by a man who at that time I trusted. I have no recollection of ever offering to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> or anyone else a commission or brokerage fee of 2VS per cent or any other amount. When I answered the question about that in this House I answered according to what I believe to be true. I answered it in clear and sincere belief that what I said is true and I rest my defence upon that belief. It is up to the House and the people of Australia to judge. I leave it to you. </para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly)-</inline> by leave- agreed to: </para><quote>

            </talker>
            <para>- We have listened with a great deal of interest to the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> defending himself against a charge which has been made against him by his Leader, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> I think all of us in this House would agree that the honourable member for Lalor is a man of great resilience, of great courage and, indeed, of considerable persuasion. He makes a case today on the basis that if he did mislead this Parliament he did so unwittingly and that he has no recollection of signing a certain letter. Having been a Minister and knowing the intensity of work that a Minister has to undertake, I am prepared to give goodwill to such an argument; I know that sometimes one is not aware or one forgets what one might have signed, if one has an enormous volume of work. But it is a matter for members of this House to make up their own minds whether the argument presented is to be believed. Certainly it is very much a matter for the honourable member's own Party to determine. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, I am disappointed that the honourable member has levelled such a heavy attack on the media. Certainly the media deserve to be attacked at times. They are deserving of the heaviest condemnation if what the honourable member said about bribes being offered to his staff is true. But we would not have got the amount of information that we have now in regard to the whole sordid affair of overseas money raising if it had not been for the activities of the Press in trying to prize information out of a Government which remains secretive about the whole operation. One of the great virtues of a free democracy is that the Press has the right to try to obtain information and to print that information. The Press can build a man up; but provided he has a sound case and strength of character the Press cannot destroy him. If there is some substance to the arguments which the Press has brought forward and which have produced a situation of crisis, as there is today within the Labor Party and the Government as a result of the Government trying to conceal or hide the facts from the Australian people, this Government and individuals in it are deserving of whatever criticism they get from the Press. </para>
          <para>Today we listened to the Prime Minister. With his usual rhetoric he tried to smooth over the whole operation as if there were no irregularities or illegality in his Government's overseas loan raising. He simplified the Government's actions almost to the point of creating the impression that there was virtue in what the Government was doing by hopping on the old emotional bandwagon with phrases such as 'buying back the farm' and the old socialist doctrinaire philosophy of buying out private enterprise by putting ourselves in hock to some foreign lenders whom we do not know. We do not know whether the money was to come from foreign governments, or whether it was illegal Arab money or even Mafia money. The Prime Minister tried to put forward a case that everything the Government has done has been above board, honourable and proper. </para>
          <para>I think that the Prime Minister condemned himself by the speech he made today. If the Prime Minister condemns the former Treasurer for seeking money by sacking him from the position of Treasurer and then by disposing of him completely from the Ministry, I believe that he and the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> are deserving of even greater censure. I say this because they conspired to corrupt the Constitution. They conspired to get around the proper methods of raising money overseas. They obtained Executive Council approval to go overseas and raise $2,000m on the assumption that the money was to be used for temporary purposes, that it was to be used to enable Australia to meet its balance of payments commitments, that it was to be used in respect of the energy crisis in our country and that it was to be used in regard to unemployment But today we are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy that this money is to be used for long term investment in the electrification of railways, in port facilities, in the development of gas, in the development of coal and in the development of the hydrogenation of coal. This is the first time that we have heard the facts. The memorandum with the Executive Council minute was a fabrication. The Government misled the Governor-General and it has not told the Aus.tralian people the truth. </para>
          <para>This matter has been going on for 6 to 7 months and we have had to squeeze every drop of information out of the Government to know what has been going on. But what we do know is that the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> had grave reservations- indeed, I think strong objections about using unorthodox and questionable methods of raising money overseas. He wanted no part of funny money being raised by funny men for funny purposes in Australia and he is deserving of credit for that. It seems that because he was a man of integrity and standing and was prepared to take the advice of his Treasury officials, who have provided the normal and orthodox channels for raising loans overseas, he was discharged from his office and put in another position. Now we have another Minister being removed. Why? Because he has fallen out with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy. </para>
          <para>This whole matter really has made a mockery of our nation. The overseas loan fiasco has shown the world something that Australians have known for a long time: The Whitlam Government is a fumbling and grossly incompetent government in the management of the nation's economic affairs. Its negligence and management incapacity which has caused so much damage is now visible to the outside world. The Prime Minister talked about our triple A rating a few weeks ago. I wonder what it is now? Nobody else is to blame other than the Prime Minister who was party to an Executive Council minute giving approval for the Minister for Minerals and Energy to go overseas and borrow money. The approval was not merely to examine the situation and see what the prospects were, as the previous Treasurer tried to do. With the issue of a promissory note, the Minister for Minerals and Energy could go overseas and borrow $2,000m at a proposed interest rate of 8.35 per cent compounded over a period of 20 years. Do honourable members know what that would mean to future generations in this country who would have to pay back the loan? An amount of $ 18,000m would have to be paid back by future generations. For what purpose? To satisfy the doctrinaire philosophies of this socialist sitting opposite me, the Minister for Minerals and Energy, who wants to get his hands on mineral resources and mining activities in this country. </para>
          <para>The sum of $ 18,000m is the compounded figure for a loan of $4,000m for a period of 20 years at an interest rate of 8.35 per cent- an enormous amount of money. This loan was to be raised just so that the Government could own and run these enterprises which it believes it can run better than private enterprise. Because of its hatred of private enterprise it wants to get into these areas. We set up the Australian Industry Development Corporation which allowed Government involvement in enterprises if they could be shown to be bona fide, worthwhile projects and we passed legislation and allowed this Government to go overseas and borrow up to $250m, as the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> said today. But that was not going to satisfy the Minister for Minerals and Energy. No. He wanted to get his hands on much greater sums of money. </para>
          <para>It is quite clear now why we have had no major mining development projects since this Government has been in office. It is because the Minister for Minerals and Energy has been stymieing all developments until he can get his own hands on them. What he has been waiting for is to get the finance to make them nationalised, socialised projects. Imagine this. He claims that Australia has great mineral and energy resources, but in 2Vi years not one major project for their development has been undertaken. There are enormous uranium deposits and great new coalfields in Queensland to be opened up and offshore gas fields in north-western Australia to be developed, yet nothing has happened. The companies in these areas have had frustration after frustration, not knowing what the policies of the Government are. Other countries which have wanted to lock in with these mineral developments have not been able to get a positive answer. There is no clarity as to what the Government's decisions are. It is becoming clear now that the Minister for Minerals and Energy is the man responsible because he has wanted to nationalise the industry, and he has managed to link in the Prime Minister with his socialist philosophies. </para>
          <para>Can we afford a situation in which a government acts so secretly and furtively? What else is it doing that we do not know about? It has taken us 6 months to get as much information as we have, although even today we have not been able to get the full facts surrounding the matter of overseas loan negotiations. How much illegality is there? How much corruption is there? When somebody can get a 216 per cent commission, is there not ground for wondering where the money which is raised might finish up? Enormous sums of money are involved. Most other countries which have a similar standard of living to us- the United States of America, England and the European countries- have obtained enormous Arab loans over the past 12 months, but the negotiation has been on a government to government basis with government officials doing the work. Why call in some unknown person? If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is such an outstanding, worthy character as we have been told today, where is he now? Why does he not stand up, front the world and tell us what is going on? Of course, we do not know where he is. </para>
          <para>What we need is a full inquiry into this whole matter. It needs to be more than just an inquiry; it needs to be a royal commission so that the full facts can be obtained to see how deeply this matter goes. We need to know the real purposes for which this Government needed the money. We need to know the legal aspects. Was the Governor-General deceived? Was the Loan Council by-passed? Were the State premiers misled in this matter? Why were unknown intermediaries called into action to raise this money? What would be the impact on the economy of bringing $2,000m into Australia? Today the Prime Minister told a new story. He said that the Government was going to raise this money before it carried out a feasibility study of projects because it would be wrong to do the feasibility study first and then go looking for the money. In other words we start off with the cart and then look for the horse. When he does raise this money what is he going to do with it? He is going to reinvest it in New York so that it does not have any effect on our economy at the moment because of the inflationary pressures. It is just one cover-up after another- a new story every day. All that we can get out of the Government is a new story trying to cover up more and more exposures that come forward. One thing that is certain is that Australia's reputation has been damaged and will remain damaged both within this country and overseas until there is a full inquiry and all the facts are known. When the most senior people in this country are involved there is only one way to have such an inquiry, and that is through a royal commission looking into the matter. </para>
          <para>We were told today by the Prime Minister that he obtained from the Crown Law office of this country legal advice concerning the raising of this money and the minute that went before the Executive Council. I would like to see the advice that was given to the Prime Minister on this matter. No such paper was tabled here today. We know the advice of the Treasury officials, the experts in this matter. They were strongly opposed to the Government's moves. I fail to believe that the Attorney-General's office also did not have very grave reservations. It knows that it is a breach of our Constitution to be raising money overseas other than for defence purposes or temporary purposes. No one can say that the $2,000m that was for all the purposes that were mentioned here today was for temporary purposes. It is a fabrication. It is dishonest. I hope that the Governor-General, who may or may not have been present, will in future examine closely any other proposals that come forward and will make sure that the legal advice is there for him to examine. The Ministers knew that this procedure was illegal. Nobody can tell me that 2 Q.Cs., the former Attorney-General and the Prime Minister, did not know that it was a breach of the Constitution to go forward and seek money, on a misleading minute of the Executive Council. </para>
          <para>Today we have heard a very emotional speech by the honourable member for Lalor when presenting his case. If he is guilty the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy are doubly guilty. Both these men have misled Australia by conspiring to get around the Constitution. That is the most serious breach that has occurred. The former Treasurer misled this House. That was a serious breach. Today he explained his situation. There has been no explanation why Ministers deceived the Governor-General on the raising of this money. It was not for temporary purposes. The minute was to allow the Minister for Minerals and Energy to raise money overseas. A precedent was established in Australia by which people other than the Treasurer could go overseas and rake up whatever people they liked, who were involved in overseas finance, to raise money and to offer a commission of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent. It was an abnormal commission in the light of the amount of money involved, even in today's circumstances. The commission on a loan overseas today in which the Treasury is involved is generally about half to one per cent. The commission on a loan of this nature should have been less than half of one per cent. Yet we are told that up to 2Vi per cent would be involved. </para>
          <para>One thing comes clearly out of this: Some honourable members of the Government, especially the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, tried to do the right thing previously. He defied his Prime Minister and was downgraded, but he can still hold his head high in this Parliament. I say to you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker</inline> and to the Australian people that this matter cannot be shut up as the Prime Minister would like it to be shut up. It cannot be shut up until there is a full, open and independent inquiry into all the matters. The many questions that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has brought forward today will have to be answered. Until they are, the media and the whole of Australia have the right to continue to question this dishevelled, incompetent and what appears to be completely dishonest Government which is in charge of this nation and which does not deserve to remain in office any longer. </para>

            <para>- If this House is to make any contribution to an intelligible understanding of these loan matters we need to sort out and deal separately with several issues. So far the tendency in public reporting to lump together unrelated issues and the talent of the Opposition to muddy the quality of some personal characters have surely left the Australian public confused and lost. For instance, the greatest amount of reporting and the largest amount of silver pieces have surely gone to the so-called Sear Cowls communications. By his own lips, that gentleman is apparently a faker.  His  fiction apparently has borne a high return. These and other matters which had been connected with the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> have been well gone over by the Press. There has been a dramatic change in the Ministry as a result The penalty was high- quite high. The result is that there is now agreement that the events which led to the ministerial changes have been properly responded to, but I do not believe that the House can easily press on to other issues without fairly acknowledging the valuable and honourable role of the honourable member for Lalor to this institution over many years and his honourable and unyielding commitment to the issues of personal rights, civil liberties and the freedoms of a democratic society. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But for the time being that is behind us. The main issue today centres on the loan proposals with which the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> has been Associated. One of the main criticisms has been that the Minister's operations have not been orthodox; that he has sought out unconventional ways of dealing with those matters. But the former Treasurer is on public record as freely acknowledging this point on 3 June 1975, in the Parliament. He then said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As I have explained to this House several times, since 1973 and the increase in the price of oil, an amount of some $60,000m has changed direction- it has come under the control of different people, and a large amount of that money was being invested for wealthy individuals in various financial circles in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. </para>
            <para>I think that this Government, as did every other government, had a responsibility to ascertain the circumstances which existed with respect to the availability of those funds. I believe that our Government and other governments that took similar steps were justified in exploring the new areas for available funds and available investment. I think that was a perfectly reasonable step to take, and I believe, as I explained when I was first asked a question on this matter in Australia, that had our Government not taken the steps to explore the new circumstances we should have been vulnerable to criticism for failing to do so. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I apologise for a somewhat lengthy quote but I think it necessary so that these events can be seen in less murky light than would be the wish of some people criticising this precise point. However the fact that something was unorthodox does not in itself mean that it was wrong. Let us put the reaction to something unconventional to one side and look at the key points in the loans matters with which the Minister for Minerals and Energy has been associated. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the general arguments of the Minister for Minerals and Energy which he claims justify the action he pursued- the amounts. It is said they were too large- that they would distort and destabilise the economy if either amount had been negotiated. That would be perfectly true if the loan money had come directly to Australia and had been fed into the economy. But both the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the Minister for Minerals and Energy have made it clear that this was not their intention. They have said the borrowings would have first been invested overseas in sound governments' bonds. They have made it clear that the funds would then be called on progressively to cover the cost of bringing into the country goods and services as required for the development of our nation. </para>
          <para>It is true, of course, that there is always a cost involved in investing; that is, the cost of borrowing. For example, no businessman would want to borrow money from a bank at 10 per cent and invest it at, say, only 8 per cent. But everybody understands that principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> has advised me that the interest rate on the proposed $4 billion loan was to be an all up cost of 7.95 per cent. During December, 1974, 6-month </para>
          <para class="block">Eurodollar deposits were returning from 9.9 per cent to 10.4 per cent, a clear margin over the costs of borrowing proposed by the Minister for Minerals and Energy. </para>
          <para>Some critics have even hinted that there is something peculiar about the idea of borrowing from the Middle East; it is not conventional enough for their liking. But Australia has traditionally been an importer of overseas capital, and now an entirely new source of overseas borrowings is available: The petro-dollar market. The oil producing countries' overall external surpluses in 1974 were estimated at about US$55 billion-of the order of US$1 billion a week. These investable funds were largely directed towards the United States, Euro-currency markets, and the United Kingdom, but a very significant proportion- in excess of 20 per cent was available to other borrowers, including the Australian Government if we were interested. </para>
          <para>Not only have leading international borrowers such as the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Italy and Denmark arranged large government to government loans on a bilateral basis, amounting to $6.3 billion in the second half of 1974 alone; an increasing number of other borrowers both corporate and governmental have tapped Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sources of funds. The trend has continued in 1975. In the first five months of this year some 14 bond issues were arranged by Arab financial institutions. Borrowers have included a number of leading European banks, the Asian Development Bank as well as leading European and Japanese corporations. Does the Opposition want to suggest that there is anything wrong in the Australian Government placing itself on a par with these international institutions? </para>

              <para>- There has also been comment on Commission costs. The important consideration from a borrower's viewpoint is the all-up cost of the loan. The all-up cost covers all costs. The anticipation of the Minister for Minerals and Energy of an all-up cost of 7.95 per cent was generally cheap by the then prevailing market standards. The all-up cost of a Swiss borrowing in December 1974 to the Australian Government was 10.06 per cent. The recent June borrowing from the United States was at 8.74 per cent for the 5-year bonds and 8.98 per cent for the 8-year bonds. Both were higher than the Minister's borrowing proposal. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Concern has been expressed about a compound interest borrowing with accumulated deferred payments of principal and interest. The deferred payment of interest and of interest on interest, can be presented as a loan for the present to be paid later. If the deferred interest allows the equivalent amount of finance to be invested and to earn more than the interest cost, then there is a net gain and our community is better off. Another matter that has caused comment is the level of accumulated repayment. Most of us face the experience of a compound interest loan in our housing loans and yet we do not see ourselves as wicked or wrong for proceeding in this way. </para>
          <para>There is another aspect to the proposal of the Minister for Minerals and Energy which was brought out in the papers he tabled today. The paper I refer to is a memorandum to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt from J. H. Broinowski headed 'Proposed US Borrowing Costs'. I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Broinowski</inline> is an executive of Darling and Co., a respected merchant banking firm concerned with corporate finance. I draw the attention of the House to the last paragraph of that memorandum. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am assured that there is ample scope for the full utilisation of the initial funds ($A3,036m) in productive enterprise. Further I understand that the management of the funds will enable profitable interest and sinking fund charges to be recovered so that in fact this recovered interest can be 'recycled ' for further profitable use. It follows that the accumulating interest has the effect of making new funds available each year or, put another way, the loan of $A3,036m could be expressed as a loan of $A13,385m at 7.95 per cent per annum drawn down as to $A3,036m forthwith and the balance over 20 years at the end of which the total is repayable in full. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again this is a fairly lengthy quote but it is necessary in the circumstances. I should imagine that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Broinowski</inline> with the experience he has and the resources he is able to call upon, would be providing accurate figuring. I therefore remind the House of the point that he makes on a loan of a little over $3,000m with an effective interest rate of 7.95 per cent per annum over 20 years with accumulated interest payments and capital to be paid at the end of 20 years. He suggests that this was the same effect as a loan of $ 13,385m at 7.95 per cent per annum drawn down. </para>
          <para>Some have said that the repayments of the loan would be difficult. Let me remind honourable members of the increased export earnings, the greater scale of production and productivity that the Minister has described he saw flowing from his investment plans. Over the 20-year period he saw the nation, after paying its debts, achieving considerably greater net economic advance as a result of the development momentum coming from the investment provided progressively from the borrowings. I challenge the Opposition to question the relevance of these points to the thinking of the Minister for Minerals and Energy when the documents he has tabled today bear a direct relationship to these points. I refer again to the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Broinowski</inline> which I quoted a few seconds ago, especially in terms of sinking fund charges to be recovered. </para>
          <para>The role of the Loan Council in these borrowings has also been raised. Last May, in the Parliament, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> made it clear that the Loan Council was not to be bypassed. More recently, at the Loan Council meeting which I chaired in my capacity as Treasurer, I conveyed an assurance to the Premiers from the Prime Minister, in relation to these loans matters now before the House, that it was never the intention of the Government to disregard the commitments and obligations under the Financial Agreement and the Loan Council. I indicated on behalf of the Prime Minister that it was the Government's intention that any action would have been consistent with the requirements arising in the Loan Council and under the Financial Agreement. </para>
          <para>Some Opposition spokesmen have been unkind enough to suggest that the actions of the Minister for Minerals and Energy and some other Ministers in this general field of foreign borrowings, had adversely affected our international credit rating. This is not borne out by the facts. Australia obtained a triple A rating Moody's of New York in October last year and a further triple A rating from Standard and Poors of New York announced in June this year. That means that under this Government we achieved recognition which had not previously applied. These are the 2 principal credit rating agencies in New York. Their ratings are keenly influential on international investors. Triple A ratings are not easily come by. Thus, having achieved that recognition from Moody's in October last year we had it confirmed by Standard and Poors in June this year after the country and- if the Opposition wants to put it this way- the world had been exposed to the public and not helpful comments of spokesmen from the Opposition on the very matters which we are currently debating. In the face of the tempo and the quality of the Opposition's public comments on these matters in that period, I suggest it is evidence of the continued strength and resilience of the Australian economy and of our credit worthiness that we were nonetheless able to retain our triple A rating. </para>
          <para>As I mentioned earlier, it is acknowledged that the actions of the Minister for Minerals and Energy and of other Ministers in these matters were not orthodox in the sense that they did not turn to the old established finance houses of the rich industrial countries. But those very institutions are prepared to search out the new sources of funds, so why is it wrong for Australia to do so? It was openly stated by the former Treasurer and it is on public record that such actions were taken because of the unorthodox nature, the unconventional rearrangement which occurred in the international financial scene following the massive diversion of international liquidity into petrodollars. It is my belief that a great deal of the surprise which is apparent in the community on these matters springs from the unorthodox, the unconventional. I remind the House that France, England, Japan, Italy and Denmark have already trodden that so-called unorthodox, unconventional path. </para>
          <para>I turn to the issues and propositions which, as I have indicated, were influencing the Minister for Minerals and Energy and other Ministers. I suggest that if there is a debate on these matters it is debate on the policy of Ministers, not on their honesty and not on whether there has been any wickedness. If members of the Opposition have any evidence of any of these serious wrongs then let them put it forward now. Such wrongs ought to be revealed in the Parliament. Where is the evidence to support the push for a judicial inquiry? Of course, there is no room for that sort of behaviour in pubic office. I would in no way want to be tainted, even by the most distant association, with people who have been responsible for that sort of impropriety. On the other hand, I do not believe anyone will accept the simple principle that if someone says you are guilty, then you are guilty. That is not justice and it is not the way of this Parliament. If the real question before us today is a matter of policy and that is what I believe this debate is all about-then I cannot see how setting up an open judicial inquiry will resolve the matter. That assessment has to be made in the political context, not within the judicial system. </para>

          <para class="block">This debate raises a question which man has constantly had to face. It is simply this: Do the ends justify the means? It is not about goals in themselves but the means adopted to achieve them. It is not about our need for energy and the ownership of our resources but whether that need has been pursued with honesty and integrity. It is not about the Government's desire to do its best for our people. In a sense it is not about unorthodox loan raisings. It is about whether the Government has acted in a way which commands respect and support at home and abroad. It is about honesty and integrity in Government. Nor is it a contest between the Press and the Government or even between the Opposition and the Government. It is a plain question whether our people, those who have supported this Government and those who have not, can go on believing that the men who lead it- particularly its Prime Minister- are men of integrity. That question hangs there. The Opposition did not raise it. The Government raised it. By its own actions the Government raised it. For its own sake and for the sake of our country the Government dare not fail to answer it. </para>
          <para>It is my firm belief, notwithstanding what we have heard today, that the questions which arise can be answered only by a full, open judicial inquiry. The Government can shout, it can rave and protest its honesty, but out of its own mouth it has today established a prima facie case against itself of deceitful conduct. It was inevitable that this debate would centre around the Executive Council decision of 13 December last. Indeed, whenever unfortunate events occur an explanation of the misfortune is likely to be found in the circumstances that set them off. The consideration of the tragic dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> therefore leads unavoidably to an analysis of the events of December. On the other hand, if a basic supervening event has involved deceit, fabrication and deviousness, that same deceit, fabrication and deviousness are likely to be found in the events which flow from it. </para>
          <para>O what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive! </para>
          <para class="block">Deceit, fabrication and falsity have all appeared in the events which flowed from the decision to seek overseas funds in this illegal and unconstitutional manner. The fact is that the seed bed for whatever fabrication and deceit has occurred who knows if all has yet been revealed- was laid and watered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and his gaggle of Ministers when they met on 13 December 1974. Since that time injustice and deviousness have also appeared. </para>
          <para>I refer particularly to the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> as Treasurer early in June. I could never understand why he should have been dismissed as Treasurer. He had authority to raise funds totalling $250m. He only asked somebody to make inquiries for him, to put together a proposition. I cannot believe that these events alone justified the Prime Minister's actions.  His  real reasons for dismissing him must have been otherwise. I believe that in this respect the Prime Minister was less than frank. He was devious. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> says that he was destroyed by the Press. The fact is that he was destroyed by his own Prime Minister, not by the Press. He knows it and so does every honourable member opposite know it. I hope that they will stand up for decency next Monday when the matter comes before their Caucus. </para>
          <para>The main issue here is the events of 13 December 1974 and those leading up to them. In considering these matters it is important to bear in mind these in contra vert i b le matters: The Government could not in the circumstances borrow funds without the consent of the Loan Council unless its borrowing fell within certain exceptions. The only relevant exception was that the funds were required for temporary purposes. The reason for inserting in the Executive Council minute that the borrowing was for temporary purposes could surely only have been to avoid the necessity of going to the Loan Council. It is difficult to give any credence whatsoever to any suggestion that it was ever intended to seek the approval of the Loan Council. I am afraid that I cannot accept what the Prime Minister has said today about going to the Loan council for approval. </para>
          <para>The draft acceptance document that has been produced gives the lie to it. The draft acceptance document has nothing in it about Loan Council approval. It has a lot in it about what the Swiss people were going to do and whether there were any conditions that they would lay down about the loan, but not a word about the Loan Council. The proposal was that that would be the draft acceptance and that a promissory note would be signed. There is no doubt about it. I believe that it is deceitful to come before this Parliament and try to tell us and the Australian people that the Government intended to get Loan Council approval. The Government intended no such thing. Further the Financial Agreement is the supreme document of the Constitution. In a sense it stands above the Constitution. I do not want to refer to the terms of it. They have already been referred to. But the fact is that the Financial Agreement in its own way does stand above the constitution. It is the supreme document in this land and every Minister opposite knows it, and none better than the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>The procedures for obtaining funds overseas were well known and practised. Officers of the Treasury and the Attorney-General's Department are well versed in these procedures. They are known to the Ministers involved and borrowing has traditionally been the function of the Treasury. Never before has anybody heard of a department such as Minerals and Energy or the former Department of National Development borrowing funds of $4,000m or anything like that amount. Indeed I have not heard of any other department doing it. This was a complete and utter departure. </para>
          <para>The phrase 'for temporary purposes' could not, on any view, include borrowings totalling $4 billion for 20 years to be used for energy purposes. In the context of the agreement, 'temporary' must mean 'to meet a passing need '. In practice it may have been interpreted by the parties as being 'for a period under 12 months'. In my opinion no honest lawyer could express the view that this borrowing was for temporary purposes. </para>
          <para>The documents that have been produced today and the speeches have made all this abundantly clear. The moneys in question were to be lodged in a bank, apparently overseas, until they were needed. Then they were to be brought back into this Commonwealth and used for long term purposes. Temporary purposes; what nonsense! </para>
          <para>The then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> said in a speech which was circulated as a Press release: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia should, I suggest, carefully preserve its reputation as a steady arid  cautious  borrower on official account. There is no need and ho case for Australia joining any mad rush to borrow petro-dollars abroad at any price. </para>

          <para class="block">The prudent .Minister was there, but his advice was rejected. He was dismissed 2 days before this unfortunate event. Those are the vital matters to bear in mind. There are others which appear from, documents and circumstances which are equally vital to an understanding of the minute of 13 December. Khemlani had been in direct contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt from 12 November at the latest.  His  task was to confirm the availability of funds. It was not different in substance from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris's</inline> task. I thoroughly agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> said. Khemlani must have been on some arrangement for commission or other remuneration. I wonder today what it was. It is said in this draft acceptance that the great amount of $ 100m was to be deducted at the source, instead of being appropriated out of Consolidated Revenue. That was another unlawful act, another act unheard of. If a man was to be paid commission for performing services for the Commonwealth it should have come out of Consolidated Revenue. But this was not the case. It was to come out at the source. The Government asked for instances of unlawful and illegal acts. That is another unlawful act. That money should have come out of Consolidated Revenue. </para>
          <para>This Government has shown a preparedness in this event to trample over the Constitution. The main reason why we need national disaster insurance in this country is that we have 2 unguided missiles, a combination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt. They are causing disaster to this country, and the sooner honourable members opposite get rid of them the better they will be and the better we will be. There is no suggestion that officials from the Treasury and the Attorney-General's Department became involved in this matter until late in the time scale. It also seems clear that any documents produced by Khemlani were not signed. There is one other matter. The Government's momentous financial problems were upon it. Honourable members remember the events of November. They will remember how close the Government got to the brink and how worried Government supporters were. They knew that they could not finance their energy programs out of the consolidated revenue of this country. They were in a position in which they had to get funds from overseas in order to carry out the program. I honestly believe that is the reason this position came about. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at this document J itself, this farrago of fact and falsity. Of course, honourable members remember a royal commission when there was a document J. This document states that the Minister for Minerals and Energy is authorised to borrow for temporary purposes. I have already dealt with that. What utter and complete nonsense it is to say 'for temporary purposed'. How can it be said that the loan is. for temporary purposes. Then we have the situation that for some special reason a promissory note is mentioned. Why not a guarantee? The promissory note is referred to because it was about to be signed and because the Minister for Minerals and Energy had no intention of this matter going to the Loan Council. This document was in the course of preparation. The Loan Council, be damned! There was no intention ever to take the matter before the Loan Council and it is a complete and utter he - </para>

              <para>-I am looking on the bright side and the bright side is not very far off, I can assure the honourable member. What do we find when we look at this explanatory memorandum? There is nothing about moneys being deposited overseas. There is nothing about the sole purpose of the loan being for matters related to energy. What do we find? We find ten or 1 5 lines of falsity; that is what we find. We find it is stated that the loan is for temporary purposes and the exigencies arising out of the current world situation, the international energy crisis, to strengthen Australia's external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia in regard to the supply of minerals and energy, and to deal with current and immediate foreseeable unemployment in Australia. This is a series of propositions which have been hardly mentioned in the Parliament today. It is a series of propositions which reveal the falsity of the document 's contents. This document went before  His Excellency  the Governor-General. I will say more about that in a moment. </para>

          <para>Why was it that this Executive Council Minute approved a borrowing of $4,000m for temporary purposes when the borrowing was known to be and was intended to be a long-term borrowing for long-term purposes? How did the Governor-General come to approve a resolution for such temporary purposes when the borrowing was for indefinite purposes? What was the reaction of the Treasury? It is unlikely that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler would agree to this proposition. No wonder he did not want his name on this document. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> says he asked why the Treasury's name was not on the document. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler was not stupid enough to associate his Department with this document J, this farrago of fact and falsity.

              <para>- We now know who gave the legal advice that the loan in fact sought could be dressed up as a loan for temporary purposes. The oral advice of the then Attorney-General was given. Let us just read what was stated because it is very interesting. The former Attorney-General advised orally: </para>

            <para>In the exceptional circumstances I have outlined the borrowing could probably be regarded as a borrowing for temporary purposes within the meaning of the financial agreement. </para>

          <para class="block">I do not want to be discourteous to a Justice of the High Court, nor do I want to be discourteous to somebody I served under. But that is not the sort of advice that honest men would seek on an occasion like this with this extraordinary loan in their minds. It is not the sort of advice that honest men would seek if they were going off to the Governor-General to tell him that this was a loan for temporary purposes. I have given this matter the most careful thought but I cannot believe that any honest man could advise the Governor-General to approve of that minute if he knew that the borrowings were for 20 years and were to meet the long term energy purposes of the Government. I do not believe an honest man could do it. I believe it was an illegal and unconstitutional act. Who were those involved? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I have referred to the advice. By the way, where was the advice of the Solicitor-General? If this Government wanted the impartial advice of a lawyer, where was the advice of the Solicitor-General? That has not been produced. We know that on 13 December the law officers were gathered. We know that Messrs Byers and Harders were at a meeting in the Attorney-General's Department. They were good enough to prepare this document 'J', this farrago of fact and falsity. Why was the Solicitor-General not good enough to be asked for advice on this particular matter and where is his advice? If it were tabled here it might satisfy a lot of us. </para>
          <para>Of course it is unnecessary to say how important it is that the Governor-General should receive honest and proper advice for although he is no mere puppet he is and indeed should be bound to accept the advice of apparently honest Ministers. Although this minute bears the seeds of its own destruction I cannot imagine that His Excellency, a lawyer of great eminence, would have approved this minute unless he had received assurances and advice that satisfied him that this was indeed a borrowing for temporary purposes. To satisfy him that it was, was to deceive him. The minute was deceptive in other respects. That is exactly what has happened. The </para>
          <para class="block">Government cannot trample on Executive proprieties like this. If the Governor-General was deceived it is the grossest deception which any person in government could practice. If a deception takes place in Parliament we can deal with it. The Governor-General has no defence and the citizens of Australia have no defence except in this Parliament. That is why we are here today. </para>
          <para>I believe there is a prima facie case against the Government- a case that it has deceived the Governor-General, a case that it has produced a document which is false, a case that there is deception. It is a case the Government has to answer. It is a prima facie case. The question that is asked constantly is: Where is the charge? That is the charge. The action was unconstitutional, unlawful and based on deception. That is the charge. There is a prima facie case. It comes out of the mouths of members of the Government here today. It can be answered only before a royal commission or before the people. If the Government will not answer this case before a royal commission it should go to the people to see what they say about it. They will not be deceived. The people are not deceived. I go back to what I said in the beginning: This is a question of whether the ends justify the means. I believe that many people opposite are clearly of the view that the ends do not justify the means. I believe that in the minds of honourable members opposite tonight- and before tonight- this question has been asked and those honourable members will go on asking it. I hope they will bring pressure on their Prime Minister to make sure that the great Australian Labor Party is not demeaned in this way and is not sent out of office- bundled out of office- in an air of falsity. I believe that honourable members opposite will come to that conclusion next Monday when they meet. </para>

What about all the people who have been slandered and maligned across this country in the last fortnight or 3 weeks? What about all the corrupt allegations that have been made with convicted criminals ostensibly giving evidence that they were true.

              <para>-I find it very difficult to have an argument with the right honourable member for Lowe.  His  protagonist normally is the honourable member for Wentworth. I am trying to make this point: The trading banks are required by statute to hold a certain percentage of their funds in statutory reserve deposits. That percentage was increased by some 3 points. This action had the effect of freezing $260m in deposits. Again, for the benefit of the right honourable member for Lowe, with respect to the balance of payments situation, the figures show that because of the deficit situation another $ 1,300m was not available. These figures demonstrate the problem that existed. The graph published last week sets out the problem in September of last year. </para>

At that stage, the arrangements had been altered and there was no restriction any longer, for example, as to the 25 per cent deposit requirement. In that climate the question was asked whether the Government would be interested in capital borrowings. The Government was interested. Was the Department of Minerals and Energy interested in using these moneys? It was. Accordingly, a number of people offered money to the Government, asking whether the Government could use those funds. </para>
          <para>I respect what the honourable member for Wentworth has said, but I do not have to answer that specifically. What I want to talk about is the imputation that I have been involved in some loan raising activities. No accusation- not one has been made to this effect here tonight. But I notice that, in the 45 questions in the document tabled and incorporated in Hansard today by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> a question is asked as to what was my involvement. This demonstrates the integrity and honesty of the Opposition. If a charge is to be laid, the normal thing to do is to get the Commonwealth Police to investigate the matter. If anybody lays an information, the person against whom the charge is laid can answer that charge and he has the right to seek remedy by way of compensation for malicious prosecution if the information is proven incorrect. But we do not get that right here. We just get a smear in a newspaper by some  'Deputy Deputy'.  We have had this smear campaign as to what has been wrong with the actions of the Government, but nobody has looked at what actually happened. Regarding my alleged involvement in loan raisings, the Rural Bank in Sydney was the organisation which suggested that somebody had access to overseas funds. This was checked out by no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt. It was found that the person putting himself forward as an agent for people overseas was not in fact then agent; and they disowned him. They had no funds anyway. Accordingly, that was the end of the matter. </para>
          <para>But I see in the Press that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> has produced a copy of a letter that the Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> wrote to me, dated 16 September. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> said: 'This is really sinister'. The whole idea of writing this letter was to convince the so called principal overseas that the Government was interested, and Barclay's Bank was nominated as being the appropriate authority through which the funds could be borrowed. Before that, the Rural Bank was prepared to act, but then it felt that it might have a conflict of interest as it was the State Government bank in New South Wales. That is the true position with respect of that matter. It could have been checked with anybody. If the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> wanted a copy of the letter, I could have given it to him at any time. </para>
          <para>On that basis all these accusations are made by a person named Barb a rich. I did not want to have to say this, but Barb a rich is a convicted criminal. He is well known to the Opposition as, when it was in government, he made offers of loan money to it. He has been in a mental asylum. The  'Deputy Deputy'  of the Opposition knew that, because he was Minister assisting the Treasurer at the time when that offer was made. The allegation now made in Sydney is that $5,000 was paid by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> to Barb a rich to get a copy of a letter that he could have obtained from me for nothing. What about the criminal aspect of this mentality? What about honesty and integrity? When honourable members read the headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper referring to myself they should bear in mind that I have a family and children who go to school. I have to uphold the integrity of my family. But the newspaper headline comes out and states: 'Bowen involved in pipelines'. It went on to state: 'But when Treasury got wind of it, the loan was dropped'. What utter rubbish! The chronological table of events is as follows: The negotiations of the loan which Hewitt was checking out were continuing on until the end of October and it was not till then that Hewitt established that the person involved was not able to be the agent and did not have access to the funds. Treasury knew about this matter as far back as 28 September because one of the acquaintances of the person concerned also saw the Treasury at about that time. There is no suggestion at all that the loan was dropped because Treasury got wind of it. But what about the verbatim accusation? </para>

              <para>-It would be a good idea to sue the <inline font-style="italic">Australian.</inline> But let us talk about honesty. The letter is quoted verbatim except for one paragraph and that paragraph of the letter said, of course, that any loan would have to receive the approval of the Treasury. A letter is quoted verbatim in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> except for a paragraph that says that Treasury approval should be given. The newspaper then put in a sub-heading that of course the loan was dropped when the Treasury got wind of it. The letter could not have been published in detail with that paragraph included if the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> were still to run that top line, that by-line- that criminal libel, because that is what it is. </para>

Honourable members opposite talk about honesty and integrity. That man should be called before the Privileges Committee of this Parliament to explain why he quoted only part of a letter and left out another part. Did he have access to the Treasury? Is that the basis for thinking there would be no consultation? The minutes of Treasury show that there was consultation on 28 September. Why is it that Lynch left out the last paragraph of a letter and then the next day tried to recover the situation? Is Barb a rich telling the truth when he said that he got $5,000 from Lynch for the letter. The point we have to look at is what is happening to this Parliament in the sense of honesty and integrity. Just what is the position? </para>
          <para>Let me turn to another matter. As we all know- a number of members of Parliament have been named in this respect- honourable members get suggestions from constituents who have access to funds. A former Liberal Minister in the last Parliament saw me in about November. I will not mention his name because if I do so he will never be selected again. But if any honourable member wants to have a look at his name I have it written on a piece of paper. This former Minister introduced me to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Llewellyn. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn</inline> said that he had access to funds. I said: 'Go through the Treasury or Minerals and Energy'. He did that and the minutes show that he saw them on 16 December. </para>

              <para>-In fairness I do not want to name the Minister. The point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn</inline> came to see me again in March and said that he had raised money but the Treasury was objecting to it. He said that the money could be borrowed at a fair rate of interest. He said that he was conducting a legitimate operation and that he was a well respected financier. I believed that was the case. He asked me: 'Why is it that the Treasury rejected this loan?' I said that I had no idea and that he ought to discuss the matter with the Treasurer. In the course of that discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn,</inline> whom I do not know- he is the only person I have ever met in regard to the loan raisings; I have met nobody else- said: 'I am not impressed with the way that the Treasury is raising loans. In my view they are not as efficient as they should be in respect of interest and other charges that are paid'. He said: 'I particularly mention the recent renegotiation of an existing Deutschmark loan in September'. He went on to say: 'I think you will find that the cost is about $A12m'. I have had some mathematics done on this and I have found that that was a loan for 200 million Deutsche marks or $57. lm, issued at 99 per cent, with an interest rate of 10 per cent and flotation expenses of 3 per cent. When one works out what has to be paid for the renegotiation of the loan one- finds that Australia has incurred an exchange loss of $ 12m. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn</inline> is entitled to ask whether everything is reasonable when we renegotiate loans on that basis. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Naturally a number of loans has been arranged over the years, but the expenses have averaged at least 3 per cent. If we were in a climate where we could not get international money at  8  per cent or  8V4  per cent, was it efficient to negotiate this loan at 99 per cent as against 100 per cent at 10 per cent interest with flotation expenses of 3 per cent? Perhaps there is a bit of kick back in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn's</inline> case. Is it not about time we had a look at who receives these commissions. I would suggest with the greatest of respect that the Auditor-General should look at all the loans raised since 1 967 so that he covers a wide spectrum, ascertain who received the commissions and the percentages, and ask all of us, including the Treasury officials, whether we received any direct or indirect financial benefit. He could make a report to this Parliament as to those who wanted to co-operate or otherwise. It would clearly show to the Australian people what happened to this money, this question of efficiency and this question of what was the best way to renegotiate loans, and not leave us in this muck raking exercise with accusations being made that with the former Government it was always right and with the present Government it is always wrong. </para>
          <para>This climate is created mainly by people who have a political axe to grind. It is all very well to make accusations about people and say that they can recover the best way they can. Accusations have been made against my former partner in a firm of solicitors, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gerathy.</inline> I no longer have an interest in the firm; I have retired from legal practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gerathy</inline> has been accused all the time of being involved, for example, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bar.barich.</inline> He appeared for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> on 6 November in a bankruptcy matter. As honourable members know, if a person is in the legal profession he has to appear for people who need legal aid. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gerathy</inline> did that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> bobs up with some wild and mysterious statement that he has a letter which has been written and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gerathy</inline> is involved in the loans. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> was involved in suit No. 413 of 1974. The petitioner was St Vincent's Hospital. The other creditor was the  Deputy  Commissioner of Taxation. An amount of $20,599.75 was involved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gerathy</inline> appeared for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> but, as honourable members know, he cannot disclose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbarich</inline> 's peculiarities, his criminal record, his insanity. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted.)</inline> I just want to illustrate how people can be maligned. Gerathy is a Master of Law with honours. He has done no harm to anybody, but he is maligned because some misguided criminal wants to make all sorts of accusations. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew of Bar.barich when he was Minister assisting the </para>
          <para class="block">Treasurer yet motivated that man with money to make accusations that something was wrong and to involve Gerathy. Gerathy cannot answer any accusations that he must have known something about the matter being debated today. </para>
          <para>Is it not time we had a little bit of honesty and decency? How is it that honourable members opposite go along with this muck raking exercise? What about the people who have been named and who cannot answer for themselves tonight? They include <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt. </para>

              <para>-It is not a red herring. The point is that accusations were made. There were headlines about myself and a half quoted letter. I want to make this clear: It all comes from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> who has said in the presence of a number of Government supporters, particularly during May last: 'I want to make it clear that I have a more comprehensive knowledge of what is happening in the Treasury than the Treasurer'. It is not about time we had a look at the conduct of the Opposition? Is there some patronage on the way back? It cannot be proved, but I ask honourable members to look at the matter in the light of a declaration tabled tonight. It is a question of what can happen. In a declaration by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy,</inline> tabled tonight, members will see another outrageous accusation. It refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline> who is talking about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> and in the declaration <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> allegedly said, 'Cairns is finished. The Government is finished. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> said he will take up the loan when he becomes Treasurer'. That is in the declaration tabled tonight. He can make these accusations but at least he can get up here and answer them. But what about all the things that have been said about me, a former partner of mine and other people on the basis that there was something wrong? We still have to look at the fact that the 22 loans raised in the past 8 years covered a wide spectrum of interest rates, percentages and commissions. I have them listed here and I repeat that we ought to have this investigated, because there were commissions paid, there were expenses taken out. Money did change hands, if we want to put it on that basis. Let us find out who got it. I am prepared to submit - </para>

              <para>-No, we do not need an inquiry, we want an inquiry of an expert type, because a lot of the money could be overseas. Members opposite know the position and they do not want to have an inquiry. What have they got to hide? Why cannot they tell the Auditor-General what they have got? I will tell him. What are they worried about? We could have this in no time. Members opposite want to parade a series of people, who are perhaps maniacs, in the witness box and who can make all sorts of accusations. It might take 6 months to get through them and to work out that nothing has happened. These are specific loans; they are detailed and the commissions are known. Nobody knows at this stage who got the money because it is left to what is known as the normal method of raising loans. I would not have raised the matter but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Llewellyn</inline> did, and he did it in connection with the German loan. There is a bit of a kick in his case when in a roll-over of $5 7m it cost us $ 12m. Honourable members opposite say that is good business. I say it requires an explanation. From the point of view of everything that has been said, we now come to the final position: No charges have been made against anybody except the suggestion that the Executive Council meeting was illegal, and it was not said until the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> got up tonight at about 8.10 p.m. and said, 'That is all we are worried about.' If that is all they are worried about is it any wonder that the Press tonight, talking about this afternoon's debate, said it was a non-event, it was an anticlimax and they had heard all this before? The implication unfairly made by the honourable member for Wentworth is that the Governor-General did not know what he was doing. The honourable member has left himself in that position. He said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byers</inline> was not consulted. I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byers</inline> was there. Why is it that members opposite make these rotten outrageous accusations? If it is only a matter of a legal opinion I am certain any State can take appropriate action to see whether the validity of the decision can be challenged. </para>

              <para>-Of course, and is that not the way to do it? But members opposite are desperate. Unless they can undertake some muck-raking expedition here they are desperate for some elections in South Australia or somewhere else. This is all put on to create a political climate to suggest that something has happened, but when I ask members opposite to have a look at what actually happened they are all saying: 'We will do it that way.' The real proposition is to do it the way we suggest. Let us face up to the fact that people are maligned and do not have a chance to answer. It is no credit to any member of the Opposition to make a series of accusations. It does no good for anybody to come up and say to me tonight: 'We've nothing against you; everything is all right.' Why make the accusation if that is the position? Why is it not done as it is normally done? If there is a charge, have the Commonwealth Police investigate it and lay the charge. Give the person accused the right to sue the person who made the charge. That is the real issue. Do not raise it as a result of deals made with convicted criminals, people who it is known are criminals and to whom money is now being paid to manufacture evidence. Can members opposite imagine any criminal passing a document without money? </para>

That is how silly it is. Do members opposite think a criminal would part with a document he never had in the first place without getting some money? How naive are they? Do they not know that the Commonwealth Police already suggest that? The Commonwealth Police have interviewed this man and are aware of the fact that it is normal practice for a criminal to do what he thinks is best for himself. But in here we have an accomplice to a criminal libel as far as I am concerned, on the basis that the letter produced does not put in the appropriate paragraph and makes some ridiculous accusation that the Treasury got wind of it and therefore stopped it. Hewitt was the man who established the position. There were no credentials of the agent-and all credit is due to Hewitt, because that clearly showed - </para>

            <para>- I came into this House today, as I think most honourable members did, to hear the explanations of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> not only about the Cairns affair but of the Khemlani affair as well. We felt, then, that the Prime Minister would give us some explanations and state the common sense of the actions taken by the Labor Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But if honourable members care to analyse the statements that the Prime Minister has made, they will see that very nearly every statement is either a misunderstanding of administrative procedures, a misunderstanding of what is contained in the Constitution itself, or a failure to understand the proper and most effective means of raising loans overseas. </para>
          <para>I refer first to the first statement that the Prime Minister made, that is the one relating to open government. He said that there are 2 areas where secrecy is necessary. One was with regard to borrowings overseas by the Government and the other related to changes in the value of the currency. I agree with the second one, but I state that the first one is total nonsense and it ought to be known as nonsense by the Prime Minister because I have stated publicly in this House on at least 2 occasions what the true position is. The Prime Minister is not listening. What a pity, because he could get a lesson on economics and administration on this occasion. </para>
          <para>Today the Treasury was good enough to send to me a number of articles which I contributed to newspapers during the time that I was the Treasurer. They disclose, in a completely adequate way, that one can disclose everything that you want to with the exception of the range of interest rates within which negotiations will take place. These documents show that I made statements before the commencement of negotiations for loans, during the commencement of negotiations and when all the arrangements associated with the loans were completed. I have asked the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> if I may table these documents so that the Labor Party can be informed of the proper procedure. I now ask that that leave be approved officially. </para>

              <para>- I wish to refer to the second point which the Prime Minister made. I am glad I interjected during his remarks about interest rates because I hoped he would be tempted to make a statement which could then be proved inaccurate. I asked him whether he would mention those cases relating to loans in which I was involved as Treasurer. He mentioned 3 loans at the rate of about 8.5 per cent. Fortunately, and I hate to say this in the presence of one who claims he is the greatest Foreign Minister ever known, nor do I want to say much about my ability as a Treasurer, but I wrote those figures down after discussions with others before getting confirming advice from the Treasury. My first loan as Treasurer was for 50 million Swiss francs at an Australian rate of interest of 5.5 per cent. The second loan was for 60 million Swiss francs or roughly $12m at 5.5 per cent, not 8.5 per cent and all the other twaddle that the Prime Minister went on with. Early in 1970 a further loan for 60 million Swiss francs at 6.5 per cent was arranged. Then we went to the American market and arranged a US$25m loan at 6.5 per cent. Costs on a once and for all basis must of course be added. I will not go further into this matter other than to say that the Prime Minister's reputation for accuracy has again been dinted and soon it will stand permanently as the record of a man who does not care very much about the truth. In September 1968 another loan was negotiated, at 6.2 per cent. I am glad to say that just before I left the Treasury- I think probably as a mark of friendship between the Deutsche people and myself- they made us 2 loans. One loan was of 200 million Deutsch marks. If we divide that by 4 we will get the amount in Australian dollars. It was borrowed at 6.5 per cent. The final loan was at 6.5 per cent. These are just some of the tendentious statements of the Prime Minister. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I come now to his statement relating to new sources of borrowing. Nobody on my side of the House argues against new sources if the money is from the Arab oil producing countries. Of course we do not want funds from those who have engaged in illegal practices and have accumulated funds improperly. If the money comes from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, then of course it would be welcome in this country, provided it was arranged on appropriate terms. What we are arguing about now is the means adopted by the Aus.tralian Labor Party to get these loans, that is about those it has treated as agents, the degree of secrecy and the motivation for that secrecy. If this had been a normal and not an abnormal transaction, these questions would not have been necessary. </para><para>I have here several documents which illustrate to the House what our position as a Liberal Party always has been on loans. We have always believed that negotiations should be open, that the Treasury should handle these matters other than in exceptional circumstances, and that it should not be left to agents to act as intermediaries. The Treasury should carry out the basic operation with the underwriters and brokers before it was agreed to at a ministerial and then the Cabinet level. I brought in to the House a letter which I wrote on 15 May 1967 setting out in clear terms exactly what I thought, and what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt</inline> agreed was the proper procedure to follow and the Department which should carry out loan negotiations. </para><para>As an explanatory note I should say that during the time I was Treasurer I found that some other departments thought they had a greater degree of expertise than the Treasury. That was never the truth. But, vanity being what it is, one can never stop that kind of vanity and thinking. From generation to generation action has had to be taken by the Prime Minister to ensure that the proper role of the Treasury as set out in the Administrative Arrangements Order, for which the Prime Minister is responsible, is observed. In this letter of 1 5 May I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt:</inline></para><quote>
            <para>The second report gives an account of the reactions of various bankers overseas to a proposal ... for a government-owned corporation that would borrow funds abroad. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">The letter was written in the context that the Trade Department no doubt would seek authority to borrow abroad, other than through the Treasury. I then stated: </para><quote>
            <para>Finance in general and Commonwealth borrowing abroad in particular are clearly within the responsibilities of the Treasurer and there are well-established methods of bringing such matters to the attention of the responsible Minister. What . . . is being suggested cuts right across the long accepted divisions of Ministerial responsibility and breaks rules that are basic to the working of the Cabinet system. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt</inline>agreed. During the time he was Prime Minister he refused to permit any Department or Minister to chisel in on this area of Treasury responsibility. The rule was broken during the Prime Ministership of the right honourable member for Higgins. The concept of Treasury responsibility was confirmed in a letter of 20 March 1975 from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dyer</inline> relating to an agent being allowed to act as an agent for borrowing of money on behalf of a government agency, when he said: </para><quote>
            <para>No Treasurer could of course agree to provide such authority. </para>
          </quote><para>The Prime Minister went on to mention that the British Government had borrowed from Arab sources. I state clearly that it was not the borrowing in which we were interested; it was the means and the people through whom it was done. The British said in their statement- as I think it ought to have said- that borrowing negotiations were first carried out by the Bank of England and then the commercial banks, as agents carrying out their normal functions under the Bank's supervision. Even tiny New Zealand has adopted exactly the same practice. </para><para>The only person to whom the Prime Minister referred as having written a letter direct to a Treasurer of Liberal persuasion to seek approval to act as an agent for raising loans was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walter</inline> Pisterman who happened to be a great friend of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt</inline> but whose request for approval was turned down. Let me turn to another question which I believe to be of critical importance and which is associated with what I have just said. I mentioned my recent visit overseas. Today the Prime Minister referred to Australia's rating in the official standard of precedence and borrowing priorities. Our rating by the relevant rating authority, Standard and Poor, is AAA, which is tops. That position was achieved by the hard effort of the producers of this country and in particular by the leadership of the Liberal-Country Party Government, and its incentives to growth and increased productivity. As the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> said today, we won that rating because so many new raw materials were discovered and processed during the time we were in government. We became one of the most respected countries. A country in which other countries could invest with the lowest risk and with a reasonable return. I have no doubt that Australia 's rating is still high. But I say with great diffidence and hest it at ion that if one goes to the United States of America or England today he will find that it is not this country, this Parliament or the people of this country but the Australian Government that is being laughed at and ridiculed because of its economic and social policies. The Cairns and the Khemlani affairs have made us a laughing stock. People ask: 'What has happened?' One company said to me that it had already invested $150m in Australia and now wanted to invest another $350m. They referred not to the Strangler, as I called him before, but to Old B oof head over there. They asked: 'What is he up to now?' This $3 50m cannot be invested because the Minister will acquire crudes at well head and he will not tell us the terms and conditions under which acquisition will take place. </para><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Berinson)Order!</inline>It was not until the end of that sentence that it became clear that the right honourable member was referring to another honourable member in a quite unparliamentary way. I ask him to withdraw it. </para><continue>

              <para>- I withdraw that remark, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. Now</inline> let me come to one other point I would like to make. We have in the Treasury three or four men who are recognised as technical experts of the highest quality and as men who have entree to the greatest banking systems of the world and to the governments in countries which save internally and invest overseas. I refer to Lindsay Brand, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Visbord</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw.</inline> They helped me during the time I was Treasurer and we obtained all the money needed when we were running deficits in our finance. If these men had been consulted and used they would have been able to negotiate with Arab countries without intermediaries and arrange for borrowing on behalf of this country. This would have prevented the Government from becoming involved in sordid transactions such as the Khemlani affair. It is also to be remembered that borrowing with an authoritarian government and a free country is different. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>In authorising loans the negotiation must be government to government. 1 want to speak on only one other subject and that is about what has become known throughout the world as the Khemlani affair. There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was the principal agent. The Prime Minister has said that he was not, but if you look at the correspondence and at the various documents that have been tabled there can be no doubt that he was the principal agent, and fits perfectly into the definition of agent. That can be illustrated by several of the letters that have been published- not in the list tabled today but published in the Melbourne Age. </para><para>It is a fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> wrote to the Moscow Narodny Bank and told them of the 5 cheques for $20m and one of $ 1 5m that were to be issued to those who were to receive commission. One was for an amount of $ 15m for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bajius</inline> who is now a fugitive from justice and one of the men who was tested by the security service or someone else as to integrity. He had this power. He was an agent. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> whom we cannot find now. He is also at large and not able to be traced by anyone so that we can test his opinion. </para><para>It appears from the letters that apart from the Minister for Minerals and Energy the mastermind was the Prime Minister himself and that not only did he attempt to ignore the constitutional legalities but also adopted devious means to ensure that these negotiations were kept secret. He did so because he dared not show his hand before he had completed the deal as he knew that if he did the Labor Party would find it intolerable and so would the people of this country. However, if he could get away with it and face the people and the Labor Party with a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli</inline> he would be safe and would have until Budget time in which to recover from the odium and distress he had caused. There is no appeal from that in Parliament. But the Labor Party and the people will each have an appeal soon. If the Labor Party does not change its leadership the people will change the Government and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> certainly you will not be  Deputy Speaker  for long and the Prime Minister will lose his job as Leader of the Government and the Australian nation. </para></speech>

            <para>- I rise to take part in this debate in order to set some facts straight and to answer some of the false statements made by honourable members opposite. I have not time to deal with them all because there were too many speakers and each of them made too many false allegations for me to deal with them all in 15 minutes. I will have to content myself with the remarks made by the last  speaker.  The right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> gave great credit to himself in particular and in a general sort of way to the government of which he was a member for the fact that he raised a loan in November 1968 for Swiss francs at a rate of interest of 5.5 per cent. What he did not tell the House was that in order to get it he paid a commission of 5.06 per cent. No one can give a person much credit for raising a loan anywhere if that person was prepared to pay 5.06 per cent commission. Nothing like that is charged in respect of the Khemlani proposal that I propose to deal with later. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The right honourable gentleman went on to say that the Opposition is not complaining about the borrowing; it is not complaining about the amount. It is the means by which the amount was borrowed and the kind of people by which the transaction was carried out that causes its worry. He went on to say that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> was the mastermind behind this transaction with Khemlani. He was not the mastermind; I was the mastermind. I was the one who discovered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> and if it had not been for me finding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> the Government would never have got near the point of being able to raise enough money to give Australia ownership of its own natural gas, ownership of its own uranium enrichment plants, the right to own its petrochemical industry and the right to put a pipeline from west to east across this continent. I was the one who discovered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> and without <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis,</inline> the Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> would never have come into the picture and the Prime Minister would never have had the satisfaction which he must surely enjoy of having been present at an Executive Council meeting which formally authorised the borrowing of the money which came solely as a result of my enterprise and the fact that I knew somebody who was able to tell us we could get money we badly needed. </para>
          <para>In this country we have to decide whether we will allow the ownership of our natural resources to be controlled by the Australian people or whether we will hand it over to foreign enterprise and foreign investors. I am sick and tired, and so is every other Australian, of seeing our natural resources golloped up by foreign investors so that we, the people of Australia, then lose control of our own assets. I am tired of that and I hope that the day will come when I will have the great satisfaction of making some small contribution to stopping the rot that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen complained about of selling off a bit of the farm each year. I thought that I might one day be able to make a small contribution. Never did I realise in my wildest dreams that I would make the contribution which I believe I can still make because I believe that this loan can still be brought about. There is no criticism from honourable members opposite about the rate of interest. How can there be when we look at the rates of interest that they paid on loans when they were in government? There is no criticism of the amount of money because nobody can deny that $4,000m is needed if we are to set up our own petro-chemical industries, instal a trans-continental gas pipeline, have an uranium enrichment plant or exploit our natural resources as we ought to do. We need every penny of this amount. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has discovered that you need about $4,000m to do anything worthwhile. In the 'Bulletin' of 1 February it is stated: </para>

          <para class="block">Honourable members opposite talk about bypassing the Australian Loan Council. They talk about deception and about not telling the people what is happening. When did their government ever tell the people what kinds of commissions they paid and what kinds of interest rates they paid during the 23 years that they were in government. When did honourable members opposite ever tell the people what they had done? It is any wonder that the people that they chose to give a monopoly over the raising of loans overseas for the Australian Government are concerned that somebody else is likely to muscle in on what they believe to be their sole preserve? I would like to know how much money went into the campaign funds of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party from the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Would not that company pay in order to get a LiberalNational Country Party in office by kicking in to the campaign funds? Out of every $100m that was borrowed on behalf of the Australian Government, the company that provided its services to obtain the money would receive $2m clear for doing virtually nothing. Of course, why would not such a company support the previous government? Why would not such a company be disturbed when it thought that somebody else was going to get into these nice pickings? That is what it is all about, excepting for this one other factor. The Government is not prepared to hand over our natural resources to foreign controllers whereas the Opposition is prepared to do so. Some time in September 1 974 a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jerry</inline> Karidis of Adelaide told me there that he believed that it would be possible for the Australian Government to raise a long term loan of a substantial amount at about an 8 per cent interest rate. </para>

              <para>- It could be either a long term or a temporary loan. They did not care which. I am glad that the honourable member asked that question because instead of being as smart as he thinks he is, he is as silly as I think he is. The fact is that it was not necessarily a long term loan. The term of the loan could be negotiated. So the honourable member is wrong. I state again that it is the silliest interjection he has ever made. I am glad that he made it. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> that the Minister for Minerals and Energy had indicated frequently by public statements that he wanted to see Australia's mineral and energy resources developed in such a way as to ensure that ownership and control would remain in Australian hands and that this could be best achieved, thought <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor-</inline> and he was so right- through the Government itself becoming involved in these activities. </para>

That indicates what they thought of him. I was present at the meeting which was arranged. At this meeting there was a general but inconclusive discussion in which questions were raised relating to the proposed rates of interest, the terms of the loan and the proposed commission. I notice that eventually <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt and the Minister for Minerals and Energy were able to reduce the rate of interest from 8 per cent to an effective 7.92 per cent, which included the commission. The Opposition can put that in its pipe and smoke it and compare it with what it has ever done. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member should not keep asking questions. I wish I had time to answer all his interjections, because he strengthens my case every time he opens his mouth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> subsequently indicated that he had made contact with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> who claimed to be in a position to make direct contact with Middle East oil interests who had large sums of money to lend. I repeat: I still think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> will succeed in raising the funds and I still believe that my colleague eventually will get the $4,000m for Australia's development. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> called at my office with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> whom he introduced as the person who was able to make contact with the Arab principals. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> asked me to arrange for him to be introduced to the Minister for Minerals and Energy. This arrangement was made and when the meeting took place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> made the introduction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to the Minister for Minerals and Energy because, although courtesy demanded that I do it, I had forgotten his name by the time we met the Minister for Minerals and Energy. I had to turn to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> and ask him to make the introduction. At this meeting no negotiations whatsoever concerning the loan proposal were carried out in my presence. Right from the very first day I had spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> I had explained to him that it would be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> who would have to carry out the negotiations because he had the responsibility of carrying out those kinds of investments. However, I did indicate- as I am indicating now, and as I have indicated everywhere for years; and I did it again then- in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> 's presence that I fully supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor's</inline> aim of trying to gain maximum Australian ownership of Australian mineral and energy reserves and to stop any further foreign ownership and control of our natural resources. </para>
          <para>I do not think anybody here will doubt the character and the standing of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. What the Opposition does not like about the Minister for Minerals and Energy is that its wealthy friends cannot bribe him as they used to be able to bribe some of the Opposition's party officials at election time. That is what the Opposition does not like about him. Its wealthy friends cannot bribe him in the way that they could bribe the Opposition's party officials at election time. The Opposition does not like the fact that the Minister for Minerals and Energy stands as true as steel in the interests of the Aus.tralian people and, on this particular occasion, was on the brink of being able to pull off the greatest coup in the interests of Australia. That is what the Opposition is upset about. </para>

              <para>-The Minister would be the first to recognise that he cannot take it, and he knows it. So far as the comments made by the Minister for Manufacturing Industry are concerned, as I understand it the suggestion was that certain moneys had changed hands or had been offered. I repeat here what I have said publicly and what I have informed the Liberal and National Country Parties: Neither I nor any member of my staff has ever been involved in any suggestions of this type. Such allegations are completely and utterly without foundation. I make it perfectly clear also that I have had no direct conversation or communication with the gentleman mentioned by the Minister. I certainly have had no conversation with that gentleman. It is true that a member of my staff made contact with him at a certain stage in Sydney recently. That member was in the company of a Press reporter from one of the daily newspapers. That reporter happened in fact to quote the letter to which the Minister for Manufacturing Industry referred. The suggestions are without foundation. </para>

            <para>-The whole of the course of today has been quite extraordinary. It has been extraordinary for several reasons. The first reason is that it is . the Government which has called the Parliament back. The Government at long last realised that significant charges had been made against it and that those charges needed to be answered. It has been a significant day also because the answers that the Government has tried to give in the House are so totally inadequate. The charges remain, not because there has not been a great volume of new evidence brought today but because the evidence which has progressively been revealed- not because the Government has been prepared to expose its actions openly, but as a result of the assiduous efforts of newspapers and, in particular, the efforts of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)-</inline> has slowly brought to the light of day the whole of the complexity of what lies behind the overseas loan dealings of this Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This matter concerns not just the loan dealings of the one man who has been sacked. It concerns the whole of the ramifications of dealings which emerged from the Executive Council minute relating to the loan borrowings approved by the Executive Council and the 4 senior Government Ministers present, of whom I wish to- say a little in a moment. That Executive Council minute was passed on 13 December last. Significantly, the charges remain. The Government is incompetent and the senior members of the Government have been involved in a deliberate deception and in a conspiracy to deceive. It is no use the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> coining into this House and saying that no responsible person has expressly or directly made any specific charge . of impropriety or of illegal or corrupt conduct on the part of his Government, himself or, any individual Minister, for that demonstrably is untrue. Charges have been made. A prima facie case has been substantiated in this place and it is now for the Government and for this House to accept the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> or, alternatively, to accept the judgment of the people. </para>
          <para>In my view there are sufficient facts still to emerge- facts which are not disclosed in the inadequacy of the documents tabled either by the Prime Minister or by the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> on behalf of the Government today and which must be answered. These are facts which must in some way rebut the charges made, or the charges will stick. These dual allegations of incompetence by the Government and of a deliberate deception and a conspiracy to deceive remain. The Government has not answered those charges. </para>
          <para>Of course, individually, the Ministers themselves have a great deal to answer for. The Government says that no action was taken on our side of the House earlier. The Prime Minister made much of the fact that he claimed that parliamentary action could well have been initiated long before this. I remind the House that it was not until 12 June, some 7 days after the rising of the House of Representatives, that the Executive Council minute of 13 December was revealed to the Parliament. If one looks - </para>

              <para>-Yes. The Government has from the very beginning refused to disclose the circumstances of the whole of this very sordid affair. All one needs to do is to look at the brevity of the replies of Ministers in the House. On 13 February the Minister for Minerals and Energy in response to a question about the whole of the ramifications of the overseas borrowings said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>Matters relating to the currency, loans and the commercial credit of the nation should be handled with the utmost discretion. I am acting accordingly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How inadequate a response. On 13 February the Prime Minister in answer to a long question from the right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> regarding again the circumstances of overseas borrowings, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Open government has never applied in respect of loans or valuations of the currency. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On 20 May 1975 the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>Can he inform the House whether the proposed $2 billion borrowing by the Minister for Minerals and Energy has the approval of the Australian Loan Council? If not, when will the Government seek approval of the Loan Council? What is the purpose of the loan? </para>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The answer to the first question is no; to the second, if and when the loan is made; to the third, for matters related to energy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So much for the information that the Government has been prepared to give to the Parliament and the people. So much for the opportunity given to members of the Opposition to canvass this matter adequately. </para>
          <para>If the Prime Minister thinks this matter has been brought forward as a result of Opposition tactics all he needs to do is to look at the newspapers and the comments of the Press about the silence of members of the Ministry and of members of the Government. An article written by John Jost which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 5 July carried the heading: 'From Connor, stunning silence'. So much for the opportunity for the people to know all the circumstances of this sordid affair. </para>
          <para>Let me just ask 2 questions. First, was the borrowing of $4,000m so extraordinary as to be improper? The borrowing was in contravention of the Loan Council. It was for an incredible amount and for purposes inadequately and misleadingly described and involved an unprecedented method of implementation likely gravely to damage Australia's financial standards. The second question is: Was the $4,000m of borrowing legal and constitutional? The answer is no. The Parliament has been ignored, the Constitution by-passed and the Loan Council and the Financial Agreement treated as of no consequence. The law has been flouted. The Prime Minister came in and said: 'We have taken no action earlier'. Now belatedly, nearly 7 months later, he tries to give us yet another reason for the actions of the Government. But let us look at some of the circumstances, some of the questions that still remain. Why the funny money men? Of course, the funny money men are not accepted as being agents through whom a Government should act, not only those of us who believe that it is necessary that the advice of responsible officials of the Government be listened to. One might again ask why was not <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler given an opportunity to comment on the Executive Council minute of 13 December. Why? Because he would not have been prepared to accept it. Why was only the advice- the oral advice at that- of the then Attorney-General taken with respect to the nature of the temporary purposes of the loan. It was because once again the members of the Ministry who were concerned with that Executive Council minute were apprehensive that if the Solicitor-General or the Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department had been listened to the whole of the nature of the Executive Council minute would have been declared invalid. Of course, if that had happened the </para>
          <para class="block">Governor-General might have refused to sign the minute. That would have prevented what seemed at that stage the finalisation of a negotiation that was apparently very near completion. </para>
          <para>Not only the Opposition has expressed the belief that these were peculiar ways to go about business. Today I read the comments of the former Treasurer- as the Leader of the Opposition called him- the present Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> who in a speech on 22 November stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the end what the Government borrows overseas needs to be determined in the light of the basic needs of the economy. Beyond that  Australia  should, I suggest, carefully preserve its reputation as a steady and cautious borrower on official account. There is no need and no case for Australia joining in any mad rush to borrow petro-dollars abroad at any price. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But did the Government listen to what the Minister had to say? Not on your life. </para>
          <para>Even the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has the same view. In a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> N. H. Dyer of 424 Huddle Street, Clifton Hill, Victoria, referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning, the Treasurer made the point: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I should point out that many similar proposals - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He is talking about one of these funny money proposals, or a proposal that seems as though it may well have been a funny money proposal-  are made each year to the Government. </para>
          <para>Experience in investigating these proposals has invariably shown that the main objectives of the intermediary has been to seek to obtain some form of authority to raise funds on behalf of the Australian Government without being able to provide satisfactory verification that funds are in fact available for lending. </para>
          <para>No Treasurer could of course agree to provide such an authority. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government's international reputation as a prime borrower is such that it does not need to use any form of intermediary. </para>
          <para>In the past it has always confined overseas loan negotiations to dealing directly with principals- leading financial institutions in overseas capital markets. </para>
          <para class="block">It will be said by the Minister for Minerals and Energy: 'Of course, this was our idea. We were going to use an intermediary only until we got to the principal '. But that is nonsense. At the time that the Executive Council minute was executed, as we have already been shown, there were drafts of the acceptance document. Already it is quite apparent that at the time of that Executive Council minute being concluded the Minister for Minerals and Energy believed that through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> he was already on to a significant part of this money. The Government through that acceptance document was going to give a fairly significant commission, not in the way that it should have been given but out of the funds to be provided and in a way that would seem to indicate that the same form of agency agreement- we already have in the document tabled today advice from the Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department that he believed it was the same- was made. The advice of the Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department puts all the arrangements of the Minister for Minerals and Energy, as executed through that Executive Council minute, in the same light as those which led to the dismissal of the former Minister for Environment, the honourable member for Lalor. </para>
          <para>So, the Government is showing double standards. It is showing one standard which the Prime Minister takes much credit for having applied with respect to the honourable member for Lalor and another standard which he applies to the Minister for Minerals and Energy and to himself. There is no basis on which this debate today can be resolved unless there is an answer on the reason for this discrepancy. There is a significant discrepancy- a discrepancy which puts one law for those who are in office against that applied to the man who has been dismissed. Even as far as he who has been dismissed is concerned, let us not for one moment think that the Prime Minister can escape all odium for all the implications which he said obliged him to require the handing in of the former Minister's commission and, failing his handing it in, to call on the Governor-General to terminate it. </para>
          <para>Two significant questions within the responsibility of the Prime Minister remain to be answered with respect to all the borrowings initiated by the former Treasurer, a man who I believe believes that he was honest in the statement that he made to this House on 5 June and a man who I believe far more, I am afraid, than I believe either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Minerals and Energy. As far as the Prime Minister and his involvement are concerned, what is he doing about the revelations which demonstrably have been of concern to the Government of Fiji and which have been promulgated through questions that were put to the Fijian Minister for Information, Rate David Toganivalu? Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Cairns in fact travel to Fiji on a diplomatic passport? Were his fares paid by the Government? These are significant questions relating to the whole of that affair which have been ignored, and they are matters within the responsibility of the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>There are many questions that have not been answered in this debate today. What were the real reasons for this loan? We have been told today that the objective was to try to nationalise the whole of the exploitation of Australian mineral resources. If that is so, why were those reasons not exposed to the people and to the Parliament at least 6 months ago? The only conclusion that one can reach through the whole of the machinations and the manner of the deceiving of the States through the temporary purposes conception of that Executive Council minute is that at no stage did the Government intend to reveal to those who have a responsibility in the States the nature of its intentions. But it is only because the whole nature of the dealings have come into the light of day through the revelations in the Press that the Government now finds it necessary to reveal what are the real purposes so it now claims- of its operations. </para>
          <para>Of course, there are many areas in which the Minister for Minerals and Energy has let down the States. He has just returned from Japan. In some discussions he had with the Association of Colliery Owners he asked some members of the As so cation to go to Japan and discuss with Japanese purchasers the prospect of buying coal at $57 a ton. Some members of the Association went to Japan and negotiated contracts at $52 to $54 a ton. The Minister went there last week and sold out the coal industry at $48 a ton. So much for the integrity of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. The whole of the circumstances of this affair relate to a continued conflict between the Commonwealth and the States. There has been a continued and deliberate intent to hide from the States an opportunity to know the whole of the circumstances of how and in what way we are going to be nationalised in relation to the exploitation of our natural resources. There is no doubt that certain questions will remain unresolved after this debate today. The only alternative is to have a vote on the question of whether there should be a royal commission. If there is to be no royal commission the Prime Minister is charged with the responsibility of handing in his commission and letting the people of Australia decide. There is no other alternative. The charges remain. </para>

            <para>- We have just had the sincerity of the Opposition shown in its refusal to allow tins debate to continue by moving that the question be put. If we had attempted to move that the question be put, Opposition members would have been screaming blue murder. However, on this occasion they had had enough of the debate. It has become obvious during the debate this day that the Opposition's unsubstantiated questions have been dealt with, first by the Prime Minister, then by the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> and then by the member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> who have shown conclusively that not one ounce of proof or truth has been brought to the attention of the Parliament by the Opposition today. In fact, all that the Opposition has relied on during the past month has been Press releases, statements and articles that have allegedly been prepared. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Today there has been talk about a sum of $8m in sterling having exchanged hands. We have heard the member for Lalor state today that a member of his staff was offered amounts beginning at $3,000 and ending at $15,000. In making statements truthful or untruthful the newspapers were not concerned with the facts. Despite all the rubbishing and maligning of people that has taken place today and over the past month, not one ounce of proof has been brought forward. As the Prime Minister said, as reported in the Press last Monday, when he gave notice of calling this meeting of Parliament it was up to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to back up or shut up. It is fairly obvious to everyone here this evening that the Leader has not been able to bring forward any proof whatsoever of any impropriety on the part of anyone. </para>
          <para>The facts are that if the Opposition wants royal commissions or judicial inquiries it has to establish a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case to start with to show that there is justification for holding such a judicial inquiry or royal commission. Where have members opposite produced proof? Members should look at the credibility of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> as revealed in the statutory declaration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy</inline> which was tabled by the member of Lalor this afternoon. In it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nagy</inline> states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> said to him that Cairns was finished and that the Government was finished, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> had said that he would take up the loan when he became the Treasurer. Let us look at the facts of this matter. I have referred to a statutory declaration of one of the men who has been involved in these negotiations with the Treasurer or the Minister for Minerals and Energy, whatever the case may be. Let members opposite produce facts and figures about just what complaint they have. </para>
          <para>In any case, let us consider the past record of the Liberal and Country Parties when they were in government in this place. I realise it will not do members opposite much good if we look too closely at that. For example, let us consider what the former Leader of the Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John McEwen)</inline> said in his second reading speech on the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill on 5 May 1970: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That there are great resources of capital overseas willing for investment in Australia either as equity or fixed term lending does not have to be demonstrated. The facts of capital inflow speak for themselves. If we could get more capital from overseas in non-equity form, carrying a terminating liability for income payments abroad, our balance of payments would be the stronger and our industries less dominated from overseas. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is what the Minister for Minerals and Energy and the former Treasurer were interested in. They were interested in capital that could be terminated. They were taking the line that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen took in this Parliament on 5 May 1 970. Where have honourable members opposite changed their ground? They want still to be in the position where they can sell out a bit of the farm, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen once mentioned. Honourable members opposite want to sell a bit of the farm each way to continue to exist. That is the way they want it. That is the way that they want it for their rich friends, just as the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is continually trying to get the price of oil increased.

While aware of its possible side effects, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recognised the place of trim et hop rim with sulphamethoxazole, particularly in the treatment of urinary tract and respiratory infections and that the medical profession had gained wide experience in its use of this preparation. </para>

          <para>The time between approval of citizenship applications and actual granting of citizenship varies considerably. Where applicants opt to have citizenship conferred at a ceremony held by the Department of Labor and Immigration, the average delay is less than two weeks. Where citizenship is conferred at ceremonies arranged by Local Government Authorities the delay is governed by the frequency of ceremonies held by the individual Local Government Authority. The interval between formal Local Government Citizenship ceremonies has varied between one month and 12 months depending mainly on the number of candidates for citizenship in their areas. </para>

            <para>I consider that the introduction of poker machines to the A.C.T. is a matter which must be very carefully considered by the community and its representatives. For this reason, I have encouraged many individuals and community organisations to convey their views both to me and to their representatives in the Legislative Assembly. In addition, I have referred the matter to the Legislative Assembly, which is representative of the Canberra community, for their careful consideration. </para>
            <para>In view of my active encouragement of an expression of views by the community, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to unilaterally insist on the holding of a referendum. The appropriate Ordinance, will however, be tabled in the Parliament and it is open for any Member of the Parliament to move appropriately for the holding of a referendum at that stage. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>At present there appear to be reasonably good prospects for the disposal of rapeseed on the domestic market, which normally absorbs about twice as much edible vegetable oil as can be obtained from locally grown seed. Aus.tralian prices for rapeseed and other oilseeds are established having regard to price levels prevailing on the world market. World rapeseed prices have fallen from the very high level of $326 per tonne (Canadian No. 1, Winnipeg Exchange) in October, 1 974 to the current level of about $ 184 per tonne. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The major Australian crusher has not yet offered growers a guaranteed minimum price for the 1975 rapeseed crop because of a continuing element of instability in world price levels. However, current indications are that growers might anticipate a price of around $ 1 50 per tonne, delivered capital city, which compares with the guaranteed minimum $165 per tonne offered to growers in 1 974. </para>
          <para>Very high prices for Unseen in 1974 encouraged the growing of a large Australian crop, some of which was exported. Current market trends indicate that domestic prices for the 1 975 crop may be in the vicinity of $ 1 30 per tonne compared with a guaranteed minimum provided by crushers of $ 185 in 1974. lit view of the reduced price incentive, and even given normal seasonal conditions, production in 1975 may not reach the level achieved last year. In these circumstances growers should have little difficulty in marketing their 1975 crop to Australian crushers. In the event that production does exceed domestic demand, disposal of the surplus at satisfactory prices on world markets may be difficult if world demand and prices continue to decline. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Prices for rapeseed and. linseed will probably be lower this year and guaranteed prices have not been established by crushers at this stage. However, prices for alternative crops such as wheat and barley have also declined. Accordingly, production of rapeseed and Unseen should continue to be a comparatively attractive enterprise for established growers. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Safflower seed is in considerable demand on the domestic market and I am advised that contracts for the coming season are available to growers at prices of around $150 per tonne (delivered to capital city basis). </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>As the summer growing oilseeds such as sunflower and soy a beans are not planted until late this year with harvesting in 1976 a reliable assessment of market prospects for these crops cannot be made at present. </para>
          <para>Market prices for all oilseeds have declined recently in response to an increase in the supply of some vegetable oils and a decline in demand for both oils and meals. Future prices will also be influenced by the progress of crops in major producing countries particularly in North America, and, in the case of soya beans, by any upturn in the livestock industry which is the major outlet for high protein meals. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>In making comparisons between the experiences of different countries it is necessary to take account both of factors specific to individual countries and of the inherent differences in national statistics which purport to measure the same concept. </para>
            <para>International comparisons of recent inflation rates do need to take account of differential impacts of oil price increases. These have had a lesser effect on inflation in Australia than they have had in general in other OECD countries. But there have been other factors which also have led to differences in inflation rates. For example, this Government inherited from its predecessor excessively easy financial conditions which contributed significantly to Australia's inflationary experience during 1973 and 1974. </para>
            <para>Individual countries have experienced different wage and cost pressures; individual countries differ in the extent to which they are engaged in international trade and commerce and so are differently subject to 'imported* inflation; individual countries make different choices as to the extent and manner in which economic growth is reduced in order to combat inflation. </para>
            <para>The nature and content of price indexes upon which international comparisons of inflation rates are made do differ considerably from country to country making it not always possible to compare like with like. </para>
            <para>The foregoing is not to suggest however, that appropriately qualified use of published statistics cannot give rise to valid broad generalisations about inflation rates in broadly comparable economies. </para>

          <para>It is understood that Western Australian legislation has been amended so that kangaroos are no longer classified as vermin. The Queensland Government introduced a tagging system on 1 March 1975 and I am hopeful that a satisfactory decision on the Queensland program, and the reserve system for the protection of kangaroos, will be reached shortly. The management program in Tasmania is unsatisfactory because there is only limited provision for the monitoring of populations of species commercially exploited and inadequate control over the numbers of wallabies harvested. The Tasmanian authorities are currently working to overcome these problems. </para>

            <para>The objective of the Australian Government's initiative at the 29th United Nations General Assembly was outlined in the reply to Question No. 1176 (Hansard, 15 October 1974). The discussion of this question, held at the initiative of Australia, led to the adoption by the General Assembly on 12 December 1974 of Resolution 3283 (XXIX) on the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The resolution. which was initiated and co-sponsored by Australia and supported by a representative group of countries, drew the attention of Members to the machinery established under the Charter of the United Nations for the peaceful settlement of international disputes; called for its greater use and improved implementation; and asked the Secretary-General of the United Nations to report on the existing machinery under the Charter and on other measures in this area subsequently adopted by the General Assembly. This review is expected to be the subject of further discussion at the United Nations. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>At last year's session of the United Nations General Assembly, Australia played an active role in relation to the two aspects of political asylum, namely, territorial asylum and diplomatic asylum. </para>
            <para>On territorial asylum, Australia participated in the drafting of, and cosponsored, resolution 32 72 (xxix) establishing a Group of Experts, composed of representatives of twenty-seven States, to review the text of a draft Convention on Territorial Asylum submitted to the attention of the General Assembly by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The resolution also decided that the General Assembly would consider at its thirtieth session the question of holding a conference of plenipotentiaries on territorial asylum. </para>
            <para>An Australian expert has participated in the work of the Group of Experts. The Group completed its review of the draft Convention at Geneva in May this year. Its report will be considered at the forthcoming session of the General Assembly. </para>
            <para>On diplomatic asylym, Australia was instrumental in securing the adoption by the General Assembly by a vote of 110-0-16 of resolution 3321 (xxix) which invited Member States wishing to express their views on the question of diplomatic asylum to communicate those views to the Secretary-General not later than 30 June 1975. The resolution also requested the Secretary-General to prepare and circulate to Member States, before the thirtieth Session of the General Assembly, a report containing an analysis of the question of diplomatic asylum, and decided to include in the provisional agenda of its thirtieth Session an item entitled 'Report of the Secretary-General on the question of diplomatic asylum '. </para>
            <para>Australia will be submitting its views on the question of diplomatic asylum to the Secretary-General and, as the State responsible for the original inscription of this item on the agenda of the General Assembly last year, will, of course, participate actively in the discussion of this item at the forthcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly. </para>

              <para>The honourable member for Kooyong will be aware of my long-standing interest in this matter. For example, on 26 September 1961 (Hansard, page 1321) I expressed the hope that Australia would provide a lead to other countries by abandoning its qualifications to its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. I have also raised this subject in questions on several occasions (for instance. Hansard, 9 April 1963, page 541; 17 April 1963, page 696; 13 May 1969, page 1734). On 11 February of this year 1 made a statement in this House in which I referred to our warm support for the principles and' objectives of the International Court and in which I said that Australia proposed to forgo its existing reservations to acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.

These reservations have been withdrawn. As I announced on 14 March this was done by signing and depositing with the Secretary-General of the United Nations a declaration which had the effect of withdrawing Australia 's then current declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice and of substituting a new declaration. This new declaration, which I signed, was deposited with the Secretary-General on 17 March 1975. It contained no substantive reservations and only one procedural reservation relating to disputes in regard to which the parties thereto have agreed or shall agree to have recourse to some other method of peaceful settlement. Attached for incorporation in Hansard is a copy of this declaration; it was tabled in the Senate on 3 June 1975, the day before the honorable member placed this question on notice. </para>
