            <para>- I rise to say a few words with reference to the announcement which my honorable friend has just made. I think I am expressing not only my own opinion but also the view of every senator when I state that we shall all regret the absence of our friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> from his place in the Chamber.  His  services to the country and to the Senate have been great, and although it has been my fortune, as it has been the fortune of other honorable senators, to be occasionally engaged in very active controversy on many matters which have arisen for consideration, I believe that no sting has been left behind, and that as between our friend who has vacated his place in the Senate and his office in the Ministry and each individual member of the Senate there will be the best of feeling and the best of good wishes for his future- We all rejoice to know that he retires to occupy an office in which I believe his- great abilities, his integrity, his broad-mindedness, will enable him to render even greater service to the Commonwealth than he has been privileged to do hitherto. I wish him long life and great success in that position, for which he is admirably fitted and which, in my belief, he will adorn. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and the Ministry of rehabilitated fragments, on his accession to the position of &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council. He knows that I  do so with the utmost sincerity. </para>

              <para>- It is no mere lip service, as my honorable friend is aware. We have been delighted to see him in that corner, both in his sitting down and in his up-rising ; we have really an affection for him, and those feelings will notbelessened when he takes his place at the table. Apart from the controversies of political life, in which we are all engaged, and which are necessary in order to the proper conduct of the business of the country and of its government - apart from those things which are essential, I believe that my honorable friend, wherever it is possible, will have the assistance - of honorable senators on both sides of the Chamber. That is all I need say of that appointment. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> on being promoted - I think it is promotion - to the position of official leader of the Commonwealth Bar. I am sure, if he will allow me to say so, that he will show he is well fitted to occupy the position. I am glad that no mistaken notion as to the necessity of having the chief legal adviser of the Government in another place has intervened to prevent him from filling the office. I do not think that there is any such rule written or unwritten. I am very glad indeed to congratulate my honorable friend on his taking the position. Of the other arrangements I prefer to say nothing. The less said the better. I say no more. </para>

            <para>- In offering my congratulations to those who have boon promoted from the Parliament to fill more honorable and responsible positions I shall have very little to say. As regards those senators who have changed their relation to their fellow members every member of the .party to which I belong is gratified by the promotion- which has been accorded to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor.</inline> We know that he will do his duty in the position to which he has been translated, as he did on the floor of the Senate. We have always esteemed and admired our good old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> We expect, that, when he is at the table and &#39;subject to criticism  and responsible for the answers to the questions which may be hurled at him, he will give the same satisfaction as he has given from the place which he now occupies. As regards the direct representative of the Government here, no one who has watched <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> conduct of business has a right to doubt his sincerity, or to complain of any want of energy and industry on his part in endeavouring to carry out his duties. We hope that he will receive thesamesupport from honorable senators in the future as in the past. I trust that our relations for the rest of this session will be mutually pleasant As one of those who have to appeal to the electors at the end of the year, I trust also that we may all meet again and renew our friendship in the first session of the next Parliament. </para>

I recognise that under the new standing order honorable senators will have an opportunity of addressing the Senate on the ordinary motion to closethe sitting, and it might be more convenient if they reserved their remarks until it was moved. </para>

Does the proposed Chief Justice comply with those requirements is the question which I have been compelled to ask myself, and I regret very much to say that I have to answer in the negative. With regard to the first of those requirements - that he should have a stainless public record - I do not know whether honorable senators know anything whatever about the record of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. But I can assure them that it is a matter of public notoriety in Queensland ; and it will be interesting, as well as informing, at this juncture to look back some years, and ascertain what this gentleman&#39;s conduct has been in the positions of Premier and leader of the Opposition in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- An announcement has been made that certain gentlemen have accepted positions on the High Court Bench. I submit that unless there is a substantive motion dealing with the fitness of those gentlemen for the positions to which they have been appointed it is not in order for an honorable senator &#39;to discuss the past conduct of one of them. The rule laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> is perfectly clear with regard to parliamentary criticism of Judges of the superior- courts in Great Britain. I will admit that the Justices of the High Court of Australia have not yet ben sworn in, but still I think that the rule laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> will apply. That rule is that - </para>

          <para class="block">I am aware that in our new Standing Orders we have not provided that we shall be guided by the authority of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> or by the rules of the House of Commons. But still May&#39;s work on <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> must be regarded as having very great authority as a guide to the  President  in deciding matters of this kind, and I submit that the determination of the point rests entirely with the  President.  Let us examine the reasons for the point of order. It has always been considered undesirable that a man occupying the position of a Judge of the Supreme Court should be liable to have his conduct criticised, in any House of Parliament unless upon specific and substantial grounds. The motion now before the Senate is an ordinary one : That the Senate, at its rising,, adjourn to a certain day. I submit that it is not competent upon that motion to discuss a matter of such grave importance as the fitness of any gentleman for the position of a Judge of the High Court. It is most undesirable that there should be a possibility of the character of one of our Judges being besmirched and dragged in the mire in any way whatever. We must regard thesegentlemen as being above reproach. </para>

              <para>- The motion before the Senate is that the Senate, at its rising, adjourn until an unusual time. It is not a motion which, within the terms of our Standing Orders, is one of urgency. It is a motion to enable a Minister to make a statement as to a change in the personnel of&#34; the advisers to  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral, and as to certain appointments which it is proposed to make, or which havebeen made, to the Bench of the High Court of the Commonwealth, and to fix our next day of sitting. In discussing that motion,. it must be remembered that the circumstances are unusual, and the question must be treated in an unusual manner. Several hon-  orable  senators have alluded to the qualifications of certain persons for the positions they will be called upon to occupy. That was done without any protest from any honorable senator ; and I cannot say that other honorable senators cannot take the contrary view. But at the same time I will ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to indulge in personal recriminations, and to moderate his remarks as much as possible. I deprecated, as honorable senators will recollect, any dis1 -cussion on this question further than from the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party, and I think it would have been better if -after those honorable senators had spoken &#34;the question had been put. In fact, I wished to put it, but I was not prepared to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was not in order. I will now ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to be as brief as possible, and not to indulge in any strong language against any of the gentlemen who, as stated by the Attorney-General, have accepted the positions mentioned. </para>

              <para>- In any case, I think that the Senate and the House of Representatives ought to have been afforded an opportunity of criticising these appointments before they were made. Therefore, if there is any lack of generosity, it does not appear to me that I am guilty of it ; the guilt lies somewhere else If I do not take this opportunity of saying what I have to say on the subject I shall have no opportunity later on. After the Chief Justice is sworn in I shall not be able to offer a single remark, unless, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has pointed out, I do so under cover of a substantive motion. I have no desire to do anything of the kind. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> intervened with his point of order, I was considering whether, from my point of view, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith complied with the qualifications which are held to be necessary in any person called upon to fill the office of Chief Justice of the High Court. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith&#39;s public record, I may tell honorable senators that in the early eighties that gentleman was the recognised leader of the white labour party in Queensland. He did valiant service for that party. </para>

              <para>- I wish to add one word to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has said. Once a person has been appointed to a position upon the Judicial Bench of the High Court, he can only be removed from it by an address to the Governor-General, passed by both Houses of the Federal Parliament, although, of course, he may resign. My contention is that everything connected with the appointment of SirSamuel Griffith as Chief Justice of the High Court has been absolutely completed. He has been appointed by the Governor-General, with the advice of the Executive Council, and having been so appointed&#39;, it is not open now, even to the Governor-General or the Executive, to reverse the appointment, except by taking the action provided  for in the Act, under which the Judges of the High Court are appointed. , </para>

              <para>- I understand that : but I desire to point out that the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> which I support, is that if there is an honorable senator present who has an objection to the appointment of any of these gentlemen, he has as much right to give expression to that objection as has any other honorable senator to express approval of any other person appointed to a similar position. Honorable senators will agree that when the question was first raised on the motion that the Senate at its rising adjourn until Wednesday, I endeavoured to follow the example set by the leader of the Opposition. I did not give expression to any opinion calculated to provoke discussion, as I was under the impression that I might have an opportunity to do so when speaking to a subsequent motion. I have just as strong an objection to the appointment of a certain gentleman to the High Court Bench as have other honorable senators, but when I was speaking a few minutes ago, I waived my I  right to make any reference to that subject.- </para>

              <para>- The point of order now raised is, in effect, that which I have already determined. What I said before, . I desire to repeat. I say that, inasmuch as some honorable senators have expressed their approbation of certain appointments and have stated their reasons for that approbation, I am not prepared to debar other honorable senators from expressing s their disapprobation of certain appointments. At the same time, it appears to methat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in going into a number of details as to the past history or i political career of a - certain gentleman, is  departing somewhat from the course of. action which should be pursued by him. I think that the honorable senator will be perfectly in order in expressing his disapprobation of the appointments made by the Government. That relates to a political question. </para>

              <para>- I think it would be very much better if I were allowed to continue my remarks. Those who consider that what I am doing is wrong should allow me to bear the blame of my action, and those who approve of my attitude of coursehave nothing to say. I was referring, when interrupted, to the position occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith in the white labour movement in Queensland. I was pointing out that he was the leader of that movement in Queensland, and conducted it to victory. In 1885 a measure was passed which declared that the kanaka traffic should cease  as from the year 1890. In 1888 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was defeated at the elections by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith, who had previously been an advocate of black labour, but who bowed to the weight of public opinion in Queensland, and publicly pledged himself never again to propose the re-introduction of any kind of coloured labour into the State. Thus we had the leaders of the two great political parties in Queensland ostensibly at one on this very important question and unanimously supported by the country. In 1890 the kanaka traffic came to an end. Some time later a coalition Government was formed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> McIlwraith and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, who previously had been political enemies of the most pronounced type. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith had even gone so far as to take a trip to England to endeavour to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> McIlwraith was little short of a criminal. But in 1892 these two gentlemen formed a coalition Government with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith as Premier. Immediately afterwards a Bill was introduced to repeal the Act of 1885 which put an end to the kanaka traffic. I had not the slightest objection, nor do I believe that any citizen of Queensland had the most remote objection, to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith changing his mind upon this question, or to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> McIlwraith taking up the same position. But I contend that what those gentlemen, and more especially <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, should have done, was to have appealed to the country before deliberately breaking their own promises to the people - before deliberately going back upon the policy unanimously adopted by the country. </para>

              <para>- I think it has. In my opinion, it proves that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith is unreliable - that he has been faithless in his public acts as a public man. If that can be proved against him as a lawyer, as a politician, and as the Premier of a State, it naturally follows that he cannot, from my point of view at all events, and from the point of view of a great number of the people of the Commonwealth, be a fit and proper person to fill the position of Chief Justice. We place this gentleman, so to speak, in possession of the Constitution. We put the Constitution in his hands to interpret. We have found him faithless in one relation of life, and how are we to know that he will not be faithless in this ? We have found him going back on his pledged word and abandoning his pledged policy. We have found him deserting his party. We have found him passing a law without appealing to the country for authority to do so, and I have heard it said lately in Melbourne </para>

              <para>- That is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith&#39;s connexion with Queensland politics. I come now to his connexion with the Federal movement. Surely I am entitled to say something on that head. He has always been an ardent advocate of Federation. He was a member of two Conferences, and drafted a- Constitution which was praised by every Conservative in Australia as a monument of the greatest capacity. It was, however, so Conservative that the Convention which sat in 1S97 and 1898, found that it could not be adopted. One of its provisions, I believe, limited much more strictly than the limitation in the Constitution now in force the right of appeal to the Privy Council. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was chiefly responsible for that provision. In 1900, however, we found him secretly intriguing in London - as an honorable gentleman who occupies a distinguished position in this Senate has characterized his action - against the Constitution adopted by the Australian people. He tried to get the Imperial authorities to alter the Constitution, which had been twice accepted by the people, and which had the unanimous support of the Premiers of the States. In what particular <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> He did not on that occasion desire that the right of appeal to the Privy Council should be limited. He had changed his mind then. He was not, as he had been in 1891, an Australian in sentiment. He was in favour of extending the right of appeal to the Privy Council. I think that any one who knows him can easily find a reason for that change of mind. The reason was the alternative proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> for the establishment of an Imperial Court of Appeal, with paid Australian Judges upon the Bench, and with a prospect of those Judges becoming peers of the realm. That was the magnificent prize which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith dangled before his vision, and for which he was prepared to bind Australia in chains, so far as Great Britain was concerned, by compelling the people of Australia to go to the Privy Council for the interpretation of their Constitution. That is the kind of man who has been appointed to the position of- Chief Justice of the High Court. Can it be said that a man of that stamp is not a self-seeker ? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who appears so indignant at the remarks which I have made, whether under ordinary circumstances he would consider one who had been guilty of conduct of that description fitted to occupy the most exalted position in the Commonwealth ? </para>

              <para>- We must have a High Court ; but the Justices of that Court should be above suspicion and above reproach. Their public record should be stainless, and  above everything,  they should be Australian in sentiment. I do not wish to say more. I feel that my task has been a most unpleasant one. I should have preferred to congratulate the Commonwealth upon its prospective Chief J  ustice,  not only for the sake of the Commonwealth itself, but for the sake of the State which I represent. It has been said here in Melbourne that all these things were done by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith without a single murmur from the people of Queensland. That, however, is an absolute misstatement, because there were many murmurs both loud and deep, and these culminated in the return of an almost complete labour representation from that State to the Federal Parliament. It may be pointed out that the people might have turned out the Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was a member, and reversed the policy which he initiated. I can assure honorable senators - and no man knows it better than the Minister of Defence - that they could not have done anything of the kind. It was made exceedingly  difficult for any person to get his name on the electoral&#39; roll, and it was impossible for the people of Queensland to show their disapprobation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith&#39;s conduct before they made an emphatic demonstration in that direction at the time of the Federal elections. . I am sure that if Queensland had been polled, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith would not have been the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- The question whether he should have appealed to the country does not affect his fitness for the  position  to which he has been appointed. He may have been the most inconsistent politician in Australia, and yet that would not be any justification for saying that he is unfit to become a Judge of the High Court. Exception has also been taken to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, on the ground that he was in favour of limiting the right of appeal to the Privy Council, and that he subsequently changed his mind. I decline, however, to believe that a man is unfit for a high judicial position simply because circumstances lead him to honestly change his mind. So far as the question of appeal is concerned, I am told that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. Dickson</inline> went to England, at the time he was a Minister, and represented that the people of Queensland were in favour of retaining the right of appeal to the Privy Council. </para>

              <para>.- A Judge is perfectly entitled to give his opinion upon a question of that kind, particularly if it be true that he, with others, was requested by the Imperial authorities to express his opinion for their guidance. He may not have been thus invited, but whether that be so or not, the facts mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> are not sufficient to justify the condemnation of his appointment. If it had been urged that the appointment was not desirable in view of the fact that it would exclude a better man from the position, or that the gentleman appointed was corrupt and incompetent, there would have been some force in the objection. But the matters which have been mentioned do not afford sufficient justification for the attitude assumed by the honorable senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith may not be as good a man for the position as some others would prove, but that is not the contention, and nothing has been said to in any way affect his vital qualifications. It has been stated that because certain remarks were made in approval of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> to a position on the High Court Bench, honorable senators would be justified in adversely criticising the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. Those remarks were of a very flattering character, and having been made, the argument was used that it was open to any honorable senator to express dissatisfaction with regard to any one of the other Judges. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps he does not care, but it is a matter of grave moment to the Commonwealth that the Judges should be clean and reputable men. I am aware that certain honorable senators are honestly dissatisfied with the one appointment. It may be very hard for them to see this gentleman placed in such an important position as that which he has now to occupy. But still there is a broad rule laid down for dealing with such cases, and we should not attack a man whose hands are tied. So far as I can judge, the objections raised to the gentleman in question are not such as justify any honorable senator in urging that he is unfitted for the high judicial position to which he has been appointed. I say this as one who has not had a great personal acquaintance with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. I do not say it as a matter of personal friendship, but simply with a desire to do what is fair and just to those holding public positions. Ihope thathonorable senators will, now that the matter has gone so far, allow the motion to be put without further discussion. </para>

It must be a matter of congratulation to the Senate that the Government recognise that three of the important salaried positions in the Ministry can be worthily filled from this Chamber. We now have the Attorney-General occupying a seat in the Senate. Previously the portfolios of Minister for Defence and PostmasterGeneral have been held in the Senate ; and I hope that at some future time we may welcome Ministers holding other portfolios. I congratulate my honorable and learned friend, and hope that he will have a bed of roses while he remains Attorney-General. As to my genial friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I congratulate him on attaining the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council. I feel sure that the Senate will be led by him with all kindliness.

          <para>SenatorFRASER (Victoria). - I do not rise to flatter the Government, considering that I have been more or less opposed to them during the last eighteen months or two years. From my fighting nature, I should be more inclined to find fault with them. But on this occasion I am not justified in finding fault with the Government in regard to the appointments to the High Court Bench. I think I could have named one or two men whose appointment would have given me intense satisfaction, and at whose promotion I also think the country would have been pleased. But at the same time, speaking as one with a knowledge of Australia extending over fifty years, I must say that, in my opinion, the appointments made will satisfy the people of the Commonwealth. I am content, and believe that the country will be content, notwithstanding what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I am going to give up speaking of the Labour Corner, because I am more or less friendly towards the honorable senators who sit there just now, as they have done some kindly actions towards me lately. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> in saying that a high Official person like a Judge of the High Court should not be attacked in Parliament, except in a regular and constitutional way. There is no proper opening for an attack upon the new Chief Justice. He is a man -well known throughout Australia, and highly esteemed in his official capacity as a Judge. He is looked up to by all the professional men, and they are better judges than laymen as to his qualifications. He is held in high esteem in Queensland, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> may say ; and I am pleased with his appointment. I believe that the new High Court will really command the Confidence of the public. I was afraid that it would be constituted in such a way that it would not do so. I am in favour of keeping the road clear for appeals to be made to the Privy Council, but at the same time, if appeals  to the High Court of Australia are dealt with expeditiously, economically, and wisely, I believe that many cases will not be sent to England. I compliment the Attorney-General on his promotion in the Ministry. I do not know that there is any necessity for me to say much more than that I am quite satisfied as far as the arrangements of the High Court are concerned. </para>

I am glad that the changes have been made in such a way as to give satisfaction to the people generally. Since the nature of the appointments became known, I have heard many comments, and I think I may say that the universal opinion is that the arrangement arrived at is better than was expected. </para>

            <para>-  The honorable  member is now raising a.question, which I think ought to be settled. The question is whether on the motion &#34;That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; matters may be discussed which are not connected with the adjournment. I am quite open to admit that a good many honorable senators who amended the Standing Orders in this connexion did so with the intention of permitting general discussion on the motion now before us - with the intention of allowing all manner of irrelevant questions to be discussed. But I have to administer the Standing Orders as they are. What is the position ? Standing order 405 provides - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The question under discussion is, &#34;That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; and part of standing order 416, as submitted to the Senate by the Standing Orders Committee, provided that that question should be put forthwith, and without discussion. That part of standing order 416, however, was struck out, and, according to the Standing Orders as now framed, the motion, &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; is not excepted from the ordinary rule that the discussion should be relevant to the subject-matter of the motion. I have to rule on a question which has never before arisen, and I feel a difficulty in that I have to rule on the Standing Orders as they are, because I know that a great many honorable senators, when they amended the Standing Orders, intended that on the motion &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; it should be open to them to discuss any matter. In my opinion, the question now raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> is one for the Senate to decide ; and if I do give a ruling, it must be on the distinct understanding that if the Senate comes to a different conclusion, I shall not feel in any way hurt. I must decide according to the </para>
          <para class="block">Standing Orders as they are, and not according to the Standing Orders as some honorable senators wish them to be ; and under the Standing Orders as they are, the discussion must be confined to the question of the adjournment of the Senate. I do not know what would be the best method of leaving the question to the Senate, but it is certainly a question for the Senate, and this is perhaps a convenient time to decide it. I am quite willing, therefore, to give a ruling against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> on the understanding that if that honorable senator likes to challenge my  decision I am quite content to leave he matter to the Senate. Indeed, I am quite content to leave it to the Senate to give a decision now. It is, of course, a peculiar state of affairs for a  President  to give a ruling, and then to invite senators to consider the question of dissenting from that ruling. That, however, is practically what I am doing, and if honorable senators think that the letter of the standing order should be set aside, it is quite competent for them to take that course. But I see nothing in the Standing Orders to warrant me in allowing irrelevant discussion on the question &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn.&#34; Elsewhere in the Standing Orders, where we intended that discussion should not be confined to the motion before the Senate, we said so. For instance, we say that on the first reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, the discussion need not be relevant to the subject-matter; and that, to a certain extent, implies that in other cases the discussion shall be relevant, as expressly stated in standing order 405. As I say, I am quite prepared to give a ruling now, and allow it to be discussed. I do not care whether or not I am overruled, because it is a question on which I admit there is undoubtedly a misapprehension on the part of many honorable senators. </para>

              <para>- No ; I desire to do nothing of the sort. All I say is that I have to take the Standing Orders as they are, and that the intention of honorable senators, who amended this particular standing order, may not have been carried out. I must freely admit  that a great  many honorable senators - New South Wales senators especially - desired to be enabled to discuss all manner of questions on the motion &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn.&#34; The point which I have to decide is whether we have given effect to that intention - whether we have gone  sufficiently  far in amending standing order 416. I have no desire to give a ruling which will be dissented from, and, therefore, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will give notice that on a future date he will move that the standing order shall permit of a general discussion taking place upon the motion for adjournment the whole matter may be settled. </para>

              <para>- I should like to point out that if the Senate adjourns un til Wednesday next, that will be the last day of the present month. Upon that afternoon private members&#39; business must be taken, and consequently we shall not beable to pass the Supply Bill till the last day of the month, with the result that the civil servants will not be paid at the usual time. The reason why we didnot propose to proceed with business this afternoon was that there was no Minister in the Chamber who had been sworn in. Within a few minutes, however, I believe, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will be present in his capacity as Vice-President of the Executive Council, and probably I shall be sworn in soon afterwards. Now that we have gone so far, it appears to me that it would be wise for us to pass the Supply Bill before we adjourn. </para>

              <para>- Yes. But it is quite competent for me to withdraw that motion. In a few minutes the Ministry will be properly constituted, and there will be nothing to prevent us from proceeding with the consideration of the Supply Bill. If, on the contrary, we adjourn till Wednesday next, that measure cannot be passed till the last day of the month - a most unusual thing. I have been asked by one or two honorable senators to give the Senate an opportunity of passing the Supply Bill before we adjourn. The Treasurer desires Supply to be granted in order that he may be in a position to pay the civil servants at the usual time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has now been sworn in, and consequently the House is properly constituted for the conduct of public business. </para>

          <para>- I desire to say a few words in regard to the extension of the mail contract to Queensland. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">It would have been only a proper act on the part of the Government to invite tenders for a service which directly included Brisbane as a port of call for the mail steamers. That has not been done, and the probability is that Queensland will be excluded from any trading benefits so far as the mail contract is concerned. I think it is extremely desirable that the producers of that State should have equal opportunities of sending their produce to the old country with the producers of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. In Queensland there is a very large area of excellent country which is admirably suited for dairying - indeed, I believe that it is much better adapted to that sort of thing than is any other portion of Australia. We have also a considerable area which is suitable for fruit growing. If we had direct mail communication with Brisbane the probability is that our export trade would be very largely increased, and that the development of our resources would be materially encouraged. I would, therefore, impress upon the Government the absolute necessity of bringing Queensland within the circuit of the mail boats. I. see no reason why she should be excluded, except that it is probable that if the steamers go to Brisbane a little extra expense may be entailed upon the Commonwealth. I conceive that one of the objects of Federation was that each of the States should help the others, and that the States hs a whole should pull together to secure the benefit of mutual assistance and cooperation. If that is so, there can be no valid reason why Brisbane should not be made a port of call for the mail steamers. Indeed, ^1 would suggest that they should go a little further north than Brisbane, and touch at Rockhampton. There is up there a very rich district which is only awaiting increased facilities for export to be capable of sending away .a very large quantity of produce of various kinds. I find that Queensland&#39;s contribution to the subsidy amounts to nearly &#163;10,000, and all the benefit which that State is to derive from that expenditure is that her letters will be forwarded from Adelaide. So far as Queensland is concerned the service does not go beyond Adelaide. </para>

            <para>- That may be so, and my desire is that Western Australia shall go on and prosper. That, however, is no reason why Queensland should be- subjected to any inferiority. She is one of the great States of the Commonwealth. She is third in point of population, and second in point of size. Indeed the country available for occupation in Queensland is larger than in any of the other States. That being the case, I think it would be good policy and good business on the part of the Commonwealth Government to include that State in the mail circuit. I therefore bring the matter under the notice of the Minister in charge with the greatest confidence. I understand that a very large public meeting was held in Brisbane only last night in support of this proposal. Meetings have also been held in support of it in Rockhampton, Townsville, and Charters Towers. There is a very generally expressed wish on the part of the Queensland people that they should participate in this mail service. I am quite sure that the people of that State will gladly consent to increase their contribution if that should be found necessary. There is another matter to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Government. When the Electoral Bill was passing through this Chamber members of the Senate insisted that the electors should have the same facilities in voting for candidates for the Senate as were given to them in voting for candidates for the House of Representatives. In voting for candidates for the House of Representatives an elector can vote anywhere within his own electorate. We claim that the same right should be given to electors voting for candidates for the Senate, and that they should therefore be permitted to vote anywhere within a State. That was allowed at the last Federal elections in three of the States, Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland, and very few cases of personation were discovered. The Commonwealth Electoral Act gives power to the Government to make regulations providing facilities for this being done. The late Vice-President of the Executive Council gave us a distinct promise on behalf of the Government that regulations permitting an elector to vote anywhere in a State for a senatorial candidate would be framed. I understand that they have not yet been formulated. Surely it is high time they were. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is opposed to giving these facilities, but the right honorable gentleman is in his present position not to carry out his own wishes, but to do what the Act provides shall be done, what the Government has distinctly promised, and what public opinion demands shall be done. I can assure the Minister representing the Government in this Chamber that if this is not provided for very great dissatisfaction will arise in my State, and a very large number of the electors of Queensland will be disfranchised. I know that the objection raised in some quarters to the proposal is that it will have the effect of -making personation more easy. Unfortunately it would appear to be impossible to entirely abolish personation, but why should we take up the position that, because a few persons &#39;may offend against the law by per-  sonating,  we should therefore disfranchise a large number of honest people who would never think of doing such a thing ? Our laws are made for the honest and not for the dishonest, and I submit that it may be much better that a dozen persons should be allowed facilities to personate than that probably a couple of thousand persons should be denied the opportunity of voting. Therefore I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to bring the matter before the notice of the </para>

          <para>- I desire to say a few words on a question which is almost of supreme importance to the State I represent. I refer to a survey of the route of the transcontinental railway. Now that we have a VicePresident of the Executive Council who knows something about this matter, I feel that the position is improving all the while. I think we are entitled to ask for the authorization of a trial survey before the session is closed. The States EngineersinChief were appointed by the Government to report on this very important question. These gentlemen were all highly qualified to express an impartial opinion ; and in view of the rosy complexion of their report the Government ought to provide a sufficient sum for carrying out a survey. </para>

We have every right to claim that the logical sequence of the impartial report of the States EngineersinChief is a survey of the line. I desire to know if the Government intend to take any immediate step in that direction. In the life of this Parliament every State except Western Australia has derived a benefit of some kind from the Federation ; it still remains the Cinderella of the group.

Would not persons who are earning their living outside the Public Service be quite satisfied to get their pay within twenty-four hours of its being due <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> No great harm would be done by letting public officers wait twenty-four hours for their salaries. It will create a precedent if we rush this measure through the . Senate with about half - a - dozen senators in attendance. The Government should have given more reasons than they have done before they asked the Senate to take this step. </para>

            <para>- The membership of the Legislative Council is more numerous than that of the Senate, but no great difficulty in regard to ventilation was ever experienced while the Council met here. My difficulty as  President  was to keep the chamber warm enough. Before resuming my seat I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister another matter which requires our consideration. I find that, during the discussion of this year&#39;s Estimates in another place, statements were made and decisions were arrived at which placed the officers of the Senate in an invidious position as compared with the officers of the House of Representatives. I fail to see why treatment should be accorded one set of officers which is not accorded to another. The salaries of our officers have been reduced, and the statement has been made very freely that they have less work to perform than have the officers of another place, and that they should, therefore, receive a smaller remuneration. The question should not be dealt with in that way. If any reductions are to be made in the salaries of our officers the Senate should be consulted. If honorable senators give a moment&#39;s consideration to the question, they will readily see what may follow. At some time or other a difference of opinion might occur between the two Houses, and as another place votes supply, it might in such circumstances reduce the salary of every one of our officers, from the  President  downwards, by ten per cent. That should not be possible. A certain sum of money should be passed <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> for the Senate, and should be disbursed by the proper officers according to a schedule prepared either by the Senate or by a committee of honorable senators. Unless honorable senators take care to prevent such an invasion of their rights as this appears to be, they will bitterly rue their neglect. Some day the two Houses may come into conflict on a point of this kind, but by the exercise of ordinary prudence  such  a difficulty should be impossible. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - This is a matter which I intended to bring before the Senate when the Appropriation Bill came up  for consideration. I understand that the reductions referred to by the honorable senator were made on the plea that the officers of the Senate have not so much work to do as have the officers of the House of Representatives. In the first place I am not at all sure that that statement is correct. The refreshment rooms, the Queen&#39;s Hall, and other parts of the building which are common to the members of both Houses, are under the jurisdiction of the joint House Committee, and the officers of the Senate are the officers of that Committee. In the House of Representatives there are three more officers than there ale in the Senate. We have the  Clerk  of the Papers and Accountant at &#163;380, and a shorthand &#39;writer and typist at &#163;188, or &#163;568 in all ; whereas, in the House of Representatives they have the  Clerk  of the Papers and Accountant at &#163;420, the  Clerk  of the Records at &#163;350, the Assistant  Clerk  of Committees and Reading  Clerk  at &#163;300, the Assistant Reading  Clerk  at &#163;-200, and a junior clerk at &#163;80, or a total of &#163;1,350.

          <para>- I have heard senators continually assert that the Senate is not to be compared with a Legislative Council, and those who have knowledge of the work done here know that both senators and officers have a great deal more to do than the members and officers of the Legislative Council of Victoria, which formerly occupied this part of the building. I understand, however, that the salaries and wages of the officers and attendants of the Senate and House of Representatives were arranged as though the relative positions of the Senate and the House of Representatives were the same as the relative positions of the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, which was a wrong basis upon which to arrange them. Although the House of Representatives may not have reduced their salaries, I think those who wish to maintain the prestige and position of the Senate should see that consideration is paid to the greater amount of work done by our officers and attendants. I hope that when the Estimates are under discussion the opinion of the Senate will be expressed upon this question. </para>

I think . that the State of Queensland has not been fairly dealt with by the Government, and I should like to feel sure that there is not some influence in the Cabinet which is being used against that State in this matter. To my mind, there is no reason why the mail steamers should not call at Brisbane. Honorable senators may be influenced by the argument that they cannot afford the time to do so, but business men will admit that nowadays there is not so much urgency in regard to the carrying of mails as there was formerly, because all urgent business is done by means of cablegrams, and letters are chiefly confirmatory of the messages which have been sent by cable. </para>

            <para>- It is only fair to Queensland that she should share in the carrying facilities provided by the Commonwealth Government. There has been established in Queensland within the last few years what is practically a new industry - the dairying industry. A few years ago the farmers looked upon dairying almost as a means for making pin money for their wives. How they get &#163;20 or &#163;30 a month from their dairies. It is their mainstay, and has worked quite a revolution in their condition.. Millions of money have been spent in improving the channel of the Brisbane River in order to enable the largest steamers to go up to the wharf at Pinkenbah, which is 7&#189; miles distant from Brisbane proper, and, therefore, there should be no difficulty in accommodating the mail steamers, if the Government will only compel them to call. It is very unfair to single out the port of Brisbane, and call for tenders in a special way. </para>

            <para>- No ; a port of call only. When tenders were called, Brisbane was placed at a disadvantage, because the steam-ship companies were asked to send in alternative tenders, one of which would omit Brisbane from consideration. Now, the greatest indignation prevails in Brisbane. A meeting held there last night, and attended by representatives of all parties in the State, condemned the action of the Government. I would ask the Attorney-General whether the grievances of Queensland cannot be redressed even at this stage. I cannot help thinking that some influence adverse to Queensland is at work in the Cabinet. Human nature is human nature all the world over, even in Cabinets, as we have seen from recent developments. The Federal spirit is not predominant at the present time, and certain State influences aire at work to deprive Queensland of her rights. We cannot afford to overlook this matter, and although the Government seem disposed to pay very little attention to the Senate, they will some day find our assistance lacking when they most require it. They are piling up a number of political crimes which will call for punishment later on. It may be true that the Senatecan bark but cannot bite. But at the same time we could place the Government in a very awkward position by rejecting Supply Bills or other equally essential measures. I should imagine, from the way that the members of the Government in. another place treat this Chamber, that they do not attach very much importance to what we may think or do, and it may be necessary to take some strong action in order to show them that we are entitled to some voice in the affairs of the Commonwealth. I think that the Senate is more in touch with the people of Australia than is the House of Representatives, because we represent the States as a whole instead of divisions of the States. Therefore, we are entitled to a great deal. more respect and attention than we have hitherto received.- I should like the Attorney-General to reply to the questions I asked last evening with reference to the Pacific Cable and the message sent by the Governor-General to the Honorable Joseph Chamberlain. </para>

          <para>- I think that matters in connexion with the advertisements relating to the mail service have been misrepresented to the honorable senator and also to the people in Brisbane, who have been complaining of the action of the Government. I can assure the honorable senator that there is no hostility towards Queensland on the part of the .members of the Cabinet. That particular portion of the advertisement relating to tenders to which he has referred has not been altered in any way .from its original form. Nearly the whole of our mail contracts will expire about the time at which the proposed new services will begin, and therefore an opportunity is afforded to secure offers from the shipping companies for almost every kind of mail service that would  be of  use to us. If honorable senators read the advertisements they will see that we are asking the shipping companies to furnish us with alternative tenders under almost every conceivable condition as to route and ports of call.  Weare inviting tenders for a service  from Sydney <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Colombo or Aden, for a service simply to Colombo or Aden, for a service from eastern ports, from Brisbane, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Vancouver and also from some port in Australia by any route to England. We have purposely made the invitation as wide as possible in order to secure every variety of offer, and thus extend our choice. </para>

            <para>- The advertisements are drawn up in such a way as to leave an opportunity for the shipping companies to tender, in almost every conceivable form, for a service from Australia to England. With regard to the service hitherto maintained by the P. and O. Company, we are asking for tenders, as before, from Sydney ma ports, and also, as an alternative, we are inviting the companies to state what additional cost would be involved if the steamers were required to go on from Sydney to Brisbane. That seems to me to be very fair. If the  shipping companies  respond toom advertisements, we shall know exactly what services we can secure, and be able to judge which will be the most advantageous in view of the expenditure involved. I cannot see that there is anything unreasonable in that. We are inviting tenders for a service from Brisbane to Vancouver. We do not say anything in that connexion with regard to a service from Albany or Fremantle. We are inviting tenders for services going in the other direction from particular ports, and in fact we are affording the companies an opportunity to tender for a service from almost any port, and by any route they like, including the Cape and Torres Straits. What reasonable ground is there for the complaint made by some people in Brisbane ? We are inquiring as to the cost that would be involved in extending the service from Sydney to Brisbane. Is there any reason why we should not ascertain that ? We might not be able to afford to pay the extra money, or we might discover some more efficient way of carrying on a mail service from the eastern ports. The position taken up by some people in Brisbane is that we should not allow the shipping companies to submit any tenders except for a mail service which would include Brisbane as a port of call. That is not reasonable. </para>

            <para>- Surely the honorable senator does not suppose that the shipping companies will perform extra work without extra payment. We have not found any shipping companies ready to do so. If honorable senators will turn to the advertisement and read it for themselves they will see that we have made the conditions so _ wide that we can obtain tenders for every possible service that could be of use to us. It will be for the Executive afterwards to decide what proposals they will accept. </para>

            <para>- They are alternative to such an extent as to make them as wide as possible. I hope honorable senators will obtain copies of the advertisement calling for tenders and read it. They will then see that no injustice has been done to Queensland. At all events I say distinctly that the supposition that there is in the Cabinet any hostile feeling to Brisbane is absolutely baseless. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> desires me to go into the other matter to which he has referred. I made preparations to do so, and am having inquiries made in connexion with everything which has been brought up. But we shall have the Appropriation Bill before us next week or the week after, and I propose to postpone my reply upon the matters alluded to on the motion for the first reading of this Bill until the Appropriation Bill is before us. There is only one matter which I ought to mention in fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> It has reference to the motion which was carried in the Senate with regard to the telegram, sent by the Governor-General to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> I take all the responsibility for allowing that motion to be passed in the form in which it was passed without challenge. I did not happen to be at the table at the moment. But I wish to point out that the motion was not in the .proper form. I do not think the honorable senator is acting in the best taste in asking for the  cablegram ; but the proper form of asking for anything that is in the possession of the Governor-General is by means of an address. The motion in question should have taken that form. I do not think the honorable senator is right in asking for the cablegram ; but, in any case, it is a well-known fact that the proper form in reference to such matters is that a minute goes from the Prime Minister to the Governor-General, and the minute is transmitted to London. I do not think the honorable senator is justified in implying a distrust as to the way the minute was transmitted. 11 d </para>

          <para>- There is one subject which I should like to bring under the notice of the Government in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department. It is a subject that has not been mentioned this session. I allude to the fact that we, as a Commonwealth, are out of harmony with the entire British Empire in connexion with the penny postage system. There is no Government under the King that maintains the old-fashioned idea of charging for every letter that is sent to or received from England at the rate of 2&#163;d. It will be remembered that when Canada started the penny postage system some years ago there was a loss for the first nine months, but since then the revenue has increased by leaps and bounds. If we turn to India, to Ceylon, to Fiji, to New Zealand, or to* any other British dependency on the globe, we find that one uniform penny postage rate prevails. This is a matter which the Federal Government ought to look into very closely. Although at the commencement of a penny postage system there might be a slight loss, nevertheless, the increase in the correspondence carried would be so great that, in two or three years, the loss would be completely overtaken. I say so much, because we are supposed to represent the most energetic portion &#39;of the British Empire. We are descendants of the bold spirits who came here after the discovery of gold, and we ought not to lag so far behind in a matter of this kind. I wish the Government to take the subject into their serious consideration, and to look into all the figures, so that an alteration may be made, and- that we may be brought into conformity with the rest of the British Empire. </para>

          <para>- No; it was a letter containing a request that the GovernorGeneral would cable, asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> if he still pressed for a Conference. Then we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> reply cable of the 27 th August, which amounted to fifteen or twenty lines, and dealt with a variety of matters other than the mere request contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton&#39;s letter to the Governor-General. That shows, to my mind, that the Government advised the Governor-General, probably by word of mouth, as to the terms of the communication sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> who, in his reply, said that it was possible the matter had gone too far for the Commonwealth to recede. How did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> come to send that reply, unless there was some suggestion in the cablegram of the GovernorGeneral that the matter had gone too far ? If it was possible to produce the cablegram of .the 27th March, 1903, why is it not possible to produce the cablegram sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> on the 21st August of this year? I have no wish to reflect on the Governor-General, who simply carries out the instructions of the Ministry ; but the latter have adopted such an extraordinary attitude that honorable senators have, a right to see all the papers connected with the matter. </para>

          <para>-r- I am perfectly sure that the proper course by which to approach the Governor-General is by an address, but I shall inquire into the matter more fully. I see by the correspondence referred to that the Government have laid on the table telegrams which passed between the GovernorGeneral and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and, perhaps, there may be no objection to a similar course being adopted in regard to other communications. </para>
