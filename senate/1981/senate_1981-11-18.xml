<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised-that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing. Therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All pension and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the national average male earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Removal of the means/income test on the Pensioner Health Benefit imposed by Federal legislation in 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> Reintroduction of Medibank; in so doing restore all Australians to equity of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To alleviate Australia's shortage of housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government immediately inject $200m into State housing authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Fees</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criterion for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50 per cent of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example, thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22 per cent of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to questions previously asked by Senator Puplick on 26 February and by me on 12 March relating to the importation of gold chain. The Industries Assistance Commission, in report No. 274 dated 6 August and entitled 'Chain of precious metal', has recommended that the duty on chain falling under tariff item 71.14 and currently dutiable at 2 per cent be subject to duty at 25 per cent, which is the same level as is applied to chain jewellery which falls within item 71.12.9. The report also recommends a review of the whole industry in 1986. Will the Minister advise whether the Government will accept the report of the IAC and, if so, whether speedy implementation can be made of the recommendation to lift duty under tariff item 71.14 from 2 per cent to 25 per cent to prevent some importers from taking advantage of what seems to be an anomaly in tariff provisions covering the importation of gold chain?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the questions on this subject that were asked by Senator Puplick some six months ago and earlier by Senator Thomas. It is true that the Industries Assistance Commission did recommend a change in the rate of duty applicable to precious metal chain-2 per cent-as distinct from that chain which constitutes jewellery, to which a tariff of some 25 per cent applies. The Government has decided to accept the recommendation in the report and has applied the higher rate to precious metal chain since 30 October. I understand that that was the date upon which the announcement was made. I will check for the information of the honourable senator whether that was the actual date of implementation of the new decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the Minister also confirm that this increase in mortgage interest rates has cost persons, with the common 30-year $30,000 home loan, $65 a month while average weekly earnings have increased in the same period by just over $30 a month? I refer the Minister to statistics which show that in the December quarter of 1975, when average weekly earnings were $167 a week and the median house price in Sydney was $33,500, the value of a house was 200 times average weekly earnings, whereas for the same quarter in 1981 it was 283 times average weekly earnings?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A great deal of information and many figures were given in the question. I am not able to confirm the accuracy of the figures expressed by Senator Bolkus. However, he did make comparisons of figures over the last five years for income levels and the repayments that are required to be made. Again, I am not able to verify the figures that he presented. Although we are concerned about the level of interest rates, there are some interesting statistics which show, in relation to the repayments that need to be made by prospective home buyers, that the prices of both houses and land have increased considerably. The proportion of income that is reflected in repayments related to those costs should also be of concern to us all, quite separately from the interest rate problem. The matter of home ownership is of primary importance to this Government and I think of concern to all Australians who wish to see that there is the capacity for home ownership by as many families in this country as is possible. Our record in this country is significant in comparison with other countries. However, I will ask the Treasurer to look at the figures and the facts that have been provided by the honourable senator and see what information can be given in response to them. But I suggest that he might, if he is interested in figures, analyse what has happened to the price of land and the price of building houses as well as look at interest rates, in considering the incidence of the increase in repayments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the Campbell report, my colleague the Treasurer made it clear yesterday that this report is under study by a committee which will work on the report for the Government. Before any decisions are taken on that report the Government will, of course, have in its own mind its social policies and its political approach to many of the things that have become established policy in this country. I think we should await the outcome of that study and the Government's response to the Campbell report before we draw the sorts of conclusions that people seem to have been drawing in the last 24 hours or so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that tuberculosis used to be a notifiable disease. It certainly was at the time I was involved in the care of patients with this illness. I know of no reason why it would not continue to be notifiable. I am aware, of course, that it has diminished considerably as a health risk in this country. I am also aware that in 1976 the Government handed control of tuberculosis to the States. The special Commonwealth program that began in 1949 made Australia the country at that stage with the best control of tuberculosis in the world. It was thought appropriate at that stage to hand control of tuberculosis to the States, which have direct management of hospital and other services. I am not aware of any significant increase in the figures for tuberculosis since 1971. In that year there were 11.6 new cases per 100,000 and in 1980 the figure was 10.7 new cases per 100,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was referring to unemployed persons, for example, and figures of 20 to 30 per cent are quite obviously incorrect and outrageous. The population in Australia is ageing and it may be that there could still be some detection of people who have had long standing tuberculosis. Age rates for tuberculosis were first collected in 1975, and the rates then for elderly people, say between 65 and 70 years old, were about 7.5 per 100,000. In 1980 that figure was 21.4 per 100,000. But I emphasise again that the overall figures in Australia are not rising. There is no evidence of any increased incidence of tuberculosis. I repeat that we achieved the best figures in the world by dint of a very active program.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Government aware of reports that the Bjelke-Petersen Government is presently considering a proposal that would make Queensland an on-shore stamp duty haven with the State forgoing around $280m a year in revenue in a move designed to have businesses from around Australia stampeding into Queensland to consummate their transactions? What is the Government's attitude not only to the national economic implications of any such move but also more particularly to the inequities and distortions that any such change, such as the competitive phasing out of probate duty before it, would inevitably introduce into the present national tax collection and revenue distribution arrangements? Will the Government take measures to dissuade Queensland from any such move-for example, responding to the State's apparent willingness to forgo some revenue by reducing the Commonwealth general purpose grants otherwise payable to that State?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the last part of the question is asking whether we would use the tax revenue sharing device as a punitive weapon, the answer is no. Also, I would reject the concept that it was a bad thing to phase out probate duties. I imagine that every family in Australia welcomes the fact that probate duties were phased out. From time to time there will inevitably be competition between the States as to methods of incentive to stimulate business within the States. It would not be the task of a Commonwealth government to decide what a sovereign State government might or might not do. That is the kind of paternalism of the socialists, which we reject. I am not aware of the proposal to set aside stamp duty. I will have a look at the matter. But I imagine that the Commonwealth Government would regard that as something that was a proper decision for a State to make. The taxing abilities of the States and the way in which they raise their revenue is taken into account by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. In the end, overall adjustments are made, particularly in the longer run, with Queensland which has been a claimant State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have some information relating to political prisoners in Uganda. Some of Senator Coleman's questions may have to be referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Press reports published concerning political prisoners in Uganda have led the Minister for Foreign Affairs to state that if these reports are verified this would be a matter of grave concern to the international community, including Australia. The Government attaches importance to the protection of human rights and is concerned about reports of violations of those rights wherever they may occur. Australia has sought to monitor developments in Uganda since the elections in December 1980 which resulted in the return of Dr Obote to the Ugandan leadership. Australia is sympathetic to the immense problems confronted by Dr Obote's Government in restoring Uganda to its former peace and prosperity. Progress has been slow but there are indications that the Government is making some headway in its efforts to re-establish law and order and to overcome the serious economic difficulties which confront the Government after years of misrule and chronic violence. It is our earnest hope that the Ugandan Government will be able to continue to make progress and to overcome its current difficulties without resorting to harsh and repressive measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that he has instructed the Australian High Commission in Nairobi to make inquiries concerning these reports, which were the ones mentioned by Senator Coleman, during the next visit to Uganda by Australian representatives. I might also add that within the context of our aid program in Africa, Australia is doing what it can to assist the Ugandan Government's efforts. We participated in the Commonwealth group which observed the Ugandan elections. In April this year the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that Australia would provide $1.5m in famine relief and more recently, following discussions held with Ugandan officials at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Government decided to provide additional assistance to Uganda in the form of food aid and commodity support to the value of $2.4m. The Government is currently examining possible additional assistance to Uganda. As I said, with regard to some of the more specific matters raised by Senator Coleman, I will see what early information I can have provided for her.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the potential value of the porta-printer device for the profoundly deaf. It is a device which can be attached to a normal telephone and which provides a printout. It is, therefore, something which can greatly expand the communications ability of those who suffer from profound deafness. The value of the machines depends upon there being a network of them. A single porta-printer is of no use. It has to work in conjunction with a porta-printer which is at the other end of the telephone call. As a contribution to establishing a network of porta-printer devices at useful centres, my Department has taken the initiative of installing a porta-printer at an office of the Department in each State and is arranging to centralise the records of the profoundly deaf at that office so that all profoundly deaf clients of the Department, if they have the porta-printer device, will be able to access into my Department. We have drawn this development to the attention of other Commonwealth departments. I hope that other departments will be able to make similar provision in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have also examined the point which was specifically raised by the honourable senator; that is, the availability of the device to individual people who are profoundly deaf. My recollection is that at the moment the cost of installation is of the order of $900. I do understand that that can be a very considerable cost for many people who are disabled. At the moment the only people who qualify for assistance through the Department of Social Security are those who are receiving assistance through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service; that means people who are getting assistance with a view to increasing their employability. There is no general program which would provide a subsidy for the machine to be obtained by others. Again I speak from recollection, but the last step taken by me was to raise the matter with the Minister for Health, who has responsibility for the Aids for the Disabled Program which was recently instituted by the Commonwealth. Many honourable senators would be aware that that program is still to go into operation in New South Wales. It is in operation in other States. It is very early in the life of that program, but I have drawn the particular mechanism to the attention of the Minister for Health and have asked him to examine whether assistance might be provided with respect to its being obtained by individuals in the community.</PARA>

Is it a fact that presently only 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of road stock is being replaced under the present funding programs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not have available to it any independent source of information to confirm the points raised by Senator Jessop and referred to by the Australian Automobile Dealers Association yesterday. However, the Minister has indicated his awareness of the claim that the Australian road system is becoming increasingly inadequate to handle current and projected traffic demands. Relevant studies are being undertaken at present by the Bureau of Transport Economics. Negotiations and discussions are being undertaken with the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities. There are a number of factors which combine to make the problem of financing road transport and development in Australia a very difficult one. The Minister has indicated that he cannot accept that any shortfall in funding for roads is wholly attributable to the Commonwealth Government and its particular programs at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true to say that all three levels of government do have a role, and have accepted that role over a long period. The Commonwealth is presently committed to a five-year program of road assistance to the States totalling $3,650m between 1980-81 and 1984-85. No State government has yet made any long term commitment of that kind to road funding. The Commonwealth believes its commitment to be significant in the light of the overriding need to limit public sector spending in order to control inflation. Moreover, in recent times, since 1976, the Commonwealth has provided substantially increased general revenue assistance to State and local government. This has substantially enhanced the capacity of local government, in accordance with its own priorities, to increase expenditure on those parts of the road system for which State governments and local authorities are primarily responsible. The Commonwealth Government is demonstrating clearly its approach from the national point of view and realising its priorities in this particular area. It encourages governments in the other spheres to take their priorities seriously also and to ensure the development and maintenance of a road system that is of adequate quality and, in fact, meets the projected traffic demands of Australia.</PARA>

Mr Viner and I constitute a committee, if that is what it could be called, and consult each other, and the Minister concerned, on some of these recommendations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report of the Senate Standing Committee. I read it with some pleasure. I note that it referred to problems with vitamin intake and the need for some control over some vitamin-I cannot say prescribing-use. I understand that control over the addition of vitamins and minerals to food is very definitely the responsibility of State and Territory legislatures and of their regulations. I think it is administered through their health commissions. Nevertheless, there is a role for the National Health and Medical Research Council in offering advice to these commissions, acting, as it does, on behalf of all the different health commissions throughout Australia. I understand that a working party of the NHMRC is currently reviewing the NHMRC standard for vitamins and minerals in food to ensure that the addition of vitamins and minerals is appropriate to particular foods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Elstob's concern, I think, would be that some of the B vitamins might be wasted and that vitamin A additions, if taken in excess, could actually be dangerous. I am advised that in April 1980 the National Therapeutic Goods Committee and the Foods Standards Committee of the NHMRC agreed to develop a standard for vitamin and mineral preparations. I think this came out last night in the consideration of Estimates. The first draft of that standard, after being widely disseminated to all interested parties, has been withdrawn now to allow formulation of a second draft which will also be circulated for comment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked to clarify the question of whether tax had been taken into consideration in the West German study of brown and black coal in Australia and in the reports that had been prepared. I am advised that the summary report refers to two distinct methods for evaluation of what is called discounted cash flow rates of return-DCFROR. The first is the economic rate of return and the second the financial rate of return. The economic rate of return, according to the German companies, is intended to reflect the return on the project from the point of view of the nation as a whole. It is based on exclusion of all taxes and import duty which are argued to be transfer payments which in no way diminish the national economic benefit of the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The financial rate of return, on the other hand, is intended to reflect the real after tax return on the project which will be the basis for any commercial development by the private sector and which includes the consideration of taxation and import duty. The main results of the two analyses are summarised for the three plants as follows. The economic DCFROR in New South Wales is 16.6 per cent, in Queensland 17.6 per cent and in Victoria 21.4 per cent. The financial DCFROR in New South Wales is 4.4 per cent, in Queensland 4.6 per cent and in Victoria 7.3 per cent. The Press statement attachments referred specifically to the real after tax DCFROR in the range 4.4 per cent to 7.3 per cent which, while promising to the extent that they appeared to provide a worthwhile basis for further co-operation between Australia and the Federal Republic of Germany, are not in themselves sufficient to justify commercial development.

The fact that he is a Labor senator makes it no less proper that I should try to get a proper answer for him.

The matter of whether Ministers have been informed prior to questions being asked has been raised in this chamber many times. As I understand the situation there is general agreement in this chamber that honourable senators who wish to receive information can approach the Minister concerned. This practice was referred to by Senator Peter Baume today. With regard to the other point that Senator McLaren raised, I have also suggested to honourable senators on the other side of the chamber that in cases where an honourable senator seeks a lot of information which on many occasions would be nigh on impossible for a Minister to have with him or her at the time I invite-I emphasise that word-that Minister to place the question on notice. I have not directed that that should be done.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 November Senator Foreman asked me a question without notice concerning housing loans. I now have some information for him. The decline in lending by permanent building societies during 1981 was from the near record levels of the previous year. Since early this year, societies have generally faced a low funds intake and a liquidity rundown. This situation has now improved. A considerable lift in societies' funds intake in recent months and a restoration of their liquidity position have improved their prospects for achieving an increase in lending throughout the current financial year. In fact, societies in some States are now taking steps to attract borrowers to take up the funds available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the effects of the strong competition for household savings on lending institutions, the Government's firm objective is to see an adequate availability of housing finance to credit-worthy borrowers. In 1980-81 a strong lending performance by savings and trading banks cushioned, to a large extent, the decline in lending by permanent building societies. This fall in lending by societies reflects, in part, unrealistic ceilings imposed by some State governments on interest rates paid to investors.</PARA>
<PARA> Dwelling commencement statistics confirm that overall activity in the housing industry grew strongly in 1980-81. Final figures for the year should reveal that total commencements in 1980-81 will be around 148,000, the highest level recorded since 1973-74. The Government is nevertheless concerned about the problems being faced by prospective home owners. A review is currently underway to examine closely the problems being caused by the current level of housing interest rates. The review will determine whether the Government is getting value for money from its current programs and will also examine the need for new home ownership assistance measures. A wide range of options for assistance will be considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. It was reported, or at least strongly implied, in several of yesterday's newspapers that an important recommendation in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System-the Campbell report-had been leaked either by me or by my office, namely, that portion dealing with proposed deregulation of home interest rates. These newspapers included the Melbourne Age, the Melbourne Sun, the Adelaide Advertiser, the Brisbane Courier-Mail, and the Hobart Mercury. I leave aside the scurrilous piece in the Sydney Daily Telegraph as it is presently being forwarded to my legal advisers for advice. Two of the authors of these stories were Lorenzo Boccabella of the Age who wrote that 'Senator Chipp appears to have broken an embargo placed on the release of the Federal Government's Campbell report . . .', and Wallace Brown of the Courier-Mail who said that Senator Chipp had 'in effect leaked the recommendation'. I wish to make it perfectly clear that neither I nor any other Democrat senator or staff member leaked any part of the Campbell report. My Press release of last Monday was based purely on months of obviously informed speculation in the financial Press and in Parliament House that the Campbell committee was certain to propose the immediate deregulation of home interest rates. There was not one senator or member of the other place who did not know just that. Indeed, this recommendation was one of the most open secrets circulating in Canberra about any report which was yet to be tabled that I can remember.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No staff member of mine examined our embargoed copies of the Campbell report until after my Press statement had been issued. Further, no staff member reported any of the contents of the Campbell report to me until 9.30 p.m. on Monday, whereas my Press statement was issued about nine hours earlier. I did not see the report or any copy of it until the next day. Both of the gentlemen mentioned, namely Boccabella and Brown, have my home telephone number. I was home all evening. The facts of this matter could have been easily ascertained by direct reference to me. To my knowledge my home telephone number is also in the possession of every single member of the Press Gallery who could have ascertained the facts of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Some journalists often show that they have very thin skins in relation to criticism of their integrity or competence. Yet at times like this a small section of them do not think twice about impugning the integrity of a member or a senator without making the slightest check as to the accuracy of their stories. I find it highly regrettable, to say the least, that some journalists and some newspapers have seen fit to report the matter in this way when the truth of this matter would have been so easy for them to determine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Interest rates will fall by 2 per cent over the coming year. It is a target that can and will be met'. So asserted the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in November 1977. At the time he asserted that, interest rates generally-it is not possible to quote a specific figure because there are variations in the rate of interest on borrowings for various purposes between States and between different institutions-were around 10 per cent. Far from falling by 2 per cent as the Prime Minister had promised-'it is a target that can and will be met', he said-interest rates in fact have risen from the general level of 10 per cent prevailing at that time to 13 per cent and 14 per cent today. The effect of an increase in interest rates from 10 per cent to 14 per cent for somebody with a $30,000 housing loan repayable over 30 years is to increase the monthly payments from $265 to $357. That is an increase of $92 a month. Some people have avoided an increase of as much as 4 per cent and have got away with an increase of 3 per cent. For them the figure is somewhat lower-in the vicinity of $70 a month. But everyone with a housing loan of that magnitude on those terms has had his weekly repayments increased by around $20. One million Australians have housing loans of that type. They are squeezed. The effects have not stopped there. No family with an income significantly below average weekly earnings can obtain a loan. At current interest rates and required levels of repayment families in that category are excluded from the home purchase market unless they already have very substantial liquid assets. This, of course, has macro-economic ramifications which are beginning to show in a significant decline in approvals for finance for residential building and for commencements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that one very small group does still secure loans and interest rates of less than 10 per cent; indeed, at less than the 10 per cent minus 2 per cent which the Prime Minister promised four years ago. For example, the Prime Minister's wife and her relatives were the recipients, and are still the recipients, of a $50,000 loan at an interest rate of 4 1/2 per cent, granted under murky if not actually illegal circumstances by the Government of Victoria four years ago. Due to the diligence and industry of Senator McLaren-we are indebted to him for this-we have information that Mr Anthony secured a loan of $17,964, which was 95 per cent of the value of the property he was buying, at an interest rate of 4 3/4 per cent repayable over 45 years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Sibraa reminds me, the deposit was $36. For what is rental purchase of that house, Mr Anthony pays $80 a month. I am reliably informed that the commercial rent for a house of that type is in the vicinity of $100 a week. Mr Anthony's rental purchase payments are $80 a month. The $80 he pays is less than the increase in charges over the last three years for ordinary people. Also, Mr Anthony got a $320 a week pay rise this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is yet another remarkable aspect of this story. The loan which Mr Anthony was granted, and still has, was granted in 1964 by ministerial allocation-that is a technical term-by the then Minister for the Interior, who was Mr Anthony. It is a clear case of the Country Party helping itself. Mr Nixon has a loan of $30,352. He was advanced 95 per cent of the value of the property he bought at an interest rate of 6 1/4 per cent, again over 45 years. Because of the much higher value of the property and the somewhat higher interest rates, his monthly repayment-remember that it is rental purchase-is $168 a month; something less than half of what the typical Australian family pays for a loan of the same size. Yet the typical Australian family has an income of about 25 per cent of Mr Nixon's. That loan, too, was approved by ministerial allocation, in 1970, by the Minister for the Interior who was, would you believe, Peter Nixon. The Country Party helps itself again. It is true that at that time the rates of interest charged were not greatly below commercial rates and that other people, including politicians, also borrowed at around that time. However, I stress that all serving politicians other than those mentioned paid back their loans long ago. Only these two people have kept them. They are bludging on their fellow taxpayers. Mr Anthony still owes 84 per cent of his original debt; Mr Nixon owes 94 per cent of the original loan. They are living in houses part time under rental purchase arrangements for a tiny fraction of normal current commercial rent for houses of that calibre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And they do not pay tax on the subsidy. The Prime Minister should order them to return the properties to the taxpayers from whom they have filched, or at the very least order them to pay off the outstanding balance instead of continuing to bludge on their fellow taxpayers with interest rates significantly less than half prevailing commercial rates. Mr Sinclair, demonstrating again the propensity of the Country Party to hang together in times of trouble-these days it is always in trouble-has defended the actions of his fellow Ministers with these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Doug Anthony, Peter Nixon and I--</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sinclair also received a loan, which he has repaid-</PARA>
<PARA>received no different terms to those available to every other Canberra citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>Doug Anthony, Peter Nixon and Ian Sinclair are not and never were Canberra citizens. They exploited provisions made available to Canberra citizens and authorised loans for themselves, two of which are still outstanding. Only a tiny fraction of the principal has been repaid on each loan. They, themselves, authorised the loans that they still have. By ministerial allocation, the Country Party helps itself. The Prime Minister has refused to provide a guarantee that these same two or other Ministers are not simultaneously receiving almost 24 per cent interest from the Commonwealth on money that they have lodged with the Commonwealth, at the same time evading and avoiding their just taxation liabilities. A near-hysterical Country Party leader last Sunday claimed that these and other factual revelations constituted personal smears by what he called 'toads'. I understand he was almost frothing at the mouth at the time he made those allegations. His deputy leader attacked the journalists who published such facts. The wife of the closet Country Party Prime Minister, when the question of the loan to her and her relatives was raised, said that anyone who would raise such a question was lower than a snake's duodenum. </PARA>
<PARA> What this bunyip mafia is really asserting is its divine right to plunge its collective fist into the public till whenever it feels inclined. When these people are caught, they attack those who have blown the whistle on them. They tried the same tactics when the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations report on the Australian Dairy Corporation was tabled. It backfired on them very badly, I am pleased to report, and this will too. When there is a trail of scandal such as that left behind by the Country Party, left by this bunyip mafia, it is no surprise that someone discovers it. Indeed, a responsible Opposition would be negligent or worse if it failed to discover such a trail of scandal and to draw it to the attention of the public. Of course journalists who failed to publish revealed facts would be equally negligent. There may have been a sinister implication in Mr Anthony's expressions of admiration last week for the regime in Chile. In Chile, of course, journalists would not be allowed to publish that sort of information. One wonders whether the Country Party in its simultaneous expression of admiration for the Chilean regime and vilification of Australian journalists thought that adoption of some Chilean methods might be appropriate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser, Mr Anthony, Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon, almost the entire Cabinet, the Ministry and even the back bench of this Government are out of touch with reality and out of touch with the people. They should have been where I was last weekend talking to residents of a far northern beach suburb of Perth called Heathridge. It comprises about 250 houses which were occupied in quite a short time around two and a half years ago. Twenty-eight of those 250 houses are on the market because the occupiers can no longer maintain the payments to which they are committed and which have increased by around $80 a month or $20 a week because of the record interest rates of this Government. What is happening in Heathridge is being repeated in hundreds of similar areas right around Australia. That will sweep this Government from office whenever the next election is held. </PARA>
<PARA> Those not alienated by interest rates will be alienated by record taxation. The Prime Minister's promises on taxation are revealed as being as phoney as his promise on interest rates. In the heady days of 1975 and even in 1977 he used to say: 'We will end the great tax rip-off'. He promised to index the taxation scales every year to end what he used to call the secret tax of inflation. We do not hear very much about the secret tax of inflation since indexation was finally and completely buried four months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The aggregate of government tax collections is revealed, among other places, in Budget Paper No. 1 at page 273, which shows Budget receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product over the last 10 years. I cite the details for just two of those years. In 1975-76, the year of the last Labor Budget, taxes constituted 25.1 per cent of the GDP. That was a crippling level of taxation, according to Mr Fraser at the time. The estimate for this year, 1981-82, is that as a proportion of GDP taxes will be 27.5 per cent. So that is an increase from 25.1 per cent, which was allegedly an intolerable burden, to 27.5 per cent. They are the aggregate figures. Last year the Government imposed the highest ever levels of income tax. For wage and salary earners it is estimated that those record levels will rise another 22 per cent this year. In addition there is a crude oil levy that will yield about $3.5 billion a year. The Government has now widened and deepened indirect taxes with the notorious set of Bills which will raise an estimated $900m in a full year. In the same Budget that increased wage and salary earners' taxes by 22 per cent these notorious sales tax Bills were introduced in spite of the promise given by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 24 November last year, on one of many other occasions, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if there was an increase in indirect tax, it would be in the context of a reduction in personal tax. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact this massive increase in indirect tax-a 38 per cent increase in sales tax from both broadening and deepening sales tax-accompanied a 22 per cent increase in income tax on wage and salary earners. It is not only the aggregates. Within those aggregates the burden of taxation has been regressively redistributed. I do not have time in this discussion to go through many figures. On 13 October the Sydney Morning Herald published details derived from information supplied by Mr Risstrom which showed that in 1975-76 a family of four on a single income of 85 per cent of average weekly earnings paid 9 per cent of that income in tax. Now the same family pays 16 per cent of its income in tax-up 80 per cent. In 1975-76 a family of four on average weekly earnings with a single income paid 10 per cent of its income in tax. It now pays 18 per cent. That family's tax is also up 80 per cent. These single income families are the very families which this Government purports to be concerned about. All taxpayers with current incomes below $16,500-that is, more than 70 per cent of all taxpayers-paid a higher proportion of their income in tax in 1980-81 than they did in 1975-76. Those wage earners will pay 22 per cent more this year. There is no doubt that within the next 12 months something called tax cuts will be reintroduced. They will not be real tax cuts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to debate the matter of public importance that was brought forward today by Senator Walsh in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crippling burden placed on Australian families by the record taxes and interest rates of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there can be few economic issues of greater importance to most Australian families than the level of taxation that they are required to pay and the interest rates on money which they borrow to sustain themselves. Given the importance of these matters I had hoped we might have heard a more considered contribution from the Opposition. There was no attempt by Senator Walsh to raise the discussion today above a repetition of his tired political slogans, personal abuse and assertions that he backs up by very selective statistics. I wonder how many times we are expected to listen to the obsessions of Senator Walsh on the matters that he continues to raise. He seems to have one or two speeches and we hear them regardless of the terms of the matters of public importance and regardless of which Bill we may be addressing or whatever matter may be before us. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Australian Labor Party that brought forward this matter today. There was not one proposal in what Senator Walsh had to say that would reduce the level of Government expenditure and the impact of that reduction on the tax that is required to be raised by the Government or do anything like meeting the requirements of government by trying to balance the Budget. The ALP opposition to the sales tax Bills, which were very briefly mentioned by Senator Walsh, included the expression by him and by others that the legislation increased the potential for income tax reductions. There seems to be some fear by Senator Walsh that there will be income tax reductions. Surely that is the very matter that we ought to consider to be in the favourable interest of Australian families. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Apparently Senator Walsh wishes to make two speeches-the one that he made officially and the one that he wishes to make by encroaching on the time of other speakers. Rather than proposing reductions in taxes, which I would have thought was the purpose of the matter of public importance, judging by recent media reports and by the discussions that we have had in the Senate, the Australian Labor Party has been developing proposals for new expenditure, and new types of taxes-all the things that would have adverse effects on the families in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Victoria we have a proposal for the introduction of probate and the various controversies within the Labor Party over the introduction of a capital gains tax. I could go on and on. We have everything except any proposals that would reduce expenditure and would put a government of any calibre in a position to be able to reduce taxation. In contrast to some previous occasions, Senator Walsh on this occasion was unusually reticent on ALP policies. He said nothing about his own policies on wealth taxes, capital taxes, probate duties or any other form of indirect tax that any Labor government could introduce. As I said, I think there was nothing in what was said that would give the vital impetus to a reduction in interest rates. What is the point of coming into this chamber again and again and debating interest rates if constructive policies are not being put forward in regard to them. In fact the debate on taxation and interest rates requires a much more serious treatment than we have heard today. The fact is that there is a fundamental difference between the ALP and the Liberal-National Country Party coalition Government on taxation and interest rate policy. For instance, in recent days we have had-I think probably we will have it again today-an example of Senator Walsh's desire to cut returns to farmers through the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme. That is one proposal on which he seems to be at variance with some of his party colleagues. Maybe we will hear further explanation of that matter from him later today. </PARA>
<PARA> The ALP spokesmen have made their position clear time and again; they believe in increasing public expenditure. Therefore, they must have the corollary to that which is that taxation levels must be increased. We never hear of any sort of effort to balance our income and our expenditure. Anyone who listens to the debates in this chamber would have no difficulty in identifying areas where the ALP thinks there ought to be greater expenditure. That party thinks we ought to lift spending on education, welfare, student allowances, arts and communications-on whatever services we may be discussing at the time. There is never a concrete proposal to look constructively at the requirements or priorities of government or with the recognition that ultimately these proposals need to be paid for by the Australian people. If there is an endless shopping list, such as the ALP has, then there can be only one consequence-higher taxation or higher deficits and higher inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been endlessly criticised by the Opposition for holding back the growth of government expenditure. Whenever we hear of contrasts to government expenditure we look at whether it is in real terms, whether it has increased or whether some effort has been made by government to reduce the rate of growth of government expenditure. We make no apology for that because it is crucial to our proposal to contain the expenditure of government in order to fulfil our other part of the policy, which is to reduce taxation and to reduce the burden that is placed on the Australian people. The Australian Labor Party's approach is quite clear. It is pointless for Senator Walsh, or any other Labor Party spokesman, to come into this place and to pretend that somehow we can have bigger government and reduced taxation. I think it ought to be placed on the record that there are other spokesmen for the Labor Party who are prepared to be more explicit on policies than Senator Walsh is prepared to be. I will cite firstly Mr Willis, the shadow Treasurer of the Labor Party, who spoke at a conference of Labor economists in 1978. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If Labor does not gain office next election then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector-and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the official policy of the Australian Labor Party. Its spokesman said: We are going to have a mammoth task by the mid-1980s, to rebuild the public sector to the level we all talk about. We are going to have trouble convincing the Australian electorate they have to pay for it. The public are not going to be so foolish as to imagine that the Labor Party can do the things it outlines time and again without their having to pay more for it. Mr Willis does not back away from the consequences of the ALP policies. He is quite explicit. I certainly reject that approach of increasing public sector spending and of increasing taxation. The Fraser Government rejects that approach. On three successive occasions the Australian community has rejected that approach of the Labor Party. There is no point in Senator Walsh coming into this chamber and trying to create the illusion that the ALP somehow supports reduced taxation on families when it has a platform binding every member of its party and every member of parliament to increase the role of the public sector and to increase taxation. That is the ALP policy. That is the policy that ought to have been spelt out today rather than the personal abuse, the selected quotes and the diatribe we hear again and again. I will cite the ALP policy with regard to taxation. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said this in his Chamberlain Memorial Lecture of 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> The challenge to traditional democratic socialism has been expressed in a number of deeply dispiriting doctrines. One example is the rapid spread of philosophy based on lower taxes and smaller government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition calls the doctrine of lower taxation and smaller government a deeply dispiriting doctrine. That is the policy that is such a disaster as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned. It might be dispiriting to him but I am sure it is not dispiriting to the community who have to meet the burden of tax and who have to look at the requirements of government, knowing they will have to pay for them. Mr Hayden has one view on the role of government and the need for higher taxation. He, at least, has the honesty to state it. The Chamberlain Memorial Lecture is important to the members of the Australian Labor Party and the people of the Labor movement. Mr Hayden was quite explicit as to what dispirited him about the rapid spread of the philosophy based on lower taxes and smaller government. That is a philosphy that is not only being spread throughout Australia, it is also being spread through many parts of the world. The requirement of people to have lower taxes and smaller government certainly is a great threat to the spread of democratic socialism as the people of the ALP would like to see it. Mr Hayden has the courage to recognise that there is a reaction in the community against higher taxation. He certainly has the capacity to express this philosophy based on lower taxes. He had the courage-perhaps he also had honesty-to express that idea because he was expressing it on behalf of his party. I think that we would have to say that Senator Walsh shows neither honesty nor courage in any of the statements that he makes in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The only honest way to argue for reduced taxation is to argue for a reduction in public expenditure and in the size of government. This is precisely the policy that the Fraser Government has pursued for the last six years. Under the Whitlam Government spending rose by an average real rate of some 10 per cent per annum while the Budget deficit grew to close to $4 billion. If we had persisted with that approach the Budget deficit would be almost $7.5 billion at present. That is a lot of money to be repaid by the Australian people. The plain fact is that in 1975-76, as in the immediately preceding years, the Budget deficit itself operated as a form of tax on the community. That is a matter that is ignored by Senator Walsh when he quotes from Budget Paper No. 1. The Budget deficit itself operated as a form of tax on the Australian community, and as a tax of the worst possible kind. It has not been easy for this Government to get rid of the very large accumulated deficit of the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been essential for us to do so because when money is printed, when there are deficits, there must be a day of reckoning. It is the present taxpayers of Australia who are paying for that. Senator Walsh apparently does not believe that Budget deficits have any consequences on levels of taxation and interest rates. His view would not be accepted by economists-even by economists of his own political persuasion. If we are to talk about tax I will say again that we do need to look at the Budget deficits as well as the tax raised in a particular year. On this particular point the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA>
<PARA> In considering the real burden imposed by Government on the community the deficit is as important as taxation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>-for the deficit must ultimately be paid for in one way or another . . . </PARA>
<PARA>-and in 1975, when we take into account both income tax and the burden of the deficit, the total burden from government spending on individuals was almost 18 cents in every dollar produced (income tax 12.7 cents, deficit 4.9 cents). </PARA>
<PARA>In that 1975 Budget, from which Senator Walsh chose to quote, that is the real figure he ought to be looking at: 18c in every dollar. Of that 18c, 12.7c was for tax. The remainder was for a deficit which the Labor Government was not prepared to fund. It was not prepared to raise that from the Australian people in that year; it left it to the future taxpaying population to pick up the responsibility. That was the figure in 1975: 18c in every dollar. We have reduced that to about 14c in the dollar: Income tax 14.1c and the deficit of 0.1 of a cent. It is worth recalling that Australian families have benefited also from the simplified system of a standard rate of tax. That reform was of the biggest proportional benefit to taxpayers who were on the lowest incomes. Other reforms included the abolition of the Commonwealth death and gift duties, an initiative which the Labor Party has always resisted and one which I understand it would reverse if it were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to talk about figures, let us have some figures and relate them to the percentage they represent of the gross domestic product. Under the ALP Commonwealth Budget outlays rose from 24 per cent to 30 per cent of gross domestic product. By trying to solve every problem by government spending and taxation, massive difficulties were created in the Australian economy. Unemployment and inflation were the most striking consequences of that approach. In contrast to those trends under the ALP Government, the rate of growth in Commonwealth spending has been reduced in real terms to a little over one per cent per annum since 1975-76. We have contained the growth of Commonwealth expenditure and have still provided additional funds for welfare and other essential areas of government responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent Budget real growth, after adjusting for the effect of an extra pay day for public servants and pensioners, was estimated at just under one per cent. Commonwealth spending has been wound back to representing about 27.5 per cent of gross domestic product. I suggest that honourable senators should contrast that figure with the 30 per cent it represented in the last Labor Budget. Restraint in Commonwealth expenditure is a very important part of the policy that ought to be related by the ALP to the matter of public importance it has brought forward today. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh mentioned very briefly taxation burdens on families, but he did not mention that real household disposable income increased by $2.7 billion last year and Budget forecasts indicate that in the current year another significant increase will occur in the incomes available to Australian households. The confidence of Australian families in this Government's policies are reflected in the sharp rise in private consumption expenditure. I do not think that even Senator Walsh would deny that a real increase is occurring in the level of retail sales. Those are statistical facts. I would have thought that that reflected improved incomes for families and confidence in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh did not mention that this Government has been able to create an additional 300,000 jobs in the last two years. He did not mention that it was about that number of jobs that the Labor Government managed to destroy in 1974 and 1975. I would have thought that those additional jobs that have been created-about 300,000 in two years-would have had an impact on the well-being of Australian families. Those jobs have been created in the private sector. They have increased to unprecedented levels the level of employment in this country. In the past two years we certainly have not seen the destruction of jobs that we saw during the years of the Labor Government, particularly during 1974 and 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Budget-this was not mentioned by Senator Walsh-the family allowance for families with three or more children was increased by 50 per cent. Perhaps those people who have large families would be the first to recognise that the family allowance has been of great assistance to them. It was perhaps also of note that in the last Budget-this was not mentioned by Senator Walsh-the spouse rebate was increased. In the years since the Labor Government the spouse rebate has been increased by about 90 per cent. There is little doubt that Australian families will benefit from the upsurge of investment activity occurring throughout the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Primmer can talk about any area of Australia he likes. I wonder whether Senator Walsh, when he visited the people with whom he spoke last week in the town he mentioned in Western Australia, talked of his Government's policies. I am sure that the people in Heathridge were concerned about their own difficulties, but I wonder whether Senator Walsh told them about the fact that Mr Hayden wants to increase government expenditure and is worried about whether the people will accept increased taxation. I wonder whether Senator Walsh told them that Mr Willis said there will be some difficulty in convincing the Australian community that to put into effect the Labor Party's policies there will have to be increased taxation. Mr Hayden and Mr Willis are two of the Labor Party's economic spokesmen and I have indicated just what they have said. I suggest that people will take more interest in what the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, and the Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, Mr Willis, say about these things than in the sort of speeches that we hear from Senator Walsh with monotonous regularity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh mentioned, in an indirect way, interest rates as they might affect Australian families. The Government has said on a number of occasions that interest rates are a matter of great concern. The economic policies of the Government are directed towards reducing inflation and taking the pressure off interest rates. One of the best contributions that any government can make to reduce the pressure on interest rates is to reduce its own borrowing requirements. That is why the Government has held back government expenditure, has reduced the deficit and has therefore reduced its demand on financial markets. The ALP's attitude to government spending and Budget deficits inevitably, if it were put into effect, would increase the pressure on interest rates to the detriment of all Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today there was a question about interest rates and how they affect home buyers. In my answer I mentioned, and I mention again, the fact that there are statistics that show us that by far the most disabling factor for potential home buyers in recent years has been not increases in interest rates but rather increases in the price of houses and land throughout Australia, particularly in the metropolitan area of a city such as Sydney. Because of the very rapid escalation of prices in that city, particular problems have been created for home buyers in that part of Australia. If the ALP has a particular concern about these matters, perhaps it ought to make representations to the Premier of New South Wales, for instance, with regard to some of the matters in which the State Government is concerned. The ALP ought also to look at whether interest rates are the only factor that is giving difficulty. The cost of housing, the cost of land and of servicing land are all instrumental in the rise in the cost of housing and the increase in the loan repayments. Mr Acting Deputy President, if the Labor Party felt it ought to be discussing these things, it should have chosen someone other than Senator Walsh to put the facts before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very gladly enter the debate in support of the proposition put forward by Senator Walsh. I remind the Senate-it needs reminding after the last 20 minutes-of the subject we are debating, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crippling burden placed on Australian families by the record taxes and interest rates of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We have just heard a hollow and inadequate response from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who was not even courteous enough to stay around for the response from the Opposition. We have heard a response to a situation for which the Government stands condemned not only on its performance but also, as was adequately put by Senator Walsh, on its promise. It is no little wonder that the response was inadequate. Less than two hours ago I asked the Minister, who has just concluded her speech and has vacated the Senate, a number of questions with respect to interest rates. They were very basic questions relating to the increase in interest rates and their effect on families and home buyers. The Minister's response was totally inadequate. She had no idea of the issues and ranted on about topics incidental to them. It is no wonder that the response from the Government lacked credibility, coming from a Minister who, with a very important finance portfolio, does not address herself to, or have a command of, the situation of home buyers throughout Australia. Let us look at the promise and the performance. Mr Fraser said in his 1975 policy speech:</PARA>
<PARA> We will reduce the tax burden. We will put an end to Labor's tax rip off. We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years. It will make government more honest with your money. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1977 he continued his lies and distortions during another election campaign. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have ended the big tax rip off. From February 1, further tax cuts will come in for every Australian wage and salary earner. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian people will not accept a return to higher taxes. The Government will bring taxes down further-not increase them. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet time and again taxes have gone up. As I will show, and as Senator Walsh has shown, during the period of the Fraser Government taxes have risen and they have now reached a record high level for Australia. We got our tax cuts. We got a so-called tax cut in 1978 which lasted for seven months. That occurred at the time when a 1.5 per cent tax surcharge was introduced. We all know what happened to full tax indexation. It came and went very quickly. In this Government's desperate grab for Australia's money the Government has brought back the secret tax of inflation which Mr Fraser so eloquently talked about in 1975. That is only one portion of the tax bill. This Government has introduced other taxes. In relation to petrol, we have seen the crude oil levy increase by 1,100 per cent since 1975-76. We have seen the establishment of a branch of the Taxation Office at every petrol pump. Now we have a branch of the Taxation Office in every health fund. The long grabbing arms of the Taxation Office will extend next year to every corner shop when the deceitful and pernicious sales tax extensions come into operation. That will come about because of the cowardly action of the Australian Democrats in failing to keep their election promise about keeping governments honest. At this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the effect of the sales tax and which portions of the community will be hit the hardest. Those in the income group who earn under $130 a week will be hit almost twice as hard as those who have an income of over $500 a week. I seek leave to incorporate the table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has talked, in conservative terms, of where the money will come from. I would like to address myself to the question of tax avoidance. This is a matter about which this Governments trumpets loudly in the electorate from time to time. What has happened over the last five years is that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Government have made a puzzle of Australia's taxation legislation which makes the Rubik cube seem as simple as a game of snakes and ladders. Time and again the Treasurer has put forward to the Parliament legislation seeking to close off loopholes and to stop schemes, but it is reactive legislation. It is governmental action of the worst kind to combat one of the gravest social problems facing our country. Let us look at the result of the work put in by the Treasurer. He is a man who knows absolutely nothing about weekly shopping, as his economic initiatives indicate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1976 the number of people involved in tax avoidance schemes has increased by more than 1,200 per cent. The conservative estimate of the cost of tax avoidance is $1,000m a year. I tend to think that Professor Russell Mathews of the Australian National University was much closer to the mark when he said a year ago that in the 1978-79 financial year tax avoidance had cost the community $2,715m. Quite recently we had the Commissioner of Taxation lending his weight to the allegation that the problem is increasing exponentially. That someone such as the amoral and despicable Peter Clyne, a real enemy of the Australian system, can still operate, make profits and continue to flout the tax laws is perhaps the greatest indictment of this Government's mealy-mouthed, wishy-washy and ultimately futile approach to dealing with tax avoidance. Any tax laws which leave room for the rotund Mr Clyne to barge his way through are clearly unacceptable and not worth the time and effort put into their drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said many times in the past, because of this Government's lack of any real action on tax avoidance the paying of income tax by the wealthy in this community has become a voluntary action. Let us look at two instances that have been brought forward in recent weeks. About a month ago before a Senate Estimates committee the Taxation Office admitted in a letter to the committee that the reduction of manpower in the Taxation Office will result in an estimated revenue loss this year of $46.8m. At the same time, because of the rigid application of a 3 per cent across the board cut in staff ceilings, the Taxation Office has lost 179 officers. The consequence of the Government's actions has been to save $1.5m by way of salaries. Because of that it will accrue a net loss to revenue of $45.3m. That is one Government action which is totally short sighted and which gives lie to the fact that the Government and the Treasurer are concerned about tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the report of the Commissioner of Taxation which was tabled in the Parliament on 28 October. The Commissioner identified 11,253 tax avoiders in the financial year 1978-79. For the year 1979-80 he identified 17,200 tax avoiders. For the year 1980-81 he identified 22,366 participants in tax avoidance schemes, involving revenue losses of $973m-or almost $43,500 lost tax per tax avoider. When one compares these figures with the figures relating to tax avoidance in 1975-76, which was the last year of the Whitlam Labor Government, one will find that there has been a massive explosion of tax avoidance under this Government. It goes through the actions but is not prepared to take firm and effective action to bring about results in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA> A very small number of people in our community can benefit from tax avoidance schemes. For 80 per cent of Australians there is no choice. Tax is, for them, a financial imperative which cannot be avoided. What has the Government done to make life more easy for these people? Absolutely nothing. Wage and salary earners, who have seen their incomes rise by 98 per cent since 1975-76, have seen the amount of taxation that they pay increase by 146 per cent. If this Government had done something about tax avoidance in this period the massive tax burden would not be as great as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in her attack on Senator Walsh and in her neglect to discuss the Government position on taxation, has passed over quite a number of very important facts which I would now like to put on the record. The Minister invited statistics. I now provide them. During the term of the Labor Government total Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product averaged 22.5 per cent. During the six years of the Fraser Government the average has been 24.1 per cent. In our last year of government the figure stood at 23.3 per cent. In this Budget year it stands at 25.5 per cent. That is an all time record high. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at net pay-as-you-earn tax receipts as a proportion of total tax revenue. These are the tax receipts which come out of the pockets of wage and salary earners. In our last year of government, 1975-76, that proportion stood at 41.7 per cent. Under the Fraser Government it is expected to be 45.7 per cent in this financial year. Once again that is an Australian record high. If one compares that with company tax receipts as a proportion of total Commonwealth tax receipts, very quickly one will see who is bearing the burden of the Government's economic policies. One will see that under the Labor Government company tax receipts were 16.6 per cent of total Commonwealth receipts. Under the present Government they have gone down to just under 14 per cent. The facts are there. They can be looked at. They are on the public record. I will not continue with the figures in view of the time limit, but I will raise them in future debate. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when wage and salary earners are paying massive increases in taxation, tax collections from the private sector and the wealthy have declined. In fact, they have declined by more than $6,000m. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle may very well ask where our funding will come from. Let us look at the record of this Government. The shift of money out of the pockets of wage and salary earners brought about by this Government has been massive, as I have shown. More importantly, by shifting the target of its funding, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lionel Bowen, has said, it has brought about a massive shift in government funding from the community sector to private enterprise and to multinational investment. In the three or four minutes which are available to me I wish to return quickly to an area of tax avoidance which this Government, once again, refuses to attack; that is, the area of transfer pricing. I refer to the method by which goods are sold to a subsidiary of a transnational corporation which is operating in a tax haven. A price structure is developed to transfer prices and profits. What happens under these transactions is that the profits incurred by a company are pushed off-shore. As a consequence, company profits and taxation on them are assessed in havens overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> In an important High Court ruling in August 1980 the eminent Mr Justice Lionel Murphy went straight to the heart of the matter. It was the case of the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation v. the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Ltd. The court determined that the corporation was in fact a foreign owned corporation, owned by Comalco. Mr Justice Murphy had this to say about the system under which the transfer pricing operated:</PARA>
<PARA> During the tax years in question, a substantial part of the taxpayers' product, bauxite, was shipped directly to Japan to two Japanese companies . . . although it had been sold to a Hong Kong company, Comalco Bauxite (H.K.) Ltd, 52 per cent of which is owned by Comalco and 48 per cent equally of the two Japanese companies. The Hong Kong company was intended to and did relatively little except for book entries. There was no physical delivery to it. It simply purchased the bauxite from the taxpayer, for example at 33 shillings per ton, and told it to the Japanese at 40 shillings per ton. The taxpayer acted on Comalco's directions and it is very relevant to the question of control that it sold to a company controlled by Comalco which was ultimately owned by those whom the Commissioner claims control the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened in this case was that one arm of a company sold to another arm in another country and evaded taxation. That is how transfer pricing operates and it goes on every day with a resultant loss in revenue of millions and millions of dollars. The Government continues to ignore this loss of revenue. It does nothing about it. If Senator Guilfoyle invites policies, I indicate at this stage that the Labor Party does have a policy in respect of this. I close at this stage but in doing so address myself to the point made earlier. The Government is responsible for crippling high rates of interest rates and taxation. It has an alternative, but has not chosen to adopt it. I believe that in the 15 minutes available to me I have shown one particular area in which the Government can act to decrease the burden on wage and salary earners in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I suppose that we should be grateful to the Opposition for raising this particular question today because it gives Government supporters an opportunity to compare the economic record of the Fraser Government with that of the Australian Labor Party during its disastrous years in office. We must always remember that during those years Labor presided over record inflation, which reached a level of 16.7 per cent in 1974-75, record increases in unemployment and a record deficit. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the House of Representatives on 24 September said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is still paying the price of Labor's irresponsible deficits, for those deficits are still distorting Australia's capital market, and still contributing to excessive interest rates as the loans that had to be raised at the time to fund the deficit are still having to be rolled over and renewed. The Labor deficit was nothing more than a way of making the future pay for the spending schemes of the past, either through inflation, or through higher taxes, or both. Deficit financing encourages expectations that are unreal and it means dishonesty about the real level of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> With the virtual elimination of the deficit in this Budget, we can plan next year's Budget no longer hostage to this element of the Labor Government's mismanagement and with the enhanced potential for tax cuts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the honourable senator to remain quiet. I listened to him in absolute silence. I wondered about the character of his speech but I chose not to interject, so I suggest to him, through the Chair, that he might give me the courtesy of listening to me in silence. I just remind the honourable senator that expenditure restraint has been the major ingredient of this Government's approach to getting rid of the deficit and making room for the private sector growth on which the future prosperity of this country so fundamentally depends. In the Labor years the average annual real growth in Budget outlays was just over 10 per cent. They were the big spenders-people who believed that the taxpayers should shell out with great gusto so they could pursue their extravagances which, in turn, have created tremendous problems today as they did in the past for the families of Australia. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81, under the Fraser Government, the figure in that regard was just over one per cent-compared with 10 per cent during the years for which Labor was in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The restraint of this Government is highlighted further if we look at what has happened in some major countries, which are concerned to achieve expenditure restraint. While Britain has matched Australia's achievement, our figure of 1.2 per cent stands in stark contrast to comparable figures of nearly 3 per cent for West Germany, about 5 per cent for the United States of America and more than 10 per cent for Japan. The most important index of government spending is the number of cents which it takes out of every dollar of the gross domestic product. I remind the Labor Opposition that the record of the Fraser Government in the control of inflation deserves commendation. To hold down the level of inflation to 9.1 per cent over the last 12 months, when one reflects that under Labor the level was 16.7 per cent, represents a remarkable achievement. I believe that the people of Austrlalia recognise the sense of economic responsibility that is displayed by this Government, which believes that the government should work for the people. The Labor Party believes that the people should work for the government. That is the fundamental difference between socialism and private enterprise. To finance the costly programs that the Labor Party introduced when it was in government, tremendous increases in government spending occurred. Taxes were increased and heavy borrowing took place. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that this Government has given some tax relief to the Australian people. During the debate on the sales tax measures I drew attention to the fact that the Australian tax system is disproportionately geared and is heavily reliant upon direct taxation, one form of which, of course, is personal taxation. While direct taxation is high, indirect taxation is extremely low. A table produced in 1979, which shows the reliance of the various Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries on indirect taxation, places Australia second last. Australia relies for 6 per cent of its revenue on indirect taxation, compared with about 24 per cent for France, about 12 per cent for Canada and 15 per cent for Ireland. The Government, recognising this imbalance, chose to bring down legislation to increase indirect taxation through sales taxes. The long term objective is to enable the Government to reduce personal tax. I look forward to that happening very soon. It may be next year or in the next Budget-I do not know-but since we have broadened our taxation structure in this way we should be able to fulfil the objectives outlined in the Prime Minister's speech of 24 September designed to reduce personal taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to observe a statement in a report by the International Monetary Fund released in September that it was not known how much longer interest rates would remain high. That problem is not peculiar to Australia. It is causing great concern in the United States of America, Canada and other countries. However, the report argued that the levels would remain above the 'abnormally low or negative levels' of the early 1970s for some time. It stated that the major factors behind the increases had been the rise in inflationary expectation and the tightening monetary policies in industrialised countries. The report called for a reduction in growth rates of nominal demand that would be sufficiently marked and prolonged to break inflationary expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has always espoused as its main economic objective the reduction of inflation. I have described how effective that has been. Clearly the IMF report demonstrates that the Government's economic policy is sound and that it is on the right course to bring about an eventual fall in interest rates. People should remember that this Government inherited Australia's inflationary problem from the Whitlam Government and the economic policies of its succession of Treasurers. When we hear people calling for Government intervention to lower interest rates we would do well to recall an editorial appearing in the Australian Financial Review on 17 August. In part it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> When the demagogues of the labour movement, or of the building society movement, or the populists on both sides of politics, begin shouting for assistance to mortgage borrowers and for lower interest rates they should reflect on what they are asking for. This is a reduction in the value of the insurance, superannuation and savings of, for the most part, the very people who are demanding lower housing interest. But considerations of simple logic have never stopped a demagogue. It is only too easy to demand lower interest rates and ignore the consequences. The consequences are clear enough. If savings are successfully diverted to subsidising housing even more our economic growth rate will be correspondingly lower. The poor will be worse off-they never benefit from house ownership subsidies. The relatively well off will do extremely nicely. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about the crippling burden on the families of Australia-and I am sure we are all concerned to relieve the pressure of high interest rates and other matters that have been alluded to during this debate-but I suggest that one thing we have to remember is that interest rates are affected quite substantially by a country's economic performance. One of the more significant factors is the inflationary pressures caused by execessive wage demands and accompanying strikes. I always remember what the Honourable Clyde Cameron said when he was Minister for Labour-that one man's wage increase costs another man his job. I suggest that one of the problems we have to front up to very seriously in a bipartisan or tripartisan way, in the spirit of interest in the development of this country, is the crippling burden placed upon Australian familities as a result of strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> Our record over the last few months has been disastrous for export trade. One example is the shipping strike. I cite the wage demands of the Marine and Power Engineers Institute which placed bans on all out-going shipping from Australian ports. I think some 60 ships were held up during the dispute, of which almost half were carrying cargoes of raw materials for export. In fact, our reputation overseas at present is at an all-time low because of those strikes. I was talking to a vice-chairman of a commercial steel corporation earlier this year in South East Asia. He said to me that his corporation would be delighted to buy 100 per cent of its raw materials from Australia. The only reason it is buying 50 per cent is that it cannot rely upon Australia to deliver the goods on time, if at all in some cases. I think that is an indictment of the Australian community at large, the governments of Australia, the trade union movement of Australia and everyone who has anything to do with this matter. The sooner we come to grips with this matter the better. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view it really demands a total re-examination of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as we know it today. Perhaps the Act ought to be destroyed and rewritten by people who know something about it. Perhaps we ought to co-opt Bob Hawke, George Polites and people such as that. Even the Acting Deputy President, Senator Georges, might be able to give a little assistance in redrafting these things in the interests of the trade union movement and for the benefit of the people of Australia. Either we have to do that or we have to have a look at the matter of collective bargaining. I think that may be on the cards at present. I have always been one who believed our system of arbitration in Australia was fair and reasonable. It seems to me that it is breaking down. We allow demarcation disputes to interrupt industrial development in this country. We allow arguments between trade unions as to who is supposed to be doing one job or another and this causes strikes. We allow people to go on strike while their--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am sure that you realise, because you have been interested enough to listen to me carefully, that I was talking about interest rates. I was talking about the crippling burden that the Labor Party suggests is being placed upon the families of Australia. I am merely saying that the irresponsible attitude of some trade unions in creating unnecessary strikes and making excessive wage demands is creating incredibly crippling burdens for the families of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats compliment the Australian Labor Party for bringing this matter of public importance before the Parliament today, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crippling burden placed on Australian families by the record taxes and interest rates of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree with that proposition. In saying so, let me also state that it is very easy to say that interest rates are high and catastrophic and that, therefore, it is the fault of one person, whether it be Mr Fraser or whoever. The Democrats do not take that view. We do not say that the situation can be easily fixed by the substitution of a Labor government, a Democrat government or whatever for a Fraser government. We do not say that at all. We recognise the complexity of this problem. It is a world-wide problem rather than just an Australian problem. Having said that, I will be critical of some aspects of Mr Fraser and his Government and the Fraser Government's policies with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the present level of taxes and interest rates borne by Australian families has reached crisis proportions. 'Crisis proportions' are strong words but I hope to demonstrate that for many families a crisis has been reached. Nor can there be any doubt that the misguided economic policies of the Fraser Government are largely to blame for this crisis. I do not know what further evidence is needed by Mr Fraser, Mr Howard, or more particularly Mr John Stone and those public servants who advise this Government, or the people who are responsible for Reaganomics, Thatcheromics or the Milton Friedmans of this world with their excessive pursuit of monetarism. I do not know for how long their policies have to fail, continue to fail and be seen to continue to fail before they realise the basic fallacy in the present policies of monetarism which are being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before in this chamber, the sophisticated policies of Milton Friedman, grabbed hold of by the less sophisticated Mr Reagan and Mrs Thatcher, are fairly simple. They were simple when I was studying economics a few years ago. I say that in answer to that genius working for the newspaper the Australian who this morning called me an economic illiterate. At least I do have some basic training. In those days the sophisticated game of monetarism was, as I understood it, known as the quantity of money theory. That simply means that in an economy where the supply of goods and services is about equal to the demand for goods and services, the injection of money means that there is then too much money chasing too few goods and there is demand inflation. That is fairly simple. It was a sound theory when I did economics-I will not disclose the year-and it is as sound and logical today. Does any honourable senator in this chamber suggest for one moment that demand equals supply in our economy today? It is absurd even to put the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Our material resources are underutilised by approximately 15 per cent, to put a conservative figure on it. Our labour resources are underused. We have a real level of 11, 12 or 13 per cent unemployment. I do not think that under any circumstances one can apply that form of economic equilibrium in which the monetarist policies or the quantity of money theory can be applicable today. That is why the Democrats say that we have in this economy cost push inflation and not the classic demand inflation which the monetarist policies are called upon to correct. Of course what they are doing is not curing the situation; they are exacerbating it. I again ask the question: How long does Mr Reagan, Mrs Thatcher, Mr Fraser or Mr Stone have to wait to see that their policies are not working, cannot work and will not work?</PARA>
<PARA> I will take the home loan interest rate crisis which is especially tragic. The recommendation of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System that these rates be de-regulated will obviously aggravate the situation even further. One wonders how this Government can even contemplate such a cruel and callous action. I join with my friend and colleague, Senator John Siddons, our economic spokesman on these matters, who condemned that thrust of the Campbell Committee's report which wants to de-regulate interest rates, including home interest rates, which would add crisis upon crisis. I was very impressed with an article written by a journalist, Tim Dare, in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. I think it is up to us who live in this ivory tower in Canberra to read articles such as this one which tell the politicians who live in this glass house what conditions are like for a typical couple who are trying to buy and equip their house. This article is dated 14 November last and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Young home buyers who are equipping their house and paying off a car are often spending more than $100 a week to meet interest charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of couples who have managed to bridge the deposit gap and get a home loan are now struggling to keep their house because steep rises in interest rates have increased their mortgage repayments. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether any other senators have had the experience which I have of being informed by constituents that homes are being broken up today and that couples are faced with a bank foreclosing its mortgage because they cannot keep up interest payments on the house alone. I am not talking about refrigerators, television sets, or cars; just the house. People are faced with the problem of having the bank foreclosing or the husband leaving the home and going to the Northern Territory or Western Australia to work in the mineral industry where he can work six or seven days a week with overtime so as to earn enough money to be able to sustain the payments. Is that the sort of society which we want to encourage? Is that the sort of situation which we want to impact on people who have had the guts and the wish to do what every politician in this place espouses is his dream, namely, that all Australians should have a responsibility to own, buy or build their own home?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to attribute all the blame of the following examples to the banking system. The banking system, I believe, has a lot to answer for in what it has done to people in the last few years. Building societies also have a lot to answer for. But to be fair to the banking system we must go back to the Government of the day. I have known of cases, as have no doubt other honourable senators, of young couples who have a 30 per cent deposit-30 per cent in hard cash which they have saved-to buy a home. Yet they go to a bank and are charged 17 1/2 per cent on the 70 per cent balance. I know of one case where a young couple had one-third deposit on a house which cost $60,000. They needed to borrow $40,000. The bank said: 'Yes, we will accommodate you but we will accommodate you only to the extent of $25,000 of the $40,000 you need at an interest rate of 13 1/2 per cent'-that is very high but fair enough-'but we cannot accommodate you for the extra $15,000. If you walk around the corner and see our subsidiary company it will be pleased to accommodate you for the balance of $15,000 at a rate of about 17 1/2 per cent per annum'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is what the Labor Party means when it refers to the crippling burden being placed on Australian families by the record taxes and interest rates. They are astronomical at the moment compared with a decade ago. Last financial year the average loan from building societies in New South Wales was $33,000. Repayments for a 25-year loan at 14 per cent reducible, were $405 a month. How many families can afford $405 a month for repayments on a house? I will not give too many figures because they are hard to absorb, particularly by people who are listening. But to understand how crippling this is, of that $405 that that young couple has to pay each month off the repayments of a 25-year loan, $393 goes in interest. In other words, only $12 a month out of $405 is paid off the principal. This means that a family of four, with only one breadwinner on average weekly earnings, would use almost 40 per cent of his take home pay each month to meet mortgage repayments. The credit squeeze keeps on tightening. Interest rates rose four times between April 1980 and June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I have criticised the Government, I have tried to be fair and say it is not all its fault. It is not an easy area. Of course world interest rates and the world economic situation have something to do with it. But the Democrats say that this Government can interdict in the market. It has done so since Federation with war service homes and terminating building societies. It is a philosophical question which Campbell in his report discarded. I do not blame him for that because he was not asked to be philosophical; he was asked to be a financial adviser. But a government with compassion for home buyers would simply say: 'We make a special case for people who want to buy or build their home. Therefore we will subsidise interest rates'. For that reason the Democrats have put forward, through my colleague Senator Janine Haines, a private member's Bill. The honourable senator presented the Bill in this chamber the second day she was in the Parliament. It will freeze interest rates as they are, and then make provision for them to be brought down after freezing by means of subsidies. This will be done because interest rates are too high already. It will then, in an attempt to attract money to the home loans section of the banking industry, make the first $1,000 of income received as interest on a bank savings account tax free. </PARA>
<PARA> Our two Bills-one to amend the Banking Act and the other to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act-are before this Parliament. The first Bill proposes that no increase in interest rates will be impacted upon the Australian people without the approval of both Houses of this Parliament. Does anybody cavil at the proposition that this Parliament should control interest rates? The second Bill proposes that a fund be built up and people encouraged, through a tax incentive, to invest so that money is available for home builders at low subsidised interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that I am deeply and desperately disappointed in the reaction of the Australian Labor Party when it says that it will not give the Democrats any support on those two Bills. One would have thought that a party such as the Labor Party which says in this place that there is a crippling burden placed on Australian families by record taxes and interest rates of the Fraser Government would have been sympathetic to two Bills which do precisely the opposite of putting a crippling burden on families. I hope that when these Bills are debated next week, as we have been promised by the Government they will be, the Labor Party will give us its reasons for the position it has taken. </PARA>

<PARA> The crippling burden placed on Australian families by the record taxes and interest rates of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter was supposed to have been discussed in a debate which has run for nearly one and a half hours. Senator Chipp said that he was deeply disappointed with the Australian Labor Party. I am even more disappointed with the socialist party which always masquerades as a body interested in human beings and human well-being. The socialists are very good at rhetoric, at making dramatic statements such as 'crippling burden'. That is typical socialist rhetoric and a total exaggeration of the facts. The socialists are always trying to conceal the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh who brought forward this matter of public importance devoted only five minutes to the matter under discussion in a speech which took 20 minutes to make. He wasted nearly half an hour of the Senate's time to repeat his personal attacks on two Government Ministers. I am delighted that the people of Australia were able to listen to Senator Walsh so that they can make up their own minds and form opinions on the character of Senator Walsh and some of his colleagues from the socialist party. As I said, Senator Walsh did not touch at all the matter of public importance. In the last five minutes of his speech he quoted a few statistics which were well refuted by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. We all expected that during his 20 minutes he would have addressed himself to and detailed the plans of the socialist party to relieve this crippling burden of taxation and interest rates on the Australian people. But he did not do that at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anybody wasted the honourable senator's time it was Senator Walsh. Senator Bolkus, who also spoke during this debate, again in a typical socialist fashion, used slogans but gave no facts. He made no mention of the subject matter at all. The only thing that Senator Bolkus mentioned was tax avoidance. I wonder whether Senator Bolkus has looked through the list of tax avoiders which is compiled by the Commissioner of Taxation? If he has not, I suggest that he should do so before he talks about people who are tax avoiders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of public importance refers to the record taxes and interest rates that are crippling the families of this country. Anyone who looks at the retail sales figures will see that retail sales are up 14 per cent since last qear and the estimate for this year is $4,330m. If anyone wants to tell me that there is no well-being in this country, that people have no money to buy the materials which they need for their daily lives, I suggest that they look at these figures. I would like to know how the Labor Party would classify a society which can spend $4,330m on retail purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to talk about the so-called 'investment' in betting. From where do people, who have to pay huge amounts of taxes and huge rates of interest, get the money to invest $20m a week in New South Wales alone. We hear talk about a lack of ability of the people of this country to spend money. However, in 1978-79 people spent $2,380m on the Totalisator Agency Board in New South Wales. They also spent $1,939m on bets with bookmakers. The point is that in 1978-79 a total of $4,319m was spent on betting in a so-called poor society crippled by the burden of taxation and interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to bank deposits. Would this country be able to claim huge bank deposits if its people had to scrape for every penny to meet their daily needs? The figures show that in September 1981 figures $23 billion was held by the savings banks and $26 billion by the trading banks. The total held by the banks at that date was $50 billion. Can anybody tell me that this means that Australian people are under tremendous pressure from taxation and interest rates? I wonder which country can equal that record of bank deposits. Household disposable income has increased by $2.7 billion from the previous year. We did not hear this from the socialist side of the Senate because honourable senators there talk only about unimportant matters and waste the time of the Senate. What the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said in his speech on the Budget is absolutely correct and shows to the Australian people the concern of this Government. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our programs are effective and progressive, that they identify priorities and balance the total range of human concerns, and that any suggestion that the Government does not care, does not understand, simply flies in the face of the record. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to extend the operation of the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Scheme which is due to expire on 31 December 1981, for a further 6 months period until 30 June 1982. The existing subsidy rate of $20 per tonne of nitrogen content will continue to be payable for the new period. </PARA>
<PARA> This subsidy was first introduced in 1966, with the aim of reducing costs to the users of the fertilizer, and to encourage its use in new applications. The fertilizer is used extensively by sugar and grain producers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the future operation of the nitrogenous fertilizers subsidy is currently under inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). </PARA>
<PARA> The reporting date on the inquiry which was 16 October 1981 has been extended to coincide with the reporting date of 28 February 1982 for the associated IAC inquiry into phosphatic fertilizers. This action was taken because of the commonality of the issues involved in both references. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the operation of the nitrogenous fertilizers subsidy as proposed by this Bill will give the legislation the same expiry date as the phosphatic fertilizers legislation. It is also expected to provide sufficient time for the Government to reach a decision on both fertilizer reports and introduce any resulting legislation into the Parliament before the common expiry date of 30 June 1982. The cost to the Government of this subsidy for the further period is estimated to be between $2m and $2.5m. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to set out in a clear and precise form the rights and duties of citizens and members of the Australian Federal Police in relation to the investigation of offences against laws of the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory. At the same time, the Bill seeks to establish a proper balance between the community's need for effective law enforcement and the need to preserve and respect basic human rights and freedoms. It will complement the provisions of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 recently enacted by Parliament. In March 1977, Attorney-General Ellicott introduced a like measure, the Criminal Investigation Bill 1977, which implemented, broadly speaking, the report of the Law Reform Commission on this subject. In respect of the limited difference between the majority and minority reports, the Bill followed the minority report. To enable the public and interested bodies, to study adequately the legislation, the Bill lay on the table until the end of 1977, when it lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Few Bills have attracted more public comment and attention than the Criminal Investigation Bill 1977. Comments and criticisms were received from a very wide cross-section of the community and from many public bodies and professional associations, including the Law Council and police associations. After careful consideration of these comments and criticisms, the Government decided that the Bill should be comprehensively reviewed to determine to what extent the criticisms could be met, without impairing the essential purposes of the Bill. One particular object of the review was to simplify the language of the Bill and the procedures provided by it because much criticism had been directed to the complexity of the Bill in those respects. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department accordingly conducted a thorough review of the 1977 Bill in conjunction with other interested departments and the Australian Federal Police. In the course of this review, scientific, legal and other experts were consulted and the practical application of the legislation was taken into account. The difficulties seen by the police forces in the 1977 Bill were examined in considerable detail. During the review, members of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure visited Australia to look into Australian developments in the regulation of criminal investigation. I and officers of my Department involved in this project had a useful exchange of ideas with members of the Commission. As a result of these consultations and the review generally, the Bill was substantially redrafted. The Commissioner, Australian Federal Police Force, has indicated that the Bill, so far as his Force is concerned, is in a workable form. For myself, looking at the Bill from the point of view of preservation of individual rights as well as the need for effective law enforcement, I am satisfied that the Bill is now appropriate for enactment by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite a number of changes have been made in the Bill from its 1977 form but these changes, I am pleased to say, do not interfere with the major reforms provided for in the 1977 Bill which in turn were based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. The more significant reforms to be effected by the present Bill may be briefly described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. A person held in custody will be given a specific right to be assisted by a lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Strict criteria will be laid down for arrest without warrant and the taking of fingerprints will only be permitted for identification purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Restrictions will be imposed on the use of force, including firearms, for the purpose of arrests. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Safeguarding provisions will be introduced as to the identification of suspects by identification parades and other procedures to ensure that injustices are not thereby committed. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Restrictions will be placed on the questioning of Aboriginals except in the presence of 'a prisoner's friend' and on the questioning of persons not fluent in English except in the presence of an interpreter. These provisions are similar to some of the provisions contained in a private member's Bill already introduced into the Senate by Senator Bonner. They are designed to recognise the need for special assistance for Aboriginals when being subjected to interrogation on criminal matters. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Rules are laid down as to the recording and admissibility of oral confessions made to police officers. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Substantial alterations are made to the system of police bail, including the spelling out of criteria to be applied by the police in making decisions as to the grant or refusal of bail; provision will also be made entitling a person refused bail by the police to appeal immediately to a magistrate, if necessary by telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The police will be given the power to require persons to identify themselves where they may be able to assist police in inquiries in relation to an offence and reciprocal power is also to be given to citizens in those circumstances to require the police to identify themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. General search warrants are to be abolished and specific provision will be made for the granting of search warrants, detailing the situations in which searches may be conducted without warrant and providing for obtaining a warrant over the telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. In a prosecution for an offence, the onus will be on the prosecution to justify the admission of evidence obtained in contravention of any of the procedures or requirements laid down in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Bill substantially simplifies the language of the 1977 Bill and the procedures provided under that measure. For example, the provisions of the 1977 Bill setting out when a person was under restraint gave rise to considerable misunderstandings; it was even thought, for instance, that the Bill created new powers of custody by police officers. In the current Bill the corresponding provision-clause 4-has been replaced by simpler language making clear that persons who would not normally be regarded as in custody are to be treated by the Bill as being in custody for the purpose only of conferring rights on them and corresponding duties on police officers. </PARA>
<PARA> One significant departure from the terms of the 1977 Bill is to be found in the provision made in the current Bill, for recording of police interviews with suspects. The 1977 provisions would have required the entire police interview with a suspect to be tape recorded or conducted in the presence of an appropriate witness unless it was in all the circumstances impractical to do so. Further, a police officer recording such an interview would have been required to deliver the record to an authorised custodian who would have been required to furnish on application a transcript of the recording to the person interviewed. The objection seen by the police to this requirement was that, in their experience, action at the beginning of an interview with a suspect to record it openly would, in many cases, cause the suspect to refuse to talk further to the police officer or otherwise assist the police in their inquiries. This is a human reaction but different considerations apply when the interview is further advanced. On the police view, the 1977 Bill would therefore seriously have affected criminal investigation processes. It was also pointed out that an obligation to furnish transcripts of recordings of police interviews would have placed a very heavy and expensive burden on the police force. I must say that these objections could not lightly be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the more frequent complaints made today in relation to the criminal investigation process concerns cases where there is, for one reason or another, no record of the police interview acknowledge in writing by the defendant and conflicting testimony is given as to oral admissions allegedly made by the defendant to the police. In the jargon, the police are accused of 'verballing' the defendant, that is, falsely attributing oral admissions to him. I would not for a moment wish to be understood as accepting that this in reality occurs with any frequency. However, the allegations are made from time to time and if, with the advance of modern technology, we can evolve procedures to reduce the possibility of these allegations being made, it behoves us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, the present Bill will provide that, on the trial of indictable offences under the law of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory, evidence may be given of oral admissions made by the accused to a police officer only if one of three procedures have been followed by the police. The first procedure will require that the entire interview is sound recorded and a copy of the recording is given to the accused. The second procedure will require that a record in writing of the interview has been duly acknowledged in writing by the accused. The third procedure will require that a record in writing is made as soon as practicable after the admission in question and this record is read to the accused, who is afforded the opportunity to comment on the accuracy of the record, this process being sound recorded or conducted in the presence of an appropriate witness. In the event of it being sound recorded, a copy of the recording must be given to the accused. I emphasise that it will be sufficient compliance with the Act if one of these procedures is observed. Which of the procedures should be followed by a police officer in a particular instance will depend on the circumstances of the case including the attitude of the suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, the Government believes that these legislative requirements will go a long way to removing disputes that take up so much of the time of the courts as to the terms of oral admissions made by suspects. In explaining this approach, I should like to acknowledge the contribution made to the thinking on this subject by the Queensland Committee of Inquiry into the Enforcement of Criminal Law under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Lucas in its report of April 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> Other significant changes from the 1977 Bill include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Arrest without warrant. In sub-clause 10 (2) the circumstances in which a police officer may arrest without warrant are extended beyond the 1977 provision to include where the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the arrest of the person is necessary in order to achieve-</PARA>
<PARA> the purpose of preventing the commission of a further offence; or</PARA>
<PARA> the purpose of preserving the safety or welfare of the person. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the variation are self-evident. In sub-clause (4) a power of arrest is also provided in respect of a person who is escaping, or has escaped from lawful custody. The provisions are also extended to cover State and Northern Territory police officers arresting persons for Commonwealth or Territory offences. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Warnings. One of the complaints made in relation to the 1977 Bill was the requirement for what was described as a 'multiplicity of warnings'. The requirements are now simplified. For example, while clause 19 provides for the giving of a warning when a person is in custody, this may be dispensed with if the warning required at the point when the officer made up his mind to charge-clause 20-had been given at or during the interview. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Aboriginals. It was considered unnecessary to provide for the attendance of a prisoner's friend during a police interview of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander where, because of that person's level of education or understanding, he would not be at a disadvantage in comparison with the Australian community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Identification. The grounds for taking fingerprints are extended to clause 34 to cover the purposes of establishing who the person is. The operation of the provision is also confined to persons in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 36, on the advice of scientific experts, the requirement in the 1977 Bill that, before permitting a witness to look at persons included in an identification parade, the police should obtain from the witness a written description of the person to be identified has been removed. So also has the requirement that a record of the names and addresses of participants in an identification parade should be provided to the suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Search warrants. The changes in substance are:</PARA>
<PARA> The requirement for an affidavit has been abolished as all relevant details can be and on present practice are, contained in the information. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum duration of a warrant is extended from seven days to one month. This was because seven days was considered unrealistic. These days warrants may have to be executed in several States or it may be necessary to wait for the occurrence of a particular incident before executing the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> By sub-clause 58 (5) a police officer who, in the course of searching for the thing specified in the warrant, finds another thing that he believes on reasonable grounds to be connected with the offence in respect of which the warrant was granted or another offence and that it is necessary to seize that thing in order to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction is authorised to seize it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is made clear that a search warrant may authorise the removal of clothing for forensic examination. As an extra safeguard for these and other searches of a person, the Bill requires that females may be searched only by female officers. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Entrapment. The prohibition on entrapment has been extended to a police officer causing another person to induce a person to commit an offence. On the other hand, the exemption has been widened to take into account the necessities of police work. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Exclusion of Evidence Rule. Since the Law Reform Commission's Report was published, the High Court in 1978 handed down its decision in the case of Bunning v. Cross which established the law in Australia on exclusion of evidence obtained in contravention of the law. Clause 69 has been altered to reflect the law as laid down in that case. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Emergency provisions. In clauses 21, 26, 28 and 29, emergency provisions have been inserted to enable a police officer to take action, for example, before the arrival of a lawyer, where he has reasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary to take such action to prevent danger of loss of life, personal injury or serious damage to property. The reason for the variation is self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Handicapped Persons. A number of provisions have been added to provide procedures to be followed when dealing with physically handicapped suspects. This last change reflects the Government's particular concern in this, the International Year of Disabled Persons, to take account of the special needs of handicapped persons as members of our community and the particular vulnerability of such persons when faced by authorities with whom they may be unable to communicate. </PARA>
<PARA>Having regard to Australia's ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in August 1980, it is particularly apposite to note the extent to which the Bill gives effect to that Covenant. Thus Article 9 of the Covenant provides:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Everyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 10 provides:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 14 contains a number of provisions entitling a person, subject to any criminal charge against him, to minimum guarantees in procedures for the determination of that change. They include guarantees:</PARA>
<PARA> 3. (a) To be informed promptly and in detail in a language which he understands of the nature and cause of the charge against him;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) To have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (f) To have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt;</PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the international Covenant are clearly relevant to this Bill which can be regarded as a practical step to implement the obligations of the Covenant. It is interesting to note that the Bill represents probably the first attempt by a common law country to state comprehensively the principles applying to criminal investigation, consistently with the requirements of the International Covenant. In a real and practical way this Bill, together with the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 and the Human Rights Commission Act 1981 demonstrates the concern of the Government with the protection and promotion of the rights of the individual. The Bill exemplifies the government's appreciation that the rights of the individual, to be effective, need to be set out clearly and specifically. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police-with which I agree-the Bill also represents the single most significant reform in Australian policing. Its impact on the operations of the Australian Federal Police will be considerable. The Government intends that sufficient time should be available both for detailed consideration of the Bill and to allow the Australian Federal Police to prepare for the many operational and administrative changes this legislation will necessitate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that the legislation will be debated towards the end of the autumn session of the Parliament and I look forward to receiving submissions from honourable senators and members and from all other interested persons and organisations, if possible by mid-January 1982. Mr Deputy President, much time and effort has gone into the review of the 1977 Bill. As a result, the present Bill represents, I believe, a workable and sensible balance between the needs of law enforcement and the preservation of individual rights. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the amendments in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981 are ones that would normally be included in a Statute Law Revision Act of the kind passed earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Some are designed to correct printing and drafting errors that have been found to exist in a number of Acts. Another provision provides for the repeal of Acts the operation of which is exhausted or which are no longer required. Other provisions make a number of technical or minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions go to matters of substance in varying degrees-as indeed did the Statute Law Revision Act 1981-but they are regarded as suitable, in the interests of legislative expedition, for inclusion in an omnibus measure of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the present Bill that deal with the matters of statute law revision in the narrowest sense do not call for particular comment. I propose to explain in some detail the nature and effect of the other provisions, taking them in the order in which they appear in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of the proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 is to remove a constraint which prevented, even with the Minister's approval, councils and associations incorporated under the Act from selling, mortgaging or otherwise disposing of their assets to non-Aboriginal bodies or individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Although originally included in the Act to protect land provided for Aboriginals by the Commonwealth against unwarranted disposal, the constraint has been counterproductive to the social and economic development of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> The consent of the Minister will be required in the situations dealt with by the amendments. I should add that nothing in the amendments would place in jeopardy land held under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory Evidence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1971</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 amends the Australian Capital Territory Evidence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1971 so as to allow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance 1971 of the Territory to be amended or repealed by an ordinance of the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Evidence Ordinance 1971 contains comprehensive rules of evidence for civil and criminal proceedings in the Australian Capital Territory. The Ordinance was disallowed by the Senate in 1971 but its provisions were kept in force by the Act because the disallowance had left the Territory without adequate evidence laws for criminal trials. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Act did not provide for any amendment of the provisions of the Ordinance. At present those provisions have the status of an Act and can be amended only by an Act of the Parliament. Moreover, difficulties can arise in the inclusion of desirable evidence provisions in other Territory ordinances because of possible invalidity due to inconsistency with the Evidence Ordinance. The amendment will remedy this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1972 the then Attorney-General introduced a Bill for an Act to replace the Ordinance but the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for consideration and was not enacted. Following a recommendation of the Committee, the law of evidence applicable in proceedings in Federal and Territory Courts was referred to the Law Reform Commission in 1979 for review and report. The Commission's report is not expected for some time. The amendment proposed by the Bill is an interim measure only, pending the report of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933</PARA>
<PARA> Part VI of the Bill makes four amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 amends section 10 of the Act to enable a new judge of the Court to take the oaths or affirmations of allegiance and of office before another judge of the Court, a justice of the High Court or a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. This amendment will remove the need for the Governor-General to appoint, each time a new judge is appointed, a person before whom the judge may take the oaths or affirmations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 inserts a new provision dealing with the delivery of reserved judgments. The new provision will enable reserved judgments of the Court constituted by three or more judges to be delivered by any one of them, thereby removing the need to reassemble the whole of the Court merely for the purposes of delivery of the judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 deals with prosecution of indictable offences triable before the Supreme Court. Section 53 of the Supreme Court Act now provides for such offences to be prosecuted by information in the name of the Attorney-General or such other person as the Governor-General appoints in that behalf. The amendment to be made by clause 16 will remove the need for an appointment to be made by the Governor-General and enable an appointment to be made by the Attorney-General by instrument in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 inserts a new section 53A which provides that, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, upon application, the Court is to include, in any judgment for a pecuniary amount, an amount in respect of interest. The amount of interest is to be within the discretion of the Court and the interest is to be calculated, as the Court thinks fit, on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or any part of the period between the date the cause of action arose and the date of judgment. A lump sum may be ordered in lieu of such interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act 1978</PARA>
<PARA> Part VII of the Bill provides for certain amendments to the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act 1978 to rectify a number of legislative deficiencies which have become apparent in the course of the Corporation's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments embrace four particular areas of concern and propose-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) an expanded definition of 'development project' as contained in the Act to include projects concerned solely with the supply of services. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the inclusion of a provision to enable the Corporation to engage directly in negotiations on overseas projects with overseas clients at the request of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the inclusion of a provision to enable the Corporation under certain circumstances to act at the request of an authority of the Commonwealth or a State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the replacement of the maximum contingent liability concept in the Act which has proved difficult to define precisely in terms of the Corporation's activities with the concept of assessed net commercial risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of implementing these amendments will be to enable the Corporation to operate more effectively and in line with the original objectives of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Bankruptcy Act 1966</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Government has asked that bankruptcy matters in that State should be taken over by the Federal Court of Australia. At present bankruptcy matters there are heard before the State Court of Insolvency, in which a judge of the South Australian District and Criminal Courts sits part-time. The purpose of clauses 28 to 30 of the Bill is to transfer all matters pending before the State Court of Insolvency into the Federal Court from a date to be proclaimed. At the same time, it is convenient to remove the bankruptcy jurisdiction presently vested in the Victorian Court of Insolvency, which has not sat for some years. The Supreme Courts in those two States will be invested with jurisdiction in bankruptcy, bringing them into line with the Supreme Courts in the other States. In practice, however, all bankruptcy matters in Victoria and South Australia will be dealt with by the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</PARA>
<PARA> In a statement to Parliament on 7 May 1981 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs foreshadowed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in relation to requirements to enrol, to vote and to nominate as a candidate for election to Parliament. Following close consultations with State governments, it has been determined that Australian citizenship is the appropriate basis for the franchise and for nomination as a candidate for election to Parliament. The Government considers that migrants, irrespective of their country of origin, should be treated equally in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IX of the Bill gives effect to these decisions. It is to come into operation on a day to be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the requirements to enrol and to vote, the changes to legislation will not of themselves confer a right to vote upon any further categories of people. The only group of migrants affected by the changes will be British subjects who are not Australian citizens and who have not enrolled before the coming into operation of the legislation. In future, only Australian citizens will be entitled to enrol. I should emphasise, however, that the changes will not disenfranchise anyone. Compulsory voting will continue for all those who are on the roll at the date of commencement of the legislation. Not only will their rights be preserved; they will be obliged to maintain their enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> From date of commencement of the new provisions, membership of the Australian Parliament will be restricted to Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of these changes will constitute a further milestone in the social and political development of Australia. The changes reflect the Government's commitment to enhancing the value and status of Australian citizenship and to the consistent and non-discriminatory treatment of all migrant groups. Most States have already agreed to introduce similar legislation. It is desirable that there be a uniform commencement date across Australia for the new arrangements and it has been agreed in principle that this should be early in 1982. The actual date will be determined in conjunction with State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Designs Amendment Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA> Part X of the Bill amends the Designs Amendment Act 1981. Clause 39 operates to insert a definition of 'legal personal representative' into the Designs Act 1906, the effect of which is to remove the requirement for the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased owner of or applicant for a design registration to obtain in the Australian Capital Territory-or elsewhere in Australia-a resealing to the grant of probate or of the letters of administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 40 first makes it clear that a separate application for design registration is to be made in respect of each article-or set of articles-for which the owner seeks design protection, and secondly sets limitations on the type of amendments which may be made to an application for design registration. Both these provisions embody the long-accepted interpretation of the Designs Act 1906. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 41 amends the provisions allowing restoration of lapsed design registrations. Under the procedure established by the Designs Amendment Act 1981, a design registration is in force for one year from registration, and can be extended, on request made in due time, for three further periods expiring 6, 11 and 16 years after the date on which the application for registration was lodged. If the owner fails to meet the deadline for requesting the second or third extensions the registrations can nevertheless be restored on late application. This is not possible if the deadline for requesting the first extension is not met, but this situation is now remedied by the amendments in clause 41. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment in clause 42 specifically provides that the legal personal representative of the deceased owner of a design may be registered as owner; while clause 43 enables the making of regulations requiring persons to furnish statutory declarations in relation to proceedings under the Designs Act 1906. </PARA>
<PARA>Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980</PARA>
<PARA> Part XIII of the Bill revises section 92 of the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 to take account of the fact that the Principal Act, which is not yet in operation, provides for imprisonment for a number of offences under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the amendment is to provide that such offences shall be indictable offences, and thus triable by jury, unless the defendant and the prosecutor consent to prosecution in a court of summary jurisdiction and the court is satisfied that this is appropriate. The maximum penalty a court of summary jurisdiction may impose is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine not exceeding $10,000 or both. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XVII of the Bill makes a similar amendment for similar reasons to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980 concerning prosecution of offences under section 132 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The amendment has the effect of inserting a new section 132 in the 1967 Act, which is to come into effect when the 1980 Act comes into operation. </PARA>
<PARA>National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977 and Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA> In September 1981 the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations (CAGEO) merged with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the former body ceased to exist. The amendments in Part XV of the Bill provide for the abolition of CAGEO representation on the National Labour Consultative Council, established under the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977. Provision is also made by Part XVIII of the Bill for the abolition of CAGEO representation on the Australian Council for Union Training, and on each of the State Councils for Union Training, established under the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the amendments increase by one the number of persons representing the ACTU on the National Labour Consultative Council. They also increase by one the number of ACTU representatives on the Australian Council for Union Training and the number of State Trades and Labour Council (TLC) representatives on the respective State Councils for Union Training. The TLC's are State branches of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA>Patents Act 1952</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in Schedule 1 of the Bill include amendments of the Patents Act 1952 following from Australian membership of the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The Treaty provides for regulations to be made to prescribe matters of form, times, procedures and fees in relation to matters under the Treaty. Since Australian accession to the Treaty, the regulations made under the Treaty have been amended and further frequent amendment is expected in the early stages of its implementation. To give effect to these amendments it is necessary that the Australian legislation be amended as the Treaty is a Schedule to the Patents Act 1952. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in the Bill enable effect to be given to amendments to the Regulations made under the Treaty by modifying the definition of 'Treaty' in section 58A of the Patents Act to include the Treaty regulations as amended, subject to the amendments being declared in the Patents regulations. The clause then empowers the Patents regulations to make such declarations. The Schedule of the Bill also amends sub-section 58C (7) of the Patents Act 1952. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of interest-free non-repayable capital grants totalling $435.75m to the States in 1981-82. This amount represents the grant component of the Loan Council program for State governments in 1981-82 and is one-third of the total program of $1,307.25m agreed at the June 1981 Loan Council meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the payment of capital grants in the first six months of 1982-83 up to an amount equal to one-half of the 1981-82 amount, pending passage of legislation to authorise grants in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with past practice, payments authorised under this Bill may be made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from the Loan Fund, and appropriate borrowing authority is included. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposed grants represent a continuation of arrangements initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government in June 1970, which provide that a proportion of the State governments' Loan Council program should take the form of interest-free non-repayable grants instead of what would otherwise be interest-free bearing borrowings by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the grants is to relieve the States of debt charges-that is, interest payments and sinking fund contributions-which they would otherwise have to pay, and the grants accordingly have a substantial beneficial effect on the States' financial positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The grants were introduced to help States finance works such as schools, and other capital works from which debt charges are not normally recovered, The States are, however, entirely free to apply these grants as they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the general context in which this Bill is being introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the grants which are the subject of this Bill comprise one-third of the States' Loan Council borrowing programs in 1981-82. The Loan Council, at its June 1981 meeting, approved a State governments' program of $1,307.25m for 1981-82, of which two-thirds-$871.5m-comprise borrowings and one-third-$435.75m-is to be provided as capital grants to the States. These amounts are the same as approved in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> It is misleading, however, to consider the States' Loan Council borrowings in isolation. As with all forms of funds made available to the States, a direct comparison with last year can only be made in the overall context, including total Commonwealth Budget funds provided to the States and borrowings by State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds to the States from the Commonwealth Budget are estimated to total $12.791m in 1981-82, an increase of 8.5 per cent. This represents nearly one-third of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays this year. Payments to or for the States in addition to the general purpose capital funds and borrowings are expected to increase by 9.6 per cent to $11,484m in 1981-82. All but $4,477m of this involves general purpose funds which may, of course, be spent by the States however they see fit, including on capital works projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the arrangements this year see a considerable reduction in the relative importance of specific purpose payments, so much so that overall Commonwealth general purpose payments to the States-payments which can be allocated by the States themselves between recurrent and capital expenditure-are estimated to increase by 28 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> At its June 1981 meeting, the Loan Council also approved an increase in the larger state semi-government authorities' borrowing programs of 11.2 per cent to $2,098.3m for 1981-82, which includes infrastructure borrowings for such authorities of $806.7m. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions of the June 1981 Loan Council meeting on public sector borrowings must finally be seen against the background of re-emerging inflationary pressures-pressures which if allowed to grow unchecked could quickly undermine the current recovery and threaten further development that is in the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the package of funds to the States in 1981-82, including the Loan Council borrowing programs, has been carefully designed both within the constraints of the Commonwealth's continuing policy of responsible restraint on public sector spending and with a view to giving the States further flexibility in determining their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an important measure in these overall arrangements for Commonwealth Assistance to the States. I commend it to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Senate that the Australian Democrats are not prepared to support Senator Walsh's motion to disallow the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Regulations amendment, basically because we believe that the Income Equalization Deposits Scheme works essentially to help small farmers. Those small farmers have a very difficult row to hoe and income equalisation deposits do in fact help them to even out their income. We have looked at the figures and they show that 75 per cent of the deposits made by farmers under the Scheme average only $6,192 and, in fact, that only 51 people have made deposits in excess of $100,000. If the Scheme is being used as an income tax dodge by the high income farmers-there are not very many of them, as the figures amply demonstrate-that is to be regretted. It would be a matter of some concern to us if the Scheme in the future were to be used for that purpose to any greater degree. However, at the moment, the bulk of the evidence suggests that IEDs are being used by most farmers in the manner in which they were intended to be used; that is, to average the incomes of a group of people whose incomes fluctuate considerably. That is the reason the Scheme was devised and, as far as we can see on the evidence of the figures as we have dissected them, that is essentially what the Scheme is being used for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Scheme does have the potential to be used as a tax dodge, we agree. So far that has not happened. That essentially is the reason for the Democrats being unable to support Senator Walsh's motion. However, we as a party do believe that a register of pecuniary interests for all parliamentarians ought to be set up and that all members and senators ought to declare their financial interests. Only such a register could allay the fears of responsible people. Justice should not only be done but also be seen to be done. For those reasons, we do not support Senator Walsh's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am disappointed that even though I have sent two sets of circulars to the Australian Democrats in an attempt to educate them on the matter of the disallowance of the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Regulations amendment, they have been conned by the spurious arguments of the National Farmers Federation. Senator Siddons admitted that the Democrats have seen that there is considerable potential for the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme to be used as a tax haven. In failing to support this motion the Democrats will throw away the only weapon which the Senate has to enforce the sorts of reforms that are needed in this Scheme. Those reforms are basically: Firstly, not to pay interest on the tax deferred component of the deposits; secondly, to tighten up the provisions regarding the timing of deposits and withdrawals and the interaction between the timing of deposits and withdrawals and the effect on provisional tax; and, thirdly, to clean up the scandalous mess of the income tax averaging provisions made in 1978 by this Government because of stupid pre-election promises which came straight off the top of the head of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) prior to the 1977 general election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even the National Farmers Federation admits that this is an area of taxation law which needs to be cleaned up. In failing to support this motion the Democrats will throw away the only weapon which the Senate has to enforce some sort of reform on this Government. As I said, the Democrats have been conned by the spurious arguments of the National Farmers Federation-arguments which have been abundant on this issue. I notice that the Federation has not replied to my latest riposte. I do not believe it will. I challenge it to debate the issue publicly in a large forum. The Democrats have fallen for the line that this is a Scheme which helps small farmers. I point out that there are in total only 12,000 deposits from 200,000-odd eligible taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> My first point is that only somewhat less than 6 per cent of eligible taxpayers are using the Scheme at all. One would have to be incredibly naive to believe that the depositors were all small farmers. Secondly, I refer to the National Farmers Federation's typically spurious manipulation of figures. Senator Siddons referred to figures indicating that 75 per cent of depositors had average deposits of only $6,500, I think it was. While there is probably some correlation between the size of the deposit and taxable income, there is no necessary correlation between the two factors. The fact that somebody has a relatively small deposit proves nothing about the level of that person's income. It is probable that there is a correlation, of course-obviously, somebody who has a very large deposit has a very high income-but there is no one to one correlation between the size of the deposit and the size of the income. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way in which the Democrats have been conned by the National Farmers Federation was in the emphasis placed on the number of depositors instead of the amount of money. In fact, 54 per cent of the money which was deposited last financial year-I emphasise, of the money, not of the number of depositors-was in amounts in excess of $20,000. Most of the money that has been paid into that account in the last year came from individuals who paid in individual deposits in excess of $20,000. Those depositors are not likely to be small farmers. It is not the small farmers who are reaping the benefits of this Scheme. As for the National Farmers Federation's humbuggery about their concern for the small farmers, anyone who was concerned about small farmers in respect of this Scheme would be moving to ensure that a higher rate of interest was paid on the deposit net of tax than would otherwise be payable. The Democrats, in adopting the attitude they have, have denied themselves the only means of effectively bringing pressure to bear on this Government to reform this rort. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make in answer to the arguments of the National Farmers Federation, is that, of course, this rort has not been operating for very long in the way in which it is operating now. The effects of last year's increase in interest rates, up to a maximum effective rate of 17 1/2 per cent, have not yet flowed through into the statistics which are available. To some extent they will show up this year. But the full effects of the rort which this Government has introduced, of this tax haven which this Government has engineered and constructed and which the Democrats now seek to protect, will not become available in official statistics for another two years. I invite honourable senators to record what I say, to mark it down against me if they like: If the Government is actually serious, if it effectively cracks down on other means of tax avoidance, I forecast that there will be a very substantial increase in the use of this tax haven for as long as the provisions, post-Statutory Rule 302, are allowed to prevail. Let us think about the effects of that on the small farmers. I return to Mr Geoff Miller's statement at Agro '79 in Perth in March 1979. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Farmers should aim at achieving tax equity with other people in the community, but not tax concessions not shared with others. Tax concessions result in excessive entry into agriculture--</PARA>
<PARA>Have the Australian Democrats grasped the implication of that?</PARA>
<PARA>for the specific purpose of receiving the economic reward associated with the concession. Rural land values and the costs of other limited resources, such as livestock and credit, are inflated by this process. Although individuals may benefit, the benefits of tax concessions to rural industries as a whole are likely to be negative. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made by the former Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. I believe he is now No. 2 in the Department of Primary Industry. I might add that he is a very competent officer. He must be somewhat of a misfit amongst the crowd into which he has recently moved. If rural industries as a whole are not to gain or even be disadvantaged by any provision which makes agriculture a tax haven, which induces excessive competition for the inputs required, the smaller farmers will certainly be greatly disadvantaged. Any measure associated with taxation which confers more than proportionate benefits on high income farmers as against low income farmers reduces the competitive position. It weakens the competitive position of a small farmer vis-a-vis a larger farmer. That is precisely what is done by this tax haven created around income equalisation deposits. The situation was seriously exacerbated by the statutory rule which my motion seeks to deny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a particular year; that is correct. That is my recollection of it. Only 51 farmers have made deposits in excess of $100,000. I am willing to accept that that is correct. But they can make another $100,000 in the following year. Surely the definition of a high income farmer would fall short of somebody who had $100,000 in spare cash to put into an income equalisation deposit. The point I want to make is that the small farmers-about whom the Australian Democrats profess to be concerned and about whom the National Farmers Federation, eyes flowing with crocodile tears, professes to be concerned-are placed in a disadvantageous position vis-a-vis their larger and stronger farming competitors by any measure related to taxation which provides more than proportionate benefits for farmers on higher incomes. I am sorry that the Democrats have not been able to understand that. I have attempted to give them a couple of tutorials on it by way of written papers, but obviously the message has not got through. The Democrats are idly standing by while this Government preserves the tax haven it has created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats cannot be taken seriously in the future as a party dedicated to the elimination of tax evasion and avoidance. Indeed the Democrats are collaborators with this Government in preserving tax evasion and avoidance schemes which, I repeat, will disadvantage the very small farmers, the welfare of whom they claim should have a paramount position. Anyone who wants to make sure that the small farmers get a fair deal, this goes particularly for the National Farmers Federation since it chose to use this wholly dishonest argument, would amend these provisions in a way that ensures that the interest-at a higher rate than 9 1/2 per cent; perhaps 12 per cent or 14 per cent-is paid on the deposit net of tax. Senator Bjelke-Petersen and her husband are probably up to their ears in this scheme. As one who has never taken advantage, throughout 25 years of farming, of the various rorts which the Liberal and National Country Party governments have created, I serve notice now, as one who is ideally placed to exploit, as are half the members of the Cabinet which implemented the statutory rule, that if this statutory rule lasts I will exploit it. I will make public statements about the way in which I have exploited it. I will continue to demand that this scandal be cleaned up. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's attempt to defend this rort one week ago was the most pathetic and puerile defence of an indefensible government that I have ever heard in this Senate. She made three points. The first was that John Kerin had said that interest rates ought to be lifted. So have I. So have other people in the Australian Labor Party. This is based on the provision that interest is paid only on that section of the deposit which belongs to the depositor and not, as it is, on that section which belongs to the taxpayers of Australia, which is tax otherwise payable. Her second point was incredible. Obviously she understands nothing about the issue itself. She has not grasped the arithmetic that is involved which, I suppose, is not surprising because normally she knows nothing about anything on which she is asked questions in the Senate. She is the highest paid post box in the world. She refers queries on to other people. She never knows anything and rarely says anything. Obviously she has failed to grasp the fundamental arithmetic relationships in this issue. But if she does not know anything herself, which is not surprising, the Senate is at least entitled to expect that she get advice from people who do. During her speech she said:</PARA>
<PARA> The aim of this scheme is to provide a means whereby primary producers can act themselves to smooth out their income flows for taxation purposes by making deposits in high income years and withdrawals in low income years. In this way they can reduce the adverse effects on their taxation liabilities which would result from the interaction of a progressive tax rate scale and fluctuating incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>To put that in simpler words, what she was saying was that farmers who use income equalisation deposits to maintain as close as possible to a constant taxable income will avoid taxation penalties which would otherwise apply. Not only is that wrong but also the truth is the complete reverse. Ever since the averaging provisions were amended in 1978 farmers who use income equalisation deposits to smooth out taxable income do not avoid a tax penalty; in fact, they incur one. On the other hand, if they wish to reduce their tax otherwise payable one way to do it is to use income equalisation deposits, not to stabilise taxable income but to destabilise it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows in detail the way in which a farmer may evade taxation liability by using income equalisation deposits not to stabilise income but to destabilise income. If Senator Guilfoyle did not know that before, did she not look at the table that I presented? Did she not understand it? Does she understand anything? Although it may not surprise the Senate that Senator Guilfoyle has no command of the fundamentals of the area she is supposed to cover, at least we are entitled to expect that her advisers, who I notice are again present in the chamber, can give her better information than to provide the peg upon which the Government hangs most of its argument for retaining these provisions-something which was not only wrong and inaccurate but also the complete reverse of the truth. Farmers do not avoid taxation penalties by using IEDs to smooth out taxable income; they incur taxation penalties if they use them. But if they use IEDs to destabilise taxable income they evade forever the payment of tax which would otherwise be due. On that spurious defence the Government rests its total case, and the Australian Democrats have accepted that case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point made was the assertion that it was impractical to administer the scheme in the way that I had outlined; that is, that the interest be paid on the deposit net of tax which would otherwise have been payable. That contention also is wrong. It is necessary to introduce certain restrictions and provisions but they are of the type which already apply in regard to the payment of provisional tax. For example, most deposits are lodged in June, July or August and are deductible from taxable income in the year ended 30 June. Taxation returns for that year should, according to the law, be lodged by 31 August, which is 9 to 12 months before the first interest payment is due. In other words, if the conditions of the Income Tax Assessment Act are being strictly observed, for all those deposits made in June, July and August the Australian Taxation Office will have a taxation return in its hands 9 to 12 months before the interest payment is due. It is obviously a very simple matter to calculate the tax deferred component of the deposit and pay the interest accordingly. Returns are not always lodged by 31 August, it is true, and some other arrangements would be necessary to determine the relevant taxable income when interest was due on a deposit lodged in, say, September of any year, but that problem would not be insurmountable. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of alternatives. The actual payment of the interest could be delayed until the taxation return was received. Another alternative is that it could be paid when due, subject to the depositor declaring taxable income for the relevant year, even though a return may not have been actually submitted to the Taxation Office. In exactly the same way, of course, provisional taxpayers now may, if they choose, reassess their provisional tax liabilities at 31 March of any year for the income year ending the following June. Exactly the same thing could be done in this case. Of course, penalties would be provided for gross understatement of income, just as they are when people vary and grossly understate, provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Guilfoyle claimed that interest rates had increased quite significantly since the last amendment of this particular rate of interest occurred in August 1980. That is true. She said that market rates had increased, in one case, on Commonwealth bonds, by 3.15 per cent; and that therefore it would be less than reasonable if rates for income equalisation deposits were not increased by the nominal 2 1/2 per cent. What she is conveniently overlooking is that the effective rate of interest on the income equalisation deposits is not the nominal rate. She is attempting to defend this proposition by saying that because market rates for government bonds have gone up by 3 per cent that justifies an increase in the effective rate on income equalisation deposits, for people on the maximum marginal tax rate, of not 3 per cent but of 6 1/4 per cent. That is precisely what the increase in the effective rate is. The effective rate for maximum marginal taxpayers, which was 17 1/2 per cent before this statutory rule was introduced, has been increased not by 3 per cent but by 6 1/4 per cent, to 23.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Guilfoyle said she had been advised that the interest was not paid in the way I am advocating-the way originally recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission. Senator Guilfoyle said last week: 'I am advised that it was not done in that way solely because of administrative impracticability'. I have just shown that it is not administratively impracticable to do it in that way. Indeed, for most deposits there would be no difficulty at all. For those in regard to which there would be some difficulties the adoption of similar arrangements to those which already apply to provisional taxpayers in reassessing their tax liability-it is called 'option to vary'-would overcome the problem. I do not believe that the Australian Taxation Office is so lacking in ingenuity that it could not work out a scheme at least as good as that. It took me about 20 minutes. I do not believe that the Australian Taxation Office, which has a number of extremely competent people, could not work out a scheme that would be at least as good as the one that I have worked out-if the Government were willing to allow it to do so, or willing to implement it. That is yet another spurious defence of this taxation rort. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I am more than a little disappointed with the Australian Democrats, not only because they are not supporting us but because they have again revealed an incapacity to see through a spurious argument of the type that has been put by the Government and by the National Farmers Federation. The small farmers, the welfare of whom the Governent purports to be concerned about, will not be helped by this statutory rule. Indeed, they will be harmed, firstly because it will attract outside capital into agriculture for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the taxation concession, as Mr Miller has outlined and, secondly, because in common with all taxation concessions where the benefits are disproportionately weighted in favour of farmers with high incomes, the position of the small, low income farmer vis-a-vis the higher income farmer will be weakened. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in respect of all the other reforms which ought to be made in this area, the Government having got away with this statutory rule, which has seriously exacerbated the effects of the tax haven which it previously engineered and constructed, the Senate has thrown away its only weapon to impose any discipline on the Government, to apply any effective pressure for reform. Had this decision not been taken we would have been in a strong bargaining position for the Government to reform these provisions, to make them operate in the way they were intended and ought to operate before they were sabotaged in 1976 and 1978 by decisions of this Government. That could have been a condition of supporting an increase in the interest rate in the way it ought to be applied, that is, on the net deposit of the tax deferred component. </PARA>
<PARA> As for Senator Guilfoyle, if that is the best defence the Government can offer no wonder the country is in a mess. The Minister for Finance does not understand that the way these IEDs now operate utterly contradicts the stated reason for their existence, that is, to enable farmers to avoid taxation penalties caused by varying taxable income, using IEDs to smooth out those variations in taxable income. According to Senator Guilfoyle only one week ago, that is what they do but in fact they do exactly the opposite. The way to minimise tax payable is to maximise the fluctuation in taxable income. Any farmer who uses income equalisation deposits in the way Senator Guilfoyle says they should be used will, in fact, incur a tax penalty and will pay more tax than would otherwise have been payable if no resort was had to income equalisation deposits. If she cannot understand it-and she obviously cannot-she might at least have looked at the table I made available to the Government last week, which gave the specifics of how this operated, or have got some decent advice, which she obviously has not. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed that this has happened. I thought that the Australian Democrats might have been serious about stopping tax avoidance and tax evasion. Obviously they are not. Senator Harradine has not declared himself. I hope that he will come into the vote that will be held on this matter and at least declare whether he is for or against protecting the tax havens which this Government has engineered and constructed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill 1981 is a short Bill and it has two unrelated functions, one of which is the result of the Government's administrative incompetence. The outcome of the Government's misguided and inequitable economic policy which seeks to heap on those who can least afford it more than their share of the economic burdens of this country makes up the second part of the legislation. The former corrects a mistake which is the result of the hasty and ill-conceived health charges which were introduced into this Parliament in May this year. The latter raises the cost of pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceutical benefits legislation from $2.75 to $3.20 per item, an increase of 45 cents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the first part of the legislation. The mistake to be corrected results from the fact that in producing the legislation to deal with the new health arragements earlier this year the Government, amongst other things, abolished the hospital cost sharing agreements with all States with the exception of South Australia and Tasmania whose agreements had some years to run and whose governments-one Liberal and one Labor-recognised the inequities of the Government's proposals and would not have a bar of them. Not only were the proposals inequitable but also they were incompetent and not thought through. As a result the Government found itself in the position of paying the States a grant calculated to cover the costs of providing pharmaceuticals in public hospitals. In addition to this, because of the failure, as I said, to think things through, the Government found itself liable to reimburse the States for these pharmaceuticals under section 99 of the Health Insurance Act. This was potentially double dipping on a grand scale. We had the spectacle of Senator Peter Baume, then the Acting Minister for Health, coming into this chamber in September to say that the new health scheme was defective and that the Government intended to amend it when possible. Hence this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975 we have had six health schemes in this country. Each has had to be drastically changed after almost 12 months operation in each case. In this one the legislation was defective in conception and had to be adjusted only a couple of weeks after birth. We do not oppose the amendment. The whole scheme is inequitable and unfair but without this amendment it would be even more ludicrous. The States which oppose the new arrangements are amused and bemused by the incompetence of the Government. Those in the bureaucracy who have to attempt to translate the Government's hare-brained schemes into action are considering the agreements for similar mistakes and we will have to deal with those mistakes later. </PARA>
<PARA> This small amendment, like others, is a measure of the incompetence and lack of planning, and many such examples have littered and will litter the path of this benighted Government. The second section of the Bill intends to increase patient contributions to pharmaceutical benefits from $2.75 to $3.20 per item. It is in line with the Government's continued policy to introduce a user pays principle into our health scheme. The users in this case are the sick, particularly those with chronic illnesses and recurrent illnesses such as asthma, children with recurrent respiratory diseases, particularly those low income earners who qualify for assistance with health insurance but not pharmaceutical benefits and those who fall just outside the cut-off point for the disadvantage card. It is worth noting that large families with children in the years who suffer from childhood complaints such as recurrent upper respiratory tract infections are particularly heavy users of pharmaceutical benefits in the community. They are the families who will suffer the most from this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is worth thinking about another aspect of this problem. The usual justification for the introduction of a user pays principle is that in the market situation people have a choice of what goods and services they will buy and, therefore, they can regulate their expenditure according to their means and needs. The argument goes that they should therefore pay accordingly. This, as we have emphasised on numerous occasions in this place, does not apply to those who use and need pharmaceutical benefits, namely, the sick. Neither the nature of the purchase nor the time of purchase is the choice of the consumer. The time is dependent on illness and circumstances beyond the control of the patient and the choice of a pharmaceutical agent is almost entirely the choice of a third person, namely, the doctor. This is not a market situation in any normal sense; it never has been and it never will be. It is not appropriate that the user pays principle applies either in the pharmaceutical area or in the health area. It is the situation of an essential service needed by the patient and the provision of that service at a reasonable cost. The control of this is a legitimate function of government. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed to be determined in the case of pharmaceuticals is, in fact, what is a reasonable cost. Any cost which places too large a financial burden on the patient or those in need, or limits access to health care by limiting access either to a doctor or to medicines, is too high. Both the present health system and the prescription charges which were introduced into this legislation will do this to a significant group of patients. It will make the cost too high. It is for this reason that we must look at this increase in pharmaceutical benefits in the context of the Government's new health insurance system. </PARA>
<PARA> Already there is a problem with prescription charges at $2.75. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia and individual pharmacists have produced plans which they believe will overcome the problems of low income and large families. They believe it will overcome the problems of those who need multiple items or repeat prescriptions but who they know, as practising pharmacists, cannot obtain the medicine they need or are limited in the number of medicines they can purchase through the pharmaceutical benefits system because of the cost. I think every member of this Senate has received either correspondence from or been approached by members of the Pharmacy Guild and individual pharmacists who are increasingly concerned with this problem which faces patients who have chronic and recurrent illnesses and who need continual medication. It is for this reason that these people, including Mr Hodges in another place, who is a pharmacist, continually talk about changing the scheme to bring the cost of pharmaceuticals to a reasonable level for this group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not true, as Government spokesmen sometimes say, that the group which falls outside the disadvantage card group or those on benefits who cannot receive pharmaceutical benefits can go to public hospitals and public hospital pharmacies. There is not the distribution of public hospitals and such pharmacies throughout this country to enable them to do so. Since 1975 the increase in the cost of pharmaceutical items will have risen by 113 per cent, far in excess of the consumer price index over that time. If this increased cost is added to the increased costs involved under the new health insurance system we have a very real problem facing many low income earners and disadvantaged people in this community who need pharmaceuticals. It is for this reason that the Opposition will oppose these increases. This should hardly cause the Government much distress. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not easy to determine from an examination of the Budget Papers how much increased revenue to the Government will result from these increases. In the notes on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) the Government talks about $5.7m flowing from a number of factors including a variation in the mix of benefit items prescribed and a decline in the volume of prescriptions dispensed due to the removal of some items from the pharmaceutical benefits service list and, to a lesser degree, the increased patient contribution. This is a miniscule amount in the overall Budget. We believe that the combination of the new health insurance program and the increased pharmaceutical benefits represents an unsatisfactory system of health and access to health in this community. We believe that we should do everything we can to reduce the burden on people affected by the increased costs in this system. It is for this reason that in Committee we will oppose that part of the Bill which seeks to increase these charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has already been pointed out tonight, there are two main purposes to the National Health Amendment Bill which is before us tonight. The first is to correct a Government oversight relating to the payment of funds to the States and the other is to increase the patient contribution for prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, the first matter is a perfectly clear cut one. The Government made a mistake and is setting about correcting that mistake. It was a silly mistake but it could have been an expensive one. It is certainly not the first mistake that the Government has made this year and I doubt that it will be the last. We are certainly not going to put the Government in a position of not being able to correct the blunders that it makes. Of course, I think our attitude is particularly generous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second element of this Bill, however, relates to clause 3 which provides for an increase in the patient contribution for pharmaceuticals from $2.75 to $3.20-a 45c increase due to operate from 1 December and an increase which has been depicted by speakers from either side of the Senate as being something either akin to a Christmas present or a crime the magnitude of which is only slightly less than that of the great train robbery. It really is neither. In fact, the increase of 16 per cent since the last increase two years ago is considerably less than the increase of 50 per cent which the Labor Government introduced over the four year period to 1975. So even taken on an annual basis, this increase is by no means any worse than the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits rate that the Labor Government in 1975 was prepared to concede was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The major problem with the Bill is not what it says or what it does but what it does not say or does not do, and to a certain extent this has already been canvassed by Senator Grimes. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> As in the past pensioners holding a pensioner health benefits card and their dependents will not be charged for pharmaceutical benefits. Similarly, no charge will be made for sickness beneficiaries holding a health benefits card and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately this benefit does not extend to some one million or so unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged people in the community unless they happen to have ready access to the outpatients department of a public hospital. This, of course, is not always possible, nor is it always desirable. I think most of us are aware of the fact that isolated patients do not have ready access to a public hospital. It is not even always easy for those living in cities where there are public hospitals with the appropriate out-patients departments. Some people have to catch several buses or make long trips across the city to get to those out-patients departments. This, of course, increases the cost to them. If the person concerned is a mother with, say, several small children the trip itself is a nightmare and the lengthy delay in the out-patients department of sometimes up to eight hours does not bear thinking about. I might add that this is not a criticism in any way at all of the staff of outpatient departments. They do the best they can under particularly trying circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It therefore seems rather ironic that, considering outpatient departments are almost by their very nature used to excess by the disadvantaged sections of the community, the situation has only worsened by the Government's allowing this anomaly to persist. Such a situation does not do anything to help anyone at all. It is in fact to prod the Government into ending this anomaly that the Democrats seek to move an amendment to the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should give urgent consideration to alleviating the burden on those unemployed and generally socially disadvantaged people who are not at present entitled to exemption or relief from the cost of pharmaceuticals'. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer honourable senators to the editorial in the October edition of The Australian Journal of Pharmacy. The editorial is headed 'Whose policy is this, Mr MacKellar?' The first sentence, the most pertinent one for my purposes tonight, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, it can now be said, has achieved a bi-partisan policy in at least one area: that of payments under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to drug manufacturers and pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA>The rest of the article points out how similar the Government's attitudes are to those of the Labor Opposition in certain areas affecting health care and pharmaceutical benefits in particular. I can see no reason, therefore, why Australia cannot go one step further and adopt a bipartisan, or even a tripartisan, approach to the application of some sort of relief from the costs of pharmaceuticals for disadvantaged persons not at present eligible for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is even more reason for my hopefulness on these grounds when we look at page 16 of the November edition of the AMA Gazette which discusses some of the Labor Party's attitudes to this suggestion. Certainly the Labor Party policy is not incompatible with it. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is considering including pharmaceuticals in the new health insurance plan it is developing. </PARA>
<PARA> The party's Shadow Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, told the annual meeting of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association that such an approach might be the most effective to deal with a number of problems evident under present arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the problems that are evident under the present arrangements are apparent even to the mythical blind Freddy. They are concerned particularly with those who are chronically ill, those who have to look after the chronically ill and those who are in receipt of the disadvantaged persons card. They affect also, of course, those people who are just marginally over the income limit for access to a disadvantaged persons card. I was particularly pleased to hear Senator Grimes mention this problem since I hope that it indicates, if only tacitly, future Australian Labor Party support for the Australian Democrats' Health Act Amendment Bill (No. 2) which was introduced earlier this session and which seeks to overcome the anomaly which exists in the form of an absolute cut-off line for disadvantaged people by introducing a sliding scale system. That, however, is a debate which I dare say I will have out with Senator Grimes at some later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe or hope that all other parties in this Senate believe that those who can afford to pay should do so and that those who can afford to pay and do should subsidise those who cannot-a sort of income distribution scheme on a minor scale, if you like. That belief is certainly behind the Democrats' intention not to oppose outright clause 3 of the National Health Amendment Bill. We are not prepared to do that because, as our amendment to the second reading motion says, we believe that something must be done at present to end the anomaly whereby certain unemployed and socially disadvantaged people get no assistance from the Government for the cost of their pharmaceuticals. That is an anomaly which is clearly evident when one compares the benefits that are available to pensioners who have pensioner health benefit cards and whose incomes are highly unlikely to be any worse than the incomes of those on unemployment benefits or simply on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Democrats are not prepared to oppose the minimal rise proposed by the Government in clause 3, in order-I stress that it is only in order-that the Government is given no excuse to duck its responsibility to the disadvantaged in the community by claiming that it has been denied funds, however minuscule Senator Grimes alleges they are, with which at least to begin to implement some sort of equalisation scheme. As I said earlier, figures are being flung around with gay abandon but apparently with very little regard either to actuality or to mathematic precision, and certainly not to the real issue at hand which is not how compatible the figures are-that is, the figures for cost of living increases vis-a-vis increases in pharmaceutical benefits-but whether the needy, the disadvantaged and the economically vulnerable can be protected from any cost, present or future, of medicines that they are likely to be forced to buy. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a phone call from Adelaide late this evening which alerted me to an article in today's News, the Adelaide afternoon newspaper. The article, on page 20 is headed: 'Cancer, poverty hit family'. It concerns a family named Woods which consists of a father who has cancer, a mother who has muscular dystrophy and five children who presumably are all healthy, since the article did not mention that there was anything other than normal childhood complaints wrong with them. Mr Woods has had a colostomy, because of which he needs on a regular basis suppositories which apparently, at least according to this article, are no longer on the free list. I am only going on the article and Senator Baume can correct me if that is not so. The point made is that he cannot afford the regular $14 that this medication costs. This is a fairly extreme case but when one takes into account the fact that they have to have a wheelchair for the wife, that she has a particularly disabling sickness and that they have five children who would not be normal if they did not come down with childhood complaints which require medication, one can see that the situation is indeed grim-extreme, but grim. </PARA>
<PARA> The general consensus within the industry is that the average person needs in the vicinity of five or six prescriptions a year; that is, an average, ordinary, relatively healthy person. The increase proposed by the Government of 45c in the contribution fee which these people will be expected to pay for those five or six prescriptions a year will amount to something like $2.70 per annum, an amount of money which is hardly likely to send the normal, working, average person to the wall. However, as I have said before and as Senator Grimes also pointed out, the problem lies not with those whose wage or income is the average weekly wage or better but with those whose wage or income is less than the average weekly wage, who are not pensioners entitled to the benefits of the pensioner health benefit card, who do not have ready access to out-patient departments of public hospitals and who are or who care for chronically ill people. I spent a considerable part of yesterday discussing not only my amendment but also clause 3 of the Bill with both the industry, represented by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, and the Australian Council of Social Services, a group whose concern is predominantly with the have-nots in the community. I was pleased that both organisations not only shared my concern for those people in special need who are not at present being catered for but also agreed that the way around the situation is to allow clause 3 to pass and to induce the Government, by grovelling, pleading or something else, to use that money as a starting point for alleviating the financial hardship which is being forced--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. I am being as reasonable and as reasoned as I possibly can, given the emotiveness of the topic. I am sure he appreciates that. Nevertheless, those organisations believe, as we believe, that that amount of money could be used a starting point for alleviating the financial burdens on those people in need who are not covered by some other means in the system that gives them exemption or relief from the cost of pharmaceuticals. It seems to me that if the Government is prepared to allow pensioners relief from the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased from a chemist and if it is prepared to repay the State governments, even if it does it only once and not twice, for their outlay on the provision of pharmaceuticals to the disadvantaged through out-patients departments, there is no reason why it cannot offer that same assistance to the disadvantaged by allowing them to get their scripts filled at a pharmacy by an ordinary chemist. It seems to me that there would be no greater cost to the Government and a lot less hardship and inconvenience, and extra cost, to the disadvantaged and the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is happening at the moment-from memory I suspect that Senator Grimes touched upon this and certainly it is something about which the Pharmacy Guild is particularly concerned-is that chemists are being placed in an extremely invidious position. Customers are walking into their pharmacies with three or four or more scripts and saying 'We can only afford one. Please select the appropriate one, the best one for our needs'. That is asking a chemist not only to play God, which is bad enough, but also to do a job he is neither paid nor qualified to do. It is almost as bad as placing the mother of a child in the position of deciding herself, before she goes to the chemist, which of a series of prescriptions she will have filled for her child because she is unable to have the lot filled. The news release that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia put out yesterday sums up more than adequately the attitude of the Australian Democrats. As I said before, it is an attitude that ACOSS supports fully. Part of the Guild's position on the matter is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . 'While recognising the need for the Government to increase the patient contribution in line with inflation, provision needs to be made for those in special need. In the past our proposals have not been adopted on the grounds of difficulty in administration and cost of providing the concession. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the health care card has provided a mechanism for identifying people to whom such concessions could be made available.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Guild claims that there is little point in providing those in special need with free medical attention, if they are unable to afford the patient contribution for medication prescribed by their medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Guild has again urged the Government to make a commitment to grant a significant concession on the patient contribution to health care card holders and to announce its intentions as a matter of urgency' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There the news release ends. Tacitly implied in that is the point that it is not the 45c increase which is doing the damage; it is the original $2.75 cost which is becoming an intolerable burden for this relatively small group of people who are not able to take advantage of any other concession scheme. I put as strongly as I can to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and to the Government that they seriously consider doing what the Democrats amendment requests; that is, to give urgent consideration to-indeed, to take urgent action-alleviating the burden on those unemployed and genuinely socially disadvantaged people who are not at present entitled to exemption or relief from the cost of pharmaceuticals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Laudable as the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats undoubtedly is, I have my reservations whether the Australian Labor Party would share the optimism of the Democrats that the Government will be persuaded to add another patch to, or to cobble or darn, the tattered garment which is all that remains of the National Health Scheme as we now see it. In the Australian Broadcasting Commission program Background Briefing of 23 August this year, Professor George Palmer of the Department of Health Administration, University of New South Wales, spoke of the increasing privatisation of health services. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . The total amount of private medicine being practised, and I mean private fee for service medicine, both within private and public hospitals, is likely to be increased, or at least there are going to be pressures to increase. So there's no question that the big winners, the people who are most likely to benefit most, are those who one can broadly describe as being the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that is what we are seeing. Every successive change in health services is inexorably adding to the advantage of the private sector and subtracting from public access to quality health care. Increasing the patient contribution by about 15 per cent, which is what this 45c increase will do, and despite the Government's own calculation of a 10 per cent or an 11 per cent increase in wages over the next 12 months, may not at first glance appear to be particularly significant. Many people, however, especially families on low household incomes, those who are chronically ill and those with children, have over the past six or eight years come to rely on government hospitals for their out-patient treatment because for one reason or another they have been unable to receive the advantage of bulk billing from a private practitioner. Now, unless they are very poor and entitled to a health card or are comfortably situated and privately insured, they may be without any assistance at all. Previously they could use out-patient consulting facilities and be supplied with drugs from the hospital pharmacy free of charge. Nasty shocks are in store for many such low income earners because now in most cases they will be required to pay $15 for each out-patient visit plus the $3.20 which will now be the cost of each prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> Community health services are also being forced to charge all but pensioners and card holders. Certainly this is the case in all Western Australian government hospitals. Late last year when changes to hospital funding were being anticipated the Western Australian Government issued instructions to all the hospital pharmacists restricting the maximum allowable on each prescription to seven days supply for emergency outpatients, 14 days supply for out-patients under specialist treatment and 14 days supply for in-patients under specialist treatment. No larger quantity was to be dispensed except with the express permission of the hospital administrator. This directive meant that those who depended on the local hospital for their contraceptives, for example, could no longer be prescribed oral contraceptives, for which of course monthly or two-monthly packs are the only rational method of dispensing. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time many people, some young, some not so young, are without the only low cost source of family planning advice that had previously been available to them. Family planning clinics, where they exist, are battling to maintain adequate services with diminishing funds. Oral contraceptives can still be provided at a slighly discounted rate through the family planning services but for a growing proportion of women-up to 50 per cent-who choose another method of contraception there is nowhere they can go to obtain devices or advice free of charge. In Western Australia a diaphragm costs from $10 to $15 an intra-uterine device costs from $15 to $20, and family planning clinics have no choice but to pass the cost on to the woman concerned. The Family Planning Association says that since 1 September about 20 per cent of those previously eligible for bulk billing must now pay as they fall outside the income test. </PARA>
<PARA> The King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women is now forced to charge all out-patients $15 for each consultation plus $3 for each prescription. Community health care workers confirm that where the family is poor money is found for the children's health care but women's health tends to be neglected. Obviously the intention of this Government and of the State Government of Western Australia is to force people to attend private practitioners, regardless of their circumstances or of their personal preference. It has been suggested to me that sensitive, reliable, skilled general practitioners are so busy that one waits weeks for an appointment even where the choice is financially viable. </PARA>
<PARA> Public hospital treatment, after all, is what our taxes provide. It is surely a sign of an abysmally inept and callous government if any individual is deprived of medical care or essential medication because of inability to afford it, and this is where the policies of this Government are leading. Hospital treatment is becoming more expensive and therefore less accessible. The theory is, of course, that most people can afford private advice. But we know that the burden of medical insurance is only one of the many recent financial punishments meted out to Australian workers and their families. Doctors and chemists bills may well be the last straw for families already struggling to make ends meet after coping as best they can with rising housing loan repayments, high income tax, heavy transport costs and vicious State charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Opit of the School of Social and Preventive Medicine at Monash University, during the Background Briefing program to which I previously referred, made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done, it seems, is not to have understood history . . . Neither the very rich nor the very poor who tend to be polarised in their voting patterns are going to be greatly affected. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly those who will be affected are low income earners eligible for health cards but not for pharmaceutical benefits; those who are marginally better off but who are ineligible for a health card and not able to afford health insurance but faced with heavy hospital costs if they do not insure; and the chronically ill. There are also significant numbers who have returned to the work force after extensive surgery or after very serious illness but who will need medication, often in large quantities and of a number of different kinds, for the rest of their lives. An extra 45c on each repeat of each prescription is an impost that these people could do without, especially those in the same position as the Western Australians who had expected that life supporting drugs would continue to be available free of charge and in appropriate quantities through the government hospitals. Such people are often the owners of prescription books, similar to the one that I have in my hand, which tend to become volumes over a few years. This one has been current for five years. It has just become useless. This book belongs to a Western Australian who developed an extremely severe liver disease from which he was fortunate to recover. For the last five years and until very recently he had been able to receive from the government hospital reasonable quantities of the drugs that he required-up to three months supply of anything up to a range of seven medications which he must have if he is to remain in the work force, continuing to pay taxes--</PARA>

<PARA> Professor Opit clearly states his position, and it makes eminent sense. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> We need to have a public utility system that is the responsibility of the government. It should not be means tested: If you pay income tax you are financing the system. And then outside that I want to see if people and doctors want to provide a private consumption system which can do anything it likes and if people want to pay for that by agreement then that's their right. But I want the two systems disentangled and at present they are hopelessly entangled. </PARA>
<PARA>I add that this is to the disadvantage of such people as we have been discussing tonight. Over the years there have been calls for the cessation of hospital outpatient dispensing. What is happening now is a blatant attempt to price all outpatient care out of reach, which indirectly has the same effect. The result can only be deterioration in the health of the nation, further stress for families already under severe financial pressure and more unplanned pregnancies. Is this what the Government sets out to achieve?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to Senator Haines's amendment which, in fact, seeks to add to the motion this expression of opinion-'that the Government should give urgent consideration to alleviating the burden on those unemployed and generally socially disadvantaged people who are not at present entitled to exemption or relief from the cost of pharmaceuticals.' Of course, the Opposition has no objection to this amendment; we will support it. We will support it in the knowledge that in fact it does very little but perform the useful function of expressing a view and highlighting a group of people in the community who are obviously disadvantaged. The Government, in its new health scheme, has chosen the group to be disadvantaged. It has chosen to give most of them access to health insurance and health care without access to pharmaceutical benefits. I do not share Senator Haines's hopes that the Government will take notice of that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We must keep trying and we must live in hope. I suppose that is all that keeps some people in this place-even some people in this country-going. In fact, the first legislative act of this Government after achieving power in 1975 was to abolish the subsidised health and pharmaceutical benefit scheme of the time. Although I share the honourable senator's hopes, perhaps I do not have the confidence that she has that the Government will in fact take notice of the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another point I would like to make about the matter. Even if the Government does take up Senator Haines's proposal it will still leave out a large group of people in the community who are disadvantaged, particularly that group of people of whom Senator Haines has spoken in the past and about whom I have spoken. I refer to people who fall just outside the cut off point for the new disadvantaged cards. In fact the Government's scheme for disadvantaged cards bears little relationship to need. It is a crude measurement. For example, consider the situation of a family of a husband, wife and two children just below the cut off point who will receive access to health care and who, under Senator Haines's proposal, will receive free pharmaceutical benefits; as indeed they should. The problem is that families $1 or $2 above the level with the same number of children will get nothing. They will have to pay health insurance and the increased pharmaceutical benefit costs. The family just under the level may have healthy children, and the adults may be healthy, but the family just over the level may have asthma, epilepsy or other chronic and/or recurrent illness. Therefore, under this scheme there is no relationship to need at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we also have situations like this: A 16-year-old or 17-year-old living at home and earning $95 a week will get a disadvantaged card but an adult with a chronic illness, earning slightly more money, will not get a disadvantaged card and, under Senator Haines's proposal, will get no free pharmaceuticals. Although we agree that this group should get free or reduced pharmaceutical benefits we would not like to give the impression, in our support of the amendment, that in fact we think this is an answer to the inequities of our present health insurance and health scheme generally. As Senator Giles pointed out, and as I believe I pointed out, in a health system, in both the provision of health services and pharmaceuticals, it is quite inappropriate to apply the sort of market mechanisms which exist in the provision of other goods and services in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what I said before: The patient can choose neither the time that he needs the services nor the time that he needs the pharmaceuticals. In fact, the patient does not choose what services he will receive or what pharmaceuticals he will receive. That choice is made by another person-the doctor. Therefore, patients cannot adjust their expenditure to suit their needs or their means. Until we recognise this, until we provide a health system such as is provided in most European countries, Canada and other places, one that is public whereby this burden is not placed on people who cannot afford it at that time, or who cannot afford it at any time because of their low incomes, we will not have a fair and equitable health system. If people want to go outside that system, if people want to opt out of the public scheme and enter into a private health insurance system, so be it; but the provision should be available under a universal health scheme for all citizens in the community. That scheme should include the provision of pharmaceuticals. Therefore, we support the Australian Democrats' amendment more in hope than faith that anything will come of it. We will persist with our opposition to clause 3 when the Committee stage is reached. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering a National Health Amendment Bill with two legs to it. Honourable senators who have spoken already have indicated that there is support for the first part of the Bill which seeks to correct an anomaly which has arisen following the amendments introduced earlier this year. I thank honourable senators for that support. I understand that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the second part of the Bill which seeks to increase the patient contribution for pharmaceutical products obtained under this scheme. The debate really has not concerned itself so much with those two matters. It has concerned itself with a number of problems at the margin; a number of problems of people who may not be covered by the scheme and for whom there is some concern that in fact they could be better catered for under the arrangements that we have in this country. The Government is aware of this problem. It is keen to see debates such as this occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the new arrangements we will find that health insurance for three out of every four Australians-when we take account of all the measures involved in the new health insurance scheme-is cheaper than it was previously. That is so when we take into account the very considerable contributions the Government has made, for example by way of $200m to the reinsurance trust funds, the fact that there is now a flat rate reimbursement of 30 per cent for all medical benefit items as a Commonwealth benefit, the fact that it has relieved the health insurance funds of the burden of paying nursing home benefits for insured persons-that is a further Commonwealth Government subvention of $120m a year-and, of course, by providing a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar for those who take out health insurance. The package adds up to one which has very real costs by way of subvention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not yet tried in any way to make fun of or not take seriously the very fair contribution that the honourable senator has made. The point I make is that, whatever action we take, it will be necessary to match our revenue capacity against what we want to do by way of subvention. For better or for worse, we chose a series of options for the subventions we could make this year. The amount that went into the reinsurance fund was a decision, a choice between priorities. The $120m for nursing homes was a choice. The tax rebate was a choice. That does not mean that the Government cannot consider further choices or further options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say as a doctor, and as a doctor who is a specialist physician, that one of the great banes of my life was the problem of overmedication, unnecessary medication and inappropriate medication. I might say to honourable senators that, as a matter of fact, a large amount of the medication used in this country is ineffective, inappropriate or unnecessary. That does not alter the fact-I do not move away from the argument Senator Haines and others have put-that there is a part of medication which is both necessary and appropriate. However, I make the point that polypharmacy generally-not always but generally-indicates sloppy medicine. That is why I was concerned at the example Senator Giles gave. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just saying that that is one other part of the problem. Of course, in relation to the proposed increase in the patient contribution, we are following a well trodden path. The Australian Labor Party when in government, Senator Grimes when in government, supported an increase of 50 per cent in the patient contribution on one occasion. In 1975 the Australian Labor Party supported an increase from $1 to $1.50 in the patient contribution. What does that prove? It proves nothing more than that the principle has been well established: That the patient contribution is there, can be increased and can be increased by socialist as well as non-socialist governments. If it was proper for it to be increased by the Labor Party in 1975, it is equally proper for it to be increased now. Senator Grimes is laughing. If he wants to argue the point later I will produce a whole series of indices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to devote my remarks to the amendment moved by Senator Haines and to the propositions she advanced. I say to her that it probably is not appropriate for the Government to support her amendment to the motion that this Bill be read a second time. Having said that, I say to her that the sentiment expressed in her amendment-namely, that consideration should be given to a particular aspect-is one which will be brought straight away to the attention of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). If there are at the margin problems which require a further subvention, further effort or initiatives by government, that is something which we will make sure that we take on board and examine. Yes, at the present time patients who have health care cards can get relief through public hospitals. Yes, there may be some disadvantages in their doing that, but some exemption and relief is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator said that she wanted a different model. She named a particular model which she thought might be appropriate. I am perfectly happy to look at that model, but whether the extension of the pensioner medical scheme for pharmaceuticals is an appropriate way of achieving what she wants to achieve I do not know. One of the problems we face is that, with the best will in the world, it is very difficult to know with any certainty exactly what the size of the problem is. If honourable senators were to think about it they would realise that most of the comments we have heard have been anecdotal comments-they have been the impressions of people in either pharmacy practice or medical practice-on the extent of the problem. We can identify-Senator Grimes has done so-where some of the problems might lie. I hope that we can look at whether it is possible to get an idea of the dimensions of the problem and of what might be the size of the subvention needed. We take on board the problem raised by the Australian Democrats. The Minister for Health has indicated that he certainly will look at it. Whilst we do not support the proposed amendment, we adopt that approach on that basis, with a great degree of goodwill and with a considerable degree of agreement on the concern expressed by Senator Haines in moving her amendment. I commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 3 of the National Health Amendment Bill has the effect of increasing to $3.20 the patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits and, of course, excludes people who hold pensioner medical cards and others. The Opposition opposes this clause. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, in summing up for the Government at the second reading stage of the Bill, suggested that what we were in fact dealing with was a problem around the margins. The problem with those margins is that within them are people who are ill, people who frequently have recurrent illnesses, and people who can ill afford not only the pharmaceuticals which they require-many of them have no access to the pharmacies of public hospitals-but also the increased health insurance costs or, alternatively, the very high health costs they would have to pay if they did not take out health insurance. These people may be considered by the Government to be on the margins, but they are real, live people who deserve the concern of this community and whose problems would be assisted, initially, by a universal health insurance scheme and, secondly, by a scheme which included pharmaceuticals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume introduced an argument which we hear often from the other side of the chamber. He, as a doctor, pointed out that there was considerable overmedication, inappropriate medication and unnecessary medication in the community and that the practice of polypharmacy often represented this. I, as a doctor, could not agree with him more. I assume that the only reason he introduced this argument was to take up the point which, as I said, is so often taken up on that side of the chamber; namely, that something can be done about this, that indeed it is appropriate for something to be done about this, by imposing a penalty by increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals. I repeat, as I have many times in this place: If there is overmedication, and there is, if there is inappropriate medication, and there is, if there is unnecessary medication, and there is, it is not the fault of the patient in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is not solved by increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals or by imposing a penalty on people requiring access to health care in this community. It must be solved at the level of the doctor. We must, if necessary, reduce the expectations of people in this community for various forms of treatment, including pharmaceutical treatment. If Senator Baume did not bring that matter in as an argument, I do not know why he brought it up at all. But we have heard it so often from him and other honourable senators on that side of the chamber that one can assume that he is bringing up that old furphy again. He mentioned that so much of the evidence of the difficulties faced by people in the community in relation to this matter was, in fact, anecdotal. I assume that he was partly referring to the anecdotal but true story--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not quantitative. The honourable senator also mentioned the pharmacists and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Pharmacy Guild, which represents almost every pharmacist in this country, has said that there is a problem of people who cannot afford to pay the present $2.75 per item; and how much greater will the problem be when the cost is increased to $3.20. The Government may solve some of its problems of overmedication by people not being able to afford it but unfortunately people who need the medication will not be able to afford it or will avoid paying for it altogether. I thought that Senator Baume's best and most extraordinary argument was that it was appropriate for the Government to increase the cost of pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions because the Labor Government did so in 1975. I suggest that it is appropriate for the Government to introduce a universal health insurance scheme, which the Labor Government did. Many other matters are appropriate, but surely it is phoney for Senator Baume to introduce such an argument, particularly as his government has increased the cost of pharmaceuticals by 113 per cent since it came into power. I point out that that is far in excess of the consumer price index increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe this legislation cannot be taken in isolation and that one cannot consider in isolation the cost of pharmaceuticals to the patients of this country. One has to consider it in the light of the inequitable health insurance scheme that has been introduced. One has to consider it in the light of the increased costs of health insurance and health care which will be imposed on many people in this community who cannot afford them. One has to consider the legislation in light of the fact that it involves a flat rate payment which bears no relation to what people can afford to pay. In the light of all those facts we believe that the least we can do as a party is to say to the Government that it should stop making these changes. The Government should take out the tiny cost to the revenue which is involved in this increase from $2.75 to $3.20, go away to consider not only the proposals contained in Senator Haines's amendment-to bring in that limited group of disadvantaged people-but also, over the next three months, the very real difficulties which many people in the community will face because of these increased costs. If the Government does this and looks at it fairly I believe it will come up with a proper health insurance scheme. It is for this reason that as well as supporting, as we did, the amendment moved by Senator Haines, we persist in our opposition to clause 3 of the Bill. This clause seeks to impose an added injustice in the health system of this community. We will persist with our opposition. Whether anyone else goes along with us is immaterial. We are concerned about the costs in general of health care, including pharmaceuticals, to the ordinary men and women of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make one or two comments in relation to clause 3 of the National Health Amendment Bill 1981. I covered the matter, I think, fairly adequately in my speech at the second reading stage. For the record I wish to itemise again the reasons the Australian Democrats will not oppose this increase. The first is that in the last two years there has been an increase of something like 16.4 per cent compared with-if one must make comparisons-the 25 per cent a year increase that took place between 1971 and 1975 when the Labor Government introduced its increases.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I am doing it because it seems to be the going game. I agree with Senator Grimes that it is pointless to say that the Liberal Government is increasing the patient contribution by 16.4 per cent when Labor did it by a much more substantial amount. That is pointless. As I said earlier, the increase of 45c is nothing to people who are disadvantaged in comparison with the $2.75 which is already there. It is the $2.75 which is the stumbling block, not the 45c increase. I believe, however naive that belief may be, that it is better to give the Government an opportunity to use the $5.7m-or whatever amount Senator Grimes said would be raised from this increase-for the benefit of those disadvantaged people. I do not agree with Senator Grimes that they are a small group of people. In a country which has a population of slightly in excess of 15 million, I can not see how he can define a group of one million or close to it as being small.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment that the Australian Democrats moved and had passed to the second reading motion is one which does ask that the economic burden on one million people be alleviated by giving them some exemption or relief from the cost of pharmaceuticals. It is for that reason I cannot fathom the incongruity or illogicality of agreeing with the hopes expressed-however pious and however unlikely to come to fruition Senator Grimes seems to think they are-in that second reading amendment and then cutting off the Government's access to that, I agree, relatively small amount of money which may induce the Government to take action. It seems to me to be cutting off the nose of the disadvantaged to spite the political face of the Australian Labor Party. The Democrats believe the Government has the right to be given the opportunity to show whether it has any scruples. In doing so, I am prepared to sacrifice that $5.7m to the potential greater good of one million disadvantaged people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been provoked by Senator Haines. Senator Haines seems to believe that by my remarks-I hope that when I read Hansard I will see there is no justification for what she seems to believe-I was inferring that the problem of the unemployed and the generally socially disadvantaged people, who as she said, comprise of about one million people in this community, was a small problem involving a small group. I used the expression 'small' in referring to the suggestion of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) that what we are talking about was this group of people around the margins. The Opposition and I supported Senator Haines's amendment because obviously there is a case for providing pharmaceutical benefits to that group of unemployed and generally disadvantaged people. My qualifications on that support were that I did not share her hope that the Government would do much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second qualification I had was that large numbers of people are outside the scope of that amendment. Perhaps that group will come into the scope of Senator Haines's private member's Bill which she intends to introduce at a later time and will, in fact, not be affected by her amendment and by any Government action, however unlikely that may be. It is because we are concerned about all people inside and outside that group that we persist with our opposition to clause 3. We do not think that the number of people involved is small, nor do we think that their problems are small. We believe that their problems can be solved only by a comprehensive and universal health scheme. If I suggested to Senator Haines in anything that I said that either I or the Opposition think that this is only a small group and that their problems are small, I apologise. I will be more careful with my words in future. I am just disappointed that Senator Haines thinks that we or any party in this Parliament should be in the game of bartering off one group against another. We cannot understand why Senator Haines and her colleagues will not persist in opposing clause 3 as well as with the amendment that they have moved, but that is their choice; they must make their own decision. They chose to oppose tertiary education fees, using logic which I suggest is hardly consistent with their failure to oppose clause 3; but logic does not always apply in political arguments in this place. I reiterate that we persist in our opposition to clause 3. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening the Committee was discussing points which had been raised by Senator Grimes about the dispute which for a considerable period has plagued the Department of Social Security. It must be said that, despite the contribution made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), the Opposition is not satisfied that everything that should be done is being done to resolve this vexed question of stand-downs and industrial disputation which is disrupting social security payments in New South Wales and Victoria and may become more extensive. I think the Senate was entitled to expect that the Government would have handled this dispute in a much better way with a view to resolving the differences that clearly exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not believe that public servants as a whole are responsible. We do not believe that the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, which covers the public servants, is also irresponsible. In fact, the evidence shows that this dispute is the first industrial experience a great majority of the members of the Department of Social Security who have been stood down have had. Surely it has to be recognised by the Minister and the Government that the members concerned have a genuine grievance. They believe that the policies being pursued by the Government, which can generally be related to the area of cutbacks in the work force, are not commensurate with the extra responsibilities that the members of that Department have been called upon to carry out. The members believe that despite some improvement by the Government in the numbers employed in the work force there is still a need for considerably more staff to be employed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this situation flows from decisions made by this Government over the last several years which were designed to affect the number of persons employed in all of the government departments. When the situation reaches the point where staff ceilings have the effect of creating disaffection and inefficiencies and where the industrial relations in the Department have deteriorated to the degree that they have, I think the Senate is entitled to expect of the Government a much more co-operative attitude and a better determination to resolve the differences that clearly exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should not just see the acts done at the head of the Department level. They can only be described as provocative and needling. Over the years the members of the staff have given yeoman service to the public while working in a very difficult area. These officers have to deal people in our society who are disadvantaged and who, in many cases, feel that they need compassion and understanding of the sorts of problems they face when they go to discuss these problems at the counter and seek interviews, whether they be about unemployment benefits or other social security payments. We find that the Department and the Government are adopting what can only be described as a dog in the manger attitude, an attitude of obstinancy. They are saying that they are not prepared to resolve the dispute until the work bans have been lifted. The fact is that the dispute has been simmering for more than two years. </PARA>
<PARA> It must surely be of concern to the Senate that nobody is winning this issue. The Government is standing pat and the staff is standing pat. The social security beneficiaries are the people who are affected by this obstinate attitude. I do not think it is proper that the Government should take the view that it will tough out this dispute on the basis that the ACOA, which is the appropriate Association covering the employees, is somehow or other involved in some sort of ideological struggle with the Government. Enough evidence is available to show that close to 400 officers have been stood down. They were not just officers at the lower end of the scale; some senior people were involved. These officers responded because of the extra tasks they have been given as part of their normal daily duties. It just stands to reason that they would object. The very strong criticism that has been made of the Public Service Board in recent days by appropriate authorities in the industrial field indicates that one does not need to have the wisdom of Solomon to appreciate that if workers are given tasks over and above their normal tasks one can expect a reaction. That happens to be part of human nature. If management persists in that process, inevitably it leads to industrial conflict and dispute of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association has been suggesting that, because of the razor gang cuts, extra tasks have been allocated to the staff of the Department of Social Security, tasks which were previously carried out by the Commonwealth Employment Service, and that there are established forms and processes by which these matters are normally resolved. Of course, this has led to a breakdown in relations with the Government. The Minister says that it is a matter for his departmental head and that he is not prepared to become involved until the work bans have been lifted. I think it was Senator Chaney who said on 2 July that the staff ceilings for the Department would be increased by 152 and that additional steps would be taken to increase that number. But the following day the Federal Secretary of the ACOA, Mr Paul Munro, said that that number was not sufficient and that this statement contradicted negotiations and an understanding the union had with the Department. It contradicted a June 1980 joint departmental-ACOA working party report stating that the Department needed at least 500 extra staff for relief purposes. That undertaking was given, of course, prior to the additional tasks being allocated to the Department of Social Security arising out of changes in areas of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> There has clearly been a breakdown in relations at the departmental level and that is causing us a great deal of concern. Certainly, in adequate steps are being taken to resolve this dispute. Internal departmental reviews have been carried out by senior departmental officers. One of those reports showed that in New South Wales alone there was an immediate need for more relief staff to be employed. The other report, dealing with Victoria, showed that in regional areas there was an immediate need for a considerable amount of relief and additional staff to be allocated. But that has not happened. The situation is that the Minister is relying upon the niceties of the relationship between himself and the departmental head. The Director-General has refused to negotiate with the ACOA and the Minister has indicated both in the discussion on this matter in this chamber as well as in reply to questions asked by honourable senators, particularly by Senator Grimes, that he is not prepared to take any steps to resolve the matter. How much longer will this go on? It seems when we have a stand-off position-one can only describe it as such-somebody must break the impasse and take the initiative. Surely it is a matter of concern to the Senate to know that as a result of staff ceilings-we raised this matter in an Estimates committee-the Government is losing money in the collection of tax. Tax evasion is proceeding because of cutbacks in staff in the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening as a result of the low staffing levels and at what that means in terms of government revenue, particularly in the area where there are outstanding overpayments. In 1977-78, for example, outstanding payments were $21.3m and 51 per cent of that money was collected as a result of departmental activities. The following year the figure increased and 58 per cent of the money that had been overpaid was collected. But as a result of staff ceilings in the current year-1980-81-when overpayments are $45m the collection rate is down to 35 per cent. So if honourable senators apply some mathematics to that they will see that the Government is losing revenue as a result of its philosophical position of not putting on sufficient staff to collect the money. By having a stagnant staff position and by refusing to negotiate, the Government is failing to collect money that is due to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently of course the Department of Social Security is conscientious enough to believe that the state of affairs is unsatisfactory and that the actions which it has taken to protect the public interest are also affecting the beneficiaries of social security payments. We expect the Government to take such steps as will resolve this current difficulty. It is pretty clear that whilst the Government has been pressed to increase staff levels there is not sufficient staff in the Department to overcome the problems that obviously exist. The staff is not sufficient to cover the new tasks that the Department of Social Security has to provide. The Department has not been given sufficient permanent staff and it still has some difficulties about retraining programs which it believes are essential in the Department. I do not believe that we can afford to have a continuation of the existing situation where the Government says that while ever the work bans are on and while ever the union adopts the attitude that it has there will be no negotiations. I believe that the Government must take the initiative to resolve the differences and, if necessary, eat humble pie to reach that objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to continue briefly with the matter raised by Senator Gietzelt which we discussed in this place last night. One has heard for some days the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) telling us that age pensioners who receive benefits from the Department of Social Security will not be affected by this dispute. It is therefore with some concern that one reads in the Press and hears from the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association today that it suspects--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney will laugh, and that is typical of the attitude that he has taken all along regarding this dispute. He cares not for the concerns of members of his staff who have been in dispute with the Department for so long. He does not care for the unemployment beneficiaries and those who need emergency assistance who have been affected by this dispute. He does not care for those who have gone into affected social security offices such as Redfern, Camperdown and those in the Hunter Valley and who cannot receive proper service. He does not care for the woman with two children, the wife of someone who was stood down in his Department and who was asked under instruction from his senior officers to sit in the office for a whole day while the matter of what should be done with his wife was sorted out with Canberra. I think Senator Chaney's laughter is a reflection of his attitude to this whole dispute. He is determined to make it a political dispute and make the people who are affected suffer. However, we have a statement from the ACOA today that it suspects some pensioners, starting from tomorrow, will suffer because of the stand downs and difficulties. It points out that it has tried throughout the dispute to minimise hardship to clients. It points out that this is in stark contrast to the behaviour of the Department and the Minister who has carried on with what I have described and it has described as confrontationist tactics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Chaney wishes to dismiss this problem with laughter and if he, his Director-General and others wish just to continue pouring scorn on people who, as Senator Gietzelt pointed out, have a very good industrial record, who over the years have considered their responsibilities to the disadvantaged people in this community as serious and therefore have avoided dispute, who have taken only the attitude they have taken now after a long time of attempting consultation with the Department, let them do so in front of everybody in the community, and let it be on the record. But I still think that this Parliament deserves an answer during debate on the Appropriation legislation. Not only Senator Chaney and his Director, who he continually points out has the responsibility and not him but also this Parliament has a responsibility to those who should be provided for under the social services legislation. Therefore Senator Chaney is answerable not only to his Government but also to this Parliament. He may choose to ignore Senator Gietzelt; he may choose to ignore me; he may choose to pour scorn on and laugh at the ACOA. We do not think it is a laughing matter; we think it is very serious. I merely ask the Minister for his comments on the ACOA media release. Can the Minister guarantee to us that pensioners will not be affected in the way that some unemployment and sickness beneficiaries in this community have been affected?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter in this debate on the appropriation for the Department of Social Security. It relates to the situation in Portland, Victoria. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) may or may not be aware that his leader was in Portland last Friday for discussions with members of the trade union movement, to look at what is going on in relation to the development of the Alcoa smelter and to have discussions with the Portland Council which I understand may well have put a case to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for some form of funding to take up the unemployment slack now running at 20 per cent in that town. I make a plea to the Minister to look at the situation in relation to welfare organisations in Portland which are in dire straits and which are endeavouring to supply funds and other commodities to hundreds of unemployed workers and their families in that town.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thomas Borthwick &amp; Sons (Aust.) Ltd closed its works last June, putting some 600 men and women out of work. At my last inquiry only a handful-I think it was 17 of those 600 men and women-had found alternative employment. This was largely because of two factors: Firstly, the management of Alcoa refused to employ meat workers and, secondly, the development of the building of the smelter itself had slowed down. The trade union body in the area established an office in the town and for some time was able to fund families in indigent circumstances-families that were hard pressed because of the fact that landlords raised rents last year by 50 per cent. Many of these families had moved to the town because of speculation that it was going to become a boom town. However, on arrival they found that all the contractors employed in building the Alcoa smelter had brought in outside labour and very few of the citizens or workers of Portland actually found jobs on that site. The position is extremely bad. Will the Minister look at the situation to see whether there is some mechanism by which the welfare agencies in the town can be given some form of hand-out to allow them to carry out their work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments on child care as part of this Estimates debate. The admission by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) at the Estimates committee hearings that he was considering the introduction of a pilot program for the funding of fees for children attending commercial centres sits oddly with his concern for taxpayers' money. Is he aware that average profits over and above all costs outlaid are estimated by the private child care centres to be a healthy 30 per cent? How does he justify funding a profit margin out of taxpayers' money?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the original speech introducing the Child Care Act in 1972 the then Minister for Labour and Industry, Mr Lynch as he was then, claimed it was necessary to introduce Federal funding of the cost of providing quality care because 'most parents'-they are his words-could not afford the cost of quality care. He described child care which was beneficial to the child's development as 'prohibitively expensive'. How does the Minister currently in charge of this program reconcile the inability of parents to cover the full cost of quality care in 1972 with parents' assumed ability to do so in 1981. This is particularly interesting as living standards, due to this Government's activities, have been falling, as have real wages, for most of the population. I would be very interested to hear the figures on which the Minister bases his assumptions of the levels of income on which families could afford the full cost of care which I believe has been estimated at $80 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister prepared to list the types of programs and the States of origin of the $5m worth of priority rates programs which were rejected? I would also like to know, as no doubt would other senators representing their States, the other rejected applications on the basis of the State of origin, the type of program, whether capital and recurrent funding was sought, or only capital or only recurrent, and whether these applications would have been accepted initially as being of some reasonable priority? What is the future of the program established to help disadvantaged groups to prepare submissions and establish children's services now that there is no point in putting up submissions? Notwithstanding the Minister's answer to a question yesterday, can he assure the Committee that the continuation of a distinct Office of Child Care with combined policy and administrative functions will be a priority, given the visibility of this program and the level of community concern?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred in the chamber during the recent child care debate to his many statements uttered mostly by other people, particularly public servants, on his behalf. Can the Minister detail the number of times in the last six months he has sent a public servant from the Office of Child Care or a backbencher to represent him and/or to read his speech? Does the Minister accept that this procedure in a time of 'review and consolidation'-they are his words-is likely to contribute to anxieties and frustration among child care users and workers, as the Minister is rarely available to answer questions that only he is in a position to answer? I am well aware of the fact that it is conventional wisdom to speak at the present time of an increase in the standards of living of average Australians. But I think it would be difficult to convince most of the Australians with whom I come into daily contact that in fact their living standards have increased when over the last 12 months certainly most of them have seen a considerable deterioration in their living standards. A very highly regarded Australian woman who spoke out strongly on the issue of child care said:</PARA>
<PARA> Why do women have to endure inadequate child care facilities in a country where the Federal Government thinks nothing of spending millions on inspirational advertising campaigns telling us what a great country this is. </PARA>
<PARA> Why aren't there more schemes to look after the children of working parents in a country where we're constantly having something called the resources boom dangled in front of us?</PARA>
<PARA> People are the best resource this country has, but they can't reach their most beneficial fulfilment unless their full potential is liberated. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do many women have to work these days, many of them want to-without sacrificing the love for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> In a rich and developing country such as ours they are entitled to expect better child care facilities to enable them to combine both roles. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the worlds not of a raving radical but of Ms Ita Buttrose writing in her syndicated column for most of the Sunday papers on the fifteenth of this month. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly also to the funding of shelters for homeless youth in Western Australia. I am aware of the fact that 11 submissions were waiting for a very long time for some sort of response. I am aware of the fact also as a result of a question I asked in this place that the delay was largely attributable to the Western Australian Government. I believe that within the last week about $44,000 has been allocated to five different projects in Western Australia. This still leaves six projects without funding, those projects having waited for a very long time. At least three of these are actually providing shelter for homeless youth. There has been an impression among the groups providing care for homeless youth in Western Australia that an amount in excess of $200,000 was originally allocated for a youth services scheme over the three years terminating in July of next year. Can the Minister confirm that there is still a significant amount of this original money unallocated? Can the unfunded projects expect further consideration? In the event that the problem of the allocation of any money unspent is still with the State Government, has the Minister any advice for the groups still awaiting a reply?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) a few questions also in relation to child care funding. I would first like to follow up the request by Senator Giles that the Senate be provided with a list of organisations, State by State, which have made applications for funding but which have not been successful. Tonight I want to speak about the Lower Murray Child Care Centre at Murray Bridge. When this community child care centre was first formed the people concerned had to draw up a constitution. They put it to officers of the Department of Social Security and were told that, in the officers' view, they would be high on the priority list. Of course, when they came to see the powers that be they found that they were not high on the priority list. The latest correspondence I have seen from the Minister's office indicates that there is to be no Federal funding this year and there will be none next year. They are now in the situation of having to live from day to day wondering what is going to happen to the centre. Luckily for the Lower Murray Child Care Centre the State Government has come to its assistance for a short time but there is no guarantee that the State Government will fund the centre next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister what now is the policy of the Government in regard to these child care centres which in some cases operate on a shoestring budget? Will they have to close up shop because of a lack of funding? I hope that the Minister can give some assurance to the people who operate the Lower Murray Child Care Centre at Murray Bridge, where I live, that they do not have to go through many sleepless nights wondering whether the facility will be available next year. If the Minister could give some assurance I am sure it would be very helpful to the women who run this child care centre and also to the women whose children attend it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to a matter that I raised last Thursday in Question Time. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) may have been able to give it some attention in the last six days. I asked a question relating to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the development of the consumer price index figures as they relate to pensions. I pointed out what I thought was a problem, that the State Electricity Commission of Victoria put up its fees by 20 per cent on 17 November. As I understand it, on 15 November the Australian Bureau of Statistics calculates energy charges into the consumer price index and therefore, in my view, it takes another year for the corresponding increases to come through to pensioners. The Minister in his answer indicated that the CPI was just a broad measure and is the only fair criterion that can be used. I concede that it is very difficult to take into account all the factors that can affect the CPI, and therefore pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the situation in Victoria is serious. As I indicated I think in the last part of the question, the SEC, not in its public reports but in some of the more secret ones it circulates, has said that the Loy Yang power station is no longer specifically necessary because the projected increase in consumption of electricity in Victoria, as it predicted a year or two ago, is wrong. One of the major factors in the State Electricity Commission in Victoria reducing its projection of how quickly consumption will increase is its belief that many of the old age people in Victoria will not be using radiators or electrical heating appliances over winter. I think it is a pretty sad situation when the SEC bases its future projections on the belief that the people of Victoria in the old age category will not be able to afford to use electrical heating appliances. That is not the responsibility of this Government; I acknowledge that. Electricity rates in Victoria are tending to go up by 20 per cent each year. If the SEC is to finance the rest of the electricity generating programs such as Loy Yang, which cost billions of dollars, we will find that charges will continue to go up by 20 per cent each year. This could be a major problem for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> One possible solution the Minister may look at-I doubt whether he will be successful-is writing to the State Government to ask that the SEC put up its charges on 14 November so that at least the pensioners will get some increase in pensions in the May period, when increases occur. As I have said, most of these problems are not of the Commonwealth Government's creation. It has adopted a scheme that the Australian Labor Party supports, although more often than not we would prefer quarterly adjustments. However, we endorse a scheme whereby pensions go up according to CPI increases. I repeat that the difficulty arises when figures for energy costs come in immediately after the energy component of the CPI is calculated. I understand also the point made by the Minister, that the pensioners are in some ways better off because the health component, which increases the CPI, really does not affect them. I wonder whether, if a Medibank or universal health scheme is brought back and inflation figures are then artificially depressed, the pensioners would be any better off. That has happened a couple of times in the past. I do not know whether that would make up for the situation we have in regard to the health component. I do not know whether the Minister has an answer at this stage. Maybe I am basing my assertions tonight on a not completely accurate premise. I would be interested to know. </PARA>

To pick up the last points made by Senator Robert Ray, I am not able to give him a more detailed reply than I offered him in Question Time the other day because I have had no further advice on that matter from my Department. With respect to the position of electricity in Victoria, certainly it is my understanding that the unit cost of electric power in Victoria is rather lower than that which applies in a number of other States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are considerable discrepancies from State to State. However, for example, I think that pensioners in Victoria, as well as all subscribers, pay a lesser rate than subscribers in some other States. There may be a catch up process going on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If those costs are going up I suspect that, as Senator Robert Ray interjected a few moments ago, it is a catch up process. Incidentally, I agree with him in regard to the point I made about the additional benefit which flows through to pensioners because of consumer price index changes brought about by health cost rearrangements. If one goes back through history one finds a series of changes which have affected the CPI. As far as I know no specific adjustments have been made to the indexation arrangements to pick up any of those discrepancies. It is to some extent a swings and roundabouts situation but, as I have said, the broad measure of the CPI is applied to try to ensure reasonable justice to the people concerned. It is not and cannot be a perfect measure. I will get a more detailed response to the particular technical question that was asked in Question Time some time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return relatively briefly to the industrial matter. I would like the chamber to be quite clear on my view as to where responsibilities lie with respect to Ministers and departments. I refer briefly to the Constitution. It is certainly my view that Chapter II of the Constitution makes it clear that Ministers are responsible for the administration of departments of state. Section 64 of the Constitution refers to that, and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such Departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish. Such officers shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept the responsibility that that section of the Constitution imposes. I think honourable senators would also be familiar with the provisions of the Social Services Act and the Public Service Act which further define the position. The Social Services Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA> There shall be a Director-General of Social Services, who shall, subject to any direction of the Minister, have the general administration of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>He also has powers of appointment, delegation and so on. The point I made in Question Time the other day which has given rise to a series of statements by Senator Grimes as to my seeking to place responsibility on officers was that the general administration is, of course, in the hands of public servants but in whosever hands it is, I am responsible for what they do. That is quite clear. I do not seek to escape that and I do not think I have ever said anything which would suggest that I do. I regard this as a somewhat important matter and for that reason I would like to put the record straight. I refer also to the Public Service Act which makes quite clear what the duties of permanent heads are. I refer to sub-section 25 (2), which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The permanent head of a Department shall be responsible for its general working, and for all the business thereof, and shall advise the Minister in all matters relating to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, I do not believe that that statutory duty which is placed on the permanent head by the Public Service Act in any way affects the responsibility of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The last time we were dealing with these appropriations Senator Grimes raised a series of specific concerns about the treatment of individual officers. I made it clear, I think, at that time that certainly I would not and did not direct that there should be any selective application of stand-downs, that the no work as directed situation should be applied generally. That was the position as I understood it. In light of the specific matters raised by Senator Grimes I sought from my Department specific advice with respect to the matters that he raised. I will now read from that advice which has been provided for me and which I think indicates that the concerns which he expressed are misplaced. I quote firstly from the document signed by the Director of the Department of Social Security in New South Wales. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The following comments are made in respect of the specific instances of standdown action taken in respect of officers who were mentioned by Senator Grimes as allegedly being involved in the issue of hardship cheques at the time. Redfern Office-David Cowell, Peter Law, Terese Traves, Glen Dwyer and Norm Haskell. In Redfern Office the Regional Manager exercised care to ensure that no current hardship payments would be affected by the standown action and timed his declarations accordingly. The only case where payment was not made was one which was put aside by a Clerk two days earlier and was discovered after that officer was stood down and the client arrived to pick up his cheque at a time pre-arranged by that Clerk. The Manager has advised that on no occasion when he was standing down staff had he instructed any officer to stop work on any hardship cases before he instructed that work commence on overpayments. He also stated that he had not asked David Cowell to leave his pensions work to help out in the U.&amp;S.B. Section and that this would have been an informal arrangement if in fact it had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The next reference is to the Camperdown office. The name Steve Bolt was mentioned. The report to me reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Manager who took the standdown action is on recreation leave and cannot be contacted. However, the witness to the second standdown instruction issued at--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain that in a moment. I will be referring in a moment to the public statement of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association which led me to laugh at the statements that it was behaving responsibly. To go back to the report, it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the witness to the second standdown instruction issued at 2 p.m. on 9 November 1981 by the Manager and the issue of declarations immediately thereafter has advised that he observed that staff involved had one hour in which to clear up work on hand between the first and second instruction. The Social Worker in the office has examined his case records and advised that he personally was not handling any case where a hardship cheque was held up by the standdown of Mr Steve Bolt or any other officer. The counter staff recall only one such case handled by them at the time--</PARA>
<PARA>I will omit the client's name-</PARA>
<PARA>Who made his request at 1.40 p.m., and received his cheque at 2 p.m. as a result of the Accounts Clerk staying back after standdown to complete the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>The next reference in the report is to the Liverpool office. The name given by Senator Grimes was Ken Bernoth. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ken Bernoth who was acting as a Clerk Class 4 in the U.&amp;SB. area, Liverpool was asked at approximately 9 a.m. on 10 November 1981 when he commenced duty to conduct four pre-grant interviews. He indicated that he was not sure of what action he would take and then left the vicinity of his work station. He then decided to hold a meeting of ACOA members and at approximately 11.30 a.m.-</PARA>
<PARA>That is two and a half hours later--</PARA>
<PARA> He chose not to follow the direction. He was stood down at 11.45 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA>The next reference is to the Belmore office. The name mentioned was Vince Senat. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Vince Senat who is a long term occupant of the pensions officer position at the Belmore Regional Office took part in the 24 hour industrial stoppage on 11 November 1981 instigated by the ACOA. In his absence a non-unionist interviewed an applicant for widows pension--</PARA>
<PARA>I omit the name of the client-</PARA>
<PARA> On his return to work on 12 November 1981 Mr Senat stated that he would not process the claim any further and standdown action then proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA>There is then a report with respect to the allegations about the stand-down on 9 November of Mr Champion, the regional manager of the Marrickville office. The report is signed by the First Assistant Director, Field Operations. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the comment by Senator Grimes that 'In the Marrickville Office the Manager was stood down for refusing to stop his staff working on hardship payments, stating that he believed that their work was too important to stop-and he would rather be stood down himself'. The facts are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) At approximately 3.20 p.m. on Monday, 9 November 1981 in the company of Mr Roy Tollis who holds the delegation under Section 32A of the Public Service Act 1922 in relation to officers of, or performing duties in, the Department of Social Security and employees employed in that Department, I entered the Office of the Regional Manager at Marrickville Office and spoke to the Acting Manager, Mr Chris Champion in general terms during which I asked him whether he was prepared to stand down members of his staff who were applying bans. He indicated that he was not prepared to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That was at 3.20 p.m. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) At 3.30 p.m. I formally directed Mr Champion 'to give specific instructions to staff applying bans in respect of such work as covered by the bans and if the staff did not comply to exercise his delegation under Section 32A (1) of the Public Service Act 1922'. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Mr Champion refused stating he did not believe he should be the one to exercise the standdown delegation. He said that the staff applying the bans should be stood down and they thought that he should stand them down instead of being stood down himself. Furthermore he thought that the office generally had enough staff although sometimes he could do with more. He said he was greatly concerned about not being able to bring himself to take the standdown action although he had discussed the matter with his wife and she considered he should. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) At 3.55 p.m. Mr Tollis exercised his delegation and stood Mr Champion down on the basis of no work as directed no pay. </PARA>
<PARA> At no time whilst we were present with Mr Champion did he mention the question of hardship payments or that he believed the work of his staff was too important to stop. I must say that I felt deeply for Mr Champion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These reports refer to specific cases which were put before this chamber. The reports which I have read were prepared by officers. They indicate that the assertions that were put before this chamber do not accord with the reality of the position. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt went on to address himself to this subject. May I say that I agree with him wholeheartedly when he said that he did not believe that the Public Service as a whole is irresponsible. I certainly agree with that wholeheartedly and of course evidence of the responsibility of the Public Service is shown in the fact that the great majority of public servants have continued to do the work which they are employed to do. In fact, on the figures that I have for today, out of the total number of public servants employed in New South Wales and Victoria 350 were stood down and 200 walked out. That is out of a total of 2,759 staff in Victoria and 3,768 in New South Wales. So in those two States out of the total staff about 550 are in any way involved. The last advice I had was that only five offices in the two States were closed by union action. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that is a very good indication of the sort of responsibility to which Senator Gietzelt referred and which I accept I commend and for which I thank the public servants involved. I am less able to agree with the suggestion that the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association is responsible. I remind the Committee of the documents that I have referred to in answers to questions in this place over recent days. I remind the Committee that it was an official of the ACOA who said in June when the union did not get the pay claim that it wanted from Mr Justice Moore: 'Do we have to starve pensioners to get pay justice?' I remind the Committee of the circular that was put round over the name of Mr Bunn which instructed public servants in how to act irresponsibly in this present situation. I deplore that contribution by the ACOA to the non-working of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt addressed himself to a series of matters to which I have addressed myself in response to questions over recent days, and I do not wish to duplicate what I have said. He referred to cutbacks in the work force. I have of course put on the public record over and over again that since 1976 we have had a very substantial increase in the staffing of the Department of Social Security. The Government has taken particular care with respect to the staff requirements of the Department and in fact the present staffing is approximately 12,400 people as against a figure in the vicinity of 9,000 in 1976. The long term staffing position of the Department is something which is under continuous review. There were complaints from the union that inadequate staff was provided for the assumption of the new health card function. It is now common ground that an excessive number of staff were provided by that temporary cover. There have been complaints about the lack of training facilities in the Department. That is known to the union. I have said in this place that the additional staff cover, which we obtained on a temporary basis, has now been extended to June of next year to enable us to undertake better training. There were union complaints about accommodation. I have told the Senate that the Government set aside in excess of $2m to deal with some of the accommodation difficulties which the Department had. I simply say that the Government will continue to deal in a reasonable manner with the reasonable needs of my Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Queensland) (10.51)-I raise a small matter but one that is of quite some concern to some people in far north Queensland. I have not been able to determine the exact date on which this event occurred-it was either very late in October or very early in this month of November. Some people in far north Queensland received a note which said the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Enclosed is your group certificate for the 1980-81 financial year. Please accept my apologies for the delay in forwarding this to you. </PARA>
<PARA>If you have already lodged your tax return without including the income summarised in this group certificate, please forward the certificate, together with a copy of this advice, to--</PARA>
<PARA>There is then the address of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Brisbane. The note concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> If you have not already lodged your tax return, please proceed as normal. </PARA>
<PARA>This note was forwarded to me after the people concerned had received it and the group certificate at a very late stage, after they had submitted their tax return. Therefore, this was of some concern to them. I do not expect the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to have any information on this state of affairs at this stage. However, I ask him to look into this and-unless he has the information now-to give some explanation of why the group certificates arrived so late. It seems to me that group certificates should arrive in July or August in time for people to submit their taxation returns in the normal way. It seems to me that there has been excessive delay when a certificate arrives very late in October or very early in November. I hope that the Minister will be able at some stage to ascertain the reason for the delay and either advise me, as the inquirer, or advise the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston correctly guessed that I might not have the information on the matter he raised. I will seek a reply for him. I will return to the matters that were raised earlier. Senator Grimes made a number of comments about my lack of care about the Department's beneficiaries. No doubt he evidenced his own very great concern by his total silence and total failure to make any suggestion that the union might moderate its stand and lift the bans that it has been imposing for the last 12 months. The reason I showed evidence of some mirth when he referred to the attitude of the union I can very simply explain by reference to the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association Press release put out today headed 'Social Security staffing crisis: tomorrow is crisis day for pensioners'. The Press release stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tomorrow is crisis day for one million old age pensioners who receive benefits from the Department of Social Security in New South Wales and Victoria. It is extremely unfortunate that these clients of the Department will experience significant difficulties on pension day tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an inaccurate statement. Those pension cheques were processed and in the mail days ago. To suggest that one million old age pensioners in New South Wales and Victoria will experience significant difficulties is simply not true. I put it to the Senate that that sort of contribution to the situation is scarcely evidence of a union attitude which is concerned with the welfare of the clients of the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Primmer raised matters in respect of Portland. I understand that the closure of the Borthwicks works has had a significant effect on that community and that some of the developments which it is hoped will lead to a creation of considerable employment in that community have yet to occur. He asked me whether I would examine the position to see what could be done in respect of welfare organisations which he described as being in dire straits. At this stage I simply undertake to examine that position to see whether there is any function which can properly be performed in that situation by my Department. He described a situation which is clearly relevant to some of the work of my Department in respect of its responsibilities for income security. Some other areas may be the responsibility of State authorities. I will ask my Department to advise me on that position. I will speak to the honourable senator when I have that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles raised a whole series of questions on child care. I think that most of these could perhaps more adequately have been dealt with in the forum of the Estimates Committee. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That comment is regarded by the Opposition as being offensive in some way. The fact is that honourable senators do sit down around a table and both the Minister and a large number of public servants are available to deal with detailed questions. If we are to go through exactly the same process here in the full Senate chamber it seems to me there is some oddity in that duplication. I simply say that I think the Estimates Committee procedure-as honourable senators observed when we were dealing with earlier Estimates Committee reports-ought to lead to debates in this chamber on issues raised in those Committees rather than a repetition of the same sort of exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I will address myself to the matters raised by Senator Giles. Of course, she is entitled to raise those matters here. That is any honourable senator's right. The question she first raised concerned how I can square my concern for taxpayers with the consideration of a pilot project to assist lower income people to attend commercial child care centres. I have expressed concern over a series of matters that I have discovered in this program which indicate to me that some people on modest or low incomes have difficulty in getting benefit from those parts of the program which are subsidised by my Department. If Senator Giles casts her mind back to the Estimates Committee, I gave an example of a centre in Victoria which had had capital subsidy in excess of $300,000, was getting recurrent subsidy of approximately $86,000, was catering for no more than 60 children and yet was charging fees which the operators of the service said put it beyond the means of many of the people that they wished to serve. That is one of the areas about which I am concerned. I think we have to look at the funding mechanism to make sure that those centres are available to people who need them most. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the commercial centres are concerned, when one looks at the statistics and sees that there are a very large number of non-subsidised centres which operate in the child care field and which, because they are unsubsidised, have to charge a full cost, in seems to me that it may well be we can open up the opportunities for people on lower incomes to get access to something more than casual child minding arrangements if they can be assisted to attend commercial centres where they are the centres which are available to them in a geographic sense. As I said in the Estimates Committee, that matter is not very far advanced. The pilot project has not been designed. It aims at examining whether greater access could be provided by the use of that sort of mechanism. As for the question of how people can be expected to pay $80 a week, I make it quite clear that my concern is that there are low income families who cannot afford the present subsidised rates. I would wish to see something done about that. But in a situation described by Senator Grimes in the Estimates Committee as one where there are almost limitless demands-I think I quote him accurately-I cannot see an end to some rationing of government money going into child care. I believe that that rationing ought to be in favour of those who are less well off and those who have a greater social need. In light of the hour I will seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commissioner for Employees' Compensation deals with each case on its individual merits, and as has been done in cases dealt with to date, he will rely on specialist medical opinion to determine future cases as they arise.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Commonwealth was found to be liable to pay compensation in the case of a Royal Australian Air Force Squadron Leader who had been exposed to radiation while performing duty as a member of aircrew at Emu Claypan in South Australia. This case attracted considerable publicity in the media. However, there had been one earlier case in which liability was found in respect of the effects of exposure to radiation. The case arose from a claim by the widow of an Army Warrant Officer who was a member of a detachment which recovered a centurion tank from a fall-out area of atomic tests conducted at Emu Claypan. The Commonwealth was found to be liable to pay compensation in this case in the light of specialist medical opinion from an expert in cancer cases. From the available evidence, the delegate was satisfied that on the balance of probability there was a connection between the Warrant Officer's death and his exposure to radioactive dust.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, 14 claims have been disallowed since March 1980; one of these is the subject of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> If the case of the Royal Australian Air Force Squadron Leader is the one that the honourable senator had in mind in asking his question, in view of the foregoing it cannot be regarded as a precedent.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No payments of compensation are pending in any other cases, but 46 claims are currently under investigation in relation to alleged exposure arising from United Kingdom atomic tests in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. In the case of the Army Warrant Officer referred to at (1) above, compensation of $8,600 was awarded under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act in accordance with the level of benefit prescribed at the date of death. Weekly payments of compensation at the prescribed rates were also made to the widow initially in respect of four dependent children. At present payment is continuing at the rate of $14.20 per week in respect of one student child.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) For liability to be found under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation or his delegate must be satisfied that the employee sustained personal injury arising out of or in the course of the employment, or suffered from a disease, the contraction, aggravation, acceleration or recurrence of which was contributed to by the employment.</PARA>
<PARA> In disease cases the determination of a claim will normally be based on specialist medical opinion which, on the balance of probability, points to a casual relationship between the condition under claim and the employment.</PARA>
<PARA> In cases where exposure to radiation is alleged, subject both to an employee's exposure to radiation in the employment having been established, and to the condition under claim being consistent with such exposure, then, in the absence of specialist evidence to the contrary, the employment will be deemed to have been a contributing factor to the contraction of the condition.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Copyright owners have always had the right to claim royalties for the copying of their works.</PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Amendment Act 1980 provides that the remuneration payable to a copyright owner for the copying of his work is a matter of agreement between the institution doing the copying and the copyright owner or, in default of agreement, by determination of the Copyright Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In a Press statement dated 12 July 1981, the Attorney-General announced that the provisions of the Copyright Act concerning the audiovisual copying of copyright material would be reviewed by his Department. Submissions from interested persons and bodies were requested to be lodged by 30 November 1981.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Budget papers do not provide estimates expressed in constant prices for Commonwealth Budget outlays classified by function. Specific price deflators for all the functional classifications are not available but a very broad allowance for the influence of price movements can be made by adjusting current price estimates of outlays with movements in the implicit price deflator derived from the national accounts estimates of gross non-farm product. Estimates of outlays expressed in 1980-81 prices derived in this manner are shown in table (i) below. These estimates should of course be treated with due regard to their approximate nature.</PARA>
<PARA> There is an additional reason for caution in considering estimates of the kind requested by the honourable senator. Changes in financial arrangements have affected the comparability of several of the Budget functional classifications between years. For example, recent changes in health funding arrangements have affected the allocation of expenditure between the 'Health' category and General Revenue Assistance to the States and the Northern Territory; the latter component of expenditure is included in the 'Not Allocated to Function' category. Adjusted for these changes, outlays in 1981-82 under 'Health' would have amounted to $3641 million in terms of 1980-81 prices rather than the $2599 million shown in table (i); the real percentage change over the period since 1975-76 for the 'Health' category would then be -21.2 per cent rather than -43.7 per cent as shown in table (ii). This would be offset by a corresponding adjustment to the 'Not Allocated to Function' category. A further example is the marked reduction in outlays for the 'Transport and Communication' classification, both in real terms and as a fraction of total outlays after 1975-76, which reflects the shift to non-Budget financing of capital expenditure by several Commonwealth trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> Several other classifications have been affected in some way by changed arrangements in recent years; a more detailed consideration of the functional classification of Budget outlays and of movements in the main categories over the past decade is provided in Statement No 6 in Budget Paper No 1.</PARA>

<PARA> It is impossible to derive a reliable estimate of the emergency relief provision distributed by community agencies in 1980-81 at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> The major proportion of emergency relief contributed by non-government agencies in Australia is provided by the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army. These organisations are not yet in a position to provide figures for 1980-81.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Departure taxes, in one form or another, are levied in over 100 countries many of whom provide Australia with tourist traffic. The form of the tax varies and it is often incorporated in the price of the ticket so that travellers may be unaware of the existence and size of the impost. While the total amount of tax in overseas countries varies significantly, Australia certainly does not have the highest total. For example, New Zealand charges a levy of $35 on all adult tickets purchased there, together with an airport tax of $2.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The departure tax was introduced in the 1978-79 Budget as a general revenue raising measure. In the three years since then the tax appears to have had little, if any, impact on tourist travel to and from Australia and the tax is not significant when seen in relation to the total costs of international travel. The exclusions suggested by the honourable senator would seriously limit the usefulness of the tax as a general revenue raising measure; they would also add major complications to its administration.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As a general principle, Government expenditures are best allocated according to the priority attaching to those needs and not simply on the basis of revenue collected from a particular tax. Unless expenditure proposals compete for a share of revenue on their merits, expenditures which happen to be financed by a particular tax may take precedence over higher priority needs not financed in this way.</PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCILBORROWING BY SEMI-GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIESTHE 'GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT'</PARA>
<PARA>(As amended to 19 June 1981 at 117th Meeting of Loan Council.)</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Australian Loan Council have agreed that the following conditions will apply to future borrowings of Commonwealth and State semi-government and local authorities. These arrangements consolidate amendments made to the original Gentlemen's Agreement since 1936 and, where necessary, modify the Agreement (as amended) in the light of Loan Council practices that have developed since then.</PARA>
<PARA>A. BORROWING PROGRAMS</PARA>
<PARA> (i) In the case of semi-government and local authorities constituted under the laws of the Commonwealth or a State which propose to raise more than $1,200,000 in any one year, all loans issued either in the form of new money or for the purpose of conversion or redemption of maturing debt are to be subject to the authority of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth or of the Premier or Treasurer of the State concerned as to the amount, terms, time and place of issue.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Commonwealth and each State agree to submit to the Chairman of the Loan Council, before the close of the preceding financial year, the new money borrowing program for each semi-government and local authority proposing to borrow more than $1,200,000 in the form of new money during the forthcoming financial year. After the Loan Council has decided the maximum aggregate amounts to be borrowed by such authorities in the Commonwealth and each State, the Commonwealth and each State agree to submit to the Chairman by 31 October each year a program for the financial year for each authority within the overall limits decided by the Loan Council. Unless the Loan Council decides otherwise, these programs will constitute the final borrowing programs for each authority during the year concerned. Transfers of unused borrowing allocations between individual authorities will be allowed subsequently within this financial program subject to the specific approval of the Loan Council in each case.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The Commonwealth and each State also agree to submit to the Chairman, before the close of the preceding financial year, a program of borrowing for the purpose of conversion or renewal of maturing loans by the authorities referred to in clause (ii), together with programs of borrowings of more than $1,200,000 during the year for conversion or renewal purposes by other semi-government and local authorities. No additions will subsequently be made to this program without the specific approval of the Loan Council. The Chairman may agree to additions to the program on the recommendation of the State Premier concerned where these have been omitted due to oversight. Details of such approval given by the Chairman will be circulated to the Loan Council each month.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The borrowing programs referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above will be considered by the Loan Council in conjunction with its consideration of the borrowing programs for the Commonwealth and State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the borrowing programs referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) will cover the total proposed borrowing for a complete financial year, and any approvals granted by the Loan Council for those borrowings will, if not availed of, lapse at the close of the financial year concerned, unless otherwise specifically determined by the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) The amount, terms, time and place of issue of each loan raised to finance the borrowing programs referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) will be fixed by the Premier or Treasurer concerned, in consultation with the Chairman, who will consult the Members of the Loan Council before giving his decision. If, subsequent to Loan Council's decision, there is a change in maximum semi-government interest rates, the Premier or Treasurer concerned may, without further reference to Loan Council, approve a change to the interest rates for a public loan proposal (provided that the new rates comply with the revised maxima and that all other terms and conditions as approved by Loan Council remain unchanged) and may vary the time of the loan by not more than five working days. The Premier or Treasurer concerned may also give his decision on proposals for private borrowings by semi-government and local authorities without consultation with other Members of the Loan Council, provided the terms and conditions of proposals comply with the terms and conditions of similar proposals which have previously received unanimous Loan Council Approval. Details of such borrowings will be reported to the Chairman each month by each Premier or Treasurer for circulation to the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Authorities with borrowing programs, referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) and exceeding $100 million in any year, should not seek to raise more than two-thirds of their total programs in the first half of the financial year and limit approaches to the market to a minimum interval of two months, unless there are special factors which justify exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) The Chairman may agree to the transfer of borrowing allocations from one authority to another on the recommendation of the State Premier concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Details of such approvals given by the Chairman will be circulated to the Loan Council each month.</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) Unless the Loan Council decides otherwise, there will be no overall limit on borrowings by authorities with programs of not more than $1,200,000. The terms of such borrowings will be determined by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth for Commonwealth authorities and by the Premiers or Treasurers of the States for their respective authorities. These terms will be in accordance with those currently being approved by the Loan Council for authorities borrowing more than $1,200,000 during the year.</PARA>
<PARA> (x) Monthly returns of aggregate new money borrowings by semi-government and local authorities in the Commonwealth and in each State with programs of 1,200,000 or less in the form of new money are to be furnished each month to the Chairman, who will circulate them to the other Members.</PARA>

<PARA> The Commonwealth and each State agree to inform the Chairman of the results of each public loan as soon as practicable after the closing date of the loan. Where subscriptions have been received in excess of the amount offered, the Chairman is to be informed at the same time whether these amounts have been returned to subscribers.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Private borrowings when public loans are open for subscription.</PARA>
<PARA> Between the opening date of a public loan and seven days after the closing of that loan, the Commonwealth and each State agree that they will not submit to the Chairman details of proposed private borrowings by the same authority unless they are satisfied that the amount of the private offer would not be available for subscription to the public loan.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Counter sales.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Counter sales of securities by semi-government and local authorities, when approved by the Loan Council, will be permitted to remain open for a period specifically approved by the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The interest rates of counter sales will be those appropriate at the time for public loans raised by semi-government and local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The amount of each approval for counter sales which is debited against borrowing programs for semi-government and local authorities will be limited to the amount actually received as advised to the Chairman at the close of the period approved for the sales.</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) Publicity.</PARA>
<PARA> No public announcement or release of the proposed dates, terms and conditions of public loans of semi-government and local authorities will be made until Loan Council approval of such dates, terms and conditions has been obtained. In the case of opening and closing dates, an announcement may be made, if desired, as soon as a tentative allocation has been made by the Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA> (x) Loan Council approval.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Commonwealth and each State agree that, when submitting proposals for private borrowing by semi-government and local authorities for Loan Council consideration, they will inform the Chairman if any of the terms and conditions as submitted are subject to review before the funds are to be received by the borrower. The Chairman is also to be informed if the terms of the transaction are not to be finally settled within one month of the date of the submission.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Unless the Chairman is advised to the contrary, the Loan Council will assume that all proposals for private borrowings by semi-government and local authorities have been firmly taken up and such amounts will be debited against the borrowing program of the authority for that year.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Public borrowing proposals by semi-government and local authorities will only be debited against borrowing programs to the extent that actual offers are made on the market. Proposals for public loans which are withdrawn after Loan Council approval has been obtained will not be debited against programs.</PARA>

<PARA> It will be seen from the table that relativities between the two countries' rates on unemployment benefit depend on the recipient's age, marital status and number of dependants. Also, because of the impact of income tax, the actual value of benefits for any given category of recipient may vary from those shown in the table. Benefits are taxable in New Zealand only if the recipient has no children; in Australia, by contrast, they are always taxable. On the other hand, the effects of tax in Australia will depend on the amount of other income a beneficiary receives during the year; by itself, unemployment benefit is not enough to take the recipient above the tax threshold unless he or she has at least two children (more if the beneficiary is single).</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> In formulating its policies in relation to defining people in special need, the Government was conscious of the position of those who marginally fail to qualify under the income limits laid down. It was recognised that, where a monetary limit is set for eligibility for a benefit, there will always be some people who are just outside the limit, no matter how high, within reason, the limit is set. Accordingly, the income limits under the new health insurance arrangements were set at relatively high levels so that those people who fail to qualify can reasonably be regarded as being in a position to contribute towards their health care costs.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of such persons who fail to qualify for special assistance being also ineligible for the basic health insurance tax rebate, it is a fact that persons who are not liable to pay income tax are not entitled to any form of taxation rebate. The amount of rebate allowable to a taxpayer cannot exceed the tax otherwise payable.</PARA>
<PARA> Eligible pensioners and persons in special need (and their dependants) receive the benefits of other tax financed health subsidies. Those persons who choose to take out hospital insurance in order to have doctor of choice, are entitled to receive Commonwealth Medical Benefits at 85 per cent of the Schedule fee or at the Schedule fee less $5. The value of that entitlement could exceed the value of the rebate for combined basic hospital and medical insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no plans to change the arrangements for determining those in special need but the Government, as would be expected under any new system, will continue to monitor all aspects of the arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I have sought the advice of the Commissioner of Taxation on the operation of this particular sales tax provision, and have been advised that sales tax on pet food applies only to animals kept as domestic pets. It is accepted that guide dogs are kept not as domestic pets but as a means of assisting the safe movement of blind persons from place to place. Blind persons will be entitled, therefore, to claim exemption for pet food for their guide dogs.</PARA>
<PARA> To claim exemption a blind person will have to supply a standard form exemption certificate to his supplier. There is, however, no requirement in the sales tax law which compels a retailer such as a supermarket to accept such an exemption certificate. To obtain the exemption it may be more practical for a blind person to deal with a wholesaler of pet food or a specialist pet food supplier.</PARA>

Does the Minister not concede that a case of misrepresentation could be made in respect of one of these two areas?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The matters raised by the honourable senator have been canvassed at length-in the House of Representatives Estimates Committee E on 8 September 1981, in my reply to the question without notice in the House on 15 September, and in debate in the House on 22 and 23 September. While I refer the honourable senator to the full record of those debates, I can advise him that on 8 September I informed the House of Representatives Estimates Committee E, referring to the state of preparedness of the Government's application for deregistration of the ABCE &amp; BLF when I became Minister responsible, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It was utterly impossible to lodge the proceedings in April because they simply were not prepared. The whole material was not gathered and that material was not in a form appropriate for filing of any documentation. What I sought from the Department was an intensification of effort in the gathering of that material and in the preparation of it.'</PARA>
<PARA> In amplifying this comment in the House of Representatives on 23 September, I made the following additional remarks:</PARA>
<PARA> 'After I took over responsibility I was briefed by my officers on 22 April. I was informed then of the procedure that they were applying as a task force to gather the material, to put it into-to use a legal term-proofs of evidence or statements of prospective witnesses, to have those matters checked out by Counsel, to have them returned to the task force and then, to have them put by the task force under supervision of legal Counsel from the Victorian Bar and a senior officer of the Attorney-General's Department, into affidavit form. Anyone who has practised law, any member of the public who can understand this kind of thing, will readily appreciate the amount of meticulous and detailed work that has to go into the preparation of a case of this kind. I think anyone would understand the veracity of the statement I made to Estimates Committee E and to this House that in April it was utterly impossable to have that case in a state of readiness for filing in April.</PARA>
<PARA> There is in my mind a clear distinction between progress in the gathering of material and having a case prepared to the point of its being ready to file in the Court.'</PARA>

<PARA> I have noted the view of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) on the General Aviation Study. The report was the result of careful and thorough research. It has provided a significant contribution to our knowledge of the general aviation industry. However, as you will be aware, the Government has decided not to accept the recommendations on cost recovery, but to continue its previous practice of deciding on levels of air navigation charges annually in the Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also aware that AOPA is seeking an independent enquiry into my Department. In recent years, my Department has been subjected to many reviews. To name only a few of the more significant investigations, there was the Government industry study in Departmental costs and revenues in the early 1970s the Coombs review of Government expenditures in 1973, the Bland Report in 1976, and the Industry Review Committee in the mid 1970s, in which the industry participated in depth. More recently, of course, there has been the review of Commonwealth functions conducted by Ministers. In addition, my Department is subject to reviews by the Government, the Parliament and its committees, the central agencies of government and through the Aviation Industry Advisory Council and other consultative arrangements with the air transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also pertinent to note that between 1975 and 1980 there was a reduction in the Department's staffing levels from 11,415 to 11,269. On the other hand, hours flown by the industry increased from about 1.6 million to 2.2 million in the same period.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to recent newspaper articles which report the removal by private collectors and aircraft restorers of two Bristol Beaufighter fuselages from Kalumburu airfield, previously known as Drysdale airfield, to Sydney. As I understand the position, the aircraft were badly damaged during the Second World War and were converted to components, which means essentially that they have been stripped of useful parts and abandoned in that remote and almost totally inaccessible part of Western Australia since 1945. I further understand that it is the intention of the group which has recovered the aircraft to restore one for static display and that it is hopeful, using other parts it has, of restoring the other to flying condition. If that is the case it will be only the second Beaufighter aircraft in the world flying today. I ask the Minister: Firstly, to whom do the aircraft belong and by what critieria do they claim legal ownership? Secondly, will the Government consider vesting ownership of the aircraft in the restoration group which has recovered them; provided they are made available on display to the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following information, additional to that which I gave at the time:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The property remains in the Commonwealth as original owner, unless proof of abandonment is clear. This onus will be upon the interested third party.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commonwealth may enter into a loan agreement with an interested party. This will confer exclusive rights to a group to restore and use the aircraft for a given period. Ownership, however, remains with the Commonwealth. It has not been, and will not be, the Commonwealth's intention to pass title to other parties concerned.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence been drawn to an article appearing in yesterday's issue of the Sun headed 'Joke Force'? The article states, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> The total defence effort in Darwin consists of one functional but slow RAAF Caribou transport plane, four naval patrol boats and just over 100 regular soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA> Would the Minister not agree that this level of deployment is laughable and will he take steps to see that Australia's northern coastline is more appropriately protected? At present inadequate funds are being made available to Norforce, the reservist force currently being developed to service the north. Will the Minister provide a more appropriate level of funds for this group?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> A new patrol boat base to support the Fremantle class patrol boats is under construction in Darwin and is due for completion in late 1982. The new Fremantle class boats will increase the surveillance capabilities in Northern Australia. Attack class patrol boats presently provide regular patrols of the Australian fishing Zone while RAAF P3 Orion aircraft conduct aerial surveillance staging through Darwin and Learmonth.</PARA>
<PARA> Norforce replaced the Darwin based Army Reserve Unit, 7 Independent Rifle Company on 1 July 1981. I can assure the honourable senator that sufficient funds have been made available for Norforce which is being progressively developed as a new concept, with the specific role of surveillance and reconnaissance in the north. The force has a currently planned strength of 40 regular and 280 reserve soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA> A fighter squadron is planned to be based in Darwin and this together with a new airfield to be constructed at Derby will enhance Defence capabilities in northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Daily aerial surveillance of the northern Australian littoral is provided by civil contract aircraft under the control of the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre. Civil contract aircraft also cover the offshore approaches to Darwin.</PARA>

In view of the exhaustive analyses carried out by the Department of Defence in relation to the new tactical fighter program, will the Minister list those studies or reports prepared by the Department of Defence and its agencies which explored the question whether HMAS Melbourne should be replaced? Will the Minister table those reports?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not the usual practice of the Government to release details of the investigations and analyses conducted into the proposed acquisition of Defence equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> The details of such investigations must remain confidential for a variety of reasons: they involve the security of Australia and, frequently, of our allies; they impinge upon information of a commercial nature which has been provided in confidence; and the public disclosure of this material could impair our negotiating position when dealing with prospective suppliers of the equipment.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Entry to the Commonwealth Government Centre in Hobart is at present supervised on weekends and between the hours of 5.30 p.m. and 7.30 a.m. on week days by watchmen employed by my Department.

<PARA> (2) Computer card-key entry systems of the type to be installed in the Hobart Centre have been endorsed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as suitable for use in buildings occupied by the Commonwealth. The card-key system will not record the number of persons entering the building with card-key holders although it will identify the card used.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did members of the International Council of Christian Churches visit Queensland at the invitation of the Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, to look at Aboriginal problems.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did the Council conclude that the only problems that Queensland Aboriginals had to cope with were alcohol and sin and that 'with a goodly dose of hot gospel', all their problems would simply disappear; if so, how does this compare with the perception of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs of the problems facing Queensland Aboriginals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am not aware of the circumstances under which the International Council of Christian Churches visited Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have seen Press reports of the kind referred to by the honourable senator. I am informed, however, that the International Council of Christian Churches has not issued any report of its visit. The remarks attributed to the visitors by the honourable senator would appear to take a rather simplistic view of the problems facing Aboriginal people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1981 (Hansard, page 896) Senator Elstob asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently a decision was made to proceed with the demanning of 12 lighthouses in the next 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Can the Minister assure the Senate that Transport Australia sufficiently canvassed community interests before planning this program?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Were the safety of shipping lanes, search and rescue operations, coastal surveillance work and environmental protection matters, all facets of a lightkeeper's work, taken into consideration?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Will the Minister guarantee that lighthouses of historical importance will not fall into disrepair and be lost as part of our heritage once they are automated and pass out of the constant supervision of a keeper?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The five-year rolling program for updating the Commonwealth network of Navigational aids currently includes the automation of 12 lightstations. Although automation does allow a station to be demanned this does not necessarily follow in every case. Every lighthouse is examined on its merits and the level of manning is only decided after full consultation with all interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The safety of shipping lanes is not affected by automation or unmanning. Search and rescue, coastal surveillance and environmental protection, despite the fact that some use is made of them from time to time on an opportunity basis, are not facets of a lightkeeper's work; they are, nonetheless, taken into consideration when manning levels are being decided.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Authorities responsible for heritage considerations are consulted and no building of historical importance will be allowed to deteriorate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 September 1981 (Hansard, page 980) Senator Siddons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communitions, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it true, as reported this morning in the Age, that the Government is seeking legal advice on how it can amend one of its own money Bills in the Senate in order to reduce television company licence fees that were to be increased in this Budget? If the Government succeeds in finding a legal means by which the Senate can amend money Bills, will the Minister inform the Senate of this discovery? If the report is correct, can the Minister explain why the Government has changed its mind on the matter?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer the honourable senator to my second reading speech on the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981, at page 2286 in Hansard, which explains the course the Government has followed in revising the schedule by which licence fees are set both for radio and for television licensees. I take this opportunity to reassure the honourable senator that all licences on which a higher fee became payable under measures announced in the Budget will also incur a higher fee under the provisions of the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981 and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981.</PARA>

<PARA> By way of preface, I refer him to the vision splendid, which I think he shares with me and every other New South Wales senator, of the Moore Park Engineers Depot being vacated and it, together with the Sports Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2, being merged into a modern sports stadium. Since this was promised by Lance Barnard and Senator Withers when he held the Administrative Services portfolio, can the Minister advise what has happened? When is the Army moving out? When can Sydney achieve this vision splendid?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the land exchange arrangements between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Governments the Moore Park Engineers Depot was transferred to the State on 20 March 1981 and is leased back to the Commonwealth pending a relocation of the Army facility.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the agreement between the governments the Commonwealth is to make its best endeavours to vacate the land no later than 1983 and is working towards this objective.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Commonwealth vacates the land the achievement of the vision splendid will be a matter for the State.</PARA>
