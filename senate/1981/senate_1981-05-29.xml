<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> c. The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognize that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian Nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I preface my question by referring the Minister to the explanation given in the current issue of the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication Social Indicators of the Bureau's inability to measure poverty. At page 154 it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although difficult methodological problems are involved in the compilation of equivalence scales, the concept (of equivalence scales) is central to wefare-oriented income analysis and particularly to any attempts to measure poverty. The inability to undertake analysis of adjusted incomes leaves many welfare questions unanswered.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of that statement, does the Minister consider that what are called the basic tools of measurement in social sciences are in fact capable of providing us with accurate measurements of social conditions? Further, does the Minister not consider the accurate measurement of poverty to be essential to government's financial planning?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2339" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's question highlights a very real difficulty in that area, and that is to put a precise figure on what is to be described as poverty. Obviously, it would simplify social planning and, indeed, economic planning if one were able to be quite categorical in terms of the money amounts which might be required by any particular person in a certain situation to maintain a decent, minimum standard for which it might be thought the taxpayer should be responsible. The question in fact raises some of the factors which make it genuinely difficult. The honourable senator specifically referred to equivalence scales. My recollection is that the original work on poverty measurement done by Professor Henderson, which is often referred to in this place, and indeed in debates on social security matters, relied on equivalence scales which were the result of United States research, I think based in New York. There has always been some question as to how relevant those equivalence scales are in the Australian context. It is known to the Senate, because my predecessor indicated it, that the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat has been doing work in this area. As I understand it, that work has included discussions between the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat and the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the difficult question of equivalence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I anticipated that the draft report, which I have received recently but have not yet had a chance to peruse, includes advice on the question of equivalence and suggestions as to what might be regarded as appropriate equivalence scales in Australia. Not having had the opportunity of reading that draft report, I am not in a position to give any detailed comment and I do not wish to speculate. I can say with very real certainty that whatever is determined by any inquiry there will be genuine debate of both an academic and political nature on the correctness or otherwise of the equivalence scales or on any other aspect of poverty measurement which might be brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter might be summarised by saying that there will be a completely individual result in terms of the precise amount of money required by an individual to maintain a reasonable standard for that individual. Whilst the tools of the Commonwealth Statistician will no doubt be absolutely essential to our work in the social security area, in the end political judgments will have to be made. I am sure that, however carefully they are made and however much attention is paid to the available statistical data, there will be vigorous political debate about whether we are hitting the target precisely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs acknowledge that, as a result of the Lynch Committee's decision to abandon the collection of unemployment statistics by the Commonwealth Employment Service, there will be no way of monitoring Aboriginal unemployment which, in some communities, exceeds 80 per cent of the available work force? Is it the Government's intention to conceal this situation or will some accurate method of measuring Aboriginal employment be introduced?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The regular collection and publication of CES statistics of persons registered for unemployment and of unfilled vacancies will be terminated . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The CES figures provided the only data on Aboriginal unemployment but they were deficient in a number of important ways. Firstly, the identification of people registering for employment was dependent upon visual identification by CES staff. That is not an adequate means of identifying who is an Aboriginal. Secondly, the statistics did not include those who, by reason of their geographic location, did not have access to CES facilities. The honourable senator may have referred to this at various times in the chamber. Thirdly, Aboriginals with either literacy problems or an inability to understand the required administrative procedures often do not register with the CES. Fourthly, the CES statistics did not include Aboriginals looking for part time work. I have been looking at some of the Hansard records of past debates. I noticed that many members of the Australian Labor Party have drawn attention in the past to the inadequacies of the collection of statistics by the CES. The Australian Bureau of Statistics monthly labour force survey, for technical reasons, cannot provide information on this issue either. As a result of this, officers from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs are considering other means by which information on the level of unemployment among Aboriginals may be obtained. I agree with the honourable senator that it is desirable that we have some of this information. I think we should acknowledge the deficiencies in the information we had. We should also acknowledge that unemployment is high. I will pursue these opportunities with my colleague and his Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce notice an article in the Canberra Times by Mr Frank Cranston entitled 'Intending tourists warned off Australia'? In view of the tremendous importance of tourism to Tasmania, will the Government undertake a promotion campaign which will support Australia's need to be a reliable country which welcomes tourists but which will also allow them to go home? Will the Government stress in any such campaign the great importance to Australia of tourism as a generator of urban and regional employment?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can appreciate the honourable senator's concern about the tourist industry and the possible detrimental effects of strike action. I think there would be no dispute around the chamber that the tourist industry is of considerable economic importance to Australia. We are a country which sends many people overseas, and that of course has foreign exchange implications. For that reason alone I think it is generally desirable that we should be attracting visitors to this country. Australia's tourist record is very good at the moment and is improving. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, who has taken a great interest in this area, is reasonably pleased with the tourist situation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did have my attention drawn to an article in the Canberra Times which referred to intending tourists being warned off Australia. I am not in a position to confirm or to deny that travel agents overseas are warning people about coming to Australia or are avoiding sending people to Australia because of the risk that they will be stranded here. But I suggest to the honourable senator that what is required in this area is not a campaign to support Australia's need to allow tourists to go home when they have finished their visits here but an actual ability for tourists to go home when they have finished their visits here. I would have thought it should again be accepted all round the chamber that it is not in Australia's interest to see Australians or non-Australians stranded here or overseas because of strike action. The general industrial relations policy of this Government, which is aimed at the reduction of industrial conflict and which requires the co-operation of the Australian people, is one which, I trust, will reduce the problem to which the honourable senator referred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that Senator McAuliffe is talking as a Queenslander and not as a member of the Australian Labor Party, so I withdraw my previous remarks. Senator McAuliffe drew attention to the fact that there have been several questions on this subject. I am aware that various claims have been made about the Australian Wool Testing Authority and that some representations have been made about its sale. As I have already indicated to the Senate, the Minister for Primary Industry, in carrying out the decision of the Review of Commonwealth Functions in this area, has indicated that he will proceed in consultation with the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicated yesterday that I thought it would not be sensible of me to go into more detail pending the Minister's return to Australia and his taking up of that commitment. I am quite sure that the points made by Senator McAuliffe will be taken into account in looking at how this matter should be approached. Of course, the Government is not seeking to take funds which have been contributed by other people. It is merely trying to reduce the amount of government administration in this country, not the benefits which flow to the people of Australia. I will certainly draw the points raised by Senator McAuliffe to Mr Nixon's attention. I have little doubt that the facts he has raised concerning the contributions by growers and so on are well known to the Minister and would have been in his mind in making his decision to proceed in consultation with the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> As to whether we should dispense with other elements in the wool testing area, I am grateful that the honourable senator from Queensland, who has a close interest in financial matters, should put forward suggestions for further economies which might be effected. I will see that they are referred to Sir Phillip Lynch with a view to examination because the Government has not completed its work in this area. The Government always wishes to be alert for other areas of saving which might be effected. If members of the Opposition can make sensible suggestions about that, so much the better. I say that without wishing to give any commitment that there should be any interference with that particular Authority. I am not so well advised of the matter to be able to say that the suggestion put forward by Senator McAuliffe has any merit. I simply say that I will refer it to the Minister for consideration.</PARA>

They include a copy of a Press release issued by the Minister for Health which really attempts to set out what the situation is-that is, that a draft standard has been circulated for public discussion on the basis that by opening up the public discussion and getting expressions of view, the Government will be in a position better able to understand what the public wishes or feels on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is this the beginning of a major reversal of policy in France against nuclear energy and is not that trend also evident already in Japan? Since both these nations were once seen as major customers for Australian uranium and since other less scrupulous customers without doubt want our uranium for manufacturing bombs, will the Government now take positive steps to withdraw its support from the dangerous, pollutant, uneconomic and thoroughly discredited nuclear power industry by refusing any further development of uranium mining in this country? Will the Government commence this new policy immediately by effectively preventing any further exploitation for uranium of the existing Kakadu National Park and projected extensions of the park?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I heard on the radio news that there was to be some postponement of the construction of a nuclear power station in France and that there was a suggestion that under the new Mitterrand regime there would be no progress on the nuclear campaign in France without a referendum. The background that honourable senators should understand is that France has projected that 50 per cent of its electric power generation will be provided by nuclear power by 1985 and that that percentage will increase from then. I am unable to say what will happen. I can say only that in France if, indeed, there is a decision to change course, there will be a major infrastructure problem with that change if France is to go to, say, coal because the lead times for power stations are eight to 10 years. I cannot venture an opinion, nor should I, upon either the practicability of proposals or the politics of another nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say to the honourable senator in all good faith that some time ago I said-I did not say it with whimsy-that I saw on a wall in, I think, America, graffiti which read: 'Ban all nuclear power generation'. Someone else had written: 'Yes, and let all the illegitimates freeze to death in the dark'. I substituted a euphemism. There is a terribly important message in that. Most of those who understand the problem of providing alternative energy in this world believe two things. The first is that it will not be possible totally to solve the alternative energy problem by either the use of renewable energy or the major use of coal. The second point is that if it were possible to achieve the necessary coal power generation on the massive scale that is envisaged-that would involve shifting something like 1,000 million tonnes of coal a year by sea-the burning of that coal would create a world pollution potential and a threat to health of a magnitude that people seem to ignore.</PARA>
<PARA> The world is facing a grim energy crisis. No one can clearly see the solution being achieved without some contribution by atomic energy. Nobody wants any kind of nuclear threat to the world. Everybody is keen to take the danger of contamination and pollution away from human beings whether they be from uranium or from coal. But nobody wants to let the so-called illegitimates freeze to death in the dark. That is the dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA> As to bombs, that matter is an irrelevancy because everybody knows that Australia's signature to the non-proliferation pact means that Australia will do nothing that will enable its uranium to be provided for the creation of plutonium for making atom bombs. As I think I answered a question in this House the other day, the tragedy of the world is that at this moment the major nations have more than enough plutonium to blow up the world many times over. Of course the real threat-Senator Mason and I would share this belief-is that it will get into the hands of smaller countries or terrorists. I acknowledge that very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA> The question poses a dilemma and a challenge to the world. It is a challenge that has to be taken up and we cannot just take partisan stands either way. The world is energy hungry; it needs energy. Nobody believes at the moment, with our state of technology, that we can meet that need totally without the use of uranium. I think everybody hopes that the fusion process, the process of releasing energy from heavy hydrogen from deuterium will be expedited and that down the track, say in a quarter of a century, that will mitigate the problem. But, I regret to say that the dilemma on the way is not one on which we can go into opposing corners. We have to try to stop these so-called illegitimates from freezing in the dark.</PARA>

There was some pessimism in more recent estimates but, frankly, countries such as Japan and West Germany and others, whatever their present political policies, have expressed the view that they cannot see how they will solve their problems without some supplementation of a significant kind by nuclear energy. Therefore, I am not of the opinion that there is any proof that there will be a fall in the long term demand for uranium. On the contrary, I think our job is to ensure that if the world needs uranium for energy, it gets it, but under the strict provisions that it cannot be used for non-peaceful means and that the world should concentrate on taking the bugs out of any contamination that nuclear power stations may cause. Equally, the world had better concentrate on taking the bugs out of coal-fired power stations because they are a very real threat.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the feasibility of uranium enrichment is a matter that comes under my portfolio, but I take on board the responsibility of the Department of Science and Technology. Some time ago this Government enabled a body called UEGA-the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia, a body of some four major Australian companies such as CSR Ltd, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Western Mining Corporation-to undertake first of all a pre-feasibility study into uranium enrichment and then to consider whether a feasibility study should be made. The body has made a report. It has said that there will be, in its view, an enhanced demand in the world for enriched uranium from 1990 onwards, but not before. Therefore, there will be a market for a factory producing enriched uranium from 1990. The body considers that Australia has the ability to sustain such an industry. It then outlined the questions of the choice of technology as between centrifuge, gaseous diffusion and a new technology which is emerging called chemical exchange, or chemex. This is an ion exchange and is a very complex process. The body indicated that it would set about looking at it. It has submitted to the Government a report which the Government is studying as to the next step in feasibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is confronted with making a number of judgments. I should hope that it would be able to make an announcement in the weeks immediately ahead as to any intention of procedure in feasibility study. There are two factors involved in that. There is the choice of technology-whether centrifuge, diffusion or chemex. Amongst other things, apart from the high technology, the tremendous use of electric power in diffusion and, to a lesser extent, in chemex has to be considered. There is also the question of markets. I hope that we will be able to give a much more detailed answer to the honourable senator within the next few weeks.</PARA>

The pipeline from the Cooper Basin to Whyalla is expected to be in position by January 1983, which is a relatively short time from now. That pipeline is expected to carry in its first year, not under pressure, some 35,000 barrels of liquids a day-liquids of hydrocarbons of all kinds. It could, under pressure, carry 80,000 barrels, so we are not dealing with an insignificant contribution to Australia's energy or to South Australia's industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my understanding that Santos Ltd is contemplating a refinery along the lines that Senator Jessop has indicated. I do not think it has made a definitive statement. Of course there had been a contemplation of taking a pipeline to Stanvac further south and establishing a refinery there. I know that Santos is busy in this regard. I had thought that, due to a number of factors, Dow Chemical (Australia) Ltd had set aside for the time being its consideration of petrochemicals, the stripping of ethane from the gas, but that was governed, I think, by a number of things such as a world recession due to oil prices, and also a development in the Middle East whereby the Middle East oil producing nations, rather than flaring their gases, are now turning towards stripping and processing. In fact there is an emerging glut of liquefied petroleum gas. I should tell the Senate that, as I was fortunate enough to be able to predict some months ago, there is a fall in the world price of LPG of some $40 a tonne, which is very significant.</PARA>

The Uniting Church in Australia at that place provides a very high standard of service to people, some of whom are simply aged, but many of whom are infirm, and others of whom are severely incapacitated. In hostel arrangements the Uniting Church has given a standard of nursing care which, I think, is well in excess of what one would normally expect or require in that sort of accommodation.

I was pleased that at those discussions we were able to meet the request of the Uniting Church to make changes in the arrangements with respect to the Old Timers' Home which, to my recollection, involved changing certain hostel beds to nursing home beds which, of course, has some financial benefit to that organisation and which, I think, will improve the standard of services which can be provided.</PARA>

The agreement was that we should examine the position of the Northern Territory, both in the north and in the centre, to see what arrangements were required. The Uniting Church already has proposals for other facilities, for example, at Katherine. These matters are under examination. It is to be hoped that the needs of the Territory in this area can be met with the reasonable co-operation of the two governments concerned and the Uniting Church which has been making such a valuable contribution.</PARA>

This has now been adjusted. The Department will be able to pay the work value increase, if any applies, to the employees concerned from the date of the last basic wage case-7 May 1981-to the date of the award automatically. The Department may be able to take this back to the January basic wage increase but this will involve a few difficulties because of the changes in status of some employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Finance system is a payments system and not a personnel system. This is the reason we cannot pay the whole of the increase automatically. The Finance Department does not hold the past pay history records; these are held in the departments to which the employees are related. The calculations for variations relating to overtime, higher duties and status resulting from the three national wage cases must be done by departmental personnel sections. This involves a very heavy work load because of the nature of the changes in the pays that will result from the decision. The adjustment will be one of the largest pay exercises to be undertaken in the last few years. It will require significant effort by the Finance Department computing staff and accounting staff, once the other departments have completed their work. The Department advises me that some increases in large departments will be paid in two or three blocks as they are completed. I want to stress that every effort will be made by my Department and by other departments to see that no undue delay occurs in the increased payments that result from these wage decisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Having regard to the quaint conclusions that were reached by a magistrate concerning certain happenings at Ayers Rock, have there been any summit talks between the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and its Northern Territory counterparts to ensure that the conclusions of the magistrate in question are not to be used as an occasion for wholesale fauna carnage? I have in mind, of course, the dingo. There are some unanswered questions from that inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may not be appropriate to take up the last point raised by the honourable senator, but I have some information relating to the major part of his question. I think the honourable senator referred to the fact that the coroner, in presenting his findings on the Azaria Chamberlain case, commented, among other things, that dangerous animals should be eliminated from national parks or at least from those areas frequented by visitors. It was these comments which have drawn protests from many people. There is a balance to be drawn, of course, between the need for people who go to national parks to exercise some degree of caution and the appropriate place of fauna in the parks. Following the handing down of the coroner's findings, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and other senior officers of the Service have had discussions with their counterparts in the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They have agreed that in the light of the coroner's comments the following action should be implemented. I have been advised of four actions. The first is the erection of additional signs warning of the dangers of dingoes at Uluru. The second is the preparation of a leaflet for distribution to visitors to national parks warning of dangerous animals that might be encountered. The third is the promulgation of a regulation prohibiting the feeding of wildlife in national parks. The fourth is the fencing of a limited area of the camping ground at Uluru within which persons concerned for their own safety and that of their children may camp if they so desire. The benefits which might flow from this approach might well be that people have a maximum of information on which they can base their judgments to make best decisions, that there will be minimum interference with the fauna which quite properly live in the park and that there will be some protection for the public interest, as indicated by the coroner. I hope this response meets the comments of the honourable senator.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hearn asked me a series of questions some days ago about the Bethlehem House homeless persons' centre in Hobart. I undertook to examine the matter and to let her have a full reply. Since Senator Hearn asked me that question, a number of other representatives from Tasmania have also talked to me about the problems of Bethlehem House. They have assured me that the problems are serious in the same manner as did Senator Hearn in her questions. I advise the Senate for its general information that we provide support for people who are homeless through programs under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. We have undertaken to make additional capital assistance of $10m available over the next three years. In addition, we provide subsidies against recurrent costs. As I understand it, the problems of Bethlehem House relate to recurrent costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The centre is at the moment receiving the maximum subsidies to which it is entitled. It is operated by the Society of St Vincent de Paul, which is, of course, very active in support of the most needy in our society. It has for some time been experiencing difficulties in maintaining the centre. It received emergency assistance from the State Government last year. The Government increased the rate of recurrent subsidies payable to centres of this type with effect from 1 July 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the continuing difficulties being experienced by the Society, my Department is arranging a joint review with the appropriate State authorities and the organisation itself. My understanding is that this was arranged prior to the matter being raised in the Senate. It is a review of the current financial situation, including the precise nature of the difficulties and the likely causes. It is being undertaken of necessity without any commitment as to future funding arrangements but in a spirit of trying to help the organisation identify any possible source of relief. It will include, of course, careful examination of the cost structure of the service being offered. It is my hope that the Society will be able to maintain the centre. I recognise that the closure of the hostel would result in additional pressures on other agencies and State authorities. I have asked my Department to keep me advised of the course of this review. I will be happy to discuss it at a later time with the honourable senator if she wishes.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hearn also asked whether I was aware of a letter written in June 1980 to the then Minister and whether that letter had been answered. I have made inquiries of the Department. I have found that a number of representations were made, including the one in June 1980, in relation to Bethlehem House. Those letters were answered in August 1980 by my predecessor.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Archer asked me in the Senate on 12 May whether the Minister for Trade and Resources would, while he was in New Zealand for ministerial trade talks, take up the matter of the impact of New Zealand fish imports on the Australian industry. The Australian fish industry has recently complained about the importation of dumped fresh and frozen fish from New Zealand. I undertook to get a message to Mr Anthony who was at that stage engaged in discussions with New Zealand Ministers. However, the question was asked on the day of completion of those discussions. I was not able to get a message to the Minister within an effective time and the matter was not raised during the talks the Minister was holding on that day. The matter has now been brought to the attention of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I advise the Senate that fresh and frozen fish are included on Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Trade in both directions between Australia and New Zealand is, accordingly, duty free. However, as Australia accords duty free treatment to imports of fresh and frozen fish from all sources, New Zealand does not receive preferential treatment for these items. Australian imports of fresh and frozen fish from New Zealand have grown rapidly in recent years. In 1979-80 Australia imported some 11,000 tonnes valued at $15m from that country. This represented an increase of more than 60 per cent over the previous financial year and imports have continued to rise in the first nine months of this financial year. The Australian fishing industry has the option of seeking anti-dumping action if a case can be established that the imports from New Zealand are being sold at less than normal value and have caused or threaten to cause material injury to the Australian industry. Article 10 of NAFTA specifically provides for consultation between the two governments as a means of resolving such cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I wish to persist with the Opposition amendment moved in my name to delete all words after 'authorities'. The point of this amendment was simply to clarify the objectives and intentions section of this clause and make it clear that the exemptions elsewhere in the Bill were not overstated in the initial object section. I will say more about the particular subject matter of clause 3 in a moment. However, the point that I want to make strongly right at the outset of this debate is that clause 3 is symbolic of a larger phenomenon that will return over and over again today. That is a situation in which the Government promised to consider the force of the amendment moved by individual senators and promised to go away and redraft the provision so as to accommodate the concern expressed and to bring back a redrafted clause accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 3 is the first such example of a promise of this kind having been made. It is also the first example that we will come to today of a promise of this kind being broken in the sense that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has not come back anywhere in his rather tangled amendment booklet, just put before us, with a redrafted clause. He has decided to stand firm on the original drafting. As I said, this is an exercise which is likely to be repeated very often during the day. What might have been a great parliamentary occasion seems now destined to be a procession of capitulations. The Government's will will prevail. No amendments will be carried other than those the Government has indicated it is prepared to accept. However irrational, unreasoned or unprincipled the Government's position might be, all honourable senators on the Government side will line up behind it. As a culmination of the bludgeoning and soothing respectively that have been offered by the Government to its own members over the last few days and weeks we have a situation in which the bravery of three or four weeks has now evaporated. It has got too dark for the schoolboys to whistle any more. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that some significant concessions have been won by those of us who have been concerned to secure more effective freedom of information legislation. Some concessions have been won as a result of the efforts of the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and that original group of Government senators who indicated they had a principled position on the Bill. In that respect the exercise has not been a complete waste of time. There are some proposed significant amendments to the conclusive certificates provisions of the Bill which will represent an advance on the intransigence which originally had been demonstrated by the Government. How much of an advance it represents we will be debating in more detail, later on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now the case that there are sensible provisions with respect to access to personal records for the purposes of correcting them where they are misleading. That is to be applauded. There are minor improvements in the prior documents access provisions of the Bill. For some, at least, that is a matter of joy. A number of small procedural changes have also been accepted by the Government. Many more concessions have been made by those Government senators who originally indicated, by putting their names to the amendments that have been circulated in this chamber, that many more concessions would be made but none of them will now proceed today with the amendment standing in their name except to the extent those amendments that have been the subject of Government acceptance and are likely to be accepted either in their original or in a slightly redrafted form. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the conclusive certificates provisions are still ultimately in the hands of Ministers. Although there are significant improvements, as I said, that area of the Bill still leaves an enormous amount to be desired. As a result there will be no significant weakening in the scope of any of the exemption provisions which, of course, litter so much of this Bill. As a result there will be not one exempt agency listed in the Schedule to the Bill that will, at the end of this day, be non-exempt. There will be not one class of agency documents listed in the Schedule to this Bill that will, at the end of the day, be non-exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this capitulation the Commonwealth Ombudsman will not now be able to exercise the wide-ranging functions of an information commissioner that were envisaged and contemplated for him with all the rational arguments that we put together and produced in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. As a result of this perhaps understandable capitulation to the forces that were set to work in the last couple of weeks, innumerable procedural obstacles will still remain in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the score card, as I understand it is likely to be at the end of the day, the result is something like this: Of the 80 amendments that were proposed and have been circulated, the Government has indicated that it will accept 24, either in whole or in part. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see. Maybe the score card will need altering at the end of the day. Maybe I will succeed in restoring some fire to the breasts of the dragons on the other side of the chamber and maybe some further concessions will be made. Twenty-four amendments have been accepted. Of the 80 amendments, 56 have been rejected by the Government. It remains to be seen at the end of the day whether they will still be rejected but that is the situation as I undertand it at the moment. Of those 24 acceptances, in two cases they have been manifestly involuntary. They were the subject of votes in this chamber a few weeks ago. There will be a couple of further consequential amendments following from that which, I understand, will also be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be voluntary acceptances of another some 22 amendments, as I understand it. Eleven of them will be accepted in the original form in which they are moved. Another 11 will be accepted in a redrafted form, nonetheless still accepting the principles that were involved in the original amendment. Of the 56 amendments which, on my understanding, are likely to be rejected, 11 are in that category where, I understand, the Government did, in fact, originally promise either overtly in this chamber or outside it that it would take the amendment away and redraft it to make it more acceptable in some respects but that it would basically accept the principles that were involved. In 11 cases, and clause 3 which we are debating is an example of one of those cases, what has happened is that an indication of an intention to redraft has not been followed through and we are left with a straight out rejection. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation and I suggest that it is a situation which redounds to no one's credit on the Government side. I do not believe that anyone on the other side of the chamber has emerged from this exercise with real credit. The Government has been defeated on the floor, and has been forced to retreat clearly as a result of its concern not to be defeated again on a number of other issues. The Government will win on the numbers today, undoubtedly, if and when divisions are called but it will not have won on the arguments. It will not have won on the merits of the debate and it knows that perfectly well. Equally, as to the back benchers on the Government side who, I know, have a deep and principled commitment to the issues that they have hitherto put their names to, once again we have seen this phenomenon-I have had occasion to draw attention to it necessarily in the past-of standing up but not quite long enough to be counted. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we have a situation where the Bill which will emerge from this debate will be significantly better in a number of ways, I readily acknowledge, than the Bill which came to us at the beginning of this year. However, it will-this is ultimately the crunch point-fall far short of what is necessary for effective freedom of information legislation. In this respect the biggest loser has been not any individual senators but this Parliament itself. At the outset of this exercise this side of the chamber genuinely hoped to have a discussion-or a conflict-between Parliament on the one hand and the Executive on the other-a discussion in which there would be a genuine burying of Government-Opposition party differences in a mutual desire to get the best possible legislation in the interests of this nation. What we have instead is that routine phenomenon of an Opposition versus Government debate. That is what we have been reduced to. It is a familiar enough phenomenon in this place but one would have hoped that, in the context of legislation as important and as outside the immediate realm of party politics as freedom of information, we might have been able to do something better. It would have been so much better had things worked out differently. I make the final point that the contempt for parliament, which I regard as having been involved in these developments of the last few days and weeks, is shown by the way in which today's debate has so far been handled-the setting up of it-and the way in which it will be handled. The amendments which have been circulated on behalf of the Government were made available to members of this side of the chamber only--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And that side. I would welcome the honourable senator's own contribution on this point if he feels as strongly about it as I do. Despite the weeks that the Government has had to get its act together in determining what its reaction was likely to be, it was only at 10 o'clock last night, a few hours before the commencement of the debate this morning, that we at last had any clear idea as to what the Government's attitude would be on the mass of amendments that had been proposed by honourable senators-particularly Opposition senators-in this chamber. It was only at 10 o'clock last night that we were even able to commence coming to grips with the task of working out what had been accepted or rejected, and what had been promised to be redrawn or redrafted but which had not been delivered upon. Moreover, it was not until the amendments came before us, as is evidenced from what the Attorney has already said this morning about the numbering of the pages of his amendment document, that we saw that they had come forward in a form that can be described only as an unholy tangle. Last night I spent until 2 a.m. just getting the bits of paper into sufficient order to understand precisely what was going on, quite apart from being able to come to grips with the drafting detail and the underlying issues and the principles behind them. Under those circumstances, it will be a miracle if we can have any kind of rational, ordered debate today. It will be made very difficult indeed by virtue of that mechanical failure on the part of the Government to respect this Parliament sufficiently well to bring forward these amendments in a form that is easily and readily debatable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Associated with that is the time threat that now hangs over our heads so far as this debate is concerned. We have been told that this is the one day on which this Parliament can have to consider the freedom of information issue, that if the Bill is not completed by the end of this day, if we have not worked our way through all these 80 amendments and through all the clauses of the Bill, there will not be a Bill; that is it, take it or leave it. However, as the Government, everyone on both sides of this chamber and everyone outside this chamber knows, the issues involved in this legislation are phenomenally complex and important, and the most minimum of respect for Parliament and everything associated with it would have allowed rather more time than that to enable a proper consideration of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> So, today we will go through the motions. On occasions the debate might even be interesting because of the necessarily fascinating and important character of the issues before us. But it will not be a constructive debate because the Government has made up its mind that it will not be. So, effective freedom of information, like, I fear, the reputations of some of those who have been most boisterous in its support, will by the end of this day have died the death of a hundred cuts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, a Minister cannot close a debate by rising to speak at the Committee stage of a Bill. It might help to facilitate today's proceedings if that were possible. I rise only because of Senator Evans's initial contribution to a debate which I hoped was going to be an exercise in endeavouring to deal with a lot of very complicated and interlocking amendments. The only way in which today can be a great parliamentary occasion is if the cheap politicking type of speech which has just been made by Senator Evans is eschewed by all honourable senators for the rest of the day. In a spirit of charity, I say that the only explanation I can find for his contribution is that he sat up too late last night, not studying the amendments but doing a lot of unnecessary arithmetic which may well prove to be wrong before the day is out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the Freedom of Information Bill is the object clause. It is an important clause, particularly in the light of the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act, which Senator Evans supported in this place yesterday. It is true that when we discussed this matter before, I indicated that I would look at ways of redrafting the clause as there had been dissatisfaction expressed by honourable senators who spoke at the Committee stage of the Bill on the previous occasion. I have done that. I have had great difficulty in framing an amendment which does satisfy the need to state the objects as a balancing test. The trouble with Senator Evans's amendment No. (3) is that it does not provide for that balance. It is important, when we are talking about an object to create a right of access to official information, that it is balanced by certain overriding public interests which are embodied in various exemptions. I did entertain the idea that the problem could be overcome by simply saying 'subject to an overriding public interest', but that really is not adequate because also private and business interests are protected in exemptions, which I understand everyone supports. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can suggest is that we might drop off the second limb of clause 3 (1) (b). It does not add anything. Sub-clause (1) deals with the protection of essential public interests. I would be prepared to accept such an amendment. I would even be prepared to move an amendment to achieve that. I have not been able to redraft, despite the efforts that have been made to do so, a different form of objects clause. I make the suggestion that I am prepared to compromise to that extent. It is vital, in my view, for the objects clause to express clearly the fact that it is not an absolute right but a qualified right and that there is a balancing exercise that those who will be called upon to interpret this Act must make. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen an alternative amendment by Senator Evans which has just been circulated. Do I take it that it is an alternative amendment to the one which he has moved?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see. That got lost with the rhetoric, apparently. I think that amendment goes some way towards meeting my concern. It limits the exemptions specified in the Bill. Of course, other legislation such as secrecy legislation may be passed which will exempt documents from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Although such occurrences may be rare, that could happen. I am sure that such legislation would be vigorously opposed by large numbers of honourable senators. That is simply a logical possibility for which we have to provide. There is that problem with Senator Evans's amendment. I prefer the more ample explanations which are contained in the first limb of clause 3 (1) (b). I think they are more appropriate to an objects clause than the rather terse form in which Senator Evans's substituted amendment is expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> 'subject to the exemptions and exceptions specified in this Act'. </PARA>
<PARA>I do so on the basis that it picks up sufficiently, at least for the purposes of an objects clause, the balancing interest that the Attorney-General, understandably, was concerned to have incorporated in the legislation. The objection he stated a moment ago to a clause in these terms, that it might not accommodate other kinds of exceptions to this Bill which are accomplished by virtue of other pieces of legislation, does not seem to me to be a well-founded point. To the extent that other Acts cut across the principles of the freedom of information legislation, those other Acts are incorporated by reference, as it were, in the terms of this legislation. Their existence is acknowledged in clause 3 of this Bill, which will preserve other secrecy provisions. It is not that I want any other secrecy provisions to have an overriding effect; I am just meeting the technical point that has been made by the Attorney. They are exemptions which are provided for in this Bill. I suggest that the amendment in the form in which it has been moved can be accepted by the Attorney and that the arithmetic can be approved to at least that small extent as a benevolent gesture with which to start the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must make some remarks about this clause. Obviously, there is not complete agreement about it. Discussions have taken place this morning. I understand that the Attorney-General's advisers will consider and may come up with further redraftings. I hope that we will not conclude the debate on this clause now. It seems to me that it is not altogether satisfactory in its present form. I certainly think it should be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has already been an attack on senators on this side of the chamber this morning by Senator Evans. I am not going to reply to that. I have not responded to people who attack the position taken by honourable senators, whether on this side of the chamber or on the other side. I will not get into an argument about that. I think that would be unhelpful. I believe that a number of areas that are not covered in the circulated amendments have been the subject of discussions this morning. I am taking a certain stand in relation to this Bill in the expectation that before this day is out we will debate amendments involving a number of areas, including the exemption provisions, which have been mentioned by Senator Evans. As far as this matter is concerned I, and I think, my other colleagues will be supporting a certain package of amendments which the Government is prepared to put forward and to support. I do so because I have in mind that we want a Bill that can pass both Houses of the Parliament and is not therefore just a presentational piece of work which looks good, but which does not have a chance of being part of the legislation and operating in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans can insult us as much as he likes. I, and my colleagues, Senator Puplick, Senator Hamer and other honourable senators have sweated over these amendments and what is desired. To some extent we will not be moving amendments which were circulated in our names because we have accepted a lesser package-not a satisfactory package in my view, but one, which, I think, will provide a very substantial gain in important areas. Quite a considerable number of amendments to the Bill have been drafted. I pay particular tribute to Senator Evans and to Mr John McMillan who have done a lot of work drafting the proposals which have been put forward. I wish to say to Senator Evans that those efforts have not been wasted. Today we need to be a bit more constructive about this and, where there are areas of obscurity, we should endeavour to put those aside for the moment and discuss them a bit later rather than indulge in abuse of each other across the chamber. I do not intend to repeat that. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that considering the Bill which was passed yesterday, one must look at a clause like this with more scrutiny than is normally the case. Both previous speakers referred to a balancing test. I am worried about that expression. As I understand it and as I look at the need for freedom of information it is a general system of openness of documents in the possession of the Government. This system is not to be balanced by the other, but limited. In some ways I prefer the words which are in the original Government Bill 'limited only by'. These words might have some benefit over the proposal that it is just subject to the exemptions and exceptions specified in the amendment which Senator Evans has moved. Maybe an amalgam of this language would successfully point out that freedom of information is to be the rule, that access to documents is to be the rule and it is limited only by the exceptions set out in this Bill. Perhaps, therefore Madam Temporary Chairman, we can leave this matter as it is difficult to draft on the run. I hope that the Attorney's officers might be able to do something about this. We ought to set this matter down for a bit later in the day and not rush into a quick decision on it. </PARA>

There should be some response from this side of the chamber to what the Attorney-General has said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably I can do so without interruption, Senator Puplick. I do not know whether I will. I suppose time will tell. Basically, a deal has been done on the freedom of information legislation in the Liberal Party room. That is the situation. That is the truth. A serious implication of that is that this Government has short-circuited this Parliament, which is the property of the Australian people and to every word of which they have access. This Government has elected to duck out of that. It does not want that to happen. The Government-I include all honourable senators opposite-has decided that something will be done that is to be concealed again. I must say that it is being remarkably consistent, because it is doing so in the consummation of an act which it calls a Freedom of Information Bill. The Government is hoist with its own petard. It has demonstrated publicly and blatantly that it has ignored this Parliament which is the voice of the people of this country. It has attempted in every possible way to dissuade and to prevent reasonable discussion of a series of amendments put forward reasonably, by indulging in a cheap political trick, by saying that it will, in its own circle, to which the public does not have access, decide what is to be done and what is not to be done. The Australian Democrats are deeply disappointed with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My broadsides are not directed at the Liberal senators who have been called rebels-although I suggest that they are not. I think a pretty good cosmetic operation has been mustered on this Bill. They are directed at the Government, which I again indict publicly for striking yet another of the very many blows which it has delivered towards the democratic processes of this country. If the Attorney merely dismisses that as rhetoric, I suggest that that is an indictment of his limitations as a leader in this country. If he cannot see, as Attorney-General of this country, that there is a certain importance in what I have said beyond rhetoric, I feel very sorry for him. </PARA>
<PARA> I state for the record that the Democrats are deeply disappointed with the pattern that has been adopted for this legislation. It is a pattern which will not be acceptable to us in the future. In future we intend to see that matters are discussed in this Parliament. I believe that we will be in a position to see that that happens and that discussions will not be curtailed or limited in any respect. We agree that politics is the art of the possible. At this stage it is probably better to achieve a freedom of information Bill of some sort than to have the Government merely saying that it will take its bat home. I believe that on that basis we can proceed today with our operations. The Democrats will proceed to move and discuss the amendments which are listed in my name just as though this place were a real parliament instead of the farcical proceeding which will go on throughout the rest of this day. </PARA>

He may not have been fully filled in regarding the whole course of events. But I am in no doubt that the package was resolved yesterday and that it was resolved on the basis of the material that is before us today. It appears that a few more cosmetic changes of some kind or another will be made, acknowledged or allowed during the debate. But, as Senator Mason says, that will be done only in the corridors and party rooms of the Government. They will not be put on the table here and debated on their merits. There will be further compromises and negotiations behind the scenes. It may well be that the product of that will be some further improvement to the Bill designed, not to get effective freedom of information legislation, but to shore up the already rather tattered reputations of the back bench senators who have been involved so prominently in this exercise. It may be that at the end of the day there will be just a little more icing on the cake, but it will still have a very bitter taste.</PARA></TALK.START>

In particular, an indispensable part of the scheme will be the making available of up to date indexes of those documents which are able to be obtained under the Freedom of Information Bill.

In the amendment which has been circulated in my name no enforceable duty is cast upon anyone to update the indexes every three months. But there is a very clear indication of the Parliament's intention that that should be done. The amendment is necessary to make clear to the various agencies concerned that an updating of all the indexes and gazettals every three months is what the Parliament wishes to see.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the Attorney-General. I do not think there is a great deal of difference between that amendment and the one which has been foreshadowed by Senator Tate. All that Senator Tate's amendment does is express the intention of parliament that further statements should be published wherever practicable at intervals of three months. We argued this point previously. The Government is not prepared to accept a commitment to a time limit of three months. This is one of a number of amendments which will not be pushed today by honourable senators on this side of the chamber because it involves the Government's maintaining that a very considerable demand on resources may be caused by some of its provisions. Of course, time will tell whether that is so. After a period of operation of the legislation, it will be possible to see whether that is so and whether we can have more frequent updating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has produced an amendment which will have the effect of drawing the attention of a person to documents which have come in since the 12-monthly publication of documents, schemes and so forth which are going to be made available to people. It gives a direction to the agencies of the Government. Likewise, Senator Tate's foreshadowed amendment would give that direction. The Government places some stress on this matter because of the possible cost of administration. Since it is a matter which will be tested and with regard to which it will be possible for this Parliament to take action, on reports, to ensure that it should be done more frequently if there are not those sorts of demands-I suspect that demands will not be that great, unfortunately- we will have a chance to look at this again at a reasonably early date. Therefore, I support the Attorney's amendment. I think it is slightly preferable to Senator Tate's fore- shadowed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment (by Senator Tate) negatived:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 8, clause 8, after sub-clause (2), insert the following new sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> (2A) Nothing in paragraph (2) (c) is intended to prevent or discourage an agency from causing a statement bringing up to date information contained in a previous statement or statements to be published, whether in the Gazette or otherwise, at intervals of less than 12 months, and for this purpose it is the intention of Parliament that such statements will be published, where practicable, at intervals of not more than 3 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the name of the Opposition at this stage. In clause 8, sub-clauses (5) to (7) of the new Bill there is a provision, in a form which was not before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs when it considered it, whereby the Minister may in writing extend the time in which an agency can prepare the sort of information for inspection and purchase which was alluded to earlier. We have here a ministerial discretion whereby the Minister can virtually exempt an agency from initial or subsequent compliance with the time clauses in the earlier parts of the Bill which were thought to be important. That power is not appealable, although it is true that the Minister is required to set out in the annual report his use of the provision. The Opposition is still of the view that the power ought not be vested in the Minister, that the time limitations in the Bill are quite generous and that there should be no power with the Minister to exercise a discretion in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support very strongly this amendment to delete sub-clauses (5) to (7). Of course, the amendment was originally moved by Senator Puplick and supported strongly by Senator Puplick and Senator Missen. I remind the chamber of what Senator Puplick said about this amendment on 7 May as reported at page 1793 of Hansard because I think it admirably sets out the difficulties with this group of sub-clauses, as it stands. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These catch-all clauses provide that the Attorney may, in consultation with the Minister responsible for the agency, waive that 12 months period--</PARA>
<PARA>That is for compliance-</PARA>
<PARA>if special circumstances applicable to that agency are laid before him. I cannot conceive of special circumstances existing, given the time that all this business has been in train. But I can conceive the situation in which agencies either because of incompetence or by being deliberately dilatory in preparing these manuals, will go to the Attorney shortly before the 12 months period expires and spin out the usual yarn about why the requirements of the Parliament cannot be complied with, and why it is that the Attorney should specifically make an exemption for them. Undoubtedly they will come to the Attorney two or three days before the deadline with that sort of request. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick continued further in this vein. A few minutes later Senator Missen said: 'I agree with everything that Senator Puplick has said'. The arguments have not changed since that debate took place in the chamber three weeks ago. It appears the only thing that has changed is the state of mind of the honourable senators concerned. Under those circumstances we believe that the arguments-which do not need to be repeated in any more detail-deserve to be tested in this chamber by a division. Unless the Attorney indicates that he is willing to accommodate the Opposition's amendment we will, in fact, propose that the Committee divide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that that comment made by Senator Evans is very unfair. We had a lengthy discussion on clause 8. Indeed this was the clause on which we ended our previous debate. I wished to give some thought to ways and means of getting over the problem of ministerial discretion embodied in it. In principle I am not happy about the wide ministerial discretion here; I never have been. It is the only way in which this problem seemed to be effectively dealt with. I explained what the problems were. The unfortunate fact is that we have not seen a way of getting around them in the time since we last debated the matter. I am not prepared to agree to the amendment for that reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I intend to pursue the question as to whether this will be necessary or whether perhaps there could be some extension for a certain period authorised by the Minister. I am looking at that. Because of the great volume of material and the large number of departments involved here-although substantially it is a tax problem-we have not been able to finalise this. I intend to pursue those inquiries. When the Bill passes through this chamber and the House of Representatives there will still be an interval which I hope will enable me to give the matter further thought. If we can find some solution I will propose to my colleague in another place that he incorporate any amendment to the Bill if possible. I cannot give any undertaking that the clause will be amended. I certainly give the undertaking that the inquiries I have been engaged on will continue. I hope that we will come to some resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments of the Attorney-General have been very helpful in this regard. Senator Evans has quoted from statements which Senator Puplick and I made on the occasion of the last debate. I am not speaking for Senator Puplick but certainly I do not resile one bit from those remarks. We do have fears and worries about people getting unnecessary extensions. This Parliament will be watching very carefully to see whether these things are wrongly used and wrongly claimed. The Parliament has to find these things out. We have facilities in the Parliament, for example, in the Estimates committees to find out why these things may be done and whether they are misused. Even if the Attorney cannot find a course whereby this clause can be amended to cut down on the discretionary powers I expect that this will be carefully watched by honourable senators and, one hopes, by members of the other chamber. I for one stand by what I said on the previous occasion. In the interests of the whole package and of a Bill which is substantially good and in order for it to go through two chambers I am certainly prepared to abandon this particular proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate, as always, the conciliatory tone that crept into the remarks of the Attorney-General when he last spoke. I suggest to honourable senators that it would concentrate the mind of the Government rather more wonderfully on coming up with a solution to this problem if the clauses in question that are presently so offensive were, in fact, deleted so that the Bill went into the other place with a clean slate, as it were. If the Attorney is minded over the next few weeks to find a more satisfactory clause to replace those that will have thus been taken out, we will certainly be prepared to look at it when the Bill comes back into this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clauses, as Senators Missen and Puplick indicated so clearly when we last debated this legislation, are manifestly unacceptable as they stand at the moment. I encourage the senators in question-indeed, I encourage the Attorney-to join with the Opposition in voting in favour of this amendment to clear the deck of this palpable, obstructive nonsense which exists at the moment. I indicate that we propose to divide on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition persists with amendment No. (15), which is on page 11 of the large document circulated for consideration when the Committee stage began. It deals with the opening up of the Bill to allow prior documents-documents brought into existence before the Act commences-to become available to applicants under the Act. We say that recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in this regard ought to be brought into the Bill. Quite a lot of evidence was brought forward from such organisations as the South Australian Council of Social Services, which particularly emphasised the fact that individuals ought to have access to personal files concerning them even though those files may have come into existence at a time before the commencement of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not entirely. Not only was this the submission by various community organisations but also, for example, even the Department of Social Security conceded the point that those seeking access to their personal records ought to be given such access if relevant documents were held by the Department. It is on that basis that the Opposition prepared amendments that would phase in the ability of people to get access to prior documents as the methods of operation of the departments becomes more streamlined. In other words, when we have experience with the Act's operation, and the improved record keeping and retrieval systems, as well as the administration of the Act, get under way, we believe more and more documents from the past ought to become available to persons making applications under the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For that reason the Opposition is not entirely satisfied, as Senator Hamer appears to be, with the amendment to be moved by the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General concedes that personal records not more than five years old ought to become available, though admittedly regulations may be made which are even more beneficial and make a greater concession. The point is that in the Bill itself and in the amendments circulated by the Attorney-General the only concession is that personal records not more than five years old will become available. The Opposition says that personal records-that is, documents containing information relating to the personal affairs of any person-ought always to be available, whatever the point at which they came into existence. Of course, in that respect we maintain our support for amendment No. (15). </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Opposition maintains that if a request is made before 12 months after the date of commencement of the Act then the person making the request ought to be able to obtain access to a document if it came into existence after the date of commencement of the Act. We also say that documents brought into existence up to five years prior to the commencement of the Act ought to be available at the expiration of 12 months after the date of commencement. We recognise that it may take some 12 months to get the retrieval systems, the administration of the Act and the improved record-keeping documents into such order as would enable the Senate Committee's desire that documents up to five years old ought to be made available a reality. For those reasons I move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 9, clause 11, sub-clause (2), lines 1 to 6, leave out sub-clause (2), substitute the following sub-clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> '(2) Subject to sub-section (3) where a request is made by a person for access to a document under this Part-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) if the request is made before the expiration of 12 months after the date of commencement of this Part-he is not entitled to obtain access to the document under this Part unless the document became a document of an agency or an official document of a Minister on or after the date of commencement of this Part; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if the request is made on or after the expiration of 12 months after the date of commencement of this Part-he is not entitled to obtain access to the document under this Part unless the document became a document of an agency or an official document of a Minister at a date within 5 years before the date of commencement of this Part. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Notwithstanding anything in sub-section (2), a person is entitled to obtain access to a document, or to a part of a document under this Part-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) if the document or part of the document, contains information relating to the personal affairs of that person; or</PARA>

We both want to leave out the sub-clause and substitute an alternative clause. The amendment which I have circulated provides for access to documents containing information relating to the personal affairs of a person if such documents came into existence not less than five years prior to the commencement of the Act. The Government's concern in relation to this whole question of prior documents relates purely to resource demands. I have spoken at length on this matter in this chamber and elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason we have limited application of the legislation to documents coming into existence after the commencement of the Act is that we are very concerned about the extent of the demands that may be made on resources of departments. That is why we had provided sub-clause (2) in its present form. However, it has undoubtedly been the practice of many departments to permit access to records. The Government certainly does not want to restrict in any way the access that has been granted. On consideration, we are prepared to concede for a start access to personal records going back for a period of five years. We may well find that our concerns are not justified. After we have had the experience of the legislation being in force for 12 months we will look, not only at prior documents concerning personal records or documents coming into existence within five years but also at the whole question of access to prior documents, to see whether it may be justified to extend further access to prior documents. We will look at the extent and nature of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The failure of the Bill significantly to extend to prior documents was one of Senator Missen's famous seven deadly sins. Indeed, it was the second on his list of deadly sins constituting, as it were, the adultery to the murder of conclusive ministerial certificates, I suppose one might say. I have no doubt that Senator Puplick-or, far more to the point, Senator Tate-will correct my theology if I have the sequence wrong. I do not think Senator Puplick wants to talk to me at all at the moment. I think Senator Missen again put as succinctly as could possibly have been anticipated the argument for the phasing in of a document in a much more significant way than is now proposed by the Government when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With one minor exception, the FOI Bill will not apply to or give access to prior or current documents in Government hands but only to documents created after the Bill comes into operation. Thus the vast array of existing reports, correspondence and other records, compiled at the taxpayers' expense, will remain secret. The Bill makes no provision for the phasing in of existing records (many of them of current significance) over a period of years as proposed by the Senate Committee report. Compare again, the Canadian Bill which provides for a phasing in of existing records over a period of five years. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well said.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was brilliantly stated. It identified very pertinently the problems that exist in this respect. We were proposing that there be no limitation at all on access to personal documents and that, in respect of documents generally, there be an initial backwards period of five years, with a possible phasing in thereafter. The Attorney-General has met this proposal with one of his own which, as Senator Tate said in foreshadowing our argument, goes back five years in respect of personal documents and does not move back one minute so far as documents generally are concerned. The sort of concession that is involved in the proposal, is, to my mind, a non-event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The area of personal records is one where it was anticipated that the existing small exception in the Bill in its present form-clause 11 (2)-would largely apply anyway, of its own right. Clause 11 (2) states that access may be provided to a document if that access is reasonably necessary to enable the proper understanding of another document of an agency which is a contemporary document. Since the usual context in which personal records are sought is the context of getting access to one's personal file, which usually contains layers of insertions extending back over a period of years, with each document being subsequent to and conditional upon earlier ones in the file, it is likely that very commonly personal records, generally, will be accessable under the existing provision in clause 11 (2). The area of personal records was not the area in which it was contemplated that difficulties would really, in practice, arise. Of course, it was anticipated also that departments and agencies very often would be willing, because of the readily accessible character of personal files, to exercise their available discretion under the legislation and effect a release anyway even if it did not formerly come within one of these paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the claim that the five-year backwards extension in respect of personal documents represents a major or significant concession on the part of the Government, in our view-indeed, I think it was the view of Senator Missen when he put his name to the original amendment-simply does not stand up. We welcome, of course, the assurance of the Attorney that in this, as in other respects, where resource implications are an issue, we will have a look at it over the next 12 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a fundamental difficulty with this claim which will run through the debate today that resource considerations are conclusive so far as the Government is concerned at the moment, and that any provision in this legislation which has adverse resource implications that may require a relaxation of existing staff ceilings and may require the appointment of extra officials to perform functions is absolutely unacceptable. We have a problem with that kind of argument in two respects. Its ideological foundation is, as we have made clear in a number of other contexts, manifestly unacceptable. The Government is applying here, as elsewhere, the razor gang's small government mentality, ideology, without regard to the utility in the larger public interest of the functions that could be served by the extra public servants involved. The other reason for our concern is a much more specific one, that we simply do not believe that in practice these sorts of provisions that we are seeking to incorporate will have the large-certainly not disastrous-resource implications that the Attorney is claiming to be the case. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was very careful in drafting its report to anticipate this kind of argument, to get as much information as it conceivably could about the resource implications of the various changes that were being proposed. The propositions that we recommended in that report took very carefully into account what we, on the evidence, took to be reasonable resource constraint arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of claim that the Attorney has been disposed to come in here with, particularly when we last debated this matter, is that the Australian Taxation Office will have to spend something like 250 man years in the compilation of indexes and guidelines. Large claims have been thrown around since legislation of this kind was first mooted but have not had any substantial or detailed backing up in any hard empirical fashion. It is just so easy rhetorically to use language and figures of this kind to justify a position which, I suspect, is, in practice, not supported by the evidence but is based purely on ideological considerations. For all those reasons we believe the amendment moved by Senator Tate is an important amendment. It is one that goes to the heart of the practically effective functioning of this legislation and, accordingly, we again propose to divide on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is one of the very important areas in the Freedom of Information Bill. The progress which we have made in this area of extending the Bill to include some areas of existing documents I think is very significant indeed. The amendment which has been moved by Senator Tate was to have been moved by me originally. I am firmly in support of practically everything that has been said both by Senator Tate and Senator Evans concerning this amendment. It is my belief-the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs came to this conclusion in its report, having heard all the witnesses from the various departments-that there is unlikely to be an excessive demand. On the other hand, the Government does not accept that proposition. It fears that there will be a considerable demand. It is interesting to realise that the provisions of the United States Bill applied immediately to all documents which were in existence in government records at that time. Although there was an extensive demand in later years, there was not any initial flood which caused a great deal of upset. It is true also-Senator Evans mentioned the document I incorporated in the speech I made in the second reading debate on the Bill and I stand by it-that what is contained in that document is soundly based. I drew attention in it to the Canadian proposals wherein there is a phasing-in arrangement for existing documents over a two-year and five-year period. When that Bill comes into operation, documents-not only in the personal affairs area, but also all existing documents-no more than two years old will be made available. After two years, documents up to five years old will come into the ken of the Bill which the Canadians are now in the process of passing. After five years, all documents will be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is highly desirable that we work as quickly as possible towards a situation in which the whole existing record of the Government comes within the terms of the Act. At the moment, when this Bill is passed, very few documents will be available under the Freedom of Information Act. One will have to wait for the Government to produce more documents before they become available to members of the public. Therefore, it is a considerable advance that the Government has now seen fit to agree to this amendment. Clearly, at the moment the Government will not go beyond that stage. The Senate Committee regarded the personal affairs of an individual as being of the most immediate importance and that this legislation should apply to them. People can be affected in their employment by documents which are in the Government's possession. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators ought to read in conjunction with this amendment, the amendment which has been circulated by the Attorney, which basically takes up the Committee's recommendations in regard to the correction of personal records. People who can get documents under the Freedom of Information Act will also be entitled to get them corrected if they are unsound, dishonest or accidentally mistaken and are sitting in government records. So this is a very important area and it is one which I have claimed at all stages to be one of the vital areas where progress needed to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Progress has been made. I will now vote for the Attorney's amendment instead of moving my original amendment which I would have preferred but which cannot be included in a Bill that will pass through this Parliament and become operative. As I want the Bill to be operative, I want to see this proposal that the Government has put forward come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Documents relating to personal affairs up to five years old will comprise the great bulk of records. Our Committee was given as an example the case of defence, honourable senators can imagine that there would be a lot of past documents of interest in that area. We were told that 85 per cent of documents relating to defence are under 10 years old. The five years mentioned in the Bill relates to documents in the possession of the agency. The document may well come into existence earlier than that but at least if the agency possesses it in the last five years, those are the documents that are most likely to cause trouble for people who seek to obtain jobs and pensions because there are inaccuracies in them. I regard that concession relating to a period up to five years at this stage as important. I hope it will be seen that the demand for these documents will not be great and that it will be possible for the Government to move from that position to a position covering all personal documents at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the Attorney's undertaking that this matter will be surveyed and reported to Parliament within 12 months or so. Of course, we will be watch its progress. If it turns out that the Government cannot show that there is any real enormous demand or any reason why it should not go further, members of this Senate can introduce private members Bills. I would certainly introduce one if I thought there was a need and if I felt at that time that reasons existed why I should go--</PARA>

I feel that we, in this Parliament, now have the matter in our hands and we will be able to see what the demand is. If the demand is there and the Government is not prepared to move on from that stage to further documents we can do something about that. I welcome the amendment which has been moved by the Government because it is a real step in the right direction in the most valuable area. I welcome the measure. I will watch to see that the Freedom of Information Bill is of practical operation for people. If the demand for information is not excessive then, of course, we will be able to go on quickly. The House will note that the amendment which the Government has put forward enables the Government to bring in by regulation the increase in the availability of the legislation. It will not have to come back to this Parliament by the cumbersome step of introducing a Bill and having it enacted, it can be done by regulation. This is one occasion when, I think, we can welcome the quickness of that step. We in the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I am prepared to hazard a guess, will not be recommending disallowance of any such moves. I support the amendment. It does not go as far as one would like but it is, indeed, an important step that I think is worth supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it ought to be emphasised that the five-year period was not exactly arbitrarily chosen. Senator Missen alluded to the fact that when one looks at the Public Service Board survey of all departments it is discovered that the greatest proportion of documents are aged five years or less. Therefore, they have been compiled in recent times and within a period during which the Public Service has been on notice that some such legislation as the Freedom of Information Bill would be introduced and passed by the Parliament. Interdepartmental committees have been working on this problem since 1974, with a major committee examination in 1976. The original Bill was introduced in 1978. It has been subject to a thorough investigation by a Senate committee and, of course, has been now presented to this chamber in the form of a new Bill. In relation to the great bulk of documents put into the record keeping apparatus of the Public Service, for at least five years the Public Service has been on notice that its retrieval systems, its administrative machinery and record keeping needed to be such that there would be no great administrative burden placed on the Public Service in giving access under the Bill to those who require it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I will not weary the Committee with the reasons for this amendment. They are to be found in paragraphs 8.21 and 8.22 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Contitutional and Legal Affairs. I understand that the Government has no problem in accepting the amendment. The second amendment relates to clause 16 (2), which currently reads:</PARA>
<PARA> An agency is not required to comply with sub-section (1) if compliance would interfere unreasonably with the operations of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA>It was originally intended to delete the words 'interfere unreasonably with' and substitute the words 'impose a substantial and unreasonable burden on'. However, the Attorney-General has circulated an amendment which would delete the words 'interfere unreasonably with the operations of the agency' and substitute the words 'substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other operations'. I believe that rewording is perfectly acceptable. Therefore, the position is in effect that amendment No. (17) which was originally circulated by some honourable senators and which is an amendment to clause 16 (1) (a) and the amendment circulated by the Attorney-General to clause 16 (2) are acceptable to all honourable senators concerned and to the Attorney-General. Therefore, I formally move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is reasonably happy to accept the form of words which the Attorney-General has brought forward and which was described by Senator Puplick in his original contribution. The words 'substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other operations', which is the proposed new language, are arguably weaker in some respects than the proposition originally proposed by us, which used the language 'impose a substantial and unreasonable burden upon', in the sense that it is no doubt easier to establish that something amounts to a diversion of resources than that something amounts to a burden on the operations of an agency. But as in both cases the key words 'substantially and unreasonably' are retained and as in practice I suspect that they are likely to be the governing words in any consideration of this by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or by anyone else, the Opposition is prepared to leave aside its lingering concern that this might not be good enough and in the interests of comity, harmony and dispatch to endorse the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The point of these two amendments is to deal with the question of the time limit within which responses have to be made by agencies to formal requests for access to documents. The time limit provided in the Bill is 60 days. I understand that the Government does not propose to resile from that proposition. The joint amendments standing in my name provide for a reduction, in accordance again with the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in that period of 60 days back to 45 days, in the first instance, with a provision for phasing in further reductions thereafter. Perhaps the force of the amendment and the reasons for it are best explained, as it is an important one, by my reading as briskly as I can the relevant paragraph 8.42 contained in the Senate Standing Committee's report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The unfamiliarity of the freedom of information concept in this country and the administrative pressures-particularly in the present economic and financial climate-that will undoubtedly be associated with its introduction, lead us, however, to be somewhat cautious in our recommendations in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that we were more cautious than many witnesses and persons making submissions to the Committee wanted us to be. This was one of the liveliest areas of public criticism of the original 1978 Bill with many persons making the point that 60 days was, on the face of it, an enormously long time. It would give credence and scope for all those bureaucratic tendencies of inertia and lethargy which perhaps come to play in situations like this that it was to be contrasted in particular with the 10 day provision which applied in the United States. Few of our submitters made the point or acknowledged the point that in the United States the 10 day provision in fact is 10 working days which of course spreads out the period a little bit longer. Nor did many people appreciate the point which also became clear on the evidence we received, that extensions of that 10 working day period were in fact very common in the United States particularly in the area of Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation records in respect of which there had been an absolute avalanche of requests over the last few years since the American Freedom of Information Act was enacted. It remained the case, which the Committee acknowledged, that except in certain vexed areas like that, the United States agencies were, by and large, able to come to grips with producing responses in a much shorter period than was envisaged in the Australian Bill. For that reason there was scope for reducing the period in question. A little later in that paragraph the Committee went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> While any figure that may be specified has of necessity a somewhat arbitrary character, we have determined, after full consideration of all the evidence supplied to us on this issue-particularly from the agencies themselves-that the sixty-day time limit should be reduced to forty-five days two years after the legislation has come into operation, and to thirty days after four years. Further reductions, which we would certainly like to believe are possible, should depend on reviews of the legislation as it is then operating. We believe that the initial two-step phased reduction down to thirty days should be specifically incorporated into the text of the Bill. It may be that circumstances will emerge that make the attainment of even these limited reductions quite impossible. In order to allow for this contingency, but to ensure Parliamentary debate of the question while at the same time avoiding the necessity for formal legislative amendment, we propose that any such waiver of the reduction clause should require approval in the Parliament by affirmative resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>That states pretty succinctly the reasons for the approach now taken by the Opposition in moving the amendment. The amendments before the chamber embody technical language for that particular policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to the amendments moved by Senator Evans. A major point of debate on this legislation has concerned the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to which the Government has responded. In the Government's response it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government accepts in principle that the time limit should, so far as practicable be progressively reduced as experience is gained in the operation of the legislation, but believes it cannot responsibly commit itself to the rigid timetable proposed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The extent to which it will be practicable to reduce the time limit will be assessed when a full review is made of the working of the legislation. The Government has already indicated that it considers it would be appropriate for that full review to take place after the legislation has been in operation for three years. These are maximum limits. That does not mean to say that with experience gained-and, indeed, in many individual cases-there will not be an ability to give access within a much shorter time than the limits provide. Indeed, as the Government has said, it accepts the principle that the limits should be reduced. There will be a constant interest in this matter and pressure will be brought to bear on agencies to try to promptly answer requests. </PARA>
<PARA> Although many members of the public and witnesses appearing before the Senate Committee might want shorter periods, many of them do not really understand the difficulties faced in answering these requests. Everybody who makes a request always belives that his or her request is the most important matter that the agency or the civil servant should be attending to. The fact is that many other matters have to be attended to. It is a matter of priority of resources. I am afraid that this is another area where the Government is very concerned about the resource question. Therefore, although we accept the spirit of this amendment we are not prepared to agree to the rigid timetables that are laid down by it. Of course, as I have already undertaken, we will reconsider the matter when the Act has been in operation for three years. </PARA>

In any event, I say simply that the force of the amendment is to ensure that an applicant is not required to pay a fee which is greater than that which would have been payable if access had been granted in the form originally requested by him. The sort of amendment here provided for does put a brake upon the power of agencies to grant access in a different form and recognises that the circumstances in which the form of access is varied are beyond the control of applicants. It is picking up the recommendations and discussions spelt out in more detail in paragraph 10.5 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and in recommendation 22 (c) of that report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Attorney. I will develop the Australian Democrats' reasons for the amendment. This amendment is part of what those of us who looked at this matter would see as corrective surgery on the Freedom of Information Bill. It has the merit of making the whole area more simple and straightforward, at the same time ensuring a reasonable safeguard against excessive demands on the agency or Minister. If carried, this amendment would provide a more easily understood situation at the point of implementation. That is its merit. The point of this part of the legislation is to see that where exempt material and non-exempt material occur in the same document, the whole document should not be denied to the applicant. In other words, it should be possible for the exempt material to be deleted and non-exempt information then to be passed on to the applicant. The amendment is motivated by some words on page 133 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The key to effective operation of this clause is the sensitive application of the phrase 'where practicable'. We can only hope that agencies will apply this liberally, flexibly, and in accordance with the general spirit of the Bill, and take considerable pains to ensure-even if this involves such steps as the masking out of individual paragraphs or even sentences on a page-that the maximum possible material is disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>In the use of freedom of information legislation in other countries that sort of procedure is obviously important, especially where there is such complexity of exempt material as is the case in the Bill as we see it now and, I have no doubt, as we will see it when we have finished with it. I can only share the hope that the agencies would apply the phrase 'where practicable' liberally and flexibly. Would the amendment assist this process? We believe it would by removing a top hamper of verbiage and qualification which is at present in the Bill. Existing sub-clause (1) (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA>it is possible for the agency or Minister to make a copy of the document with such deletions that the copy would not be an exempt document and would not, by reason of the deletions, be misleading;</PARA>
<PARA>We believe this provision makes it only too easy for a public servant to decide not to make any material available and still live with his conscience. I believe a quite irrelevant issue as to whether a document would be misleading has been introduced. I feel it axiomatic that any applicant for the material would understand that its meaning would undoubtedly change as a result of any deletions that are made-this would seem to me to be square one stuff-and would reasonably take this in to account. The applicant could hardly reasonably claim to have been misled about the nature of the whole document by virtue of his understanding of the residue of it. Could any substantial sections of any document be removed without that justifying the claim that in some respects or other it was misleading? There again, I think that we can see a trap for the implementation of the Bill. This is a problem which at the stage of implementation could cause trouble. The word itself is liable, I think, to quite subjective interpretation. Sub-clause (1) (c) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>it is reasonably practicable for the agency or Minister, having regard to the nature and extent of the work involved in deciding on and making those deletions and the resources available for that work, to make such a copy. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that this has internal evidence of bureaucratic nervousness on the part of the draftsman. Something is either practicable or it is not. The word 'reasonably' adds nothing to the meaning. The nature and extent of the work and their relationship to the resources available also make me somewhat uneasy. It seems that some very important information might be required in that area which, for some quite temporary reason, perhaps due to staff sickness in an agency, might be refused on the ground of what is contained in that sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Bill is stuffed with excuses for people not to do what the Bill is expected to do; that is, to make the fullest possible disclosure of information practicable. So the only issue of importance here ought to be practicability. Since this area will certainly concern a large number of important documents practicability should be the only yardstick used. Even then, as the Committee has noted in its report, good faith on the part of the agency will be required. I think that those arguments do justify the amendment which we are persisting with. I commend it to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise that this is not an amendment which the Government is prepared to accept, but I would urge the Government to look at it further and to give thought to it before the Freedom of Information Bill is dealt with in the other chamber. I believe there is a great deal of force in what has been said, particularly concerning the reference in this clause to a document which may, by reason of deletions, be misleading. Public servants may well take the view that a document, because of deletions, could be misleading. That does not seem to me to matter too much provided the applicants are warned that it might be misleading. This is a problem which has arisen not only in this country but also in Canada. Canada has the same problems regarding legisaltion which is presently being considered in a committee. I wish to read a small section of a submission which was made by the Canadian Bar Association to the committee which is presently looking at the Canadian legislation, namely, the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. About clause 20 of the Bill, the Association stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to Clause 20 (2), which deals with product or environmental testing, we are concerned with the possible impact of this provision. In brief, the provision as presently written allows the head of an institution to refuse disclosure of tests if he reasonably believes that the results are misleading.</PARA>
<PARA>So honourable senators can see that the same problem is arising in Canada. The Association went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A nervous bureaucrat could take the view that almost any test result would be misleading unless 'placed in context' or released with an explanation of its limitations. Rather than foreclose the release of the document at all, a preferable approach would be to allow the head of a government institution to include with the disclosed document a form of disclaimer, an explanatory memorandum as to the inadequacies or perceived deficiencies of the test or other similar material. We believe that members of the public should be able to assess for themselves the value of the data in these tests. The fact that the head of an institution believes that the results might be misleading should not be determinative of the right of access under the Access to Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that there are differences between our situation and the area covered in that quotation, but the same argument arises. I think it is unfortunate that, because some public servant thinks that the resulting document as deleted will be misleading, it may be misused by people. The same point has been made in other submissions made in Canada and may well lead to alterations to the Canadian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause was not included in the 1978 Bill. Since it was inserted I have taken and represented the view that its inclusion in its present form is unfortunate. I think this is one of the provisions which will be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but, once again, one does not want to become involved in an appeal on a subject when the matter perhaps could be handled in the first place by the Parliament. Therefore, at this stage, I urge the Attorney to give further thought to this clause to see whether this possibility can be avoided, so that we do not leave this word in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this amendment. It does so for resource reasons. Similar provisions in the United States freedom of information legislation have been construed as requiring a line by line examination of documents. This, of course, involves a very heavy demand on agency resources, particularly in this case, the more senior and experienced personnel. At this stage the Government is not prepared to agree to the amendment. However, it is another of those amendments in relation to which, with the benefit of experience, we may be able to do something along the lines suggested in a review of the legislation in three years' time. I think the point made by Senator Missen-that is, that any decisions of an agency under this legislation will be appealable-is a very important one. There is that brake on agencies. If anyone were minded to abuse the disclosure provision, such action will be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to take up one point that the Attorney-General has raised. I refer to the question of resources, which I think tends to become something of a red herring where this Bill is concerned. I think it has been assumed that the same demands will be made on freedom of information legislation in this country as are made in, say, the United States. The Australian Democrats cannot believe that that will be so. The United States has extremely well-funded foundations and enormously well-funded universities and so on which go in for research and require documents in an enormous way. I cannot believe that similar organisations in Australia will have the resources to make massive demands on agencies and departments for this sort of material. I think a reasonable view of that matter might recolour the Government's attitude to many things. The Minister stated a very respectable point of view when he said that maybe these things will emerge from experience. I welcome his assurance that, if the experience is more like what I expect it to be than what he feels it will be, we might be able to look at this matter in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be moving that amendment if the opportunity arises for me to do so. It is really conditional upon the passage of our amendments with respect to conclusive ministerial certificates which we will come to when we deal shortly with clause 28 and subsequent clauses. The amendments will now be picked up by the Australian Labor Party following the retreat on these matters of other honourable senators whose names were on the document. If our amendments in respect of those conclusive certificates are adopted, at least as far as clause 28 is concerned, it will be appropriate to come back and move the amendment concerning the proposed new clause 26A. I will be seeking leave of the Committee to do so later in the happy event that the amendment to clause 28 is adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Might I just indicate, in the unhappy event that our proposal about clause 28 is not adopted, what this proposed new clause 26A is all about. Briefly, it is to establish a reverse freedom of information procedure in respect of State documents; that is, documents involved in communications between the Commonwealth and the States. Reverse freedom of information is an American concept which has been taken over in the Freedom of Information Bill in the context of business documents. We propose that it be extended to the area of Commonwealth-State relations. In essence it involves an opportunity for someone whose document is called for by freedom of information procedures to put on record his objection or hostility to the document this called for being released. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of business houses it is an obvious opportunity for business that believe that questions of commercial confidentiality or other sensitive matters are in issue to have an input before their documents are in fact released out of the Government's hands wherein they lie to an external inquirer. The concept here was that the States equally should have an opportunity to indicate why their documents should not be released in the event that they are called for under freedom of information procedures and the decision to release them is in fact made. It is a necessary trade-off, one might say, to give the States this sort of right if in fact they are to be denied the protection of conclusive ministerial certificates in respect of their documents. If they are to be granted the protection of conclusive certificates in respect of their documents, it becomes of less importance that their sensitivities be further nurtured by a provision of this kind. So that is what this clause is about and why it is conditional on the passage of our amendments to clause 28. Accordingly I give notice to the Committee that, notwithstanding Senator Hamer's retreat from the lists on this matter, other honourable senators will be all too happy to pick up the banner for him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of Senator Evans's remarks I had better clarify a couple of points. The reason that this amendment has not been moved is as stated by Senator Evans. If clause 28 is passed in the form in which I am fairly certain it will be passed, this clause will be unnecessary. This provides reverse freedom of information rights to the States. If clause 28 is modified as originally foreshadowed-I am satisfied that that will not now happen-the States' rights will be more than adequately protected by this clause in the form in which I think this chamber will pass it today. So the reverse FOI provisions proposed to be included in new clause 26A will not be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter crops up a little later. I cannot go along with Senator Hamer's view that the proposal which will be debated in clause 28 will adequately cover the situation. I hope that it will work reasonably well. As I understand clause 28, the Documents Review Tribunal will look at and deal with State documents also. I hope that that provision will be effective. Of course one would like to think that the Tribunal would consider the public interest as well as confidential State documents. I think there are some problems in that provision and one will have to wait to see whether it will work effectively. I would have thought that the reverse freedom of information arrangement would be a better arrangement and would provide adequately for States who want security when they send documents to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was taking evidence from one State, that State threatened that it would mark everything 'in confidence' if amendments were not made to this Bill. I think the Attorney may hold the view-he may well be right-that the States would have to do more than that. They would actually have to show that they were confidential documents. Probably that question can be looked at by the Tribunal and that may be some protection. I accept the more limited view put forward by the Government that it will have something less than a full appeal in the area where conclusive certificates arise. I understand that the Document Review Tribunal's findings will be made public and sent to the parties. Its findings will be made known. A Minister who goes away from that and decides to withhold a document will have to face public and parliamentary criticism on this subject. Therefore, in practice, whilst I think that the proposals that the Government makes-I will refer to them at this stage and not later-will probably work pretty well, we will have to exercise very careful scrutiny in the next few years to ensure that the Tribunal does work effectively and it does not withhold many documents because it is complacent. Whilst saying that I think that this clause will probably work quite well in practice, I reserve my right to see what happens in the future. </PARA>

As clause 28 stands now and as I take it that it will be passed by this chamber, the position of the States is so adequately protected, in my view more than adequately protected, by the clause's provisions that there is no need for any reverse freedom of information provision. There is no conceivable reason why the States would want a reverse FOI provision. Every interest of theirs is protected by the wording of clause 28. Therefore, this clause in those circumstances is redundant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence. I have given the Attorney's adviser the amendment which I had intended should be moved to the Government's amendment to clause 20. The effect of the Government's amendment is to place in the Minister a power to defer access to a document which should otherwise be available. In other words, we are not dealing with documents which in any way are in an exempt category. The Opposition is prepared to agree that if the publication of the document concerned is required by law, the document should not be made available until expiration of the period within which the document is required to be published. If the document has been prepared for presentation to Parliament, we agree that it should be presented within a reasonable time and thereafter be available to a person seeking that document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also agree with proposed new sub-clause 1 (c). The Opposition has great difficulty in agreeing to a power being vested in a Minister to defer access to a document, when the Minister considers that the document concerned is of such general public interest that the Parliament should be informed of the contents of the document before the document is otherwise made public, until the expiration of five sitting days of either House of Parliament. In other words, we have here a most remarkable provision. It seems to me that when the Government is concerned that a document may contain matters which, for example, could cause grave public scandal-a scandal in the administration of government might be revealed in that document or some new light might be shed on a decision taken by the Government-this provision will enable the Minister to defer the release of that document until the Government has had a chance to shore up its defences so that it can come into Parliament and try to mount whatever defence might be required to meet the allegations of scandal or bad decision making as revealed in the documentation. It seems to me that this is a case in which a document, if it does become available under the freedom of information legislation, ought to be immediately available. </PARA>
<PARA> One is also concerned with the fact that five sitting days have to elapse before the document is made available to the person seeking it and who otherwise has a right to it. It means that if there is a long winter recess a document which otherwise would be available in the second week of June would not be available until the third week of August. That seems to be an intolerable length of time to have to wait for a document which, I emphasise, is not an exempt document. We need an answer from the Attorney as to what documents he had in mind when he drafted this provision. If it is merely a means by which the Government can gain time to shore up its defences so that it can give a parliamentary response to the revelation of some scandal or some decision making which is not in accordance with the best advice which is revealed in the documentation, the Opposition certainly persists in its attempt to delete this proposed new sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA> We link with that the need to delete sub-clause (4) because the further defect in new clause 20 as circulated by the Attorney is that in the very instance where one wishes to make an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that appeal right is expressly taken away. Whilst the new amendment as circulated by the Attorney appears to put in a criterion that the Minister has to advert to he has to consider that the document is of such general public interest that it should not be revealed until there has been a chance to present it to the Parliament first-that criterion really is meaningless. There is no way in which it can be tested. There is no appeal right to the AAT. In sub-clause (4) it is expressly stated that sub-section 45 (1) does not apply in relation to a deferment under sub-section 1 (d). In this situation the Minister is given the power to cover up, for as long as it takes to shore up his defences, the possible revelation of a scandal of some type in the administration of government. For that reason the Opposition persists with its attempt to delete proposed new sub-clause 1 (d) and subsequently sub-clause (4) and I therefore move as an amendment to Senator Durack's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand the position, the amendments that were to be moved in relation to this matter by Senator Bonner have not been moved. Senator Tate is prepared to support my alternative to Senator Bonner's amendments provided that I delete from it sub-clause 1 (d). My amendment deals with requests for access to documents to which the Minister, on certain grounds, wishes to defer access. Various situations are provided for in my proposal. I propose also that when a Minister considers that a document is of such general public interest that the Parliament should be informed of its contents before it is otherwise made public, he may defer access to it until the expiration of five sitting days of either House of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Minister cannot defer access to a document on some pretext and get away with it. He is, after five sitting days, obliged to table it or give access to it. This provision is not designed to enable a Minister to cover up some scandal, as Senator Tate suggested. If he were minded to do that he would, in the end, have to table the document or give access to it. The object of this provision is to cover the situation when a Minister is minded to table a document in Parliament and believes that it ought to be made public in that way. It is in deference to the status and role of parliament. The Minister has to make a judgment whether a document is of such general public interest that that ought to be the case. The Government does not believe that decisions of that sort should be made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Questions of public interest are to be determined in the end by Ministers. If an applicant for a document is confronted with a deferment by a Minister on grounds of this kind, the Minister is still publicly accountable for the decision he makes and will have to defend it. I am not prepared to delete the clauses which Senator Tate has requested me to delete. I will persist with the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>Those amendments were originally circulated in the names of Senators Hamer and Puplick, but again there seems to have been some resiling as a result of the events of the last few days and weeks.

Amendment No. (32) in respect of clause 28 in essence is to separate out the national security questions from those related to Commonwealth-State questions and to delete the provisions relating to the Minister having a conclusive right to deny access to such national security matters. Amendment No. (33) proposes a new clause 28A which is a specific provision in its own right with respect to Federal-State relations, again shorn of any conclusive discretion vested in the Minister to deny access to such documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Hamer said 'adding a public interest criterion'. Indeed, Senator Hamer remembers the terms of his own amendment quite remarkably well which is only as it should be because clearly he believes in its force, as I do. Amendment No. (34) deals with clause 29 in relation to Cabinet documents. Here the power of automatic discretion to make conclusive the denial of access is withdrawn. Clause 30 is the subject matter of our amendment No. (35) which is exactly the same kind of amendment, this time in respect of Executive Council documents which are the counterpart of Cabinet documents. Amendment No. (36) proposes the addition of a number of categories of exception from the basic rules so far as Cabinet and Executive Council documents are concerned in respect of matters going to the proper definition of Cabinet and Executive Council records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular amendments proposed in relation to clause 48 are amendments Nos (55) to (60). Amendment No. (55) removes the reference in clause 48 (1) to the Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate under clause 42. That is consequential upon a proposed deletion of that earlier clause. Amendment No. (56) removes the restriction on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's capacity to review internal working documents from a public interest point of view. In other words, it is proposed by this amendment that the Tribunal have the power to determine whether a denial of access to internal working documents is against the public interest. Amendments Nos (57), (58) and (59) all delete various procedural provisions inhibiting the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to deal with documents, the subject matter of those earlier clauses, that is, documents of an internal working document character, of a defence or security character, of an international affairs character, of a Commonwealth-State character or of a Cabinet and Executive Council character. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new clause 48A, which is amendment No. (60), proposes the setting out of the criteria by reference to which it is proposed that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have the jurisdiction to review documents in these sensitive areas that we are here talking about. That formally puts on record the series of amendments that we propose. All those amendments are consistent with the general recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that there be no absolute discretion vested in Ministers to deny access to any class of documents however sensitive, on the face of it, those documents might be. Of course we acknowledge that the particular classes of documents that are here in issue-defence and security documents, Commonwealth-State documents and Cabinet and Executive Council documents at least-are necessarily of a distinctive kind and a peculiarly sensitive kind. It is for that reason that we propose that the review procedure by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal not necessarily follow exactly the same path as is proposed in respect of other functions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In other words, we are proposing that the Tribunal have jurisdiction only to determine whether the documents in these various sensitive categories were in fact properly so classified. That is at least so as far as Cabinet and Executive Council documents are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned to ensure that documents which are not really in themselves necessarily highly confidential, which do not in themselves necessarily have the kind of character which would inhibit the highest levels of decision-making being exposed to goldfish bowl scrutiny-documents which are not really Cabinet or Executive Council documents in that sense-can in fact be identified on appeal to the Tribunal to ensure that there is no excessive secrecy or denial of access in respect of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in respect of defence, security and international relations documents, we were concerned to ensure that it would not be simply good enough for the Executive officials or the Minister to plant a secrecy stamp on documents, claiming that they are confidential, secret or top secret and, by that means alone, ensure that they are not possibly able to be scrutinised by anyone seeking access to them. We were concerned to ensure, if secrecy was to be claimed in this way, that that secrecy was properly claimed. In other words, we wanted to ensure that the documents in question were properly classified. The purpose of these amendments in this context is to give the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a limited jurisdiction to determine whether the secrecy claimed in respect of those documents was properly claimed in the sense that a document was properly classified. That, in turn, raises the question of whether the Tribunal is satisfied in all the circumstances that the nature of the document is such as to prejudice Australia's security. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as to Commonwealth-State documents in respect of which a very large and all-encompassing category of exemption is claimed by the existing Bill, it is our proposal that that be very much narrowed. Part of the combination of amendments we are now talking about provides that it should no longer be possible for State Premiers or any other State officials simply to claim that the document in question was forwarded to the Commonwealth in confidence and, for that reason alone, be able to claim-as is possible as the Bill now stands-exemption from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. It was our further concern so far as Commonwealth-State documents are concerned to ensure, as Senator Hamer reminded me earlier, that a separate public interest criterion is taken into account and applied with respect to those documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in respect of the remaining category of sensitive documents-internal working documents, which is a potentially huge and catch-all category-it was our concern to ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had the option and the capacity to determine whether the claim for denial of access to these sorts of documents was, in fact, well made out in the public interest. The force of these amendments was again to ensure that the Tribunal would have the power to apply that sort of criterion. Because at least some of the classes of these documents are obviously very sensitive and because some of them do involve the security of the nation and the secrets of the Cabinet room-both of which considerations the Opposition and certainly the Committee were well-appreciative-we acknowledged the necessity to build into these review proceedings additional safeguards to ensure that confidentiality of the whole process of review was, in fact, preserved. Thus in the case of documents related to defence, security and international affairs and in the case of Cabinet and Executive Council documents, our amendments propose that special procedures are applicable in the case of these classes of documents such that the decision can be made only by a judicial member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and such that the confidentiality of the documents can be guaranteed while that judicial member of the Tribunal is making the determination as to whether access should be refused or denied. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting all that together, which is a necessarily complex business that I am trying desperately to summarise in a short space of time, the net result of our amendments is that for a series of four classes of documents-defence and national security documents, Commonwealth and State documents, Cabinet and Executive Council documents, and internal working documents-we want to remove the conclusive discretion to deny access to those kinds of documents which is vested in the Minister as the Bill now stands and to give the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a power to review the claims made. We want special provisions built into the review procedures for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to ensure that in the case of especially sensitive classes of those documents-notably the Cabinet ones, the Executive Council ones and the national security ones-it is a judicial member who makes the decision and the confidentiality of the process is preserved while the decision is in the process of being made. </PARA>
<PARA> In a nutshell, so far as I can manage it, that is a description of what this very complex sequence of amendments is all about and what it seeks to achieve. The amendments embody the substance of a very substantial chunk of chapters 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the Senate Standing Committee's report. Obviously they are amendments which go to an absolutely central and fundamental area of this whole question of freedom of information. So long as ministerial discretion in any form is retained absolutely and conclusively to deny access to these documents without being subject to second guessing or review by anyone else, it is our view-up until now it has been the view certainly of Senators Hamer, Puplick and Missen and all the others on that side who have expressed an interest in this matter-that freedom of information legislation is simply not worth having unless we can ensure that documents of this kind come within its ambit, too. Many more arguments need to be addressed to particular points which will no doubt arise when the Attorney explains his own proposal. For the moment, perhaps that sufficiently describes what the Opposition amendments are all about. </PARA>

Amendments Nos (32) and (33) separated out Federal-State relations from the other areas that were originally in clause 32-security, defence and international relations. I must say-although I accept this-that I do not think the arrangements for consideration of documents covering Federal-State relations are yet perfect. In my view far too much exemption is given to those documents. In clause 28, as it now is, documents concerning Federal-State relations are exempt if they could reasonably be expected to cause damage to Federal-State relations or would divulge any information or matter communicating confidence by a State or the Northern Territory. There is no public interest criterion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must make it clear to the Committee that I would have preferred the Federal-State relations arrangements to be separated out in the form my amendments originally showed. However, it is apparent that this is an area of great political difficulty and sensitivity for the Government and for the State governments, as I am sure all honourable senators are aware. In the interests of getting a workable and effective Freedom of Information Bill through the Senate, I am prepared to waive my desire to have Federal-State relations treated in what in my view would be a more appropriate way. I think it should be put on record that I do not think this proposal is the ideal arrangement and I hope it will be reviewed and put in the form which is now proposed when the review of this legislation is made after three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not pretend. We do operate and we do take attitudes. We have taken attitudes in regard to this Bill which are significantly important in the securing of the type of Bill which we are getting. That is a much better Bill than the one which we might have had before. It is all right for Senator Evans to go on with his holy attitude towards these things. He can talk down his colleagues and say: 'No, this is what our view is', because he is the Opposition spokesman. I am afraid that on this side of the chamber we do make our own judgments. It is part of our philosophy. My judgment is that we want a reasonably good Bill. My judgment is that we do not press for what would not necessarily have been the ideal method of appeal because the attitude which the Senate Committee took on these matters, as Senator Evans well recollects, is something which, if we were in Canada today, would be rather conservative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Canadian Government position is very much like the position recommended by the Senate Committee. The Canadian opposition parties want a de novo appeal. They want a complete appeal on these matters and a substitution for the Minister's decision. We know that the Government in Australia is not prepared to agree to that decision being taken out of the hands of Ministers. There is a need for an evolutionary process to be adopted in these things. A couple of years ago the Canadian Liberal Government was most vehemently opposed to appeals of the nature which are now contained in their Bills. A process of education and experience in what is happening-fortunately in Canada the prompting of some of the provincial governments, such as Ontario, where they are even more prepared to deal with appeals and have Ministers' decisions overturned, if necessary, on appeal-has pressed the Canadian parties to move forward. We have not moved that far here. We will watch the proposals which are made and see whether in a practical sense they achieve these aims. I would hope that we would move in due course to the position which the Senate Committee put forward and which has been explained by Senator Evans. I hope the day will arrive when we can get through the Parliament such legislation as that. I am not apologising to Senator Evans or anybody. I am trying to achieve what is possible in this way and not grandstand about the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to the amendments moved by Senator Evans. They cover the area of what has been known as conclusive certificates. I have made the Government's view on this known on so many occasions both in this chamber and outside of it and I do not propose to go over the ground again. I do, however, intend to move the amendments which appear on the printed sheet. The amendments provide for the establishment of a Document Review Tribunal which can look at documents of this character and decide whether, in its opinion, the Minister had reasonable grounds for giving his certificate. However, the decision of that Tribunal would be one of recommendation only and not binding on the Minister. The Minister's ultimate power to decide and his ultimate responsibility to this Parliament to justify his decision would be preserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the vital stance which the Government has always taken in relation to this class of documents. I am sure that that will be a view that the Government will adhere to. I do not want to have any misunderstandings as to whether this might be something that the Government will be looking at again. This is a very firm policy of the Government. The Document Review Tribunal is to be drawn from former judges of the Federal Court of Australia or supreme courts of the States. They will be judges, of course. Probably there will be only three or a small number, in any case. We hope that some of the most prestigious judges in our community will be prepared to serve on this Tribunal. The Tribunal will be called upon to make decisions, albeit only recommendations, about documents of the most sensitive kind and at the very heart of government-decisions which, as I have said, under our system of government have always been made by Ministers, who are responsible to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see any reason for the chiding by Senator Evans of Senator Missen, Senator Hamer and Senator Puplick, who, in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which they are members, and in the amendments which were circulated earlier in this debate, had supported a wider form of review whereby a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, albeit a judge, would be able to make decisions that would be binding upon Ministers. I believe this Bill should be the subject of deep consideration by members of this chamber and, no doubt, of another place. I have said all along that I believe there is always a way of overcoming controversies in which there are strongly held opinions on both sides and that these things can be achieved by compromise. I do not believe compromise means one side giving in. Both sides have to give something. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the support that is being given to my proposals by Senator Missen, Senator Puplick and Senator Hamer is being given in the spirit of compromise. I do not expect them to say that they have changed their minds. That would be ridiculous. They have made their views very clear. They have made their decision in a spirit of compromise. I commend them for it. I do not think they ought to be chided for it. There has been a spirit of compromise on both sides of the chamber in this debate. I think that is a valuable part of the process in which we are presently engaged. There ought to be more of it. When Senator Evans's amendments are disposed of I will seek leave to move my own amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It scarcely needs to be stated that the Opposition is not happy to accept, by way of compromise or anything else, the proposals that the Attorney-General has now specifically foreshadowed for the creation of a Document Review Tribunal. We will be pursuing our amendments to the point of a division in a few moments. I just make that position absolutely clear. We take this attitude not because we refuse to acknowledge that there is any element of give in the position that the Attorney-General has now espoused. I readily acknowledge, and I imagine that the Opposition will readily join with me in acknowledging, that the proposal for a Document Review Tribunal, an independent tribunal, to make a determination as to whether the documents in issue reasonably satisfy the descriptions in clauses 28 to 31 and to give publicity to that determination is a substantial advance on a situation in which the Minister in question, in the privacy of his own room, can put a forbidden stamp on a particular document and there end the matter. Of course, the reality will be that if the matter goes to the Document Review Tribunal and in a particular case, by reference to the criteria that are proposed for it in the course of these lengthy amendments that the Attorney has foreshadowed, that Tribunal makes a determination that reasonable grounds do not exist for the denial of access and that decision is made public, it will place considerable political pressure on the Minister of the day not to persist in his denial of access to the documents. We acknowledge that and, to that extent, we have moved a distance down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that what seems to be basically involved in the principle of the Document Review Tribunal is the notion that is familiar in our law at the moment so far as deportation matters are concerned under the Migration Act. Indeed, I have an awful feeling that this 'compromise' that has emerged from the Attorney-General owes something to a suggestion that I offered to him some months ago that in extremis the deportation model might be one that could be at least an advance on the intransigence of absolute ministerial conclusivity.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator Missen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, that's where it came from.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a horrible feeling, Senator, that that might be so. The system adopted in the context of deportation is that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal can make a determination under the Migration Act that a deportation order is not reasonable in all the circumstances and that determination goes as a recommendation to the Minister which the Minister can choose to accept or refuse as the case may be. That model in the deportation area has resulted in, I think, some 10 or 12 decisions being made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the deportation area which have gone against the original ministerial determination. In all those 10 or 12 cases so far, I think it is the case that the Minister has accepted the determination of the Tribunal, no doubt, because the Minister in those sorts of situations realises the political difficulties he is in if he goes against-or appears to go against in the public eye-a decision of an independent, judicial or quasi-judicial body as this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that some of the same dynamics apply in this area. However, I fear that because of the much greater likely political sensitivity of the character of the documents in issue here, it may be that Ministers will be a little more robust than Ministers for immigration have been in actually refusing to follow AAT decisions. That is the basic point. </PARA>
<PARA> A series of quick, more specific points that we wish to put on record about the Document Review Tribunal proposals are these: Firstly, the basic problem is, and always will be, that a ministerial discretion ultimately remains. However one twists and turns, however one qualifies it, however much one acknowledges it-in the way I have just acknowledged that there will be a new level of pressure applied to Ministers not to exercise that discretion to deny access-it still remains the case that the ultimate decision is with them. I do not think-nor did any member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-that it was a necessary or integral part of the maintenance of the Westminster system over anything else that ministerial discretion of this kind be absolutely retained. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if we are to have an essentially advisory jurisdiction of this kind, why is it not being exercised by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, or at least by its judicial or presidential members? Why is it that we are having a proposed wholly new tribunal-the Document Review Tribunal? I thought the Government was against the creation of new tribunals for the hell of it. Is it because we want to get State judges as distinct from just federal people involved in it? If so, why? Who are the State judges that the Attorney-General has in mind? There are some nice, civilised characters around the place in the State jurisdictions, but also, there are some judges whose views, I believe, do not readily fall within the meanings of the words 'civilisation', 'humanity', 'sensitivity', 'discretion' or 'common political sense'. In those circumstances, why is it that we want to have a potentially wider application of membership of this Tribunal? What has the Attorney-General up his sleeve in this respect? Will he be prepared to tell us?</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there seem to be some drafting difficulties about the Document Review Tribunal proposal as it is presently before us. Maybe these are easily remedial later on. Maybe there is a short reply that will solve the difficulty. In particular, I make the point that the proposed Document Review Tribunal does not seem to have the same range of necessary procedural powers as has the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. For example, under clause 48 (1) the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has the power, in appropriate cases, to determine that only part of a document is properly exempt and that the other part should be released. On a quick, necessarily cursory, scrutiny of the Attorney's proposed amendment, I cannot find any such power vested in the new review tribunal. I refer similarly to the power that exists for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to make decisions with respect to charges in clause 48 (6), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The powers of the Tribunal under this section extend to matters relating to charges payable under this Act in relation to a request. </PARA>
<PARA>The Document Review Tribunal does not seem to have a power to make those sorts of decisions when the matter lands on its plate. Is there any obvious reason for that? If not, why can we not have provisions of that kind vested in the Tribunal? The final point-maybe this is the answer to the question that I have just posed-is that there seems to be some unnecessary complexity in the procedural arrangements that are proposed. As I understand it, it is proposed that all appeals that will end up with the Document Review Tribunal have to go to the AAT first and from it be referred to the Tribunal. Maybe the view is taken that the AAT exercises, en passant, some jurisdiction with respect to charges and things which are exempt and non-exempt and accordingly it is felt that it is not necessary to vest that kind of jurisdiction in the higher Document Review Tribunal. That seems a remarkably clumsy business to the extent that we have to wend our way through an intermediate tribunal to get there. We are back in this old situation of having a huge multiplicity of procedural hurdles stretching out as far as the eye can see which have to be overcome before the person who is anxious to get his document can get the final decision made. Is it necessary for this kind of elaborate circumlocution to be built into the procedural arrangements that are provided for here?</PARA>
<PARA> The final matter to which I wish to refer-I will endeavour to make this the last point that I make in this very large area of controversy-is that I, the Opposition and, I suspect, Senator Hamer, whether he will get up to admit it is another question, still remain unhappy about the Commonwealth-State provisions in particular because--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator Missen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has said so.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that he has said it in general terms, but would he be prepared to go further and join with me in saying it in more specific terms? I know he is sensitive on the question of State government issues generally at the moment but we will not vest the sins of his family upon him. Will he be prepared to join with me in saying how appalled he is by the proposed retention of clause 28 (1) (b) which makes it a ground for exemption in respect of a Commonwealth-State document that such a document:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>would divulge any information or matter communicated in confidence by or on behalf of the Government of another country, or of a State or the Northern Territory, to the Government of the Commonwealth or a person receiving the communication on behalf of that Government. </PARA>
<PARA>What is it that the Document Review Tribunal can possibly do with that clause-that ground of exemption-if Charlie Court, or whoever the Liberal Premier of Victoria turns out to be in the next week or two, chooses to put a 'confidential' stamp on correspondence from the State to the Commonwealth? Will it not be able to rely upon the literal language of clause 28 (1) (b) to say that this was a communication in confidence? If a 'confidential' stamp is put on that document and someone is upset about it and wants access to that document and takes the matter by way of appeal or review-if that is the right word-to this Document Review Tribunal, what on earth can the Document Review Tribunal do when it is confronted with this document from Sir Charles Court which has 'confidential' stamped on it indicating that he does not want this particular information communicated? Is it possible under those circumstances for the Document Review Tribunal to say: 'Yes, we will have a look at this matter and determine whether that confidentiality stamp was properly put on it.'?</PARA>
<PARA> What sort of criteria is the Tribunal able to apply in that situation? Will it be able to apply the law, such as it is, that presently exists on the doctrine of breach of confidence so that the Tribunal will retain the jurisdiction to make an independent decision as to whether the document is, in its very nature, of such gravity, significance or sensitivity that it ought properly to be confidential; or will the Tribunal be locked into a situation of simply having to acknowledge the force of the proposition that the document is claimed to be confidential by the State government in question? We are not talking about marginal phenomena here. We all know how Commonwealth-State documents occupy such a huge proportion--</PARA>

I am trying to put together in one gulp rather than getting up and down like a yo yo all the dozens and dozens of points that could be made about these provisions. These are provisions on which, with respect, the Attorney ought to be able and willing to give not only us but also the Australian community some answers. These are not marginal, trivial procedural bits of flummery about which lawyers agonise to the intense neurotic boredom of everybody else; these are questions which go to the heart and soul of the potential effectiveness of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will leave the matter there. There are a number of points that I ask the Attorney of a technical character, but still important, about the Document Review Tribunal. I particularly ask the Attorney to give such assurances as he is capable of giving, on the language as it now stands, that the confidentiality provisions will not be capable of abuse in the context of Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add a question to the questions which the Attorney-General has to answer. In regard to public knowledge of the recommendation of the Tribunal, as I understand proposed new clause 55V, the regulations regarding the Documents Review Tribunal may in effect apply the provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Included in this provision is section 35 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act sub-section (1) which states that 'Subject to this section, the hearing of a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be in public'. I know it goes on to give the Tribunal power, when confidential matters are involved, to order that documents not be made public. Assuming my understanding is correct, it is intended that this Document Review Tribunal will give its finding in public so that it will be known to the public and to the Parliament and can, therefore, be discussed before or after the Minister makes his final decision. The section states that the regulations 'may' apply. Can we have some assurance that, in fact, it is proposed that the Tribunal will, in fact, give publicly its recommendation on these documents?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I deal with Senator Missen's question first. Perhaps I should have made clear when I was proposing the amendment that it is certainly the intention of the Government that the decision of the Document Review Tribunal should be made public. Obviously, the Tribunal would not be sitting in public dealing with the nature of the documents. So, there may have to be some modification of the provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. Proposed new clauses 55V and 55W provide for application of provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act by regulation. So that there can be no doubt about this matter in the future I give a complete assurance that it is the Government's policy and intention that the decisions should be made public. How they are made public is no doubt largely a matter for the Tribunal to determine. That is certainly the policy of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans raised a number of matters, I think the most important of which was his concern about the provisions in the Bill relating to Commonwealth-State documents. It has, of course, been the very firm policy of the Government that any Commonwealth Government documents, the disclosure of which may damage relations between the Commonwealth and the State or which would divulge any information communicated in confidence by or on behalf of the government of a State or the Northern Territory, should be exempt documents and come within this very exclusive sensitive character. I think it is very appropriate that we should have a State Premier in the Gallery at the time we are discussing this matter. Senator Evans's fear is that a State government or a State Premier might so abuse this position that it or he, in a cavalier way, would mark documents as being confidential when they really were not confidential at all. The Government does not believe that State Premiers or Ministers would do that sort of thing. The provisions here for documents communicated in confidence, in my opinion, are such that they would apply and would be held to apply only to documents that really were given in a confidential manner. There is a growing volume of law as to the nature of documents in confidence. Probably, as time goes on, we will have a more refined body of law dealing with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Document Review Tribunal certainly would have the power and, I have no doubt, would report on whether there were reasonable grounds, given the nature of a particular document, for exemption. Of course, if there were abuse of this exemption or if the legal application of it proved to be different from the one that I have expounded, naturally that would be a subject for reconsideration by the Government, and not in three years' time. It would be something that we certainly would look at because it is not intended that that provision would be applied in the broad way about which Senator Evans has expressed his fear. The Government has recommended a special Tribunal for this purpose because I think it has a special purpose. As I said, we want to have the widest selection of judges open to us. I am not prepared to mention names in public because I have not approached anybody, but I have mentioned to Senator Evans-I am sure he would acknowledge this-the names of judges whom I see as the ones I would like to persuade to serve on this Tribunal. </PARA>

It is hard to explain, but the reason for it is the convenience of the applicant so that when he lodges his appeal it can be determined whether it is a matter which has to go to the Document Review Tribunal or which should stay with the AAT. It has particular relevance in relation to internal working documents. An appeal as to whether it is an internal working document will go to the AAT in the ordinary way and be processed in the ordinary way. It would be only if this particular issue is involved that the document would have to be sidetracked to this Tribunal. Questions of charges also would be decided by the AAT. I do not know whether I have answered all the questions raised on the matter, but I hope so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The effect of the amendment is to remove a new catch-all amendment which has sneaked its way into the 1981 draft Bill. It was not in the 1978 Bill. If anything, it takes the exemption even more widely than was the case previously in the sense that it enables a document to be described as an exempt document if its disclosure would 'prejudice the carrying on generally of investigations concerning breaches or evasions of the law'. The character of the law enforcement exemption is already such as to have attracted critical comment from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its report. I think the detailed section of the report, chapter 20, paragraphs 1 to 9, and recommendation 56, makes clear, without my going on about it, the nature of our objections to a too wide ranging exemption. Of course, we acknowledge the necessity for certain kinds of investigative techniques to be kept secret in order that their efficacy might be preserved. But the clause, as it stands without this paragraph, would enable that to be done without allowing the possibility for abuse that is present as long as that paragraph is retained. So the proposal is to remove that. I hope the Attorney-General has had a change of heart and is prepared to agree with it. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment No. (38) relates to a very important section of the Bill which deals with secrecy provisions in other pieces of legislation. The substance of the existing clause is that a document is exempt if any existing secrecy provision specifically prohibits the disclosure of a document of that kind. The proposed amendment builds upon the very detailed argument-I do not propose to put that on the record again-set out in paragraphs 1 to 13 of Chapter 21 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. This amendment proposes to insert in the Bill a new clause which requires that such secrecy provisions as it is legitimate to retain in other legislation be listed in a specific Schedule to the Bill rather than there being just a catch-all picking up of them. It is also proposed that that Schedule be capable of amendment by a resolution approved by both Houses of Parliament. The point is that unless this kind of procedure is adopted, quite apart from the potential for individual secrecy clauses elsewhere to undermine the actual policy of the Bill, there is a basic threshold problem of even knowing what other secrecy provisions there might be in existence that could have potential application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee identified some 290-odd-indeed many of them are odd-secrecy provisions in other statutes and other regulations lying about in various places. It was the Committee's very strong view that, to the extent that there was justification for these provisions continuing to apply and cutting across the freedom of information principle, they ought to be sufficiently articulated in the Schedule to the Bill and as such made subject to some form of parliamentary scrutiny. That was the proposal circulated originally in the name of Senator Missen. On this matter I regret that once again it appears to be the case that Senator Missen finds himself obliged to succumb to the blandishments of Government senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to those 'blandishments' I say that I think this is a very important area that has to be cleared up. Unfortunately, the Government will not agree to the amendment but, on the other hand, the practical fact is that it is quite apparent that the work has not yet been done. There is a substantial amount of work in going through 294-that is the precise figure eluding Senator Evans-present laws of the Commonwealth regarding secrecy which impose restrictions on some people not to disclose certain documents and different other provisions, many of which are inconsistent in their terms and philosophy with the terms of the Bill. To put them in the Schedule now, to say which ones are to continue, how they are to be amended, and which ones are not to continue would probably mean that the implementation of the Bill would be held up for some time. Clearly the work has not been done. The work involved here would take a year or two. It would be that long before those provisions could be properly checked and before it could be decided which ones would continue and in what form. Therefore, I think the reality of the Government's rejection of this proposal would be understood. I look forward to receiving an undertaking from the Government that this work will go ahead and to getting reported back at a reasonably early date which provisions the Government proposes should continue and in what form.</PARA></TALK.START>

My understanding is that this was one of the matters in regard to which the icing on the cake was going to have another layer or two added during the course of today. I understood that there was a very real prospect of the Attorney-General in fact accepting a public interest criterion of an appropriate kind to be inserted in this finance and property interest clause and perhaps, indeed, in one or two of the other exemption clauses as well. Am I to take it from what the Attorney has just said that there is no prospect of movement on this matter and that the initial brave claims made this morning about the possibility of further movement on the part of the Government were the furphy that they appeared to be at the time?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak purely for myself on this matter. I will refer to amendments Nos (39), (40) and (43), all of which relate to similar provisions that a public interest test should be written into clauses. It was certainly my understanding that there would be some action in this regard. It was certainly my understanding that this provision would not be objectionable in principle to the Government, but I appear to have misunderstood that situation. I regret that, in fact, these are areas to which the Government is not prepared to agree at this stage. I have certainly worked upon that basis for some time now and I will certainly vote for these three amendments on the basis that it was my understanding that they would be acceptable. At no stage have I indicated that I would move from that stand. I do not suggest that that will have any effect on the ultimate vote but I regret very much that the Government will not move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me important that in regard to the public interest tests these amendments would, I think, be very useful to balance the desire of the Government to protect its financial interests and matters of that sort against the public interest which may overwhelm that idea. I believe that it would greatly improve these exemptions and reduce the times at which they would be used if there were such a public interest test. Therefore, despite the fact that I have no doubt the amendments will not be carried today, I hope the Government will look again at the matter before the Bill goes through the other House. I do not believe that the position, as I have outlined it, is satisfactory at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the Opposition's proposal now to divide on this matter. I am well aware of the time constraint we are all under and the Attorney and everyone else should be well aware of how much we on this side of the chamber have been seeking to expedite the production of the Bill. It seems to me that there is a very fundamental issue involved here. Claims were made this morning that there would be movement on this. The Attorney seems to have acknowledged the justice, in principle, of the particular matter that is now the subject of argument. There does not seem to be any good reason whatsoever for continued intransigence on this point. I, for one, am not mollified by the suggestion that this will go off to the higher councils of the Government parties, where it will be dealt with with the usual insensitivity that those higher councils of the Government seem able to bring to bear on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The very large claim was made this morning by various people that the arithmetic that I originally offered-which was, it might be remembered, that the Government was accepting 24 of the 80 amendments and rejecting 56 of them-was likely to prove utterly unfounded. I remind honourable senators that on the present rate of progress, and knowing now what is likely to happen for the rest of the day, the score is 29 for acceptance and 51 for rejection. I do not think on any analysis that amounts to a fundamental sea change in the Government's willingness to compromise on these matters. I know we cannot judge these things on a straight quantitative basis. I know the Attorney is about to leap to his feet to say the quality of the compromise is such as to compensate for the trivial character of its quantity. Unless the Attorney is prepared to postpone this matter for half an hour to have a further think about it, I am afraid we will put him to the embarrassment of a division on these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the subject raised by Senator Cavanagh, can we get some clarity as to what time we are sitting to this afternoon? I know there has been some discussion backwards and forwards about the matter. As far as the Opposition is concerned we have no difficulty in terms of catching planes if we sit until 4.30. I am puzzled at the attitude of the Government if it really wants this Bill passed. Does the Government want to set an early time constraint to stop proper debate of matters that are incapable of being properly debated, as was mentioned by Senator Cavanagh? Is this an artificial time restriction which will be shifted when we get close to 4 o'clock? Can the Government give us some idea? We are doing our best to expedite the debate and not put unnecessary material into the record. We are putting forward only that which is necessary to explain our position. The Opposition is prepared to go until 4.30. We have indicated that. What is the reason for the Government's disability, except to impose additional pressure and make it that much more difficult for honourable senators-including Senator Cavanagh, not to mention anyone else-to follow what is going on?

<PARA>This clause provides that if disclosure of certain documents would affect the national economy those documents are exempt.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason the Opposition so strongly supports this move, which was originally scheduled to be presented in the name of Senator Puplick who along with his colleagues on the back bench also once upon a time strongly supported it, is because we believe that it goes far too far with the exemptions in respect of the national economy. We are prepared to contemplate the view that on matters such as exchange rates and certain other precisely identified, very specific matters there may be some reason for a blanket exemption of the kind that is provided here, but that is not the way in which this clause is drafted. Mr Stone, when questioned on this matter during the public hearings conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was unable to articulate any coherent reason as to why there should be an exemption at all in this area, let alone to identify the multitude of sub-classes of documents which are now identified in the new version of this clause in sub-clause (2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter which is of grave concern to the Opposition relates to the Government's attitude in respect of this clause and that is the question of the additional public interest criterion here being inserted. The Opposition amendment that Senator Tate has proposed, with his usual cogency, is to interpolate a reference to the public interest as an additional criterion there. That is not something which appears in the Government's proposition but it is a crucial criterion for determination by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As I understand it this is another one of those matters which was the subject of negotiation and some understood agreement between the Government and its back benchers earlier today. I understand it is another one of the matters on which the Attorney-not to me I acknowledge, but to his troops-indicated that this would be another layer of icing on the cake that was possible, another area of compromise, another area of retraction from the intransigent stand that had previously been taken. It appears that that is not to be the case and that this will join its other two colleagues as particular causes which will not now be the subject of the Governments largesse. I think that point ought to be noted too, for the record, when we come to vote on this matter and although we will not put it to a division, it will be interesting for the record to identify again who among the Opposition senators feels that they have been stood up by the Government on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will oppose this clause on the ground as was found by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs namely, that it is very difficult to determine the meaning of the notion of confidence here embodied. We find that whilst the doctrine of the common law has been made specific in certain judgments it is not clear that this clause is confined to that common law doctrine. In an explanatory memorandum put around by the Attorney-General's Department earlier, and before the Senate Committee, the lack of any clearly perceived category of information for which it was necessary to have a separate breach of confidence exemption became apparent. On those grounds the Committee found that it was totally inappropriate that this sort of provision should be contained in a Bill of the nature before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Commonwealth can exempt whole areas from the operation of this Bill by consigning the regulation to a joint Federal-State body. It is an unhappy precedent. It is unhappy in its present form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can we get some better assurances from the Attorney-General? The Ombudsman matter is clearly a big one. It is probably the last remaining big matter in the Bill until we get to the Schedules with their exemptions of particular agencies and classes of documents. Unfortunately, the attitude of the Government on those matters is well known. Perhaps they need not take very long. But the discussion of the Ombudsman provisions will take a bit of time because it raises the fundamental question of the resource implications of this legislation and the whole question of having monitoring agencies independent of the Government. I imagine-it is hard to put a figure on it-that the remainder of the debate could be reasonably sensibly accommodated, not in half an hour, which would not be possible; nor do I think that two weeks is necessary as my learned colleague Senator Cavanagh earlier suggested by way of interjection. I think to have a reasonable debate to enable points of view to be put on the record we would probably need at least another hour and a half. Can we have some assurance from the Attorney-General that that kind of time will, in fact, be made available next week? I think the Attorney has already acknowledged the co-operation which he has had today. We are prepared to give him reasonable additional co-operation of that order of magnitude, but we are not prepared just to be brushed aside like flies on what is manifestly very important legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will raise the level of the general exemption from pay-roll tax applicable to the Australian Capital Territory. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced the proposed increase on 12 May 1981. The exemption is to be raised from $72,000 to $80,400 per annum. The higher level will apply from 1 January 1981, thus providing an exemption for 1980-81 of $76,200. The last increase applied from 1 January 1980 when the exemption was brought up to $72,000, in line with that allowed in New South Wales. That State has since increased its exemption level to $80,400 per annum with effect from 1 January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum exemption allowable in monthly returns will increase to $6,700 and, in conformity with existing rules, will be reduced at the rate of $2 for every $3 by which wages for the month exceed $6,700. There will thus be no exemption once the monthly pay-roll reaches $16,750. As a general rule, the new exemption will first apply to returns for the month in which this Bill receives the royal assent. End of year adjustments will ensure that the benefits are in all cases back-dated to 1 January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Another effect of the Bill will be that, when it comes into operation, an employer paying wages of $1,500 or less a week will not be required to register for Australian Capital Territory pay-roll tax purposes. Explanations of technical aspects of the Bill are contained in an explanatory memorandum being made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling $663m for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States and certain other services for the period 1 July to 30 November 1981.

That new legislation will also encompass the general tax sharing entitlement of the Northern Territory which has previously been funded from the Supply and Appropriation Bills. These are the main factors contributing to the lower provision sought in this year's Supply Bill (No. 2). </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to provide $685m by way of non-repayable grants to the States and Northern Territory for the construction and maintenance of roads in 1981-82. Honourable senators may recall that, in June 1980, the Commonwealth Government announced grants totalling $3,650m to the States and Northern Territory for road works over the period 1980-81 to 1984-85. This announcement of funding levels covering five years responds to requests from the States for a longer funding guarantee than has been provided under previous triennial assistance arrangements. The grants apportioned over the five year period are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-81-$628m</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-82-$685m</PARA>
<PARA> 1982-83-$734m</PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84-$778m</PARA>
<PARA> 1984-85-$825m</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that these allocations represent the firm and final amounts to be provided in each of the years concerned. They involve annual increases of 11 per cent in 1980-81; 9 per cent in 1981-82; 7 per cent in 1982-83; 6 per cent in 1983-84 and 6 per cent in 1984-85. I should make it clear that the declining annual percentage increases do not in any way signify a lack of awareness, on the Commonwealth's part, of the adverse effect which inflation can have on State and local government road programs. The control of inflation remains very much the Government's overriding concern. It is for this very reason that the Government refuses to encourage inflationary pressures by building into its own expenditure programs open-ended commitments to meet unlimited future cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the circumstances, the Government considers that the levels of roads assistance which it has announced represent a very substantial commitment-one that will enable an adequate level of road construction activity to be undertaken during the five year period. Honourable senators will be aware that an amount of $628m has been available to the States and the Northern Territory in 1980-81 under the Roads Grants Act 1980. By providing for the appropriation of a further $685m in respect of the coming year, the Bill now before the Senate gives continuing effect to the Government's five year funding commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for limited appropriations to each State and the Northern Territory for national roads in both 1982-83 and 1983-84. These are designed to provide the States and the Northern Territory with an assured basis for entering into longer term contracts for national roads construction works. I emphasise that these national roads appropriations for 1982-83 and 1983-84 should be regarded solely as a minimum planning base at this stage. The amounts currently specified in the Bill will be substantially supplemented when subsequent amendments are made to the legislation to appropriate funds for the balance of the five year program. The total grant of $685m to be made available in 1981-82 will be allocated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales-$214.336m</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria-$137.828m</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-$139.361m</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-$56.302m</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-$83.895m</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania-$30.243m</PARA>
<PARA> Northern Territory-$23.035m</PARA>
<PARA>The distribution provides for each State and the Northern Territory to receive a uniform 9 per cent increase in its grant as compared with the 1980-81 amount. The 9 per cent increase will also apply to each of the road categories for which Commonwealth funds are allocated. The Bill therefore maintains for a further year the same funding relativities as exist in the current legislation. In adopting this course, the Commonwealth has on this occasion accepted the view expressed by State roads Ministers that there be no change in the relative State shares of the total Commonwealth roads program in 1981-82. However, this should not be taken to imply any commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to the maintenance of the current funding relativities for the remainder of the five year program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has a very clear commitment in relation to national roads and, in particular, the upgrading of the national highways system. I would expect, therefore, that the distribution of the funds to be provided in the remaining three years will reflect an increasing concentration of effort in the national roads area. To this end, the Commonwealth has set in train a joint examination with the States of options for achieving Commonwealth objectives in relation to national roads. The national roads category will again encompass both national highways and developmental roads. The Bill provides for an extension of the definition of developmental roads to enable some limited funding to be made available from within national roads allocations for significant tourist roads and the upgrading of major development roads in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a number of significant changes in the arrangements under which Commonwealth roads assistance is to be made available to the States and the Northern Territory. Honourable senators may be aware that the roads assistance arrangements have been the subject of extensive discussions with the States over the past two years. In addition, the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations has recently completed a major report on relationships between the three spheres of Government in the roads area. It has been against this background that the Government has considered the arrangements under which future Commonwealth assistance should be provided. The Government is firmly of the view that, consistent with the Commonwealth's acceptance of full financial responsibility for national roads, it should ensure that its priorities and objectives in the national roads area are fully met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that grants for national roads construction works will be conditional upon tenders being called and dealt with in accordance with approved arrangements. Our intention to include such a requirement in future roads legislation was foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his 1980 election policy statement. The matter has also been discussed at some length with State roads Ministers at meetings of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. The Government considers that only by the creation of a competitive environment can it be sure that maximum value is being obtained from its very substantial outlays on national roads. State and Northern Territory road authorities will not be precluded from undertaking works using their own day labour forces. It will be open to State authorities to submit bids for the works in competition with private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement will apply to all works commencing after 31 August 1981 for which tenders have not already been called. Detailed administrative arrangements are still to be finalised in consultation with the States. However, I assure honourable senators that, in administering this requirement, it will be the Commonwealth's intention to minimise any unnecessary disruption of the existing processes for dealing with tenders at the State level. At the same time, however, the Commonwealth will be taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that its policy objectives are fully met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for a number of changes in the arrangements covering assistance for roads other than national roads. While the State roads Ministers advised that they were prepared to accept a one year extension of the current arrangements, we have taken immediate steps to further reduce Commonwealth administrative involvement in programming arrangements which are more properly the responsibility of the States. There will be a reduction from four to three in the number of road categories for which Commonwealth assistance is to be made available. The categories will be: National roads, arterial roads, and local roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in the number of categories has been achieved by amalgamating the former rural arterial roads and urban arterial roads categories. This change is intended to provide the States with greater flexibility in the development and carrying out of their overall road programs. Nevertheless, as was indicated last year in relation to the amalgamation of the former urban local and rural local roads categories, the States will be expected to continue to maintain an equitable balance of funding between urban and rural roads. On this basis, program approval requirements are to be discontinued in 1981-82 for arterial roads. These will be replaced with a retrospective reporting requirement under which the States must provide the Commonwealth at the end of each year with details of the arterial roads projects to which Commonwealth funds have been applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has also been made in the Bill for the discontinuation of annual program approval requirements for local roads in States where principles governing the allocation of Commonwealth grants for local roads have been implemented. The development of this approach-known as the formula approach-has been the subject of consultations with the States over the past twelve months. Besides simplifying the provision and identification of Commonwealth funding to councils, such an arrangement will provide councils with a greater certainty of future funding levels on which to plan their road programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill discontinues the practice of requiring the States and the Northern Territory to meet quotas of matching expenditure from their own resources. For some years now the States have not been required to contribute to the development and upkeep of the national roads system for which the Commonwealth has accepted financial responsibility. It will now be entirely a matter for the State and Northern Territory governments to determine the overall level of funding which they themselves apply to the arterial and local road categories. The Bill also provides that Commonwealth assistance for the arterial roads and local roads categories will no longer be conditional upon Commonwealth participation in State planning committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes which I have outlined in the arrangements relating to the non-national road categories are designed to streamline further the administration of the roads program. They are consistent with the general thrust of our approach since 1975 whereby we have progressively moved away from the stringent controls imposed on the States by our predecessors under the 1974 roads legislation. The changes are also very much in line with the Government's current rationalisation of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States over a broad range of public sector activities. The explanatory memorandum that has been circulated by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) describes in detail the features of the Bill. Therefore, I do not propose to deal with individual sections at further length. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>M. V. Vilkelis-Curas, 1 Sherwood Court, Doncaster East, Victoria 3109 25 May 1981</PARA>
<PARA>To Parliament and the people of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> This submission is to justify my action of withholding payment of my personal taxation for the year 1978-79 and any future period. </PARA>
<PARA> I have come to the decision that civil duty to one's fellow beings and nationals may, in exceptional and severe circumstances, warrant actions which in normal situations would be unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that within society a citizen must expect to have to accept certain practices which are at variance with his or her moral convictions. For the common good we may even have to contribute to the support of such practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have searched my conscience and initiated open debate on the matter of federal subsidisation of abortions, I have been unable to satisfy myself that I would be acting responsibly or in the best interests of my family or my fellow humans if I contributed my taxation towards abortion. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides claiming my civil right not to be an accomplice to what I regard as a mortal crime, I feel obliged to at least offer this action in the cause of human dignity. Abortion is the limit of human irreverence of life. Only holocaust can follow from this point. I claim no more than to be free of complicity from this crime against humanity. I believe this action represents the consciences of vast numbers of Australians who are unable to do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> I have informed and confirmed to the Taxation Department my conscientious decision. Since the Department or the law courts do not have the power to resolve this matter, I have decided to present this submision directly to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose that the resolution of this matter will come from a decision by the government to stop all use of public moneys for abortions and abortion related services. Subsequent upon this decision I shall willingly pay my tax dues. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasize that I have instigated this action as an individual and although I support certain organisations which hold compatible philosophies, I am not acting on their behalf. </PARA>

<PARA>PRESS STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA> My commitment to fast seven days in public as an act of prayer for all who are inclined to abortion, the abortionists and those in doubt, will officially be complete at midnight Sunday 31 May. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now presented myself openly before the Parliament and the people of Australia to express my total revulsion against abortion and the (Taxation) law which implicates me and other citizens in this apparently yet to be recognised atrocity. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress strongly enough that with abortion there can be no heaven, no utopia and no human unity-instead inevitable disaster for all concerned. I continue to be amazed at the extent of darkened awareness of this issue, not only with the people but the mass media also. </PARA>
<PARA> My retreat-fast outside Parliament House was one of a series of fasts but the first to public witness. I have become more confirmed that my action is spiritually justified although I understand I have transgressed a law of society by not paying my taxes. I am prepared to continue defending this issue and suffer any consequences accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I pray that we as mankind recover from this disease and gain everlasting immunity. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours in Truth, MARIJONAS VILKELIS-CURAS</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring some clarity to a situation in which I feel I have been misrepresented. Yesterday I commented on statements which you, Mr President, had handed down about security arrangements in Parliament House. In the course of those remarks I pointed out that, with all the money we have spent on security in this place, it was still possible for somebody to have thrown an egg at the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in another place. This morning the egg throwing incident was reported in the Canberra Times and my remarks reported in that newspaper made it appear that I felt we should have more security in Parliament House. The point I made, not very well obviously, or the point I wished to make was that I felt we could have looked at the amount of money we have spent on security and perhaps have spent it more profitably in other areas, as people were able to get through the security we have set up in Parliament House. I believe we need less security, not more.</PARA></TALK.START>
