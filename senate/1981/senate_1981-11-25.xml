<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Did the Treasurer say yesterday that the visit to Saudi Arabia by a senior Department of the Treasury official, Mr Des Moore, was simply to establish personal contact between the Treasury and a senior official 'of the monetary agency of a friendly country'? Did he say also that the visit was simply a courtesy call? If that is so, why was Cabinet informed of it and why did the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr John Stone, tell the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs that details of Mr Moore's visit were being held 'very tightly'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In response to a question on this matter yesterday, I said that the Treasurer had commented that Mr Moore, of the Treasury, will be stopping in Riyadh on his return to Australia from Switzerland in order to meet the Governor of the Saudia Arabian Monetary Agency, that the purpose of the meeting is to establish contact between an official of the Treasurer's Department and the monetary authority, and that it will be in just the same nature as other meetings which are held from time to time in established monetary centres around the world. The Treasurer made some comments yesterday on this matter. I have nothing to add to the comments that were made by the Treasurer or to the comments that I made on his behalf yesterday. As was stated, contact is to be made between the monetary authority and the Treasurer's Department. The visit will be in the nature of the usual contact that is made in this sort of circumstance. I have no comment to make on any matters which are the subject of Cabinet discussions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question. The Minister repeated my question very nicely, but the question is: Why did the Secretary to the Treasury, in a letter to the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, describe Mr Moore's visit as one which is being held very tightly; that is, secretly? Why is that discretion exercised in respect of this visit as distinct from all other visits made by Treasury officials?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think the nature of the questioning shows why the Secretary to the Treasury should have chosen to exercise some discretion. The fact that this line of questioning is being pursued about a normal contact that is to be made shows that he was probably wise in putting the matter to the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs in a very discreet way. In response to questions yesterday the Treasurer said that it was a normal contact that was to be made. He had no personal concern about it being publicly known that the contact was to be made. I think the line of questioning shows that there are people who wish to make something out of nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is asked in light of the grant of aid for humanitarian reasons to Poland by the Australian Government in recent days. Without in any way taking away from the humanitarian nature of that gesture, I ask the Minister: Will the Government consider giving to Poland favoured nation status in terms of trade and tariff with Australia to assist to stimulate the Polish economy and to go in some fundamental way towards meeting the problems in that country? Even if that status is not given, will the Government consider strengthening the Australian Trade Commissioner's representation in Poland? If the Government considers any favoured nation status, will it make a temporary arrangement for a specific period of, say, two years, to be reviewed at the end of that time and possibly terminated if the objective is met?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A number of specific things were asked by Senator Martin. As I announced last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is visiting Poland at the invitation of the Polish Foreign Minister. He left Australia just a few days ago. Prior to going he said that he was looking forward to having discussions with the Foreign Minister and others in the Polish Government about a range of international and bilateral matters. He hoped that in the brief time available to him he would have contacts with Polish society and that, as a result of his visit, he would have a better understanding of developments within Poland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the questions raised by Senator Martin could be encompassed by some of the discussions that the Minister might have. But I am not able to comment on the likely outcome of those discussions or on any decisions that might be taken by the Australian Government as a result of the visit. However, I am sure that as a result of the visit we will have a better understanding of what would be of assistance to Poland, in addition to the appeal fund which was opened by the Prime Minister last Sunday and to which the Australian Government contributed $1m. The visit is important because it is the first by an Australian Government Minister since 1975. It is also the first by a Foreign Minister from this country. As soon as I am able to refer the matters raised by Senator Martin to the Minister for Foreign Affairs I will see that she is advised of any response. If any general statement needs to be made it will be made.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of claims by the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce that the Industrial Relations Bureau has been giving unwarranted attention to employers in the retail motor industry, that officers of the Bureau have been making frequent and unreasonable demands on these employers and that this has been the subject of some disputation with the Victorian Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau? Is the Minister aware of allegations about a business at Bayswater where a driver was dismissed for what appear to be legitimate reasons but the employer claims to have been continually subjected to interviews and inquiries by the Bureau at great expense to all parties? Has Victoria a higher ratio of complaints than other States?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of claims by the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce because I think it sent the same letter to me as it sent to other honourable senators and honourable members which drew our attention to the complaints that it had received. I suppose the complaints are a reminder to the Senate and to the people of Australia of what was perhaps a little obscured in the original debate on the Industrial Relations Bureau and that was that the Bureau was intended not only to look at the behaviour of trade unions in the industrial area but also to look at the behaviour of employers. The complaint from the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce is that it has been over-enthusiastic in its concern about the behaviour of employers. The same letter, I think, has been sent to Mr Viner. I asked him what he was doing about the matter and he has advised me that he has referred the letter to the Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau and asked for a full and comprehensive report on the matters which have been raised. I do not know whether the matters raised with Mr Viner include the particular matter of the Bayswater case, raised by Senator Lewis, but I will refer that to Mr Viner and make sure that he also gets a report on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

For that reason, while its eventual purpose and the equipment to be set up in it have not been specifically spelt out as yet, clearly it would be for that purpose and not narrowly for a nuclear fall-out shelter.

Rather than have the Commonwealth Government initiate an investigation, I can report to the honourable senator that there has been some action. The Supervising Scientist has already had discussions with the Co-ordinator-General of the Northern Territory about the content and the format of the reports by the Northern Territory supervising authorities. In addition, the monitoring and inspection programs by which the Northern Territory supervising authorities will verify that the mining companies are complying with both Northern Territory and Commonwealth environmental requirements have been reviewed.</PARA></TALK.START>

This will be carried out by the Northern Territory supervising authorities. I hope that any tardiness in providing these reports can be overcome quickly, as I agree with the honourable senator that reports which are timely and which contain appropriate content are essential to achieve the goals to which the honourable senator referred in his question.</PARA>

Jogging, of course, is easy and cheap and to many it is a very enjoyable form of exercise, but there are other ways in which one can achieve the same results. Cycling, swimming and calisthenics are alternative forms of exercise and they, too, have their share of hazards. Because of the concern that many Australians may be entering fun runs such as the City to Surf and other runs like that without sufficient preparation, the Department of Health is in the process of publishing a guide to fun running which contains a list of precautions and a preparation schedule that emphasises gradualism. One thing is for sure; it is better to be healthy and fit than to take no exercise at all. I come back to the point at which I started.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the more they shout the more I will go on with the story. The situation in 1975 was that a completely illegal Executive Council meeting was held in secret and without the knowledge of the Governor-General. The fact is that an Executive Council meeting was held to raise a loan of some $4,000m, repayable in commission rates and in interest rates that were indefensible. It was quite proper that the advice given by the Treasury in those days-that that loan should never have been raised-should have been given. To compare that situation with a letter which is purported simply to say that a Treasury officer is visiting another country is to distort the whole purpose of the situation.

There has been a very significant improvement and increase in the Government's support for medical research. Whether a particular project is supported depends on peer assessment within the NHMRC by committees which look at the many competing requests for funding and assess them on merit. There is an attempt to look at the different projects to work out which have most merit. I have no idea at all whether a project in the University of Tasmania does or does not have continuing funding. If in fact it is a project funded through the NHMRC and if in fact it is not getting funding in the future it will be for one reason only, and that is that in the opinion of those who evaluate projects there are other projects more deserving of funding; and that is the way that medical research has been and continues to be funded in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition again raises in the Senate the crucial social issue of housing in Australia. We believe that it is a major responsibility of a national government to provide an environment in which Australian citizens have a right to solve their accommodation problems. They should be able to do that either by purchasing or erecting their own home or, if they are unable to do that due to economic circumstances, the national government should respond by providing public housing. As my colleague, the shadow Minister for urban and regional affairs, Mr Uren, and the leader of my party, Mr Hayden, have stressed in the past week or so, the growing crisis in housing and home ownership has become a major social problem, alongside the problem of unemployment. That fact is being recognised by many of the leading newspapers. The Sydney Sun stated last Monday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr Howard, is splitting hairs when he says the rise in the price of housing and land has done more to prevent home-buying than have rising interest rates in the past three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sun went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> What confronts him now is the total failure of the government housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the point made by the Sun, that there has been a total failure of the Government's housing policy. The Australian Labor Party has chosen the last week of the parliamentary sittings for 1981, a week in which the Government has seen fit finally to retreat from its responsibilities to the people of Australia, once again to raise this matter of housing. We will do it again and again until we see a genuine change of heart and a change of policy by the Fraser-Howard Government, until we see it addressing itself seriously and responsibly to the topic of this matter of public importance, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to assist citizens to have adequate accommodation and contain interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of housing is rising to a higher level than ever before. Rents are at an all-time record high and we are building fewer houses in 1981 than in previous years. The point that has to be made in this debate is that the cost of housing has risen, in general terms-it differs from State to State-at a rate more than three times that of inflation. We should recognise that the biggest single item purchased or attempted to be purchased by the average family in our country is a home. I wish to canvass several related matters in today's debate. Briefly, they are: The Government's economic philosophy, strategy and policy, particularly its obsession with the so-called free market and the money supply, a philosophy which is constantly echoed in this place by the Leader of the Government, Senator Carrick; the nature of the economic advice the Government is receiving from its Treasury; the inquiry into the Australian financial system; the pressure being applied to interest rates; and the housing crisis that is being created as a result of all these elements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Country Party Government seems proud of its free market, Adam Smith credentials. Time and again it makes statements that make its founding father, Sir Robert Menzies, seem like a doyen of downright socialism with his talk of protection for employment industries, regulation and control of interest rates and the like. All of this has come into the news again with the release of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. We are privy to the failure of Thatcherism in the United Kingdom and the repudiation of Reaganism in the United States of America even by one of the United States Governments closest economic advisers, Mr Stockman. Yet the Fraser Government persists with its outdated attitudes. As we all now know, the Government, represented in this case by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, laid down the type of report it wanted in the terms of reference it gave to the Campbell Inquiry. The report was to be influenced by the Government's philosophical position, the Government's 'free enterprise objectives'. It was to be, as one newspaper noted, Mr Howard's major political victory. It was to bear the stamp of his Department all over it. It has certainly done that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Campbell report looks like being the biggest failure of Mr Howard's short but notable time in the spotlight, for his economic theories are falling apart here, as indeed they are in other parts of the world. As an economic document the Campbell report is callous and lacking in social thought or vision. It shows the logic to which a conservative government can stretch. It is a bench-mark by which we can measure conservative governments, with its emphasis on deregulation, freeing up of the financial system to market forces and, of course, to foreign banks, cutting back on government intervention, government interest, government concern and planning, et cetera. It tells us much about this conservative Liberal-National Country Party Government and how it thinks. That is its value for us today. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the Campbell report's views are echoed elsewhere at the senior reaches of the Department of the Treasury. For example, last week, just one day before the public saw the Campbell report, the Secretary to the Treasury was reported as suggesting that the Government would need to make more room for private investment in Australia if Australia was to take full advantage of its economic opportunities, especially in the natural resource area. He saw the Australian preference for home ownership as a means of diverting capital away from other uses such as resource development and posed the question whether we ought not to see one against the other instead of seeing them complementing one another. Of course, that is Mr Stone's view. Let us remember that this is the view of a very senior government adviser whose views have held sway in the Government's economic thinking for the last five or six years. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mr Stone's view, significant sectors of the Australian economy should be squeezed back in order to make more room for an expanded inflow of capital and to facilitate a transfer of domestic funds towards investment in resource-type development. This policy, the Stone policy-the stone-age policy-is already in place in many areas of government economic management, despite reported differences between Messrs Howard and Stone, as suggested on the radio program PM last night. The Stone-Treasury line of a free play for the market and a cutting back to make room for the public sector has been a feature in each of the Fraser-Howard Budgets since 1976. This free market obsession is one key element in the Government's thinking. For the housing sector it means an uncontrolled blowout in interest rates and a neglectful cut-back in the public sector responsibilities. These are exactly the policies being followed. The other key obsession for Mr Howard and his friends is the money supply. High interest rates will restrict the amount of money floating around, thereby controlling the money supply. That is the theory. Public sector spending increases the deficit and, therefore, the money supply. So goes their obsession. </PARA>
<PARA> A policy of high interest rates and of a clamp down on public sector housing is the logical result, and that is enshrined in this Government's policies, which inevitably will mean a further increase of approximately 2 per cent in interest rates. The effects of these policies have been emphasised by the Australian Labor Party. Any compassionate political party would stress these effects. Only an uncaring government, which we now have, can neglect them in its zeal for a reduced money supply situation. As we know, interest rates have sky-rocketed in recent months. According to figures supplied by the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies, the prevailing rate for mortgage repayments is about 13.5 per cent to 15 per cent. In my estimation, that is a generous calculation. The Association calculates that on a $30,000 25-year loan the monthly repayments, at the going rate of 14.5 per cent, are $373 per month. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a small table from the Association showing monthly repayments on a standard $30,000 25-year loan at various rates of interest. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, this shows that the increase that has taken place in mortgage repayments in the recent period is something like $51. This sort of repayment excludes most wage and salary earners from housing finance. Already under this Government interest rates on savings bank loans have risen from 9.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent since February 1980. We know too that the finance company and building society interest rates are even higher. Yet the recommendation of the Campbell inquiry report is that interest rates should be deregulated altogether. On the Committee's own admission this will mean an average increase in rates of approximately another 2 per cent. When Mr Willis, our economic spokesman, referred to that he was spot on with what the estimation and assessment should be. The Housing Industry Association, which deals with the problems associated with the building industry, estimates that for each 0.5 per cent increase in home loan interest rates some 4,000 Australians are excluded from the home ownership market. The Campbell report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those persons most likely to be affected by sizeable interest rate increases are those who have not yet acquired their first home or have borrowed recently and whose repayments are a high proportion of their income. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government had better make itself clear on the matter of interest rates because they are depressing the home market. Will the Government continue to use interest rates as a squeeze on the money supply or, more drastically, will it allow market forces to increase the rates across the board? The trouble signs are there. The trouble signs of high rates have already been seen in the depressed housing market, increased pressure on rentals, increasingly inadequate housing and homelessness. The facts are there to prove what I am saying. The facts show that there is a slump in the housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics the total number of new houses approved for building in both the private and public sectors has decreased in real terms by over 11 per cent in the year since September 1980. In public sector housing the decline is some 17 per cent. According to the Permanent Building Societies Association Ltd the reason is clear; finance for housing has contracted sharply in the months to September 1981. This is what has happened without deregulation. If we wish to contemplate that perhaps we should look at the experience overseas and at the United States housing boom. The business journal Business Review Weekly, in an article on 4 September, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Soaring mortgage rates, now running at 17 per cent or more have put the lid on the American housing boom that began in the mid-70's . . . the recent surge in interest rates began in late 1979 when the Federal Reserve Board decided to concentrate its efforts on controlling the money supply. Interest rates were opened to market forces and quickly began to rise. </PARA>
<PARA>That could almost be a description of what is happening in Australia with all the disastrous consequences of the Fraser Government's policies. It is no wonder that even industry sources cannot support this Government's housing priorities. It is no wonder that the Government's housing committee has been expressing concern to the Government about the failure of the home savings grant legislation and its inability to have any appreciable impact. Is it any wonder that Liberal housing Ministers in the States are supercritical of the cut-backs that are taking place in the public housing sector? Is it any wonder that the people associated with this matter, such as the master builders and those in the housing industry, are concerned and that in the editorials of most of the responsible newspapers in Australia this Government is being slighted for its inept policies?</PARA>
<PARA> As conditions have worsened in the home ownership market more and more people face increased rental pressures. They are being forced to seek housing on the rental market. Interest rate charges and changes have hit hard in that area as well, with the vast burden being passed on to the tenant. For owners of private rental accommodation the increase in rates is forcing them to increase rents to achieve a good rate of return. The tenant pays and as the Sydney Daily Mirror noted on Monday, 23 November, this will continue well into 1983 unless government policies change. The Daily Mirror stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The reason, according to Mr Rowen Kelly, managing director of Kelly and Sons Real Estate Centres; 'there is still quite a big gap between the rent payable on a home and the mortgage repayments. And while that gap remains as wide as it is, fewer buyers will be around. As a result, home prices will remain stable. The only way the sales market will improve is for rents to catch up with mortgage repayments . . . and that's what I expect to happen in 1982'. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, clearly, the rental market will rise dramatically within the next year. A sensible government would respond by increasing the public housing stock to take up this need and to relieve the pressure. But not this Government; in real terms, it has cut funds available for public housing. Since 1975, in real terms, funds for public sector housing have fallen from $1,413m to $399m in 1981-82. This has put the States in an impossible position in this area of responsibility. The Federal Government has a concept of welfare housing only, yet today public housing should be promoted as a reasonable and viable alternative to the home ownership race, a race which the average wage and salary earner cannot now enter. This is an indisputable fact. We need rental housing for those who cannot enter that race. There is also a vital need for rental housing because of the growing mobility of the work force that has been evident in our economy in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal next with the subject of homelessness. Even in this area of welfare housing the Government fails miserably. The National Director of the Housing Industry Association recently stated that 280,000 families urgently needed housing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government had to provide at least $450 million in the next year and State Governments had to do more to attack housing poverty . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Many are being forced to live in sub-standard housing because they just can't afford the rent for a decent home. </PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Industry Association estimated that in the past year the number of very needy families grew by well over 20,000. If we concede that in 1982 and 1983 the problem will increase by that same margin, what sort of drastic and dramatic situation will face an ever increasing number of Australian families? The Government has neglected its responsibilities and transferred them back to the States and to the individuals, who cannot solve the problem alone because it is a matter for government assistance, government intervention and government planning. The thousands of people living in substandard rental accommodation, in caravan parks or in temporary accommodation could tell us that loudly and clearly. Yet things are not all bad for all people on the interest rate or construction front. Some friends of this Government and potential benefactors of the Campbell Committee report are doing very well, thank you very much. For example, the large banks and finance companies do very nicely from the high interest rates that the ordinary Australians must pay. On 30 October an article in the Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Two of Australia's largest finance companies-Australian Guarantee Corporation and Citicorp Australia-have reported hefty profit increases reflecting the strength of the finance industry amid high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Chipp pointed out to the Senate yesterday, the banks are making huge profits from interest rate hikes. The profits of the ANZ Banking Group Ltd rose by 29 per cent to $175.4m while the profits of the Bank of New South Wales improved by 33.3 per cent to $165m. The National Bank of Australasia Ltd increased its profits by 33.8 per cent to $101.4m in the same period. So much for competition in interest rates. Plenty of building is also going on, but not to provide shelter for Australian families. The boom in resources, power and commercial construction has helped huge contractors such as John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd, Roberts Construction (Pacific) Pty Ltd and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd find their way to record earnings this year. Leighton's profit has been $5.4m and Holland's surplus has been $3.3m. Such profits could provide shelter, in a properly governed society, for many Australian wage earners, but it lines the pockets of the wealthy fat cats. Finance company wits tell the story of asking all those requesting money for building finance: 'Oh yes; and where is your gold mine?'. Every day this joke becomes more and more a confirmed reality as the needs of people are being pushed aside. Mr Uren, the Oppositions spokesperson on housing matters, has outlined the need for a co-ordinated plan to respond to people's housing needs and to confront rising rates of interest and corporate carelessness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his usual way, Senator Gietzelt has sought to confuse all the issues which he has raised in the matter of public importance that he proposed for discussion by the Senate today. For the purposes of the exercise and to refresh the Opposition's memory, the matter of public importance is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to assist citizens to have adequate accommodation and contain interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>In the earlier part of his debate on this matter, Senator Gietzelt would have us believe that, in fact, the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System which was presented in this chamber only a week ago, is implemented government policy. In fact, he has been seeking over the last week or so and particularly in this discussion today to misrepresent the Government's position on housing interest rates and in other areas. On that point, I refer to a remark that the Campbell Committee made in its report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has not sought to assess the appropriate level of assistance to particular groups . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The judgments involved extend well beyond questions of economic efficiency and are outside the Committee's terms of reference. The Committee has instead focused solely on the methods of assistance and their implications for the financial system. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is simply that the Government has received a report which is, as was stated by the Chairman of that Committee, a blueprint for the financial system in Australia and, in fact, puts down views of that Committee. It is for the Government to decide what policies it should implement in regard to the financial system and especially with regard to the effects of particular decisions upon sectoral policies for the provision of finance. In particular, Senator Gietzelt's point in relation to housing will be given great consideration by this Government in considering the Campbell Committee report. Again I make the point that the Campbell Committee report is not a fait accompli as such. It is wrong for Senator Gietzelt and other members of the Opposition to represent it consistently as being accomplished Government policy. Indeed, the Campbell Committee says quite clearly in its report that it is not seeking to see that kind of policy strictly in place in various parts of the economy but leaves those decisions to government. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the points which Senator Gietzelt raised in supporting his argument which touched, as I say, very briefly upon the actual point which was raised in the matter of public importance proposed for discussion, the fact is that his major differences with the Government relate to philosophy. He refuses consistently to accept the fact that we do not speak only of housing in terms of public housing or private housing. We talk of housing in terms of the total housing market in Australia. In fact, we have to acknowledge that, over the years since 1947, total private ownership of houses in Australia has risen from something like 53.4 per cent in 1947 during the Chifley Labor Government to a level of around 72 per cent in 1980. That figure has been consistent over the last decade or so, running approximately at a 70 per cent level. That indicates a very substantial commitment on the part of Australians, on the part of the Australian financial institutions and on the part of this Government to support private ownership in housing as distinct from the kind of welfare housing approach which Senator Gietzelt is seeking to make. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not deny that the Government does not have responsibilities to lower income groups. In fact, I refute very clearly the points which have been made by Senator Gietzelt in relation to the apparent non-concern of this Government for lower income groups in this area. Quite clearly, the Government has committed substantial resources to the lower income groups. In fact, if we look at the figures for applications for rental accommodation which are outstanding with State housing authorities at the present time, we see that in 1975, before this Government came to office, approximately 103,000 people were seeking rental accommodation through State housing authorities. In December 1980-five years later-that number had dropped to 86,000. There has been a consistent fall since this Government came to power. A fair catch-up was required because of the situation that existed in 1975 which related to the previous Government's efforts in trying to destroy this nation through wrong-headed economic policies. But in terms of achievement, this Government has also substantially reduced the backlog of cases of people seeking assistance through the State housing authorities, even in light of the fact that the total market might have been expected to grow in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern, to which Senator Gietzelt did not refer, is the provision, through the State housing authorities, of rental rebates for persons on low incomes. This system did not apply in 1975. In the time of the Whitlam Labor Government there was no provision of rental rebates through the State housing authorities. In the first year of this Government $12.3m was provided to low income earners. In the last year for which I have a full year's figures-that is, 1979-80-$75m was provided for rental rebates in the States. If this does not show concern for the lower income earners I do not know what does. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this Government is committed to the provision of assistance to those who need it most. Clearly, the Opposition's policies are designed to create a greater number of people who are dependent rather than people who can look after themselves. That is the essential difference between the philosophy of the Opposition and the philosophy of this Government in relation to housing. Clearly, we seek to assist those in greatest need. Of course, Senator Gietzelt would not appreciate the point. The famous Minister responsible for housing in the Curtin Labor Government during war time, Mr Dedman, did not support private ownership of housing because it led to the establishment of more and more 'little capitalists' in the country. That seems to be Senator Gietzelt's point of view and, generally speaking, the point of view of the Opposition as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that Senator Gietzelt denies these remarks. Might I take the argument a little further to make the point that not only has the amount of money being provided to State housing authorities for rental rebates to those on lowest incomes grown substantially in the last five years, but also the numbers of people being assisted has grown enornously. In June 1975 the number of people receiving assistance was some 29,000. In fact, in December 1980 the number had risen to 95,000. That is an increase of some 300 per cent. Does that show a lack of concern by this Government for those who are in greatest need? Of course not. Clearly, this Government is committed to assisting those who are in greatest need. That is what the philosophy of this Government is about rather than putting resources into the hands of those who least need them, which seems to be the approach of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to some of the other issues which surround the general housing situation in Australia at the present time, Senator Gietzelt claimed that there has been a substantial fall in the number of building approvals and commencements. If we look back to the dark years of 1975-76, particularly 1975, we see that the number of dwellings commencement approvals was 121,323. In the last year for which we have figures-1980-81-the number of dwellings approved was 156,501, a growth of about 24 per cent over that period. Clearly that evidences continuing growth in the total housing market. Senator Gietzelt sought to make out, in terms of annual fluctuations, that somehow it is moving in other directions. But if one takes the long view, one sees a substantial improvement in the total number of dwellings being approved and commenced. This clearly evidences strength and vitality in the Australian economy. I would like to come to that point a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken of the dwellings approved. I would like to mention now the actual commencements, for which the figures are slightly different. The number of houses commenced in 1974-75 was 118,109. Last year-an estimate only at this stage-the total number of commencements was 148,000, an increase of about 30 per cent over that six-year period. Does that substantially support Senator Gietzelt's argument that housing is slipping back into the Middle Ages or whenever as he is seeking to assert? Of course not. Clearly, there has been progress in housing at all levels in this country. Whether it is at the public housing level or at the private housing level, the fact is that more people are getting into houses and doing better from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come to some of the more particular points which Senator Gietzelt sought to make with regard to interest rates. He made the point that people generally are being discouraged from home ownership by virtue of the higher interest rates which are present in the community at the moment. We know, of course, that that is substantially correct, that there have been increases in housing interest rates across the community. We have to look at the reasons why that has happened. Interest rates do register the price of money and consequently are a measure of the demand and supply situation for money in the community. Only a limited amount of money is available within the community and it is available for many things, such as the development of resource projects, the development of houses, the development of businesses and the provision of ordinary finance for consumer durable purchases, such as motor cars. Clearly, what we have to do is be able to ration as best we can finance to the various sectors of the community. It cannot be done by the stroke of a pen. Senator Gietzelt clearly knows that because he was a supporter of the Labor Government in 1974 when interest rates increased from 10 per cent to about 24 per cent in the short term money market, in the overnight money market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is something the honourable senator has been doing ever since he has been a member of this place. Interest rates measure the cost of money to the community and regulate the supply to the various sectors of the community. If we are to ensure that people have adequate housing finance, we must ensure that there is at least some relativity between housing interest rates and interest rates for any other form of borrowing. At the core of this Government's policy is the wish to ensure that there is adequate finance for housing throughout the community. The second point-I think this is the one that is most overlooked by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, for that matter, in relation to housing-is that through the much maligned monetary policies of this Government we have been able to keep inflation under control and in fact have reduced it from Labor's 19 per cent in 1974 to 8 per cent or 9 per cent at the present time. By virtue of that change, the enormous benefit to the community of Australians who are seeking to buy their first homes must be obvious to all but those in the Opposition. The fact is that by virtue of being able to keep inflation under control we keep under control the cost of housing in this community which, as we know, went up absolutely astronomically during that period of the Whitlam Labor Government. In fact, in the period of two years- or was it three?-the average price of a house in Australia doubled. In that period it became almost impossible for people to buy houses. That must not be denied by honourable members opposite. The fact is that by controlling inflation we are seeking to put as many people into houses as we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the side effects of that is that in order to keep control of the money supply, which in fact has a very big impact upon the rate of inflation, we must ensure that the interest rates are kept at reasonable levels. That, of course, has been this Government's policy over the last five or six years. No one says that high interest rates are very popular. It is, however, at this time the only policy which happens to be right, and that is the significant thing which the Opposition will dismiss and make as much politics of as it possibly can. In fact it is seeking to do that at this very moment. What we are seeking to do is to ensure that the longer term interests of the Australian community are kept in mind. In terms of the question of inflation and the cost of housing I refer the Opposition to an article by Kenneth Davidson which appeared in this morning's Age. The headline reads: 'Home prices the culprit, not rates'. This, of course, is only what we have been saying in the last few minutes. It substantially supports the point that the effect of inflation on the average price of a home is the biggest deterrent to people obtaining a home. One has only to consider the effects on a person living in Sydney who needs to pay something like $60,000 for his first home. If inflation is running in the order of 10 per cent, we are talking about an increase in the price of that house over a 12-months period of some $6,000. How does that compare with a one per cent increase in interest rates which might apply to an average mortgage?</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously those figures are not comparable and the greatest disadvantage falls on that person who is seeking to buy his first home. That is a very substantial point which this Government believes is the reason for its policies and is the reason we are committed to ensuring that interest rates keep the money supply under control so that we can in fact keep inflation under control. By doing that and by achieving those things we will do more for housing in this community and for Australians in general, not only for tomorrow but also for the long term future, than the Opposition's policies will ever achieve. The Opposition knows that by its own experience in 1974 and 1975 it destroyed the Australian economy by its free money policies which made housing so expensive that the average person could not achieve it, and in that way it made sure that it created problems which had to be corrected by the fortunately right policies of this Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has looked at the development of the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries principally from a national perspective, with particular regard to the role of the national government in overseeing development and ensuring that industrial expansion will benefit the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of an export oriented industry engaged in further processing of minerals is welcome. The aluminium industry has the capacity to generate a significant growth in wealth throughout the community, stimulate growth in related industries and, as a result, expand employment. Of central importance to the debate on the expansion of the industry are the terms and conditions on which it is attracted to this country. The Committee believes that, in the context of the world aluminium industry, Australia is an attractive location for expansion of that industry. The advantages this country has include availability of raw materials, energy, a skilled work force and a stable political and economic system attractive to corporate investors. Thus the Committee believes that there is no justification for offering special concessions to the industry whether through undervaluing of resources, taxation concessions, watered down environmental controls or subsidised provision of infrastructure. There is evidence that the new projects have benefited from one or other of these types of concessions. This is particularly so for the supply of electricity to aluminium smelters where any subsidy to one user is a direct charge on the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The belief that Australia has a significant comparative advantage must be balanced by acknowledging that that advantage is neither absolute nor open-ended. It is limited by the availability of competing locations which will become increasingly attractive alternatives over time. Thus it is vitally important that, if Australia is to attract development in the medium term without offering subsidies or concessions, this country must provide a secure and predictable framework for investment. The potential investor in these highly capital intensive long term projects must know from the outset the terms and conditions applying to development and be reassured that they will not be subject to sudden or dramatic change. Perhaps the most glaring evidence of the absence of that 'secure and predictable' framework has been provided by the recent sharp rise in electricity prices in Victoria and the resulting inquiry into the supply of electricity to the proposed Alcoa smelter at Portland, Victoria. Other examples include the wide variation in local and State taxes and charges, the lack of co-ordination between State royalties and quasi-royalties and Commonwealth taxation and the varying policies on the provision of infrastructure. All these factors also provide great scope for corporate developers to 'play off' the various States with the object of minimising their costs. A co-ordinated approach by State and Federal governments should seek to maximise the community's return. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that various national Government departments have adopted a passive role in discharging their responsibilities. This is particularly true of the lack of information available to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in negotiations in the Loan Council when considering borrowing by electricity authorities, the failure of the Department of National Development and Energy to seek otherwise confidential information on electricity supply and pricing and the reduction of the role of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in administering the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>Energy</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not view the energy demand of the aluminium industry as a problem in itself. However, it has serious reservations as to whether some State authorities can meet their contractual obligations to the industry without disadvantaging other consumers. It is essential that the cost of supplying energy to large industrial users covers the full costs of all factors of production, with one reservation-the Committee believes that export parity pricing, particularly of coal, is not necessarily the best approach to take in all circumstances. If export parity pricing will prevent investment taking place which would otherwise be of considerable net economic benefit, it may be justified to forego some measure of income to ensure that investment takes place. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation</PARA>
<PARA> The function of the taxation system is to ensure that the Australian community as a whole receives a fair return on resources employed and profits generated within the aluminium industry. The present unco-ordinated range of State and Federal taxes and royalties do not achieve this. Taken in conjunction with the structure of the aluminium industry they provide many opportunities for tax minimisation and avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>Ownership</PARA>
<PARA> A significant degree of foreign participation is inevitable to provide access to markets, technology and capital. This is not a cause for anxiety if the level of foreign ownership is kept under constant public scrutiny and if the taxation system operates effectively to ensure that foreign participation does not result in a loss of revenue to the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>Labour</PARA>
<PARA> The aluminium industry will provide relatively few jobs directly. However, through the creation of wealth in the community and the development of related industries, it can be expected to have a significant positive effect. The Committee does not believe that jobs created per dollar invested is a valid criterion for evaluating the worth of an industry. The availability of skilled labour to meet the industry's needs remains a contentious issue. Given the lead time of these projects and the predictable nature of their demand for labour, it indicates a sad lack of foresight by government, educational institutions and industry that shortages of particular skills have emerged. The Committee notes the conclusion of the Department of Labour Advisory Committee report that there is no evidence to suggest that immigration can provide skilled labour in categories where shortages are apparent. Thus increased immigration on that basis should be discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>Infrastructure</PARA>
<PARA> In remote areas such as the Mitchell Plateau of Western Australia corporate developers should be responsible for the provision of all physical infrastructure. In settled areas this policy is not equitable or appropriate. Thus it is essential that local rates, State taxes and other charges recover appropriate proportions of infrastructure costs incurred as a result of industrial development. Local authorities confronted with development must be provided with support by State and Commonwealth governments to ensure that they can negotiate effectively with developers. In addition, they must be put on a secure financial basis through the collection of an adequate level of rates and the provision of financial support when it is most needed-at an early stage of development. Reliance on negotiating one-off front end payments or the benevolence of project developers is not a suitable financial base for a local authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Environment</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that a number of projects are being allowed to proceed despite unresolved and justifiable anxieties as to their impact on the environment. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment should take a more active role in evaluating the environmental impact of these projects. That Department must also develop procedures for the conduct of regional environmental assessment involving a number of projects and different industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry was probably the most interesting that we have undertaken. I pay a tribute to the Committee members for the immense amount of work that they devoted to this inquiry. It certainly generated considerable community interest. I must record our special appreciation to Ron Maunsell who retired from the Committee and the Senate during the latter stages of this inquiry. The Committee, like other Senate committees, has always been well served by its support staff. To Derek Abbott and Jenny Norberry I convey our special thanks for a job well done. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the usually moderate language of a Senate committee report, which one would expect from a group of six senators from each side of this chamber, one might miss the cumulative impact of its moderate words, chapter after chapter. But the cumulative message is clear. There is in this report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources a very damaging indictment of government in Australia-of national government, for its passivity and its reaction policy when confronted with the development plans of those who wish to use our natural resources, and of State governments for their competitive bidding, one against another, to ensure the presence of one or more stages of the aluminium industry within their borders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee is strongly of the view that the scope and the pace of development of the aluminium industry ought to be harnessed in order to secure social goals and national strategies. I do not say that the scope and pace of development should be unduly supervised or directed, but at least it should be harnessed in a way which achieves social goals. We found, to our great regret, that there was a lack of policy and competence at the national level and that left a vacuum which was filled by the States competitively bidding against one another in order to form alliances with the great project developers moving into Australia. It would not be too much to say that the Committee members were shocked at the lack of political will and competence displayed at the level of national bureaucracy. I lost faith in the national bureaucracy when the Committe had before it representatives of the Department of National Development and Energy. When Mr Monaghan gave evidence to the Committee I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What formal request has the Department made, for example to the State Government of New South Wales or its Electricity Commission or any State government where relevant, to obtain the tariffs which you say are regarded by them as confidential?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Monaghan replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier arrangements for obtaining information which is not regarded as confidential by the authorities. We have not made a formal demand on the authorities for information which they consider to be confidential-</PARA>
<PARA>This is a reference to the electricity tariffs-</PARA>
<PARA>because we have not felt that we have the power to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a difference, is there not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Monaghan-I suppose there is. We still have felt that we are not empowered to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, at the very highest level of bureaucracy within the national government-no doubt correctly interpreting the lack of political will within the Ministry-we find that there has been no attempt by the national government even to seek by request, let alone demand, from State governments or electricity commissions the electricity tariffs being charged to the consumers of electricity in, in this instance, the aluminium industry. That was one instance that made a big impact on my understanding of the role of national government in this regard. But, of course, one can generalise and say that that was only a sample of what the Committee was confronted with. On page 7 of the report, we say:</PARA>
<PARA> In the rush to promote investment and to attract development to particular States there has been a tendency to treat these projects as ends in themselves. Competitive bidding between various States may mean that the Australian community as a whole, and even the individual States concerned, will not get full benefit from the exploitation of resouces. In these circumstaneces it is of crucial importance that the national government has a clear policy on the pace, timing and cost of development. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee looked in vain for such a policy. On page 10 the Committee concludes the preliminary part of its report by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned at the overall lack of clear policy on development at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA>We provide chapter after chapter of evidence for that concern. Given the short amount of time that is available to me I will select two or three issues from each of those chapters and comment on them. This will necessarily be somewhat subjective but I hope that it will not be found to be in any way misplacing or distorting the report. In dealing with energy I note particularly that the Committee rejected the primary submission made by Treasury that coal into electricity generating facilities to service the aluminium smelters and, indeed, other major industrial projects, ought to be provided at an export parity price. We say that it is very important for Australia's development and for the creation of wealth within the Australian economy and community that all factors of production be brought into play. It is very important, for example, that coal and bauxite should not be exported separately overseas. It is much better for them to be brought into co-ordination for refining into alumina and then smelting into aluminium. I wish to give some figures to show why that is so important to the generation of wealth within the Australian economy. On page 5, in relation to the Tomago Aluminium smelter, the Committee notes:</PARA>
<PARA> The annual export income of that smelter is expected to be $330m at 1980 prices. This is 2.7 times the income which would be produced by exporting equivalent quantities of coal and alumina and more than 7 times the export value of equivalent quantities of bauxite and coal. </PARA>
<PARA>For those reasons we think that, in order to get that sevenfold increase in value for the Australian economy, it is very important that our coal resources-those great energy resources-be used in order to convert the bauxite to alumina and then to aluminium. Having said that, we make it very clear in our report that tariffs charged by electricity commissions to the smelters ought to cover the full costs of production and of transport of that energy to the smelter and include a very realistic rate of return to the generating authority appropriate to its status as a public authority. Whereas I think we found that some commissions were looking for a return of only about 3 per cent on the public capital that is tied up in these generating facilities, we say that a figure approaching 7 per cent would be much more realistic. In fact, we go further. In what I think is a very interesting comment in the report we say that perhaps some of these projects ought to look to providing electricity generating facilities themselves, whilst acknowledging that even the biggest smelters may not justify the creation of a generating plant just to service a particular smelter. Certainly, this would bring home to the manufacturers of aluminium or to those implementing any other major projects of that type the proper cost involved in producing aluminium. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to taxation. I think the most interesting point the Committee makes in that respect is a point it has made in previous reports. At the end of the section headed 'Commonwealth Taxation' at page 28 the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that any review of the current taxation applying to resources based industries should include consideration of the use of a resource rent tax or other variable tax on profit. Where an industry's profitability provides a return on its investment significantly greater than that necessary to call forth the investment in the first place then there are valid reasons for considering a higher rate of tax on that 'excess' return on investment. This is particularly the case where, in the provision of services such as electricity to industry, there is some justification for believing that the full value of the resources used to provide that service are not being recovered from the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is most important that this Senate Committee has renewed that plea for the national government to look once again at the possibility of levying a resource rent tax. The fact is that Mr Stone, in a suitably qualified answer, said that he thought there might be an area where it could properly be considered. One finds it intolerable to continue reading, for example, that the Northern Territory Government is considering levying a profits-related royalty of some 35 per cent on a pre-tax net profit on various projects getting under way in the Northern Territory. I know that that proposition has been put on the back burner for a while. But it was reported only last Thursday in the Age that the Western Australian Government has established by agreement with the Ashton joint venturers a tax regime which will allow that Government to levy a 22 1/2 per cent profits related tax once profits reach a trigger level of $20m per annum. That is a resources rent tax. It is a tax on profits from these highly profitable industries which are using our great natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that insofar as the national Government hesitates, holds back and refuses to impose such a tax in order to capture the benefit of these projects for all Australians, the State and Territory governments will move in to fill the gap and will lock in the benefits and revenues being generated by these projects for themselves. May I say-the Committee found this to be so-that the unions will also move in and take some of the high profitability for those directly employed in or contracting to these great projects. We say that the Federal Government has a very real role in this field and should reconsider the question of national resources rent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of ownership, I think it is very important to note that the Committee-I do not know whether this is the first time that a Senate committee has said this-has pointed out on page 32 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign ownership, particularly where the Australian branch is only part of a highly mobile transnational operation, carries with it a number of risks. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the view of a Senate committee which was composed of members from both sides of the chamber. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> First among these is that corporate interest in the exploitation and processing of resources does not necessarily coincide with national interest. The pace at which an industry may wish to develop a resource or to expand (or contract) its manufacturing capacity will often not coincide with national interest. That is the view of a Senate committee. I think it is most significant that we have said it in the context of this industry. This industry, with its international aspect is, I believe, good for Australia. It is necessary that great international operators within the aluminium industry come to Australia mainly to give us access to markets. But having said that, the Committee is firmly of the view that Australia's participation is sensible as a means of attempting to ensure arms length pricing for bauxite and alumina so that taxation strategies can be properly pursued by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not so concerned about Australia's participation in sharing the profits from these projects. Dividends form only a very small part of the wealth that is generated within the community by such activities. I state as a personal aside that I know Senator Watson disagrees with me on that. But the Committee as a whole is concerned that the Government should bring into harmony its Australian participation guidelines in relation to the mining and manufacturing sectors. In respect of mining, a 50 per cent target is set for Australian participation in these great projects whereas for the manufacturing sector-and aluminium smelting is regarded as manufacturing-Australian participation is not required if the overseas project developer can demonstrate that there will be significant economic benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are saying is that the distinction between the manufacturing and the mining sectors for the purposes of the guidelines on Australian participation in these industries is extremely artificial because what we are talking about is the control, the disposal and the depletion of Australian natural resources, the provision of infrastructure, the bringing into play of all the factors of production, including employment, of course. We think the distinction between the manufacturing and mining sectors in this regard is entirely artificial. </PARA>
<PARA> As to employment, I think the main significant role of this Committee lies in its final scotching of the use of multipliers as a means of assessing the value to the Australian people of these types of projects or perhaps of any project. We do so on the basis that in their formulation one has a difficulty; there is also a difficulty on the part of commentators to draw socially useful conclusions from any multipliers that one might find to be valid. A variety of multipliers were presented to us. They were in a range which demonstrated that the flow on of jobs from the very small base of jobs actually involved in these industries is something that just cannot be properly gauged. One might also ask whether, in fact, any jobs will be created in the economy by these projects. I emphasise, to Senator Messner's amazement, the word 'created' because a lot of these jobs are simple transfers. This is most obvious in the construction stage where workers merely move from one construction site to another. There is not a creation of jobs; there is a continuity of jobs for several hundreds or thousands of construction workers moving from site to site. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the worries we had was that even in the production stage of these great projects the aluminium industry will be calling on persons already employed in the work force and taking them away from certain jobs with higher offers of wages thereby perhaps causing a breakdown in other areas of the economy presently using the skills of those attracted to these industries. There is not much evidence for even a direct creation of jobs within the economy and there is very little evidence that the multipliers sometimes used can be justified. What leads the Committee to welcome this industry within various regions and States within Australia is that the wealth generated is substantial. That wealth flows out into the economy as a whole and creates jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us stop talking about direct job creation and let us stop talking about multipliers; let us start talking about the really beneficial impact of the presence of these industries within Australia as is demonstrated on page 5 of our report. We looked at the operations by Alcoa of Australia in 1980 and found that it made the following payments within Australia: Taxes and royalties, $100m; dividends, $23m; interest and other expenses, $7m; and materials, wages and services, $566m. That is where the benefit to Australia lies, and that is what ought to be emphasised rather than the illusory multipliers that are sometimes tossed around. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has some very interesting points to make about industrial infrastructure which Senator Thomas adequately dealt with. Social infrastructure is also vitally important. It was to the great regret of the Committee that at the very time when we were engaged in this inquiry the razor gang came down with its report and recommended-I believe the Government followed the recommendation-the abolition of the various regional assistance schemes established by the Commonwealth Government. For example, both in the Hunter Valley and Gladstone regions we believed that there was a strong case for implementing those regional development policies of the national government, particularly in view of the Commonwealth's enthusiastic promotion of the various industries contributing to the social problems being faced by those regions. I am speaking here of the Commonwealth's positive regional adjustment policies which include a range of schemes. We, as a Committee, recommend that the Commonwealth Government undo that razor gang recommendation and that the Commonwealth Government should, once again, undertake schemes and policies which help to allay some of the social disruption and disintegration which can occur as these great projects come into already settled communities.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we dealt with the matter of the environment. I will say, as briefly as I am able, that the Senate Committee was totally opposed to the use by West Australian conservation interests of the courts of a foreign nation in order to pursue their particular protests at the degradation, as they see it, of the Darling Ranges by the bauxite mining activities either undertaken or proposed. The Committee is very conscious of the fact that those conservationists felt they had to go outside the Australian jurisdiction because the legal and political processes within Australia are inadequate. Therefore, the Committee recommends very strongly that, when the Law Reform Commission brings down its report on locus standi, as soon as possible, as a matter of urgency, steps to be taken to liberalise the access of conservation groups to the courts so that they can, at least within the legal jurisdiction of this country, bring their point of view to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the political processes of this country, we found that projects were going ahead, particularly in the Hunter Valley and in the Darling Ranges, where some of the facts have not been sufficiently established, including the effect of fluoride emassions on vines and the salinity problems in the Perth water supply, and, worse still, some of the environmental impact undertakings given by these project developers are not shown to be capable of realisation. I refer particularly to the Darling Ranges where one found from the Worsley joint venturers statements of pious hope that they can achieve certain objects; but the Commonwealth Department itself, in its assessment of the project developers report on the matter, says that it doubts whether those hopes can be realised. We recommend that those Commonwealth department reports be published in respect of all these developments and that the Commonwealth refuses to take the passive and secondary role to State environmental authorities which it is presently taking. There is a clear need for an independent national assessment of the environmental impact of these various projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes overall that the national Government has totally abdicated its proper and necessary role to harness the pace and the scope of the development of these particular industries within Australia in order to achieve desirable overall national social goals. The national Government has abdicated in favour of an alliance between State governments and these project developers. We believe that that alliance cannot secure overall national goals. For that reason, we hope that this report will be of benefit to the Australian community and will alert the national Government to its responsibilities. We will look forward to its response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As is obvious from the speech of the Chairman of the Committee, Senate Tate's learned speech and the concern of Senator Watson and Senator McLaren, this is a report of considerable importance, particularly to Tasmania and Queensland. Yesterday, on 24 November, we were greeted with two reports in the newspapers, one in the Australian Financial Review and the other in the Canberra Times, not only releasing the gist of what was in the report but also containing comments on it by the Chairman of the Committee and another Government member of the Committee. In the past when the pre-release, or leaking, of reports has occurred the person responsible-I note that one of them is present now-or at least inadvertently responsible for the release, has apologised to the Senate for what is legally, one would suspect, a breach of privilege.

<PARA> Reports such as this are reports to the Senate. As such they should not be released until they are reported to the Senate. They should not be released until they are reported to the Senate.

In this case the gist of the report was released. Members of the Committee from one side of the House took it upon themselves to comment in the Press on what was in the report. One could, I suppose, refer this case to the Committee of Privileges. I have no intention of doing so. But if this procedure continues-it is not the first time it has happened-people on either side of the House will feel under no obligation to recognise the privilege of a report or the conventions of this place. I hope that the early release of Senate reports does not happen again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. I was one of the Government senators mentioned in the newspaper reports referred to by Senator Grimes. I completely reject the accusation, certainly on my part, about leaking parts of the report. I shall indicate the sequence of events. I was approached by a media person who said that he wished to flag the release of the report. I made two responses to him. Firstly I said I believed this report was one of the most significant to reach the Senate. I did not elaborate on that; it was a firm statement of fact. I then stated as a second point that significant events had occurred since the conclusion of the hearings for that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of those significant events was that aluminium prices on the London metal exchange had reached a low. I said that this must have some sort of bearing on the outcome of the report. That was the extent of the statements that I made. I believe that neither of those statements reflected in any way the content of that report. Therefore, I must reject any imputation that I was involved in leaking details of the report. I am proud to have been a member of that Committee. It took a lot of time but, I believe, came out with some fairly momentous decisions. As such, I believe that we should acknowledge the fact that it is an important report but the contents of the article could not be attributable in any way to the two statements that I made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree to that procedure being followed, Mr President. The Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 is a Bill which corrects a mistake made in the original Social Services Amendment Bill 1981 which came into this chamber a couple of weeks ago. It corrects a difficulty in the payment of double orphans pensions to people who care for refugee children. It is a sensible amendment and we do not oppose it. The Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 is a different matter. The aims of this Bill are to refuse payment of unemployment benefit and associated children's allowances to the spouses, in most cases the wives, of those trade unionists who are involved in industrial action or who, indirectly, have been stood down as a result of industrial action by their union, even though it be interstate or hundreds of miles away, although in every other way these spouses qualify in their own right for benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Its second aim is to refuse payments of unemployment benefits to the wives of those who fail the work test-those who, in the eyes of the Government, voluntarily and without good reason give up their jobs or are dismissed for misconduct, even though their spouses qualify in their own right for benefits. It also aims to refuse special benefit to all those groups unless they are in what the Government defines as extreme hardship. This legislation is wrong in principle and discriminatory in action. It is a wrong use of the Social Services Act in this country in that it attempts to use this Act to prevent or shorten industrial action by depriving innocent people of benefits they would otherwise have a right to. The Bill attempts to deprive of any assistance the utterly innocent wives and children of those whom the Government disapproves of and as such it is abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will not achieve its stated intention of preventing unionists from taking industrial action, nor will it reduce the numbers who are affected by the Government's increasingly harsh regulations for the unemployed. So, it is a futile exercise. The Bill has no measurable effect on the Budget. No attempt has been made to quantify the expenditure likely to be saved, and it is not justified on any economic ground. The Bill is in fact an expression of the Government's prejudice against trade unionists and those it sees as voluntarily unemployed. It extends this prejudice to action against their wives and children. We oppose this Bill, as we opposed such clauses on a previous occasion when they were introduced in the original Social Services Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal, first of all, with those clauses of the Bill which affect the spouses of unionists involved in or affected by industrial disputes. It is worth recalling one of the most far reaching strikes in the past five years-the Victorian power dispute between 27 September and 19 October 1977, the La Trobe Valley dispute. At that time the Government had not passed the infamous amendments classifying as a striker anyone stood down who belonged to a union involved in an industrial dispute, whether he approved, disapproved or even had no knowledge of the strike or dispute in question. When that strike occurred a Commonwealth Government spokesman estimated that 500,000 people had been stood down though fewer than 60,000 had registered for unemployment benefits, 3,000 of them in other States. At that time the Government also dithered for some days while entertaining the suggestion that the stood-down workers as well as the strikers would be refused unemployment benefits. This proposed action was the source of much speculation in the Press and in this Parliament. It is interesting to look again at the opposition then to what was a possible policy change. The Victorian State Minister for Social Welfare, Mr Dixon, a member of the Liberal Party, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It's stupid to use unemployment benefits as a possible lever in an industrial dispute and such a move would be ill-advised and ill-considered. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dixon also warned of the possibility of family breakdowns if benefits were not paid. The Age reported that Mr Peter Falconer, then chairman of the Government's back bench industrial relations committee, had urged the Government to reconsider such proposals because they would affect a large number of rank and file members who would find their benefits cut. The same report stated that the present member for Boothby, then Senator Steele Hall, had said that the Government was making the innocent do its dirty work for it and that the proposal was unjust. These remarks made by three Liberal members of parliament four years ago are as valid now about this legislation as they were then and they represent part of the Opposition's case against this confrontationist legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth while quoting from some editorial comment on the same Government proposal from newspapers not noted for being in sympathy with workers in industrial disputes. The Melbourne Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it would be outrageous to deny sustenance to stood-down unionists and their families not involved in the dispute. The Government should take care that no substance exists for such stories in future. </PARA>
<PARA>The Age said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment benefits should be regarded as a right for people jobless through no fault of their own. They are not a privilege and they most certainly are not a plaything for politicians. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Canberra Times called it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a threat to the right of freedom of opinion, a denial of justice to taxpayers, and a perversion of the conventional definition of what constitutes unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Bill the Government goes much further than it proposed to then and penalises more innocent and powerless people-the wives and children of those involved. How much more valid now is the criticism which was made at that time? The Government, in a disgraceful and dishonest manner, has in both the second reading speech and in the explanatory notes referred only to the application of this renewed Bill to the spouses of 'strikers'-as the Government calls them-or of 'persons involved in industrial action'. There is no indication from the Government that it includes as strikers people who may have been opposed to the dispute, as were the Geelong Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd workers who voted against joining the Broadmeadow Ford workers on strike, but who were stood down just the same. Likewise, it includes as strikers people in a union whose counterpart branch in another State has closed down the works, resulting in their being stood down because there is a shortage of essential parts. I feel sure that some unionists do not even know why they are so penalised when they are stood down through no actions of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has perverted the definition of 'striker'. In this legislation and particularly in the speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) the Government is trying to whip up an emotional climate of hostility to the union movement. This legislation, which could impoverish families, not because the wives are married to strikers but because they are married to trade unionists and they are in single income families, is unjust. The Minister is dishonest in pretending that the Bill will affect only strikers' wives. But he will not admit that dishonesty because it would affect the hysterical rhetoric, for that rhetoric, combined with the attempted intimidation of the trade union movement, forms the regrettable objectives of Senator Chaney and his colleagues on this issue. The Government pays lip service to the right of trade unions to exist and the right of trade unionists to take action in the interests of their members-a right which distinguishes free countries from totalitarian countries. The Government praises the development of an independent trade union movement in Poland but discriminates against our own. The Government's action in putting the wives and families of unionists in the firing line surely contradicts any commitment to a free trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should look at the facts of industrial disputes in Australia. The most recent statistical information I have is from an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released last August which refers to 1980. In that year 65 per cent of all industrial disputes lasted two days or less, involving 79 per cent of all the workers in industrial disputes-that is, only 21 per cent of strikers were involved in disputes lasting longer than two days. Only 8.9 per cent of all strikers were involved in disputes that lasted 10 days or longer. It is worth remembering that unemployment benefits are payable only after a seven day waiting period. The major causes of disputes were directly attributable to management. In 39.7 per cent of the disputes managerial policy was given as the prime cause and in 19.6 per cent of the disputes physical working conditions were given as the cause. Only 21.5 per cent of the disputes were about wages. These facts make nonsense of the Minister's statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . trade unions can choose to strike, knowing that through the operations of the social security system, their members can be legally insulated from the financial effects of their action. </PARA>
<PARA>This is compounded further by the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases where the wives of strikers, who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the workforce themselves, have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. </PARA>
<PARA>The figures show that the cases obviously have not been numerous. There has been no attempt by the Minister in his second reading speech to quantify this statement about numerous cases because to quantify it would be to contradict it. The statement is an expression of prejudice. It is not an expression of fact. I draw attention to another misleading section of Senator Chaney's speech and I quote a paragraph which demonstrates his contempt for Australian wage earners. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless frivolously or maliciously entered into, the object of a strike is to obtain, by the exercise of economic pressure against the employer, a benefit for those who take such action. As a result, the benefit sought is itself economic, such as increased pay, a shorter working week, or special allowances. Not infrequently, strikes are settled on a basis that effectively compensates those who have gone on strike for pay lost during the duration of the strike. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister stated as fact that workers taking industrial action for reasons other than to increase wages are motivated by malice, and frivolity. I draw to his attention the figures that I have just cited. The major cause of dispute was found by the ABS survey to be managerial policy. Physical conditions were stated to be the important factor in some 20 per cent of cases. Almost 60 per cent of cases were directly attributed to management and physical conditions; not to malice, frivolity or even economic gain. On the economic side, I suppose the 5.3 per cent of disputes involving hours of work, pensions, leave and compensation could be added to the 21.5 per cent of stoppages involving wages. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not necessarily share Senator Chaney's view that the economic factors behind these disputes resulted in great gain. Many would be desperate attempts to stop the erosion of wages and salaries which has occurred as a result of the Government's deliberate attempt to shift the economic burden to low income groups. Only a certain percentage of stoppages would have been successful and only a proportion of those would have financially compensated the workers for the pay lost during the strike. I believe Senator Chaney is making totally unwarranted assumptions about the purposes of industrial disputes, about the incidence and success of industrial disputes and about the economic effects of those disputes on strikers' families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also referred to trade union members being largely insulated from the financial effects of their actions and in doing so tried not only to make a distinction between strikers and taxpayers but also to identify them as people with opposing interests. I will deal now with this attempt to set strikers and taxpayers at odds. Almost every person in the work force is a taxpayer. Certainly all full time workers pay tax on a pay-as-you-earn basis which does not lend itself to the tricks and devices of some of our wealthier citizens, who pay little tax but who are the most self-righteous in condemning unemployed people, welfare costs and workers. Taxes from wage and salary earners pay all Government services and subsidies. Why should the community pick up the bill for the support of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assistance to primary and secondary industry yet not, as Senator Chaney wants it, for the family of a worker stood down as the result of a dispute when that family has no other means of support?</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of paying spouses of workers on strike or stood down is not even a significant part of the welfare bill, let alone of Government outlays. Only 111,000 people last year were involved in strikes lasting longer than five days and only 54,000 in strikes lasting longer than 10 days. Unemployment benefit is not paid for the first seven days after application; therefore, only between 60,000 and 70,000 workers were affected. The ABS survey does not give a breakdown as to how many were married or had dependants. However, we know that just over one-third of the work force is unmarried so we may suppose that perhaps 45,000 married workers last year were involved in industrial disputes at a time when their spouses might have been eligible for unemployment benefits. Of those 45,000 unionists with families, probably half have working spouses and would be ineligible for unemployment benefits on income grounds. Where a person from a two income family goes on strike or is stood down, that family goes from being a two-income to a one-income family over that period. The family is obviously in temporary trouble but is in no way a charge on the taxpayers. What happens to the one-income family is the point at issue. It is against the one-income family that this legislation is specifically aimed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have demonstrated, I believe, not unfairly, probably no more than 20,000 such families each year could apply for the unemployment benefit or the special benefit for basic food and shelter for one or two days, or at the most for a few weeks. Experience shows that, if a strike looks as though it will be prolonged, the breadwinner goes out and seeks temporary or part time work. The breadwinner is then not entitled to unemployment benefit; neither is his spouse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was speaking of how the provisions of this Bill relating to industrial disputes are aimed particularly at single income families, at the innocent wives and children of those who are involved in a dispute and at those who are indirectly affected by a dispute of which they have no knowledge and in fact may oppose and which may be taking place many hundreds of kilometres away in another State. It takes away the rights of a group of women who, under our legislation at the moment, qualify under strict rules for unemployment benefits. I pointed out that these people are not insulated, as Senator Chaney has suggested, from the effects of industrial disputes by the social services legislation as it exists now. This legislation is also aimed at and will fall heavily upon another group, namely, the group of low income families involved in industrial disputes. It will fall heavily on the $200-a-week families with three children such as those who were involved in the recent Broadmeadows strike. Such families are already $8 a week below the Henderson poverty line. They are often in debt and often are struggling to survive. It is under these very conditions, of course, that we get industrial disputes frequently.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are never out of debt, as Senator Chipp says. The $200-a-week family with three children will have its income reduced by $100 a week under the present legislation. That family can in no way be considered to be insulated from the effects of that dispute by the social services provisions. The Uniting Church Welfare Agency, CARE, which operates in the Broadmeadows area, has paid out $6,000 to families affected by the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd strike and calculates that the amount would have been three times that figure if social services had not been available. Even then, that voluntary agency does not reach all affected families. Some do not know that such agencies exist and some are too proud to apply for relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Families under these conditions are under strain already. They will be placed under even more strain by this legislation. Senator Chaney referred in his speech to the absurdity that benefits should be paid to strikers or their families and that they should be paid by the community at large. I suggest that he read the Victorian Council of Social Service report 'Too little too late' on the Victorian power dispute of 1977. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> Who is or should be responsible for ensuring some basic level of income maintenance for people who, through no fault of their own, are left without income. During the strike this responsibility was borne, by default, by the relief organisations who were not geared to it either financially or administratively. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who were indirectly involved at the time will remember that the Salvation Army had to close its doors and the disputes and scuffles that broke out outside the Salvation Army office in Clayton, a Melbourne suburb, when up to 500 men and women lined up for very basic assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This section of the Bill is an attack on trade unionists and their families. It is an attack on low income married people with children and on the single income families. These are the least insulated from the problems of our economic system, and for that reason I believe this section should be rejected by the Senate. I am not one of those who believe that unjustified industrial disputes do not sometimes occur. I am not one of those who say that all strikes are justified and that the prolongation of strikes is always justified. However, I am certainly not one of those who suggest that the way to overcome this problem is to use the social services legislation in this community instead of sensible and good industrial relations and instead of having trade union reform which will reduce this sort of dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. Of course we do not hit at the innocent people, the wives and children who are involved. In fact, this sort of legislation will not reduce that militancy; it is likely to make it worse. It is likely to make worse the distinctions between them and us, as seen by more militant unionists, and in fact exacerbate the industrial situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to that section of the Bill which excludes from benefits those people whose spouses have failed the work test, who are deemed to be voluntarily unemployed, or who are deemed to have lost work through misconduct. Senator Chaney and his colleagues have a firm and final prejudice in respect of the people involved in this section of the legislation. In the final sentence of his second reading speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill prevents them from manipulating the social security system to shift the consequence of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA>This succinct sentence sums up all the prejudices of the conservatives in this Government about the unemployed. Senator Chaney is talking about married umemployed people, many of whom have children. In particular, he is talking about a small group of wives of unemployed persons who have fallen foul of the Department of Social Security. He is painting them as cold-blooded manipulators of the system. The statement demonstrates more the blind prejudice of the Government. I suggest that the real manipulators in our community are the tax evaders, those who rort the subsidy and incentive systems, not the disadvantaged who are attacked in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The married unemployed have very little opportunity to manipulate any aspect of their environment. They live below the poverty line. They suffer from the continual changes in government instructions to treat them more and more roughly, a policy which, for the Government, has two benefits; appearing to cut down the number of unemployed and then cutting down on the unemployment benefit payout. The Government's complaint in this case is that where a person is married and unemployed and has a suspension of between six weeks and 12 weeks without any payment, the spouse has been known to apply for unemployment benefit on his or her account with additional benefit if there are children. The Government's proposal is to stop this. I remind the Senate that, since 1979, the suspension of payment is mandatory on social security officers for alleged offences such as failing the work test, being dismissed for improper conduct, or being voluntarily unemployed. The financial penalties for these alleged breaches of the law are considerable-between $300 and $600 for a single person and between $600 and $1,200 for a family unemployed with dependants. These penalties are applied arbitrarily and, in fact, are heavier than most fines applied by magistrates or judges for serious offences such as drink-driving. These penalties are to be added to by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other difficulties, as I pointed out earlier when this legislation was before the Senate. There are difficulties in interpretation of the regulations. A research paper produced by the Minister's Department in June of this year entitled 'Work Test Failure-A Sample Survey of Terminations of Unemployment Benefit' had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore desirable that administrative information systems should be designed or redesigned so as to enable more to be known of who is affected by policies and programs and what the effects are . . . we cannot say with confidence even how many work-test terminations occur. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister gets his way on this legislation we know that families will be very seriously affected. We know that the basis on which this legislation has been put forward is very vague and that there is insufficient information-a fact admitted by the Department itself. All the evidence from the Henderson report, from voluntary agencies, and now from the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat on the measurement of poverty, has named the unemployed 'amongst the poorest'. They have no reserves upon which to live. They already form, with single parent families, the most frequent attenders at agencies which dispense emergency relief. But this is not enough. The Government wants to add to their numbers. But it will not even add many to their numbers. The work test failure accounts for 1.6 per cent of the terminations of unemployment benefit. This is in no way a major problem to the Government, economically or socially. Each month there are 1,000 postponements of benefits of which 300 are married beneficiaries. This is a very small group and will continue to be a very small group. </PARA>
<PARA> On this subject many of those women and children who will be affected by this section of the legislation are married to persons who have psychological problems, drinking problems which may not be obvious, or emotional problems which put them in a situation where they are likely to be considered out of work through misconduct or voluntary action when they are seen by officers of the Department of Social Security-the sort of person who may abuse the foreman or boss in anger or who throws in his job on the spur of the moment in times of stress. Are we, as a Senate and as a Parliament, seriously suggesting that a wife and her children should suffer through the deprivation of being married to such a person? Are we saying to her that she should leave him to get social security benefits and thus worsen the situation for him and in many cases for her and her children? The Government has given no thought to the complex interpersonal relations which lie behind this group of the unemployed. To satisfy crude prejudices of the Government and its supporters, the Government will throw these people on the scrap heap. We believe very sincerely that the Government should think again about this matter and this is a further reason why we will oppose this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that the Bill provides, in cases of extreme hardship that the special benefit should be made available is, we believe, the final difficulty which the Government is going to put in the way of these people. Special benefit is not a large benefit; it is difficult to apply for and it is hedged about by definitions of hardship and need which are the strictest in our social security legislation. The inevitable result of this will be to add to the administrative difficulties of those who work in social security offices and add to the harassment that these people frequently feel. The whole basis of this legislation is the belief by the Government that the legislation can be massively represented by it to the people of this community as preventing the Government and the taxpayer from supporting people who do not deserve to be supported. The fact that the emphasis in the speech of the Minister for Social Security in this place, the speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) when the Bill went through another place and the frequent references of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on television is on the wives of strikers and no reference is made to the wives of those indirectly involved in industrial action-those stood down by industrial action with which they have no part-or those who are voluntarily unemployed demonstrates to us that what the Government is about is a massive misrepresentation for political purposes with very little concern being shown for the small groups of people who will be affected very badly and very severely by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has been condemned not only by the Opposition but also by all voluntary agencies in the community which know that in times of industrial dispute they will suffer the fate that they suffered during the Latrobe Valley power strike a few years ago. Voluntary agencies will bear the burden of the Government's actions and they will be inadequately supported for taking over the Government's role in that situation. I repeat, that if the Government wants proper industrial relations in this community it should look at its own industrial relations policy and at trade union reform and not use a piece of legislation-the Social Services Act-which has been designed to help those who are in need through no fault of their own. Until the Government does that, we will oppose this discriminatory and divisive legislation. We will continue to oppose it because it has no place on the legislative books in this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to Senator Grimes, I am convinced more than ever that the real argument is about who carries responsibility ulitmately for union decisions. The effect on wives and children rests with the striker. Most husbands, I believe, would take grave exception to the proposition that anyone else should be responsible for their wives and children. The bottom line of argument in this debate is whether trade unions or trade union members generally ought to be financially responsible for their actions or whether taxpayers should pay for the decisions and actions of the trade union movement. The question really is whether Australian taxpayers should pay the cost of not only industrial disruption, social disruption, loss of productivity, loss of wages, and the inevitable flow-on of costs and charges which follows strikes but also the wages of those who are party to the imposition which is cast upon the community. I say from the outset that I believe this legislation is eminently reasonable, eminently fair and eminently responsible. I have no hesitation in supporting it to the full. I believe this legislation will have wide appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that it will have wide appeal not only to the great majority of Australians but also to the great majority of the trade union movement. There are those amongst us who would seduce the community into the belief that government can and should provide for redemption of all sins and that the government should ultimately carry the responsibility for decisions which are made by the community. I believe that the great majority of the community, including trade union members, do not subscribe to that view. If this legislation is being opposed on the basis of some misguided compassion, perhaps we ought to direct our attention and concern to the people who are really unemployed; I refer to those who, for reasons quite beyond their control, are unable to secure jobs for themselves. Before we spread the jam a little more thinly, perhaps we ought to pause for a moment to reflect upon the statistics and the circumstances of those who are unemployed, who have dependants and who claim benefits not because their spouse has voluntarily gone on strike, in many cases to improve their wages and conditions, but simply because they just cannot find work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For a moment, we ought to put aside the strikers and concern ourselves with those unemployed married bread earners who receive one-third of the average minimum wage and those unemployed single people over the age of 18 who survive on 20 per cent of the minimum average wage. There are presently approximately 168,000 people under the age of 25 years registered for unemployment benefits. In May this year, of those receiving unemployment benefits, 24,000 had been seeking work for more than one month. Without going through the whole detail, I point out that 44,500 had been seeking work for over three months and 13,000 had been seeking work for more than 12 months. Of those in the older work force category, 134,500 of those receiving unemployment benefits are above the age of 25. Of those, 20,000 have been without work in excess of two years and something like 75,000 of all recipients of unemployment benefits have some sort of family responsibility by way of a spouse or by way of children. Surely these are the sorts of people to whom we ought to be directing our energy, concern and compassion. These are the people who ought to be provided with 100 per cent of the funds allocated for unemployment benefit. These are the people who genuinely are unable to attract work and are required to live on the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the strikers, 93.5 per cent of these people have no other source of income. These are the people who do not have access to strike funds. These are the people who cannot mitigate their taxation by having a couple of weeks off. These are the people who cannot go back to work after a strike and work overtime to make up for every single cent that they have lost. These are the people who cannot do sweetheart deals with unions and get backpay for the time they were out of work. It seems thoroughly immoral to me that these people have to forgo their only means of income to allow strikers the luxury of having added benefits by way of unemployment benefits while they are on strike. The Government's record in the last two years in terms of employment is very commendable. The level of employment has increased by 348,000 or 5.7 per cent in that period. In the last full year alone, another 115,800 full time occupations were created. It is a great credit to the Government that, given the financial circumstances in which it finds itself, still suffering from the effects of the past Labor Government, it has been able to achieve this. But, at this time, that is cold comfort to those who are still required to live on unemployment benefits. They require every single dollar that they can get. </PARA>
<PARA> A great many strikes that occur in this country are thoroughly unrelated to industrial matters, that is, matters relating to employer-employee conditions. Many of these strikes, during which the Opposition wants wives of strikers to be paid are, as I said, quite unrelated to wage demands, hours of work or working conditions. In fact, in 1980 alone, 93,000 workers were involved in strikes which were totally unrelated to the normal industrial relations negotiations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I certainly do, but not within that figure of 93,000. They are excluded by definition. The 93,000 includes unionism by definition. I am sure that Labor Party experts will know all about it. That figure includes strikes relating to other causes, including political strikes and sympathetic strikes for political causes. In addition, something like 400,000 working days and $22m in wages were lost through this category of strikes. Is anyone seriously suggesting that taxpayers should pay a striker because he decides to stay home because of some alleged political belief? Is anyone seriously suggesting, in this day and age, that a further burden should be placed upon the community to accommodate the irresponsible and delinquent actions and activities of some trade union members? I believe the great majority of the community do not support that proposition. Is it not enough that as a result of such actions $22m was lost in wages and millions of dollars more were lost in export earnings and productivity? Of course, there must be a point in time when accountability has to be accommodated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to the iron ore industry in Western Australia. It is an industry of enormous potential and, as has been demonstrated, it provides enormous wealth to the people of Australia and particularly to Western Australia. The iron ore industry in Western Australia employs 8,250 employees in the wages section-1.75 per cent of the total work force in Western Australia. In 1980 that 1.75 per cent of the Western Australian work force was responsible for 46 per cent of all man days lost in Western Australia. Between 1976 and 1981 strikes by that percentage of the work force accounted for something in excess of $35m in lost wages. In one strike $85m was lost to Australian taxpayers through loss of revenue. One of the great tragedies of those strikes is that 35 per cent of them are unrelated to employee-employer relationships. They fall within the category of unionism, political strikes or others. These are the strikes which fall within the category of the Opposition's ambition to have funds made available to the wives of the spouses who go on strike. Is it not enough to recognise that the average worker in the iron ore industry receives in excess of $21,000 a year for a 45-hour week? Invariably, when one company goes on strike, if it is a dispute of common interest, employees of other companies stay on and quite properly and quite reasonably provide the strikers with a strike fund. Of course, the question of finance will inevitably be a consideration as to whether the strike goes on in the first place. It will certainly have a very strong bearing on whether such a strike will have any importance in the first place, and on its duration. I do not believe that it is the most responsible allocation of our resources to compound that great loss by adding potentially millions of dollars more to the cost of industrial anarchy by asking the taxpayers to contribute. Besides the strikes to which I have referred, of course the record in Australia is not too bright. In 1980, 3.3 million man days and $152m in wages were lost due to strikes. One million employees in Australia were involved in strikes last year. Of course, millions of dollars more were lost in productivity and export earnings. In fact, the latest figure I could get shows that in 1979 $2 billion was lost to our economy by loss of productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument has been put that it is both unfair and improper to use the provisions of the Social Services Act to attack the trade union movement. I submit that that is a thoroughly misleading suggestion and that the truth of the matter is that existing conditions not only encourage strikes but also encourage longevity of strikes. Clearly, any unionists being asked to strike will carefully take into consideration the cost-benefit considerations. He will naturally weigh up what he will ultimately receive compared with what it is costing him. He will ask himself whether he can afford to go on strike and how long he can be on strike. These are very reasonable and very proper considerations and they are the same sorts of considerations that employers involve themselves in. The employer has to ask himself how long his company can afford to be without services, without wages and without labour. He has to weigh up what the long term effects will be upon his factory. I should have thought that for very many families the payment of unemployment benefit plus a tax free payment of $10 for each child courtesy of the Australian taxpayer would have a significant effect on how long a strike lasts or whether it commences at all. If the unionist happens to be a man working for a mining company in the north-west of Western Australia or in the northern part of Queensland he will in all likelihood be living in a fully air-conditioned brick veneer home at approximately $22 per week and he will get free power, free electricity and free water with modest charges for excesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. There is nothing wrong with that. Of course, as I have said, whenever there is a strike in one company in the Pilbara the employees of the other companies very wisely stay on the job and provide their fellow workers with strike relief. That is a fairly standard practice. It is a reasonable and proper course of action to take in respect of those on strike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the 1980 strike by Queensland coalminers over notional rents the Pilbara employees were in exactly the same situation. They could have been subject to the same taxation assessments. But they very wisely and very intelligently remained on the job and provided tens of thousands of dollars to those on strike in Queensland. I have considerable sympathy for that strike and for the arguments that were put forward by the strikers. But I think it goes to show and demonstrates that that sort of assistance, together with unemployment benefit, makes it possible for the strikes to be prolonged and it certainly enables the workers to be well equipped for a cold winter. I think under those circumstances, one can reasonably conclude that the Social Services Act, as presently constructed, provides a very real incentive not only for people to strike but also for people to stay on strike. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to subsidise one party to an industrial dispute, presumably we should subsidise the other. It ought to be remembered that the majority of strikes in Australia affect that category of business which might properly be called small business. Every time there is a stoppage relating to power, transport, communications and essential services it is the small employer, the man who employs perhaps three or four people, who goes bankrupt. There are countless cases year after year of small businesses which, in the interests of industrial relations, go to the wall and as a result further jobs are lost. What recourse has John Citizen, the employer? Is he able to seek government help and support? Is he able to go to his colleagues and ask them for some sort of subsistence, some sort of carry-over money? When he goes bankrupt he is not able to move on gaily to another position. His losses may well be his life savings. He is condemned to the category of those who are no longer able to raise credit or even write out a cheque. He is certainly not able to move on with gay abandon, leaving all that behind him, putting it down to experience and seeking new work. He may well lose his home, his car and his life savings. What is his redress? It is absolutely nothing. His reward will not be future increased benefits. His reward for short term loss is not long term gain-it is invariably failure and that failure will be absolute. I speak not of the small businessman who is directly involved in negotiations with a union. </PARA>

I speak not only of the small businessman who is a party to a dispute but also who is financially crippled as a result of a strike in which he has no vote, no say and no negotiating power. Then, of course, we have the small businessman whose only involvement in a dispute is the fact that he employs a category of worker who fits into one union and who, for reasons quite beyond his control and in some cases the union's control, is required to go on strike. What can the small businessman do about it? What is his recourse? He can do absolutely nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We talk of the great inequity of union members who find themselves unable to work because of decisions made by their colleagues or decisions made by the leaders of the union whom they freely and democratically elected. What is the result for the poor businessman? He steadily but inexorably goes bankrupt. A number of reports in the media have highlighted the attitude of the unions. In one report the unions are reported to have said that what happened in the case of Mainline 'could not have happened to a nicer pack of bastards'. I put it to honourable senators that these people have no course, no redress. Is it not fair to say what is good for one side is good for the other? Do we ladle out money for the employee and ladle out money for the employer, or do we suddenly plead justice for the worker and injustice for the employer?</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the situation may arise in which there is some direct conflict between the employer and the employee. Do we say it is proper for the employee to be given financial strength to arm him for the battle and walk away from the employer while the employer goes bankrupt, in part because ammunition is provided by taxation from the employer's earnings for the employee to beat him to death? To me it is an immoral ignominy that the employer's taxes are going towards his own destruction. </PARA>

I am simply not able to reply to any of the points he made for fear of being ruled by you, Mr President, as using unparliamentary language. It may come as a surprise to anybody listening to this debate, and it will certainly come as a surprise to anybody reading it, that in fact we are debating cognately two Social Services Amendment Bills, one of which is totally uncontentious but which is connected, with not some small irony, to one facet of the second Bill. The Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 is designed to correct a small anomaly in relation to refugee children. The second reading speech reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The existing legislation defines 'refugee child' in terms of a child granted refugee status by the Australian Government. There are, however, children who are admitted into Australia as refugees who do not have the formal status of refugee granted to them. The Government intends these children to fall within the class of children in respect of whom double orphans' pensions are payable.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anybody in this chamber feels that these children, innocent as they are of the problems that have befallen them, should not be helped in some way by the Australian Government and hence by the Australian taxpayer. The second Bill, the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981, is the result of the defeat in the Senate on 29 October of clauses 18 and 21 of the Social Services Amendment Bill. The second reading speech to that Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill now proposes that, for so long as a person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of involvement in industrial action; or unwillingness to undertake suitable work; or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain such work, that person will also be ineligible for unemployment benefit. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed because of their misconduct as a worker, because they have become voluntarily unemployed or because they have failed to accept an offer of suitable employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this approach, special benefit will also be withheld from persons not eligible for unemployment benefit in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support, their spouse may-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, may-</PARA>
<PARA>be eligible for special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of my speech in the debate on the original Bill on 29 October, having criticised the Government at some length for avoiding the real issue, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats intend to do whatever we can to prevent them-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, clauses 18 and 21-</PARA>
<PARA>from becoming nothing more nor less than instruments of welfare harassment in an industrial relations situation. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that in bringing forward those two clauses in a separate Bill the Government has gone beyond what it first appeared to be doing-using the welfare system as a sort of industrial stick-and intends to use this legislation as an extremely socially divisive measure. Before I go on to elaborate a little more on that matter I wish to make a couple of other points. To begin with, this legislation sets out only to end an already existing situation. As the second reading speech pointed out, for some years now it has been possible for the spouse of a person involved in industrial action to apply after one week for the single unemployment benefit and for an additional amount if there were children. The single unemployment benefit, I might add, is $58.10 a week. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . we are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action . . . What we are concerned with is how the cost of strike action is to be borne . . . we do not believe that Australian taxpayers should be asked to subsidise strike action through the social welfare system. Trade unions choosing to take such action make a free decision to strike . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it stands at the moment permits a situation where trade unions can choose to strike knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA>I took the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to task over that statement about a month ago. I argued that anybody who tries to live for any length of time on $58.10 a week, $69.70, or even $89.70 if a person has two children, will not be living in the lap of luxury; nor will such a person find himself largely insulated from the financial effects of his actions. The point that the Minister wanted to emphasise and, indeed, did emphasise, was that to strike is an exercise in freedom of choice, one for which frequently the community suffers. I am not stupid enough to put the thesis that the community is never in any way injured by strike action. It is frequently inconvenienced, sometimes for a number of days and even a number of weeks. It is also on occasions severely hurt by the action that is taken. I repeat the point that I made on 29 October. Simply because some unions are irresponsible and because some unionists are irresponsible, that is no reason for the Government to become as irresponsible, although in a different way. Simply because some people abuse the system, that is no justification for coming up with a system which abuses the people. As I said, the Government's argument that the taxpayers should not be forced to subsidise the wives and children of men on strike is an emotional one and the Government has been using it to good effect in the media in the last week or so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolute rubbish. The Government seems to have forgotten that before people can go on strike they have to have a job. If they have a job they will be paying taxes. Therefore, in some way, however small, they have contributed to the revenue for the unemployment benefit that their spouse may be entitled to, after the first week of a strike, at the single rate plus a child subsidy. Yesterday in answer to a question which I suspect was a Dorothy Dixer and if it were it was probably from Senator Walters, but my memory may be failing me on that-I am only going on the odds on that one.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It probably is. The Minister argued that views on a matter as sensitive as social welfare were not sufficient for the media or anybody else to play around with and that the facts were the only real criteria on which the public should be asked to make up their collective minds, particularly on something as emotional as in this case of some public servants misusing their working day. I suggest with respect that the dictum holds equally true in the case before us. As an earlier speaker pointed out-since I do not count Senator Crichton-Browne as an earlier speaker I suppose that leaves Senator Grimes-at no stage has it been shown empirically or anecdotically that under the present situation in which the spouse of a striker can after one week claim the single unemployment benefit the strike has gone on for longer than it would have if such a benefit were unavailable. No figures have been put before us to show how many people who apply for the unemployment benefit do so because they are married to a person who is on strike, although I understand-I may be wrong in this-that the Department of Social Security may have some figures on this, but certainly they are not readily available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, no figures have been put before us to show how many people have applied for the unemployment benefit because they are married to somebody involved in industrial action. Nor are we able to get hold of any figures to show how long that person on the unemployment benefit for that reason remained on the unemployment benefit. The Government has given us no figures on the average length of strikes in Australia either generally or industry by industry to justify its claims although the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that at least for 1980 in the vicinity of 5 per cent of strikes across all industries lasted for more than 10 days. Instead of facts or discussion we are simply presented with the view that the payment of $58.10 for the spouse of a striker will encourage that striker to prolong his or her participation in a strike. The ABS figures also indicate that the largest group of people who go out on strike do so for increased wages. It is hardly likely that they will prolong, for any length of time, a wage dispute which puts them into an even more invidious position. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the proponents of the view that unemployment benefits only serve to prolong strikes consider two points: The first is that, as far as some of the more militant unions are concerned, the question of choice for an individual as to whether he goes out on strike or how long he stays out is an academic matter. Choice, in fact, is non-existent in a lot of cases. The frequent photos of picket lines that we see in the newspapers and the accusations that we hear flung from one unionist to another about scab labour and other activities of some of the less reputable unions of a more or less violent nature are a clear indication of this. The second point is that regardless of whether or not the worker had a choice-this is the pertinent point-the wife and children of that person certainly had no say in the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no choice but to repeat what I said in an earlier debate on the original Bill; that hitting out at innocent victims, the children in particular, is both churlish and unchristian. Whatever the actions of the father may have been, it is unfair to visit their sins on the heads, much less the stomachs, of their children. As I say, this Bill may well have biblical overtones but it certainly does not have charitable ones. That is in direct contrast-and a rather ironic contrast, as I foreshadowed earlier-with the other Bill that we are debating cognately, which takes a particularly Christian and charitable view of the way children in an invidious position, such as refugee children are placed, should be treated by the Australian taxpayer and the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that I accept-I think we all accept-that some people will abuse a system. They will abuse any system. I stand by my earlier comment, too, that there is no reason, therefore, for concocting, at government level, a system which only reverses the situation. There is no reason, therefore, for reversing the stand that I took nearly a month ago when I said that I and the party are not prepared to see society divided on this matter merely because it is convenient for the Government, for some sort of electoral advantage in the long run; nor are we prepared to see social welfare being used as an industrial stick. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see only two reasons for the Government wanting to change the present system. Firstly, it is anticipating, in the very near future, that the increasing financial burdens falling on the average working person, because of high interest rates, high inflation and the spiralling cost of goods, will produce a rash of strikes which it will want to end relatively quickly-that is, in less than the 10 days which most strikes last-by applying some draconian economic sanctions. Secondly, I could adopt the more Machiavellian view; that at about the middle of next November, after the Government has brought down a fairly reasonable Budget in which the odd tax cut carrot has been handed out to the voter, it will somehow manage to engineer a strike in an area which will cause maximum inconvenience to the public. It will then take to the hustings, blaming the dreaded Australian Democrats and those rotten Labor people for depriving it of the use of some sort of heavy club with which to beat these people over the head. I suggest that if the Government does that it may very well be successful, human nature being what it is. However, it is a risk that I at least am prepared to take because an important principle is involved here; that is, that whatever one person in a family does, other members of the family, whether that person does it voluntarily or not-I still maintain that it is open to debate-should not be forced into penury, or worse, because of it. I can see no justification for this Bill, any more than I can see any justification for clauses 18 to 21 of the Bill that was defeated on 29 October. If it presents the Government with another one of its one to fifty Bills for double dissolution gun, well and good. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to that aspect of the Social Services Amendment Bill which deals with the spouses of unionists affected by industrial disputes. In the main, most of the spouses would be women. This legislation is part of the Government's war against the trade union movement. That war has now been extended to the wives and children of trade unionists. The proposed changes to the social services legislation will stop a wife receiving social service payments for herself and her children if her husband is on strike or is stood down as a result of his union being on strike elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is pretty obvious that that Government has a poor understanding of strikes and industrial relations in general. I think this lack of understanding was amply illustrated by Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution to the debate. My leader pointed out that, quite contrary to popular belief, about 25 per cent of disputes relate to wages, about 20 per cent relate to actual physical working conditions, and about 40 per cent stem from management policies and practices and victimisation of employees, for instance, retrenchments, short changing in wages, and so on. It is worth noting that of the total working hours lost to industry or to production only one-third can be attributed to industrial disputes and two-thirds occurs because of industrial accidents. One would assume that if the Government were genuinely concerned about loss of production and the welfare of people it would be exploring this badly neglected area of health, safety and welfare. But it is so obsessed, so hell bent on trying to thump the trade union movement, by fair means or foul, and it is usually by foul means, that it neglects this vast area of health, safety and welfare, an area that claims two-thirds of the total production hours lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I should like to make quite clear is that there are 165,000 members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. We are forever hearing complaints about the AMWSU being on strike, as though the entire 165,000 members of that union were on strike. If 1,000 members of the AMWSU were on strike it would equal three-fifths of one per cent of the total strength of that union. From the way people talk in this chamber, one would imagine that the whole union was out on strike on every occasion. Perhaps the Government wants the whole union to go on strike. Perhaps that is what it is aiming for. If the Government were really concerned about tradesmen and their welfare in this country, instead of trying to bring more tradesmen into the country it would have a look at the 1976 census. That census shows that 300,000 tradesmen in this country are not working at their trade. There is something very wrong when 300,000 tradesmen do not work at their trade and 39.4 per cent of apprentices fail to complete their apprenticeships. Why cannot the Government explore that area? Why does it not have a look at that area or at the areas of health, welfare and safety?</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to strikes, I recall an occasion when a drilling rig was being built near Kwinana by Transfield Pty Ltd. An area of ground was scooped out near the foreshore and the rig was built in the scooped out area. It was a good idea. It was intended that when the rig was completed channels would be cut and the rig would be floated out to sea. In order to build the rig, naturally there had to be electric cables running across the foreshore to the rig. These were necessary for the welding and drilling operations. Then the rainy season came on and many of those cables were submerged in water. So the men said: 'Look, we are not working in these conditions. We could be electrocuted. You do not know the condition of these cables.' The usual channels were pursued. The shop stewards approached management and asked it to do something about the problem. One day passed, two days passed. Nothing happened; so the men rang the office of the trade union. The union in turn tried to put pressure on the firm to do something about the situation, which was highly dangerous. Again, more time passed and nothing was done. The men went on strike. Can we blame them? Would we work in those conditions? The men cannot be blamed for going out on strike when their safety is at stake. They could have been electrocuted. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Government proposes to do to people who go on strike is beat them over the head with a big stick. It will do so not only to them, but also to their wives, to their children and to any other unionists who may have been affected by those who went on strike. Is that what this Government proposes to do? Is this how it handles industrial relations? It is an intimidatory tactic. The Government used these tactics in 1979 when it introduced the Social Services Amendment Bill. It was then that the Government refused unemployment benefit to trade unionists stood down as a result of an industrial dispute. It did not matter where or why a strike was held. A unionist was penalised when stood down as a result of an industrial dispute if he or she belonged to the union which was on strike. Many strikes occur over health, safety and welfare issues-a whole area completely neglected. </PARA>
<PARA> I have often heard honourable senators complaining about the unions. They have been doing it all day. It is a pity that Senator Crichton-Browne is not here because I am quite sure he does not know what half the strikes are about. However, through you, Mr President, I will ask any of the three remaining Government honourable senators in the chamber to tell me what are the wages of a fitter. What are the wages of a boilermaker? What are the wages of a toolmaker? They do not know. No doubt one of them could answer, but irrespective of what those wages are, the Government wants to keep them at the irreducible minimum. It does not matter why the men go out on strike. The fact is that they are out on strike. The reasons do not matter in the least. The Government has to find legislation in order to hold them down. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick often refers to Shakespeare. Let me quote my own bard. I will anglify the quotation slightly: 'The fear of hell is a hangman's whip to hold the wretch in order; but where you feel your honour grip, let that be your border.' I am quite sure that this Government is trying to push the trade union movement to the point where its honour will grip. It will not be a thousand men who will come out on strike. The Government may get 165,000 out on strike if it keeps on meddling. It has practically killed the arbitration system with its meddling. The Government is now trying to extend the same doctrine of collective responsibility. That is what it amounts to-collective responsibility. The unionist's wife and children are now to be held collectively responsible for whatever reason he is on strike or is stood down. Over the years the practice of collective responsibility has been constantly rejected by industrial courts throughout Australia. I will quote one such judgment-there are many of them; I have a whole swag-which was handed down from the Industrial Commission of New South Wales when the employers sought to apply the principle of collective responsibility. The Conciliation Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion the principle of collective responsibility as it has come to be enunciated . . . is inherently unreasonable. When stated as it is in the authorities, as a broad principle unrelated to the particular circumstances of any employment, industry or establishment, it extends to impose responsibility for lack of available work upon employees unconnected with the dispute who are ready and willing to work. </PARA>
<PARA>That judgment means that collective responsibility is inherently unreasonable and imposes responsibility on others. That is exactly what this legislation is aiming to do. Rather than give other examples of Industrial Commission judgments-there are plenty of them in which the commissioners have refuted the idea of collective responsibility-I will tell the Senate of a further frightening extension of the principle of collective responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Second World War Lidice in Czechoslovakia was the scene of a notorious German reprisal after the assassination of Heydrich, the Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. The partisans had assassinated Heydrich. The Germans alleged that the village had aided the men who killed Heydrich and, in consequence, on 10 June 1942 the male inhabitants, numbering 172, were shot; the women and children were either shot or sent to concentration camps. The village was systematically destroyed, the ground ploughed up and the name of Lidice erased from official records. This was collective responsibility at its worst. The very same principle applied by the Nazis in 1942 is being applied by this Government today. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the tactics of a government which is losing control, has lost the confidence of the electorate and has deep divisions within its own political ranks-I instance the Withers, the Peacocks and the so-called drys. These men no longer support the totalitarianism and facism that fuehrer Fraser has now adopted. The tactic of terror is the substitution of despotism for democracy and tyranny instead of leadership. In short, the thuggery of the German Third Reich is a replacement for parliamentary government when this collective responsibility is introduced. The thinking that has gone into this legislation is the thinking that destroyed Lidice. It attempts to turn wife against husband during a strike and to make the family collectively responsible as the Nazis made Lidice collectively responsible. If this legislation is passed this Government will have publicly advertised the fact that it now has one foot on the ladder of facism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 and the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981. I will confine my remarks to the latter Bill. I congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for the steps he has taken in this Bill-I think the steps are overdue-where wives of men who are on strike will not automatically be able to receive social security benefits. When the Minister was preparing this matter and the Bill was on the table of the chamber I spoke to him in regard to whether there would be some hardship clause. I am very happy to see that there is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Government is doing is placing the responsibility right where it should be. Members of trade unions may desire to go on strike for all sorts of reasons such as demarcation, political and so on, but the responsibility for the care of a man's wife and children is his. If he decides he is going to withdraw his service, in other words to go on strike, he has the responsibility to ensure that he can afford to keep his wife and children fed and clothed. If there is a genuine case of hardship where a person with a wife and children will not be able to pay the rent, electric light bills or buy food, the Government in its wisdom has allowed for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that any honourable senator has spoken about what the Minister has prepared and distributed. The Minister has given the example of a family with two children. He has listed liquid resources and unavoidable financial commitments as conditions where special benefits will be payable. If a family with two children has no income and no liquid assets it will get $100. If it has unavoidable financial commitments totalling $100 it will get $89.70 a week. So it goes to the point where if such a family has liquid assets valued at $200 and has unavoidable financial commitments totalling up to $100 it will not get anything. I do not think honourable senators can ask for anything fairer than that. </PARA>
<PARA> First and foremost, it is the responsibility of the breadwinner to ensure that he provides for his family. Let me make this quite clear: I have been a working man all my life. I have done every labouring job known to man. Thank God I have never been a member of the Australian Labor Party. Nonetheless, I know what it is to have to raise a family. I raised seven children on a labourer's pay. But I always made sure, because it was my responsibility to do so, that I was able to provide for my family. If a person goes on strike and on a continued strike, it is his responsibility to ensure that his family is not deprived by his doing so. However, today the militant section of the trade union movement-I am not condemning the whole trade union movement-calls strikes at the drop of a hat. Trade unions have funds also. </PARA>
<PARA> What must the person who is continuously working, paying his taxes and not doing foolish things like going on strike think when he sees that a man on strike can get anything up to $30 a week from the trade union movement's strike fund and his wife can get social service benefits? A man on strike has 30 bucks. He can go down to the hotel and spend the day drinking beer with his pals. He does not care if he does not go back to work for another two or three weeks because the Government, or his fellow Australians, will ensure that his wife and children have an income. He does not have to be concerned about that because he has 30 bucks. He can have a couple of dollars on the gee-gees or he can go down to the local rubbidy-dub and have a few beers with his mates. If he knows he will not get that money and his wife and family will not be paid, he will go back to work as quickly as he jolly well can, and rightly so. If he does not do that immediately, maybe his wife and children will nag him and he will go back to work and do the right thing. I commend the Government for its action with this legislation. I totally support it because I believe it is time that members of militant trade unions started to wake up to themselves and to face the fact that they will not have a free ride at the expense of their fellow Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of whether dole payments should be made to spouses of strikers is one of some controversy in the community. If this debate has indicated anything it certainly has indicated that. It has exercised my mind to the extent that I have tried as much as possible to get the opinions of some of my constituents in New South Wales to see what they think of the matter. It was not a large sample-between 60 and 70 people-but it was interesting that only four of those people supported the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981. In other words, the great majority felt that in certain circumstances the wives and families of strikers should get the dole because they ought not to be penalised for the actions of their husbands and fathers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all right. It was a good point. In other words, the withdrawal of this provision, as a strike-breaking weapon, appears to be repugnant to most of the community. The people I canvassed were by no means all unionists; mostly they were people who were known to me. A few of them were unionists, but more of them were small business people than people of any other category I could think of. It is interesting that they should take this point of view. As I said, they believed that the dole should be available to the families of strikers in certain circumstances. The interesting point to me was that almost all of them felt that it was not right that funding from the community in the form of the dole should be available after only one week which, of course, is the case at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was no general view among those people as to how much longer than one week it should be before the dole would apply, but the range of answers they gave varied between two weeks to six weeks. The most general view held by them appeared to be roughly organised around the idea of three weeks. It is for that reason that I have circulated in the Senate an amendment which would have the effect of retaining the dole payment to the wives of strikers but applying it after a qualifying period of three weeks. It is fair to say that this is a personal initiative on my part. It does not have the support of even all my own party. But I felt it desirable to put it forward because it seemed to me necessary for the community that there should be the opportunity of some discussion of a reasonable middle-ground compromise in the matter, something between the whole thing being thrown out and it being retained as it is at present. I believe the way this is going now it will continue to be a divisive issue in the community. Whatever vote is taken in the Senate today, it will not settle this matter. We all know that very well. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that I believe that in a protracted strike, when family resources are more likely to have been exhausted and other forms of aid may also be exhausted, it is necessary to have the means by which families do not suffer unduly. Of course, there is the other point of view. I remind honourable senators that I see myself as representing Sydney as part of New South Wales where we have had a very bad time indeed with petrol strikes whereby a great deal of suffering occurred. Some of the stories about suffering that have come to my knowledge will remain with me for some considerable time. I have heard of cases of many people, besides the families of strikers, suffering seriously. I have heard of cases of old people without the transport to go to buy food at some distance away-some new areas do not allow people to shop within walking distance of where they live-having to ask for food supplies from the neighbours; in effect, begging from them. Others have been placed under a disadvantage because they cannot get needed medications. Such people naturally feel resentful if they feel they are being compelled to subsidise, through their taxes, the very people they see as causing their suffering. It may not be that that is the case. It may be that the wrongs are on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I think this makes it evident that there should be, between the two extremes we have heard in this chamber today, some middle ground which perhaps would be more acceptable to the community at large and which would take some sort of heat out of this situation. It seems to me that if it is known that an effective payment to families can be made after only one week, it is rather easier for frivolous strikes-there are frivolous strikes from time to time without very good reason-to get off the ground. If it were known that the provisions would not apply for three weeks, I suggest that unions would then have to consider the need to ensure themselves that their members could be sustained for that period. I do not see that as an unreasonable obligation on them. If in some cases some of the strikers' families were in severe trouble inside three weeks, the provisions for special benefits would apply. I have a copy of the guidelines of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), for which I thank him. They refer to the provision of benefits of up to $89.70 a week for a family with two children. So, as I understand it, a fail-safe mechanism would apply in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I put the suggestion before the Senate yesterday with an appeal that it be seriously considered as a compromise position acceptable to all parties. It is something I thought the Government might have considered. Had it any desire whatsoever to avoid anything other than a direct confrontation on this issue, I would have thought it something it might have said it would negotiate on. But that has not been the case. As a result, I have been induced to the belief that the Government is raising this matter at this stage not because it wants this legislation or because it wants a solution to this problem but purely in a spirit of mischief to cause political trouble and dissension and perhaps also as a sop to its extreme right wing supporters in the community who regularly scream for strikers to be starved out. Also I tend to support my colleague Senator Haines who has said that the Government is probably now pathologically looking for its trigger mechanisms, as it calls them-its means of trying to abuse section 57 of the Constitution of this country. It is pushing out little boats in various directions to see how it can get something which it might conveniently at a time to suit it use as the means for a double dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most impressed with something I heard Senator Carrick saying on the media last night-that the first trigger, the education Bills, was there and that this would be a lesson to those who sought to frustrate. I suggest that in that single word we see a world of attitudes in which the Executive believes that although it does not have the confidence of both Houses of this Parliament it has the right, regardless of that, to push through whatever it wishes; and it sees anything less than that as a frustration. The initiative which I have put forward and which is cast in the form of a fairly complicated amendment was reasonably put and ought to have been reasonably considered. It is evident to me at this stage that it will not be reasonably considered. I have no evidence that it will be. All I will say is that sooner or later in this place we must evolve legislation by negotiation or by compromise with an ear to what the community wants. It seems to me that that day has yet to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on that section of the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) that relates to unemployment benefit being denied to people because of industrial action. This Bill seeks, in the confrontationist style of the Fraser Government, to divide further the Australian community. The Government is using a social services Bill to impose a penalty on wage and salary earners and their families. This social security legislation is designed as strike-breaking legislation. This legislation has to be seen as a penal clause against wage and salary earners, a penal clause against the family and an invasion of the civil liberties of the spouse of a trade unionist, female or male. The vast majority of people disadvantaged by this proposed legislation will be innocent victims. They will be people who are married to a trade unionist or children who are dependants of a trade unionist. The individual entitlement of the wife or husband-their civil liberty to benefit from social services in their own right-is to be denied to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this Government is setting out to starve these families into submission, we need to have an idea of the size of this problem. Only 16 per cent of the disputes go for longer than five days. Only 8.9 per cent of all strikers were involved in disputes that lasted 10 days or longer and one per cent of all industrial disputes last longer than 20 days. This is the reason I oppose Senator Mason's proposal. It would apply only to one per cent of industrial disputes. My colleague Senator Grimes has pointed out that of the 60,000 people who are involved in industrial disputes which last longer than seven days one-third are probably single and one-third have working spouses. So 20,000 people of a total work force of 6.6 million people will be affected. They are the facts on which this whole legislation is based. </PARA>
<PARA> Who are the employers involved in the longer disputes? They are invariably the largest employers, usually with a high percentage of foreign ownership. Let us look at a few of them. The mining industry is 59 per cent foreign-owned. The motor vehicle and spare parts industry is 75 per cent foreign-owned. The petroleum refining industry, which has just been mentioned, is 91 per cent foreign-owned. The position of wage and salary earners under this Government is that 80 per cent of them are, at this moment, $20 worse off. If we consider what might be called the social wage-health services, housing, education and the social welfare system-we have a reduced standard of living of approximately $18 a week. People are a total of $38 a week worse off under this Government and this is one of the reasons why there is industrial unrest. </PARA>
<PARA> We must examine the real position of this Government. Since 1975 this Government has engaged in a massive transfer of wealth through the taxation system. The Government has taken over $17 billion in higher taxes from the average wage and salary earners. It has given $15 billion to wealthy individuals and companies through tax cuts. That has to be compared with the $5m that is involved in any reference to the spouses of trade unionists. Senator Crichton-Browne, who cried crocodile tears for the trade unionists and the people in the mining companies of Western Australia, should look at his Government's record on the main money issue, and that is tax avoidance. Last year the level of tax avoidance rose by 30 per cent. Since 1975-76 tax avoidance has increased by 26 times. They are the facts. That is where the money is. Indeed, the figure announced as to tax avoidance this year is $973m. Individually, that means each tax avoider owes $43,500. Contrast those figures with the $5m that this Government claims is involved in this legislation affecting 20,000 people. The interesting fact is that the number of people involved in tax avoidance is 22,366, with each owing $43,500. That equates with the 20,000-odd people who would be affected by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparison does not stop there. Industry has been given $2,278m by a massive system of tax concessions, hand-outs and infrastructure. The Government is not satisfied with giving this money to big business. It now intervenes to help in the struggle against labour. One might well ask: Why is the Government so bloody-minded in pressing such a biased Bill in this chamber? At least one consideration must have to do with collective bargaining because at the moment every other major employer organisation is giving lip service to it. The Government's industrial relations policy is in tatters. Rising from the ashes is the gimmick that we have before us today. One significant aspect in any consideration of collective bargaining is the power of the relative forces. Another, of course, axiomatically, is the length of industrial disputes. If we compare the situation in the United States of America with that in Australia, we find that in that country industrial disputes are more than eight times longer. Indeed, in Australia the median duration of strikes is 1.25 days. In the United States it is 16.25 days. The effect of this legislation in favouring large companies-the same multinational companies that are in both America and Australia at the moment-is similar to its effect on people involved in industrial disputes. That may well be the reason for the Government's action, in this area. As some of my colleagues have pointed out, the Government deliberately in everything that has been said has failed to recognise that managerial policy decisions are the main cause of industrial disputes. As my colleague Senator McIntosh pointed out, only 21 per cent of industrial disputes are based on wages. Managerial policy decisions are the cause of 42 per cent of disputes and working conditions are the cause of 21.4 per cent. This is the key to the issue. This is the issue that the Government is soft on. It is the thing that the Minister has not mentioned. In the area of management inspired disputes some of the most intense industrial disputes occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a few examples and perhaps start with one that might be close to Senator Crichton-Browne's heart. As he cried his crocodile tears for some of the iron companies, I was reminded of the Tom Price mine in Western Australia, which is owned by Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, the company which engaged in provocation by unilaterally changing shifts when it had a stockpile of iron ore. It can be relied on every six months to engage in such action. Hamersley Iron was a prominent case study in the Fitzgerald report on the contribution of the mineral industry to Australian welfare. The Hamersley Iron company paid less than one per cent income tax on profits of $264m. The Fitzgerald report documented the massive tax rip-off by Hamersley and concluded by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Practically no internal redistributive benefits for Australia as a whole . . . have so far emerged from these profitable mining operations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one typical example of the type of management inspired dispute. When the price of gold dropped at the Telfer gold mine management created a long industrial dispute. It was settled when the price of gold rose again. And what of Qantam House? The construction company, Dillingham Australia Ltd, provoked many disputes because the method of payment to Dillingham meant that it profited by disputes. Rise and fall clause payments were made when disputes occurred. Dillingham was making $50,000 a week when disputes occurred. There are many examples in the mining and construction industries of these actions being taken by these giant organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Murdoch newspaper group was involved in a typical dispute that illustrates management-caused industrial disputes. These are the sorts of disputes which, if this Government is successful with this legislation, will mean strikers-the victims-will be punished through their spouses not receiving the unemployment benefit. The Bill does not discriminate. All strikers are treated the same regardless of who causes the dispute. In the Murdoch newspaper dispute, Ita Buttrose, the editor-in-chief with the Murdoch newspaper group, decided, on a whim, to replace a journalist. She decided to sack a person whom she had originally recruited. In the typical arrogant, elite manner of management in such companies, the journalist was in no way warned or in any way informed that there was criticism of her work. No common-sense industrial relations procedures were followed. The capricious action of Ita Buttrose caused a stoppage of eight days. The dispute spread from Sydney to Melbourne and from Brisbane to Perth. Similar disputes have lasted longer in the newspaper industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this Bill will be that the wives and husbands of journalists or printers in those States will be ineligible for unemployment benefits unless they beg under the special provisions of the Bill to which the Minister has referred. Last year, an industrial dispute over new technology and rates of pay for journalists operating video display terminals in the newspaper industry lasted a month. This type of dispute determined by management and affecting people in the printing industry is another typical example of the operations of this Bill in practice. If the Government wants an election on this issue then it can have it. The simple fact is that it cannot make scapegoats of people who cannot afford it. It implements this legislation to save the payment of $5m to simple, ordinary people, yet it allows 22,366 tax bludgers to owe $973m. Indeed, each one of those tax bludgers could pay enough to give 740-odd ordinary people unemployment relief. That is the extent of the difference between the two sides of this argument. I would be very happy to fight against this Bill throughout Australia. The trade union movement will take issue with it because it is a biased deliberate attack on the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the limited time, I will confine my remarks to the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981, which deals with matters to which most honourable senators participating in this debate have directed their remarks. I have read carefully the material that has been presented to us by the Government in respect of this matter. I have listened to all the debate and have been present in the chamber for 95 per cent of it. I have also read, with interest, the second reading speech of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick). Might I add that I am surprised that this legislation does come from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who has a record of being very perceptive. All that I can say about the Bill has been said about a number of other things over a long period. It is a bit like the head of a bullock. There are a couple of points in it but there is a lot of bull between them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the points, of course, which was mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech was that the taxpayer should not pay for industrial action taken by the decision of strikers. I suppose most of us would agree with that principle. But then we have to start defining what we mean by that. Nowhere in this Bill is an attempt made to define the question of industrial action. It does not go to the question of what is legitimate industrial action and what is not. If, for example, action is taken by a group of workers pursuant to a secret strike ballot under the amendments made by this Government to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, those people and their families are not exempted from the penal provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a number of other points that have been raised during the debate to which the mind of the Government obviously has not been substantially addressed. Those questions include the following: Against whom is this piece of legislation directed? An argument has been put forward that it is against the married wife of the one income family. Statistics have been laid before the Senate today which indicate that possibly 60,000 to 70,000 workers were affected last year of whom approximately 45,000 had spouses. Half of these were working and, therefore, were ineligible anyhow for the unemployment benefit. That reduces the number to a possible 20,000 applicants for very short periods indeed. No figures have been presented to the Parliament as to the cost to the taxpayer about which the Government is concerned. The Minister stated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases where the wives of strikers, who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the work force themselves, have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time that the Government came clean and told us how many of these cases there are; what has been the cost over the last 12 months or even over the last three years; the duration of the strike involved; whether the granting of the unemployment benefit has, in fact, prolonged the strike action; and whether the percentage of strikers who have wives would be stretching the longest bow of eligibility to apply for the unemployment or special benefit. These are the sorts of things that ought to be clarified. As far as the Senate is concerned I believe that it cannot make up its mind until these matters are clarified and until the Government comes clean and gives us all of the information. If it does not, it appears, on the face of it, that this measure is, in fact, directed at the one income family. That is why I expressed my surprise to the Minister that he, of all people, would take action or support a measure which would further undermine the one income family. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Georges" NAMEID="7V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator Georges</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has no compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I disagree with that. With respect, I think the Minister does have compassion but his previous statements relating to the need to support one-income families are not borne out. I also point out some inconsistencies in the Minister's speech. He talks about strike settlements involving make up for pay lost during the strike. From my experience there are not a great number of such strike settlements. I also remind the Minister-he has been reminded during the debate-that the causes of strikes are not always wages causes. In his second reading speech, the Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not infrequently, strikes are settled on a basis that effectively compensates those who have gone on strike for pay lost during the duration of the strike. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate, and Senator Chaney, that the figures put forward by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that only some 20 per cent of strikes were over wages and salaries. So on the face of it the Minister's statement does not bear examination by comparison with the official figures that have been put forward by the Bureau of Statistics. As has been mentioned in the debate by a number of honourable senators, there are a number of other causes of strikes within Australia, such as managerial policy and physical working conditions. The question of safety arises as well. For example, if there is a strike regarding safety then, of course, under this provision the wives of those strikers, who are striking on a matter of principle, could be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that the Minister has not considered whether the action taken is legitimate, whether it is within the bounds of a State Act or State award, or, as I have mentioned previously, whether it is within the bounds of the amended provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Why penalise wives of men who are acting within those bounds? For example, why penalise workers who are acting precisely within the guidelines for the conduct and control of industrial disputes? I assume that that is what was meant. But this question was raised when the words 'trade union reform' were mentioned earlier in the debate. There is a growing recognition amongst a growing section of the trade union movement that the fundamental rule for the conduct and control of industrial disputes should be observed by a unionist before he takes strike action. This was adverted to broadly by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Dolan, in his opening address to the recently held congress of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He referred, of course, to the provisions of ACTU rules Nos. 13 and 14, which are long-standing rules. He referred to the fundamental principle for the conduct and control of industrial disputes, which, as we all know, means that if someone goes out on strike and puts me out of work he has a responsibility to consult me through my union, through the central trade union organisation. If, for example, a union and unionists satisfy all the criteria and wgrk within all the guidelines for the conduct and control of industrial disputes, are we to put them and their wives in the same boat as those who are not engaging in industrial activity pursuant to those guidelines? That is what the Government is doing in this Bill. I suggest, frankly, that these questions may not even have occurred to the Government, let alone proper examination having been given to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to a matter that has been raised previously, the matter of the one-income family. This legislation seems to be directed at the one-income family. In a mining district, for example, are we to impose this penalty on the spouse-that is, the married spouse-of a striker and not on the de facto spouse of a striker? I suggest that the Government has not even though of that. I know of a number of cases in mining areas of a couple who live together and have kids. Under this piece of legislation we will discriminate not only against the single income--</PARA>

I am glad that the Minister has thought of something along those lines, but I guarantee that he has not thought of the other proposition I put forward to him: That is, those workers who are engaging in industrial action pursuant to the proper rules for the conduct and control of industrial disputes and those who are not. I feel quite strongly that the Government is not pursuing a proper course on this matter. This is an attempt to involve and include industrial relations measures in social security legislation, and I do not think that will work. Quite frankly, I believe it is an extension of the Government's policy, which has not worked in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I point out to the Senate that a rejection of this measure will again load for the Government another barrel of the section 57 gun. Last night Australian Labor Party and Australian Democrat senators loaded the section 57 gun barrel for the Government. They laid themselves and the Senate open to allegations of avoidable obstructionism by their actions relating to the tertiary education Bill. By voting against the motion for the second reading of the Bill they prevented consideration of my foreshadowed motion which provided the opportunity for the Senate to exercise its audit, control and scrutiny powers in a palatable manner. As honourable senators know, my amendment then would have given the best of both worlds. I think the amendment I will propose shortly in this matter will also give time for the Senate to reconsider its position, but more particularly for the Government to reconsider its position. My proposal last night was for an amendment at the Committee stage of the Bill to make any ministerial instrument as to fees subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. Of course, as we all know, it is not unusual for such ministerial determinations to be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament in this way. As the numbers stand in the Senate, any unacceptable determination bq the Minister would be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Senate now, as I could have said last night: Why give the Government an excuse to pave the way for a double dissolution? Why not make a stand when there are other procedural avenues open to exercise our audit and control functions other than to defeat a measure outright? We will, of course, find ourselves in such a situation when the sales tax measure comes before the Senate. That can only be dealt with by outright defeat of those clauses which attempt to impose sales tax on necessity items. In the current circumstances, a procedural avenue is available to the Senate which will provide the opportunity for the Senate but, as I say, more particularly for the Government, to review the situation. I foreshadow that after this Bill has been disposed of, I will move to the motion for the second reading of the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'this Bill be referred to a select committee for inquiry and report upon the provisions of the Bill and matters relating thereto, including matters raised during the debate in the Senate on the Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that this will give the opportunity for the Senate to exercise its review and control functions. I feel that if we pass up this opportunity we will be providing the Government with an unnecessary basis for obstructionist allegations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some sympathy for Senator Harradine's amendment. However, I wish to explain why the Opposition cannot accept it. It is no secret in this place that the Opposition considered a similar amendment. Senator Harradine made the point that the Government is obviously intent on loading the gun in respect of legislation which has been rejected more than once by the Senate. The Government considers that legislation dealt with in this way is appropriate legislation to provide the reason for calling a double dissolution. According to legal opinion I have been able to obtain the reference of a matter to a committee, which Senator Harradine has suggested, would also be considered a failure to pass legislation. In fact the gun would still be loaded even if Senator Harradine's amendment were agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I wish to raise is that by opposing this legislation we will give the Government three months to reconsider its position and to reconsider the points raised by myself, Senator Haines, Senator Harradine and the other speakers in this debate. I do not believe that the Government, from its attitude on the previous social services legislation during debate in another place and in this place so far, has any intention of reconsidering this legislation. I agree with previous speakers that this Bill panders to the prejudices of those on the Government side and the Government's supporters who believe that it is appropriate that a government of their persuasion should do what it can to thump the trade unions as often as possible and, if it is necessary to attack the wives and children of the unionists in order to do that, they will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to us presents a matter of principle. It presents the principle that the Social Services Act is designed to assist those in the community who are disadvantaged, who have insufficient funds or insufficient resources through no fault of their own. Provisions which go against that principle should not be introduced into this Act. Clearly this legislation contains such provisions. I believe that our principled stand on this matter is such that, even with a committee of inquiry such as Senator Harradine suggested, it would not change; it would only be strengthened. I believe the feelings of the people on the other side of the chamber are such that a committee would make no difference to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reason I can see for supporting such a committee-I believe this is one of the reasons that Senator Harradine put forward-is that it would enable further debate on the matters about which he spoke, including the matter whether people taking legitimate industrial action are excluded from this legislation. Quite clearly they are not. There is no distinction in this legislation or in the 1979 legislation between what may be called a legitimate strike and a legal strike; there is no distinction between a strike conducted for the purpose of improving safety or working conditions and any other strike. It is a blanket amendment, a blanket change to the legislation to cover all those involved in industrial action. It is blanket legislation to cover all those who fall foul of the Department of Social Security and who lose their unemployment benefits because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the two speakers on the Government side did not mention the latter part of the Bill; this is further indication that the Government wishes to concentrate on the industrial aspects of the legislation. Senator Harradine's amendment will not prevent this Bill being used as a double dissolution Bill. It will not mean that there has not been a refusal to pass the legislation and it will not prevent a government, which is hell bent on doing so, introducing legislation like this to create division and prejudice in the community. Therefore we believe we should stand on our principles in this matter and debate the issues with a community which I believe is far more intelligent and perceptive than obviously the Government believes. We do not wish to cloud the issue and introduce into the debate further argument on whether we have refused supply or have backed down on this principle. We wish to stand where we are and, therefore, with some reluctance we did not second and could not have supported Senator Harradine's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Grimes would not presume to do such a thing without our permission. I turn my attention to the proposition put forward by Sentor Harradine; that is, that referral of this matter to a Senate select committee would be a good way of resolving differences, a good way of having the issues thrashed out between political parties and amongst members of the community. There was some speculation in the media recently that both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats were in favour of a reference of this matter to a Senate select or standing committee. Nobody at any stage asked me, as the Democrats spokesperson on the matter, whether I thought it ought to be referred to a committee, select or standing. While I am prepared to accept that Senate select and standing committees serve a very valuable purpose, I cannot see that anything would be gained in this instance by such a reference. To begin with, I am not particularly afraid of guns, whether loaded or unloaded, and I am certainly not afraid of a double dissolution gun on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether the issue ought to be referred to a Senate committee, select or otherwise, I make the point that these committees are usually valuable when dealing with matters that are non-contentious, that are not particularly political in nature or at least do not appear to be. I suppose that one could say that there is not much point in referring the matter of South-West Tasmania to a committee when clearly it would be politically dealt with, but I think there is a chance, since submissions and so on would be taken by that committee, that that matter would be looked at more neutrally than the contents of this piece of legislation would be. We certainly supported Senator Hamer's amendment to Senator Missen's motion that a Senate committee should be set up or used to look at any infringements of civil liberties contained in legislation brought before this chamber. That in itself is a good thing. It can be seen in 99 cases out of 100 as being a non-political issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not dealing with a question of civil liberties in any readily identifiable sense; the issue is an entirely political one. It was for this reason, when some people were discussing in the corridors and in their offices whether this matter should be referred to a committee, that at no stage did I indicate in any way at all that I was in favour of that course. I can see no point in it. It would drag the thing on for another three months in which some Government members, if they wished, could whip some members of the public into a frenzy of disapproval about these poor women and children getting some money out of the Government when they really should not do so. In the long run two reports would be brought down-one from the Government members and one from non-Government members. That statement might indicate a certain cynicism in me, but I am afraid that this place makes that sort of attitude unavoidable. I can see no point in referring the matter to a Senate committee, select or otherwise. I do not think it would achieve anything. I do not think we would solve the central moral dilemma-it is a moral dilemma; it is a matter of viewpoint, assessment of the situation-in that way. I cannot see how five senators, four senators or whatever the number would be would get any closer to a solution after three months hassle than we have done in the last few hours of debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might ape the honourable senators opposite at least insofar as I explain why the Government does not support a reference to a committee. I think it will be quite clear that the Government has put forward this legislation because it believes that it is an appropriate amendment to the Social Services Act. It has put it forward in the belief that it should be passed by the Parliament. For that reason it does not-I do not think it would have been expected to do so-support a reference to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There seems to me to be one common thread running through the debate on the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3), and that is that strikes cause hardship. On this side of the chamber there was emphasis on the broad hardship which is caused to the community by strikes. I believe that within the Australian community there is a very clear view that strike action is something which affects not merely the strikers directly involved and the companies or businesses directly involved but also the community, and that is sometimes brought home with great strength by the fact that essential services are interfered with and so on. That has received more emphasis on this side of the chamber, whereas on the other side of the chamber there has been emphasis on the hardship which is caused to the strikers themselves and those who are not responsible directly, the families of the strikers and other members of the same union who might be affected under this legislation by the actions of their fellow unionists. But it is common ground that hardship is caused. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate about this legislation is, I think, properly a debate about where, in the main, the hardship ought to be carried and who is responsible for meeting the losses which are caused by this sort of activity. One thing that was notably absent from the contributions from the other side of the chamber was reference to the fact that there is a basic provision in this legislation which says that those who are in extreme hardship will get assistance from the State, from their fellow Australians, notwithstanding the fact that their spouses are involved in strike action. That is a matter on which I will go into more detail in a moment. Essentially, the debate is about who shall carry the burden which is imposed by strike action. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some fairly emotional contributions, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I do not think I offend the Chair in saying that not the least of which was your contribution because you went so far as to compare the collective responsibility approach of this legislation to the actions of the Third Reich in respect of the village of Lidice. You picked an example with which I am very familiar. Indeed, for many years I had on my wall a poster which said 'Remember Lidice'. You told the story of the responsibility that was sheeted home in such a dreadful way to that village. But I think that was a great overstatement of the situation. In fact, a more dispassionate examination of the situation makes it quite clear that there is a judgment to be made here and the Government has simply chosen to make the judgment, which I believe would have the support of the majority of Australians, that when people take strike action they ought to carry the burden of it. I commend the more reasoned approach put forward by Senator Harradine in which he raised matters of concern to him about the possible operation of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer the Senate very brieflq to some of the history of this matter. I refer to a book which I think is regarded as a fairly non-partisan view of the social security system. The book is entitled Australian Social Security Today and was written by Mr T. H. Kewley. I refer to the information at pages 132 and 133. It is interesting that Mr Kewley quotes a letter to the Director of Social Services dated May 1948 in which Senator McKenna, the Minister for Social Services in the Chifley Government, said:</PARA>
<PARA> All unions represented at the Conference with me in Sydney on 23rd April accepted the principle that the Commonwealth could not permit unemployment benefit to be used for financing strikes. </PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to give that quote because it is a very big difference in emphasis from the emphasis that has been put on it by the other side of the chamber; that is, that in some way the Government is seeking to use the social security system for industrial purposes. The fact of the matter is that the Government is trying to prevent the social security system from being used for industrial purposes by those who are in the industrial sphere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that that is the true emphasis which is to be put on this legislation. Senator Grimes interjects in his usual way by saying that that is referring to strikers. But the principle is this: Those strikers are people who are perhaps without income and who are, in a hardship sense, in need of assistance but the policy decision is taken that unemployment benefit is not to be used for financing their strike. That is the principle behind what Senator McKenna is saying. That was laid down by Mr Chifley who, in that year, made a statement with respect to unemployment benefit in Queensland. On 25 February 1948 Mr Chifley, a Labor Prime Minister, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In connection with the payment of unemployment benefit to persons involved in or affected by the present Queensland industrial dispute, the Social Services Consolidation Act provides that benefit is not payable to an applicant whose unemployment is due to him being a direct participant in a strike. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to other persons involved in or affected by an industrial dispute, the Minister for Social Services has issued instructions which are being observed by the Department of Social Services in Queensland at present and throughout the Commonwealth. These instructions are the outcome of a full consideration of the relevant parts of the Act of a Cabinet sub-committee early in 1947. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, the instructions embody the following principles: In respect of unions on strike and unions sponsoring a strike of its members in key positions, members of these unions-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise these words-</PARA>
<PARA>whether directly participating in the strike, or unemployed as a direct or indirect consequence of the strike, are not to be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of unions not on strike, or apparently having no members on strike, members of these unions are to be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> A person is not to be disqualified for unemployment benefit by reason only of his refusal to undertake work available through a strike or lockout. </PARA>
<PARA>The important principle contained there is that not just those who are directly concerned in the strike are to be removed from entitlement to unemployment benefit. I mention that in the context of those who complain and say that only those who are directly and immediately involved and responsible should be deprived. As Mr Kewley points out those rules were changed in March 1973 when Mr Hayden was Minister for Social Security. In fact, those rules in general, apart from a very brief period, have applied as laid down by the Labor Government. Those honourable senators, and even those less honourable senators who persist in interjecting and who are concerned about the situation of those who are indirectly involved because they are the spouses of strikers, are-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear from the number of interjections from the other side of the chamber that the Labor Party does not like to be reminded of the days when it could be relied upon to do the right thing by the people of Australia. There would be no Australian who would not look back to the Chifley days with great regret and wish that men of the calibre of Mr Chifley were still in the Opposition now. In any event, the concern which is put forward by the Opposition relates to the fact that the wives and children are to be left without protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My friend and colleague Senator Bonner made a very good speech in which he pointed out that the basic responsibility for a man's wife and children in general may be put at the feet of that man because that is the responsibility he bears. In any event, the legislation which we have put forward provides that in the case where a wife and children are going to suffer hardship there can be intervention by way of special benefit. I have had no inquiry from the Opposition at all as to how that might operate. To do the Australian Democrats justice, they did seek information as to how that would work. In fact, there has been a total lack of interest on the part of the Opposition about what might be made available under that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline to the Senate the position with respect to the grant of that special benefit. Administrative guidelines have been prepared covering the test of extreme hardship which is the test required by the legislation and which is a precondition to the grant of special benefit under the amendment. These guidelines indicate that extreme hardship may be accepted if the current income and available liquid assets of a couple, for example, money in the bank and cash, are less than the equivalent of unemployment benefit at the single rate plus, where appropriate, additional benefit for children, after unavoidable financial commitments other than general living costs have been deducted from the income and available liquid assets. In such cases, special benefit will be paid at a rate sufficient to bring the total income of the couple up to the level of employment benefit at the single rate plus any additional benefit for children. Where an applicant is ineligible for special benefit because income and available liquid assets are sufficient to cover unavoidable financial commitments and the relevant rate of unemployment benefit, the position will be reviewed each fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, let me take a family with two children and outline a number of situations in which special benefit would not be payable and a number in which it would be payable. If a family had no liquid resources and unavoidable financial commitments, it would get the special benefit at the single unemployed rate with the addition for the two children. In other words, the family's position would be the same as if it were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. It would get an amount of $89.70. If a family had liquid resources of, say, $50 a week but unavoidable financial commitments in excess of that amount, it would get $89.70. If it had liquid resources equal to its unavoidable financial commitments, it would get $89.70. If it had liquid resources $50 a week in excess of its unavoidable financial commitments, it would get $39.70. If it had liquid resources in excess of the amount of its unavoidable financial commitments, the single unemployment rate and the amount for children, it would get nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact of the matter is that the choice one is really debating with respect to this legislation is this: At the moment the wife of a man who goes on strike or whose union goes on strike and thereby puts him out of work may claim unemployment benefit even if that man has large savings in the bank. In other words, he is entitled to conserve his own liquid resources and to call upon the taxpayer for contributions. Under this legislation the change will be this: If a man goes on strike or his union goes on strike and thereby puts him out of work, he will get assistance only if his liquid resources are not sufficient to cover his unavoidable financial commitments plus the current rate of single unemployment benefit for the woman and the children. That is the simple fact of the matter. That is what we are debating. The real issue is whether people who are out of work because of industrial action are entitled not to run down their assets during that period but to turn automatically to the taxpayer for sustenance. That is the simple question, and I think the answer to that question is one which to most Australians would be apparent. Most Australians, I think, would find it offensive that one can automatically turn to the taxpayer in those circumstances and demand sustenance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I move on. If I get fewer interjections, I will get to the stage where I can respond to the points raised by Senator Harradine. I am moving to that. But first I must touch quickly on Senator Haines's and Senator Mason's argument. Senator Haines suggested that it was extremely unchristian to be denying people assistance in the circumstances that this Bill does. I have just tried to illustrate that in fact those people who do not have liquid assets will be able to seek assistance by way of special benefit from the Department. I point out to the Senate that Senator Mason indicated that he would have moved an amendment to this Bill in the Committee stage had he thought he would get any support. The effect of that amendment would have been to apply the Bill exactly as it is drafted for the first three weeks of the strike, and thereafter the present position-that is, the unamended position whereby one is entitled to unemployment benefit-would have applied. So apparently, if we adopt the words of Senator Haines, Senator Mason is suggesting that it is all right to be unchristian for three weeks but it is no good if it goes on any longer. I suggest that Senator Mason's contribution, which did concede that there is community concern about this matter and that extremes of view are to be avoided, takes us some of the way along the track along which the Government is leading us. I believe that it would be consistent with what the Democrats had been saying so loudly in their lead-up to getting elected if the difference of opinion within their ranks-if indeed there is one-were evidenced in their voting pattern and if they stopped caucusing as seriously as the Labor Party ever caucused in the history of this place. I await the vote of the Democrats on this Bill and I have little doubt that they will caucus as successfully on this occasion as they have in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the serious point which Senator McIntosh made in opening his speech and which he has made often in this place about the importance of other factors such as losses of productivity and wealth in this country. He referred to industrial health and safety and so on. Of course, I accept and the government accepts that they also are important matters for consideration by government. It remains true that matters of industrial health and safety are largely outside the direct responsibility of the Commonwalth Government as Senator McIntosh would be very well aware with his trade union background. This is not an argument about health and safety not being relevant to these matters it is a quite separate argument and I believe it stands on its own. I have dealt with the points Senator McIntosh made about Lidice. With respect, I suggest that was a very extreme view to take of this legislation. I believe that when one looks at the history of this matter and the balance which has to be struck between the public responsibility of taxpayers generally to support people against hardship and the trade unionists and unions which take industrial action, often to the detriment of their fellow citizens, one sees that the decision which the Government has taken in putting forward this legislation is based on reason. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a request that there be some indication of the figures we are talking about in this area. No exhaustive figures are available but I have asked my Department to extract some examples from situations where it could be clearly seen that there were applications for benefit by wives during strikes. I refer to a series of strikes over the period 1980 to 1981, which give an indication of the amount of money which can be involved in some strikes. I refer firstly to the strike from June to September 1980 at Blackwater in Queensland. The reason for the strike was a dispute about subsidised housing. There were 4,500 people on strike. In that town 411 wives were granted unemployment benefit at a cost of $30,800 per week and 112 wives were granted special benefit at a cost of $8,400 per week. The total cost was $431,475. From 19 January 1981 to 19 March 1981 in Gladstone, Queensland, 176 people were on strike. Forty-seven wives were granted unemployment benefit at a cost of just under $4,000 per week. In Broken Hill from 18 February 1981 to 15 March 1981 2,000 to 2,500 people were on strike and 1,167 wives claimed unemployment benefit at a cost of $99,195 per week. Special benefit of $340 per week was granted making a total cost of $369,274. </PARA>
<PARA> From 15 July 1981 to 28 September 1981 a strike took place at the Utah Development Co. mine in Central Queensland. The use of apprentices in industrial action was central to the dispute. There were 600 people on strike. Four hundred and seventy-one wives claimed unemployment benefit at a cost of $40,000 per week, making a total cost of $444,934. At Port Kembla in New South Wales from 19 August, 1981 to 27 September 1981 550 people were on strike. Seventy-five wives claimed unemployment benefit at a cost of $6,375 per week. The total cost was $41,740, including $935 for special benefit. The last example I give is a strike at Gove in the Northern Territory from 14 August 1981 to 28 October 1981. Five hundred and fifty people were on strike. Only six wives claimed unemployment benefit and 99 wives claimed special benefit-the very benefit that will still be available to them. The total cost for that strike was $96,925. The total cost for that group of samples which I asked my Department to extract amounted to $1.422m. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is where the social cost of the action taken by the unions should lie. I believe it is reasonable that it should lie at the feet of those who are members of the unions. A great deal of concern was expressed about the ambit of this legislation and how wide it could spread. I simply indicate to the Senate that the legislation affects only those people who are members of unions who are engaged in the strike activity. </PARA>
<PARA> A series of points was raised by Senator Harradine who, I think, was seriously directing his attention to the legislation. He raised matters which I know are of real concern to him. He mentioned the fact that there is no definition of industrial action. In fact, there is a definition in section 107 of the Social Services Act. I will not read it to him but there is a definition contained in sub-section (7) of that section. He has also raised the question of cases. I have given a sample of cases which indicate the sort of problem which has given rise to both public and government concern. </PARA>
<PARA> More centrally, I think, he raised the fact that this is a measure which by definition can apply only to a one-income family. Quite clearly, if the spouse is employed the is no question of the spouse being eligible for either unemployment benefit or special benefit. By definition this measure could only be a measure which affects one income families. It is an extraordinary proposition to suggest that one could in some way attack the earnings of a spouse who is herself in employment. The question is: Who is responsible for that family? Is the taxpayer primarily and instantly responsible for that family when the trade union of which that man is a member immediately goes on strike, with or without his consent? Again I believe that the judgment is one which has to be that the burden initially is to be borne by that family, with the safeguard that we have given in respect of the grant of special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also raised the question of de facto spouses. I refer him to the definitions in section 106 of the Act which clearly indicate that the provision applies to people in a de facto state as well as a formal married state. In respect of whether the action might be legitimate, I say to the Senate that I do not believe that the question of whether a strike is legitimate or illegitimate, on some definition, is the question which is fundamental to the decision in this matter. Surely, if trade unions are to have available to them the strike weapon-I believe there are many people in this country who believe it is a weapon that should not be available to them--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The devotion of honourable senators opposite to strikes may be a very fine thing. I simply make the point that to very many Australians strikes are becoming thoroughly offensive. There is no point in ignoring that fact. The question is not whether a strike is legitimate or illegitimate but whether the strike action, if a union determines on it, is an action which it can take at a cost to the taxpayer or an action it takes at its own cost. I believe that in that balance which has to be found in this area-which I believe would have been more readily found in the days of a Labor Party led by Mr Chifley than we have any chance of finding today-the Government has made the right decision in bringing forward this legislation.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Census and Statistics Bill (No. 2) before the Senate embody the results of a very thorough re-examination of the Census and Statistics Act, much of which stands as it was drafted in 1905. Successive amendments over the years have resulted in a patchwork of provisions which badly need pulling together. I invite the attention of the Senate to the following aspects of the Bill. Preservation of the confidentiality of information provided to the Bureau of Statistics is regarded by the Government as of the utmost importance. Moreover, it is central to the relationship of confidence and trust that exists between the Bureau and those businesses and households who are asked to provide information for statistical purposes. Therefore section 19 would make it an offence for the Statistician or an officer, present or past, to divulge or communicate information furnished in pursuance of the Act, except to the person from whom the information was obtained. Section 12 would ensure that statistics issued by the Statistician shall not be likely to enable the identification of information relating to a particular person or organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has, however, emerged from the re-examination to which I referred earlier that literal adherence in all circumstances to those provisions is regarded by respondents to statistical collections as unnecessary and would in a number of respects curtail severely the statistical service which the Statistician can provide. For example, many businesses make publicly available figures on their monthly or annual production, as well as providing them to the Statistician. If they are the sole, or by far the largest, producer of a particular commodity in a particular area, release by the Statistician of production statistics in the desired detail would show a figure which would be identifiable as necessarily relating to, or as a close approximation to, the production of that business. The Act ought to provide a mechanism authorising the Statistician to publish such figures collected under the Act, with the consent of the business involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Some information of this nature relating to businesses or government bodies is in fact currently released by the Statistician and the Government has taken the view that the precise categories of such releases and the safeguards by which they are accompanied should be spelled out. Because the intention is that there should be no weakening of the general principle of confidentiality of information provided to the Statistician, information which the Statistician is to be authorised to release needs to be specified in considerable detail. That degree of detail would be inappropriate in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 13 would therefore provide that the minister may, by means of a written determination, authorise the Statistician to release information of a specific kind under specific conditions. It should be noted that no determination may authorise the release of information of a personal or domestic nature in a manner that is likely to enable the identification of any person. It is also important to note that it remains the responsibility of the Statistician, within the specific authorisations, to decide whether or not to release particular figures. In making those decisions he will continue to be guided by an overriding concern to maintain the confidence and trust of respondents to statistical collections. A determination made under section 13 would be tabled in the Parliament, published in the Gazette and be subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the other provisions of the Bill. These do not alter the substance of the powers, functions and duties of the Statistician or the method of operation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They retain the Minister's power to give general directions to the Australian Statistician to collect statistical information on prescribed matters. Instead of the present separate provisions for the population census and other statistical collections, the Bill substitutes one set of machinery provisions relating to both. Operational detail of the kind now included in the Act regarding the population censuses will in respect of future censuses be set out in regulations. Topics to be included in each population census will be prescribed in one regulation, rather than set out partly in the Act and partly in a regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Maximum penalties incorporated in the Bill are similar to those enacted by Parliament in the autumn session. However, the provision for imposing a sentence of imprisonment for the offence of knowingly providing false information has been omitted. Also, with the redrafting of the secrecy provision, the maximum penalty provided for breaches by officers of that provision has been brought into line with the penalties for similar offences in other Acts to act as a deterrent and as an affirmation of the importance of the principle of confidentiality. Detailed explanations of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="2552" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.53)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill, which authorises the payment of capital grants to the States for the present financial year and for the first six months of the next financial year-that is, for the last six months of calendar year 1982-is a decadent product of the Fraser Government's new federalism policy. New federalism, as expounded by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) from Opposition in 1975 and from government in 1976, centred on a devolution of power and of responsibility: A reduction in tied Commonwealth payments to the States, an overall reduction in Commonwealth payments to the States and the right of the States to reimpose their own income taxes and to fund a greater proportion of their expenditure from their own revenue sources, including the newly-restored revenue source of a State income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say that it is a decadent product of that because at no stage has the Prime Minister made a serious attempt to have that policy actually implemented. This Government has consistently followed a policy of squeezing the States little by little each year but never at any stage to the extent which would have actually forced the States to impose a State income tax, which was supposed to be a central component of the new federalism as originally propounded. Despite the existence of a large majority in both Houses of Parliament for five years, the Prime Minister at no stage made a serious attempt to implement this policy. The reason, as observed by the more astute of his back benchers, is that he is fundamentally a political coward. It is a decadent hybrid because it has squeezed the States enough to hurt them and, of course, to hurt even more the citizens of the States, but never enough actually to force them to impose the alternative policy. In other words, we have fallen between two stools and the consequential situation is worse than either of the two would have been if they had been properly implemented. The squeeze on the States has been made more pernicious and in the long term more damaging because the major squeeze has come on the capital works programs rather than the recurrent expenditure programs. That is again related to political cowardice. It is politically more expedient to force cuts in the capital works programs than in recurrent expenditure programs. The consequences of capital starvation take a number of years to become fully apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives Ralph Willis incorporated in Hansard a table showing in real terms the progressive squeeze on capital expenditure as authorised by the grants under this Bill and including borrowings by the States authorised by the Loan Council. It showed that in every year the capital squeeze on the States has been intensified. From 1975-76 to the current year there has, in fact, been a fall of almost 45 per cent in real terms in State capital expenditure authorised by this Act and by Loan Council borrowings. The macroeconomic effects of that progressive and continuing reduction in State capital expenditure will be more serious in the current financial year than it has been in most years for the simple reason that on the Government's optimistic estimates non-farm real gross domestic product will increase by 3 per cent in this year. Such an extremely low level of growth inevitably entails a rise in unemployment even if that 3 per cent target is realised. As time goes by it becomes more and more doubtful that it will be realised. For these reasons, at this stage, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill, by further sharply reducing the real level of funds for State government capital works, is-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) making it impossible for the States to provide an adequate capital expenditure program;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) reducing the extent and standard of community services;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) undermining the efficiency and productive capacity of many industries, especially the building industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) producing unbalanced development by facilitating expansion of infrastructure for the resource industries while severely contracting expenditure on the social infrastructure;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) increasing unemployment; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) intensifying pressure on the States to introduce a second income tax'. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the last point, the Bill certainly intensifies the pressure on the States to introduce a second income tax but it does not go actually far enough to force the States into a position where they really have no alternative but to impose a second income tax, which was an essential component of the Fraser federalism package. If the States will not make a serious attempt to raise enough revenue to compensate for the loss of Commonwealth grants, the outcome of this policy will be a reduction in State capital investments with the damaging short term macroeconomic effect of increasing unemployment and the more serious, but less easily perceived, long term damage resulting from a progressive rundown in the nation's public capital stock and social infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for this policy of squeezing the States, in particular in recent years, is the belief of the Government that lower levels of Commonwealth Government spending will lead to lower government or public sector borrowing requirements and, therefore, to a fall in interest rates. That, as the empirical record shows, is one of the many exercises in self-delusion by this Government. In fact, since 1977-78, public sector borrowing as a percentage of gross domestic product has fallen from 5.3 per cent to an estimated 3.6 per cent this year. That continuous and very substantial fall in public sector borrowing has been accompanied not by falling interest rates, as the Government's massive self-delusion leads it to believe, but by a continuing increase in interest rates. I hasten to add that I am not arguing that because those two things have happened-that is, a falling public sector borrowing requirement and rising interest rates-the increase in interest rates is caused by the falling public sector borrowing requirement. Of course, to argue that would be as absurd as to believe the Government's rationale. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point to illustrate that the situation is very much more complex than the simplistic dogma of this Government recognises. Interest rates have risen continuously since 1977-78 while the public sector borrowing requirement has fallen. Interest rates have risen notwithstanding the promise of the Prime Minister in the 1977 election campaign that: 'Interest rates will fall by 2 per cent over the coming year. It is a target that can and will be met.' In fact, since that promise of a 2 per cent fall in interest rates was given, interest rates have risen by between 3 and 4 per cent, depending on which type of interest rate one likes to examine. Indeed, in the unregulated market they have probably risen by a great deal more than 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, interest rates have not gone up for everyone because, as we know, there are a number of privileged people with access to the levers of political and administrative power in this country who have ensured that they pay interest rates of 4 1/2 per cent and 6 1/4 per cent. Senior Ministers of this Government, who granted themselves housing loans at those interest rates in 1964 and 1970, still have those loans, have made negligible repayments of the principal in each case and, 11 and 17 years respectively after they granted themselves the loans, still have them and still pay interest rates of 4 1/2 per cent and 6 1/4 per cent. Mr Anthony pays 4 1/2 per cent interest and Mr Nixon pays 6 1/4 per cent. If this Government is to have any moral credibility in the area of interest rates, if the Prime Minister had any sense of decency, the Government would demand at the very least that these interest rate bludgers-senior Ministers Anthony and Nixon, who are bludging on the rest of the community and on their fellow taxpayers-repay those loans immediately. Indeed, I suggest that given the high incomes and other privileges of these two senior Ministers a very strong case could be made for the Prime Minister going much further and instructing these interest bludgers to return the properties, the houses, to the taxpayers from whom they have been filched. </PARA>
<PARA> The deteriorating economic situation, which was flagged in the Budget and which appears to have deteriorated further since that time, and which has caused to a substantial degree this squeeze on funds to the States for capital purposes included in this legislation, has apparently caused the Government to reassess its position and to start looking around for some new policies to cope with the intensifying slow-down-if the rate is not actually negative-in the present rate of growth. The response which the Government has come up with is to go out on the Arab loan market in an attempt to borrow funds. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) yesterday tried to pass off this entry into the Arab loan market as 'a courtesy call', to use his words. He said it was simply a courtesy call by a senior official of the Australian Treasury on Saudi financial officials while he was passing through Riyadh on his way back from Switzerland. A courtesy call, if that is all it is, does not require Cabinet approval, as the Treasurer also acknowledged this visit had received. Nor, if it was simply a courtesy call, would there be any need for the extreme secrecy which has surrounded the whole operation. Nor would there be any need for the Treasury Secretary's reference, in his now famous letter, to the political sensitivity of this attempt to enter the Arab loan market. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim is simply not credible when one looks at the evidence produced by the Government. The evidence is that Cabinet approved this contact, that negotiations were conducted in secret-or at least the intention was that they be conducted in secret-and that the Treasury's Secretary referred to it as a matter of great political sensitivity. That situation is consistent not with a courtesy call; it is consistent with the behaviour of a government which is actually serious about raising money from Saudi Arabia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are valid reasons for secrecy and, of course, for Cabinet approval if a government is actually trying to borrow. There are no valid reasons for secrecy and there is no need for Cabinet approval if a government is simply sending a Treasury official to pay a courtesy call on officials of a foreign country for general discussions about the state of the world. Des Moore, Mr Williams, or whatever his name is, is quite clearly attempting to secure a chaffbag full of Saudi petro-dollars on behalf of this Government. There is other objective evidence that the Government could well be considering substantial overseas borrowings. The balance of trade is sick; it has been for several months. There is no indication that that is likely to change in the short term. Any realistic government would have, by now, revised downwards its expectations of capital inflow for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of those two factors, it is quite clear that intensifying pressure is emerging for a devaluation of the Australian dollar. It is more than conceivable that the Government would resist that by borrowing overseas. The state of the external account is fully consistent with an attempt to borrow substantial amounts overseas by a government which wanted to resist devaluation of the dollar. So, for all those reasons and in spite of the protestations of innocence of the Treasurer yesterday, the only reasonable conclusion is that the Government is making a serious attempt to borrow Saudi petro-dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister seeks to deny that, I invite her to tell the Senate whether it is standard practice for information about any Treasury official going to pay a courtesy call on a treasury official of another country, whether information about such a courtesy call has ever gone to Cabinet, and whether an attempt to maintain secrecy is consistent with a government which is serious about borrowing overseas or consistent with a government which is just going to have informal discussions with treasury officials from a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> Before closing, I want to make one point regarding the Premier of my State in respect of this legislation. When new federalism was first expounded by the present Prime Minister one of his strongest supporters was the Premier of Western Australia. Mr Fraser said that it entailed a devolution of power and greater responsibility. Sir Charles Court heard and heeded the reference to more power and either did not hear, or chose to ignore, the reference to greater responsibility. Sir Charles Court's interpretation of new federalism was that it would be a device to increase the power of the States without imposing any additional responsibility on the States. On that basis, Sir Charles Court, who is a devout believer in gaining more power but who consistently rejects the notion that he should accept any more responsibility to go with the power, was a strong supporter of Mr Fraser. He was deaf also to the advice of those among us which, of course, included me, who attempted to tell him as far back as 1975 and 1976 that if this policy were actually implemented it would have particularly severe financial consequences for Western Australia. Eventually, he woke up. He woke up last year. He said that if he had known that this was what new federalism was all about when it was first talked about in 1975 he would not have had a bar of it. Although the Senate has no realistic option but to support this legislation as the alternative to supporting the legislation is no capital grants to the States, I hope that the Senate also decides that it is time to tell the Fraser Government that it does not want any more of this degenerate, hybridised version of new federalism and shows its opinion by voting for the amendment that I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill deals with one-third of the States' Loan Council borrowing programs for 1981-82. Perhaps honourable senators ought to recall that the Loan Council, at its June meeting, approved a program for the State governments of $1,307.25m for 1981-82, of which borrowings comprised two-thirds, $871.5m, and one-third, $435.75m, is to be provided as capital grants to the States. These amounts are the same as those approved in 1980-81. Funds to the States from the Commonwealth Budget are estimated to total $12,791m in 1980-81, an increase of 8.5 per cent. This represents nearly one-third of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays this year. Payments to or for the States, in addition to the general purpose capital funds and borrowings, are expected to total $11,484m in 1981-82. It is interesting to note that all but $4,477m of this amount involves general purpose funds which may, of course, be spent by the States however they see fit, including on capital works projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Loan Council at its June meeting approved an increase in the larger State semi-government authorities borrowing programs of 11.2 per cent to $2,098.3m for 1981-82. This included infrastructure borrowings for such authorities of $806.7m. We are talking about sizeable figures-about one-third of the estimated Commonwealth budget outlays-when we are talking about grants to the States and Loan Council approvals relating to the States. In 1981-82 the package of funds to the States, including the Loan Council borrowing programs, has been carefully designed both within the constraints of the Commonwealth's continuing policy of responsible restraint on public sector spending and with a view to giving the States further flexibility in determining their own priorities. I note there is no opposition to the Bills in the Senate. I note also the amendment to this Bill that has been moved by the Opposition. The Government does not support the amendment but it thanks the Senate for the speedy passage of the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having read the Labor amendment moved by Senator Walsh, my first reaction is that I do not disagree with most of it. I am not adopting this attitude out of any personal petulance, but as a senator elected to this chamber I am not going to sit here for this entire debate, which I have done, have put on my desk an amendment which neither any member of my party nor I have been paid the courtesy of being warned that the Labor Party would move, and then be asked to support it on the run. I do not believe that that is the way in which a responsible senator ought to approach amendments to legislation in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After quickly looking at the wording of Senator Walsh's amendment, which has been approved by the Labor Party and of which we had no notice, I do not disagree with most of it. But on sheer principle, if there is a division on this matter-I am now informed there will be-I for one, and I am sure I speak for most of my colleagues, will not take a piece of paper being thrust in front of me by the Labor Party with the words: 'This condemns the Government. Will you support it?' We were not even asked that. We were not even told an amendment would be moved. That is not good enough. The same thing occurred earlier this afternoon when Senator Harradine moved an amendment to another Bill. No member of my Party, including me, received any notice of it. I do not think any member of the Labor Party received notice of his amendment. That is just not the way to go about getting co-operation in this chamber and proper consideration of the important business that is before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill 1981. The Australian Labor Party does not oppose this Bill but I intend to use this debate to outline some of the less satisfactory aspects of the disbursement of grants that have been made under previous legislation of a similar nature. I have outlined before in this chamber that I took a special interest in reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission after I become associated with the Commission as a public servant in Queensland. When I was working with one Queensland department I assisted in the preparation of documents which were submitted to the Grants Commission. These submissions, in addition to submissions from other Queensland government departments, were considered by the Commission when it was deciding what, if any, financial assistance should be made available to Queensland. On one occasion I appeared as a departmental witness and this gave me an even greater insight into the day to day workings of the Commission. That experience boosted my interest in the Commission's activities and I became even more interested in those reports of the Commission which specifically refer to Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Bill before the Senate is to authorise special grants totalling $58.5m to Queensland. These grants are the consequences of the recommendations of the Grants Commission's forty-eighth report. It is worth recalling that the Grants Commission was appointed in 1933. It made its first report in July the following year, mentioning applications made by South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The fact that the Commission has been in existence for about 50 years made the record of Parliament's total acceptance of its recommendations quite remarkable. Since being a member of the Senate I have been interested to hear every time a report of the Grants Commission is debated in relation to special grants to one or more States the following words in the Minister's second reading speech: 'The Commission's recommendations in relation to the special grants arrangements have been adopted by the Parliament since the Commission's inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion'. This practice should continue to be followed unless there are some exceptional circumstances which have not yet arisen in the 48 years of the Commission's existence. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator for Queensland, I wholeheartedly support the payment of $58.5m to Queensland, but I do have some reservations about the way in which previous grants have been used. I shall elaborate on those reservations at a later stage. The existence of the Commonwealth Grants Commission acknowledges that some States suffer financial disabilities in comparison with New South Wales and Victoria, often referred to in this context as the two standard States. In other words, it acknowledges the fact that within our federal system there is a financial inequality between the States. One of the tasks of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been to investigate this financial inequality when a request has been made for it to do so. It has structured its recommendations in such a way as to ensure that residents in the State investigated are able to enjoy services similar to those provided to their fellow Australians in the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. One of the strengths of our federation is that we can minimise inequalities between the States by using, amongst other measures, the Commonwealth Grants Commission. On the other hand, it is difficult for the Commonwealth to minimise inequalities within States. Some progress in this area has been made by way of funds payable under the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act. Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done in this regard. In general, given the provisions of the constitutional constraints under which the Federal Government operates, the States themselves are required to minimise the inequalities within their boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to understand why Queensland is at a disadvantage in relation to the two standard States. I shall outline some of those reasons. An examination of the populations of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria immediately reveals the disadvantage which confronts Queensland. In March this year the population of Queensland was 2.3 million, the population of Victoria was 3.9 million, and that of New South Wales was 5.2 million. One disadvantage that occurs as a consequence of the lower population of Queensland in comparison with Victoria and New South Wales is that Queensland has access to less taxation revenue. This is exacerbated by the relatively lower income per head of population in Queensland. For example, the household income per head of mean population in Queensland in 1979-80 was $6,328. In New South Wales the figure was $6,851 and in Victoria it was $6,798. It is interesting to note that the income per head in Queensland is lower than the total Australian average. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has Queensland a smaller population and a smaller per capita income, it also has a larger area than the two standard States. It is the second largest State in the Commonwealth. The area of Queensland is 1.7 million square kilometres, whereas Victoria has an area of only 0.2 million square kilometres and New South Wales 0.8 million square kilometres. When other factors are equal it is easier to provide services for a smaller population, but when that population is distributed over a large area the cost of providing those services becomes greater. In this regard it is well to recognise that Queensland is a highly decentralised State. Major areas of population extend from Brisbane to Cairns. There are large coastal or near coastal centres such as the cities of Gympie, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville. It is also worthwhile to note that there are some reasonable centres of population north of Cairns. Additionally, two major cities, Toowoomba and Mount Isa, are situated in inland Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast distances in Queensland are a function of the State's large area. To travel by air from Brisbane to the northern city of Cairns one covers a distance of 1,435 kilometres. That is a long way when compared with the distances in the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. One can go from Brisbane to another major city and travel even further than the Brisbane to Cairns distance I have mentioned. The distance by air between Brisbane and Mount Isa is 1,580 kilometres. To travel from Brisbane to Boigu Island, which is close to the Papua New Guinea border, one covers 2,315 kilometres-a distance far in excess of that from Brisbane to Melbourne. The fact that such vast distances separate the major centres of population puts Queensland at a disadvantage in providing services equivalent to those provided in the standard States. When the Commonwealth Grants Commission examines the case made by a claimant State it directs its attention to what are termed 'revenue needs' and 'expenditure needs'. Part of the forty-eighth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission referred to these two types of needs. In part, paragraph 1.7 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commission has compared the fiscal capacity of Queensland with that of New South Wales and Victoria, which are referred to as the standard States, taking into account differences in the revenue-raising capacity and differences in the cost of providing comparable services. Separate calculations are thus made from what the Comission refers to as revenue needs and expenditure needs respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>In determining these revenue and expenditure needs the Commonwealth Grants Commission conducts hearings at which it is able to elicit information about relevant disabilities which confront those who administer a claimant State. Naturally the Commission also uses any statistical data which are available to it. On 30 September 1971 Queensland applied for a special grant for the year 1971-72. Until recently it was the only claimant State to the Grants Commission. Queensland has withdrawn its application for special assistance for 1981-82 and now there are no claimant States. It is relevant to mention the other non-standard States and to indicate when they ceased to be claimant States. South Australia ceased to be a claimant State on 1 July 1975. This was a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments in relation to the transfer of the non-metropolitan South Australian railway system. Tasmania made, but later withdrew, applications for special grants for the years 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1977-78. In reality Tasmania ceased to be a claimant State in 1974. Tasmania's withdrawal as a claimant State was the result of other additional finances being made available to it. Western Australia was last a claimant State in 1968-69. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the Grants Commission determines revenue and expenditure needs for a claimant State. What the Grants Commission assessed to be the revenue needs for Queensland for 1979-80 are shown in its forty-eighth report. Queensland's revenue needs were grouped under two main headings-'Taxation' and 'Territorial Revenue'. Under the heading of 'Taxation' the Grants Commission assessed the revenue need for Queensland as being $86.077m. I refer those honourable senators who are interested in how this figure was determined to chapter 4 of the forty-eighth report. When territorial revenue was considered, however, there was a significant difference. The Grants Commission considered that in this case there was a negative need. In other words, Queensland had above standard revenue capacity in this area, due in part to royalties from black coal. </PARA>
<PARA> Its capacity to raise finance in this area was higher than that of the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. For territorial revenue the negative need was assessed at $38.72m. </PARA>
<PARA> The expenditure needs for Queensland were grouped under a number of headings. These were: 'Social services', 'Business Undertakings' and a group of miscellaneous expenditure items. these assessed expenditure needs were all positive. That is, Queensland was at a disadvantage in relation to the two standard States. Page 49 of the forty-eighth report outlines how the Commission arrived at a sum of $44.5m, which is the Commission's assessed grant for 1979-80. From this figure is subtracted $11m which was advanced earlier, but $25m is added as an advance for 1980-81. This provides a total grant of $58.5m, the amount being authorised by this Bill. Although I am pleased to see a sum of $58.5m being made available to the State which I represent I am concerned at the way that the Queensland Government has deliberately withheld from previous grants some funding which should have, morally at least, gone to the Brisbane City Council. I have outlined before in this chamber how the Queensland Government has behaved in an unbelievably immoral way in relation to the funds which it has received over recent years by way of various Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Acts. In some respects a more precise comment about the Queensland Government's actions would be that it is guilty of grand larceny. Even though I have mentioned this matter in this place before, I intend to outline some aspects of this action again today as the sorry tale bears repeating. </PARA>
<PARA> In making the assessment of expenditure needs for business undertakings the Commonwealth Grants Commission takes into account metropolitan road transport. Metropolitan transport in the Brisbane area is not a responsibility of the Queensland Government. It is a service provided by the Brisbane City Council. When Queensland became a claimant State in 1971 the Commonwealth Grants Commission took note of the fact that the Queensland Government did not provide public road transport in the Brisbane area. The two standard States, New South Wales and Victoria, are, however, responsible for public transport in their respective capital cities. The Commonwealth Grants Commission therefore recorded that in this area Queensland had a negative need. For instance, in 1973-74 the expenditure per capita for metropolitan road transport in the standard States was calculated at $5.23. The Grants Commission therefore determined that in relation to metropolitan road transport Queensland had a negative need of $5.23 per capita or a total of $10.171m. This latter amount was taken from the assessed needs of Queensland in determining the amount of grant which should be payable to that State. Naturally this meant that the Queensland grant suffered because metropolitan road transport was not a Queensland Government responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Late in 1975 at the request of the then Treasurer of Queensland, Sir Gordon Chalk, the Brisbane City Council made a submission to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. This submission requested that the Commission take into account the cost of the Council's transport undertaking in determining the State's grants allocation. The Commission agreed with the view that it would be consistent with its principles to take account of the costs incurred by the Brisbane City Council in assessing Queensland's needs. On page 74 of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's forty-third report the Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> Such an approach would more adequately show the financial consequences of a notional application of the metropolitan transport policies of the standard States. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that the road transport provided by the Brisbane City Council is quite significant. It carries about 150,000 passengers each normal working day. Over a whole year approximately 42 million passengers use the Brisbane City Council bus service. The service extends over 646 kilometres and travels about 20 million kilometres a year. The Brisbane City Council transport department has 537 buses, 829 drivers and a total staff of 1,438. The bus service operated by the Brisbane City Council carries 35 per cent more passengers than the suburban railway system, including rail passengers to and from the nearby city of Ipswich. The service, therefore, is a significant part of Brisbane's public transport system. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 as a result of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's taking into account the Brisbane City Council bus service, Queensland's grant was increased by $7.085m on account of the 1974-75 deficit of the Council's transport undertaking. This occurred because Queensland's assessed negative need per capita in relation to metropolitan road transport was no longer equated to the expenditure per capita in the standard States, as was the case prior to the time when costs incurred by the Brisbane City Council were not taken into account. I am informed that, at the time when Sir Gordon Chalk made his initial request for Council assistance in providing a submission to the Grants Commission, he undertook that, if the State was successful in extending its claim into this new field, it would be in a much better position to assist the Council with its urban transport losses. Unfortunately for the Counicl, Sir Gordon Chalk retired in August 1976. Nevertheless, in late 1976, when advice of the Grants Commission determination was received, the Council looked expectantly to the State for the promised assistance. No assistance was forthcoming and the incoming Treasurer, Mr Knox, now Sir William Knox, refused to acknowledge that these considerations by the Grants Commission had, in any way, increased Queensland's grant. Instead, the State Government pocketed the whole $7.085m. </PARA>
<PARA> In mid-1977, the Brisbane City Council became so exasperated with the Treasurer's repudiation of its claims that it sought some answers from Federal parliamentary sources in relation to the Grants Commission's funding. Answers were supplied by the then Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Withers. The questions and answers established beyond doubt the validity of the Council's claim and the legitimacy of its expectations in regard to the $7.085m. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of Senator Withers's letter to the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Sleeman, and the questions and answers in relation to the Commonwealth Grants Commission's funding. </PARA>

<PARA> By what amount was Queensland's assessed special grant for 1974-75 increased on account of the Brisbane City Council's Street Public Transport Undertaking modified deficit, being taken into account?</PARA>
<PARA>In part, the answer to question 4 (A) was: '$7,085,000'. In each of the years subsequent to 1975, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has taken into account the Brisbane City Council's transport undertaking. On each occasion, significant sums have been included in the grant to the State due to this bus service. As supporting evidence of my assertion, I refer honourable senators to the answer by the then Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon, in reply to a question in the House of Representatives asked by the honourable member for Griffith, Mr Humphreys. The answer appears in the House of Representatives Hansard for 9 May 1979 at page 2047. In part, the answer refers to losses made by the Brisbane City Council Transport Department. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Commission had not taken these losses into account the special grants recommended for payment would have been reduced as follows: 1974-75, $24m to $16.915m; 1975-76, $35.8m to $29.178m; and, 1976-77, $23.7m to $14.048m. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in each of the years mentioned in the answer to the question raised by the honourable member for Griffith, Mr Humphreys, Queensland would have received a significantly lower grant if the losses of the Brisbane City Council transport undertaking had not been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be noted that some funding has been made available to the Brisbane City Council transport service from the State Government since 1975-76. In 1975-76 and the following year, some funds were made available to assist in providing fare concessions for students. In 1977-78, a State Government scheme was introduced whereby a subsidy amounting to 50 per cent of fare collections was paid to the Council. Nevertheless, the subsidy in that and subsequent years fell far below the funds which the State Government received from the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I have outlined, in tabular form, the amounts which the Queensland Government has received by way of Commonwealth Grants Commission grants due to the inclusion of metropolitan road transport in the assessment of Queensland's financial needs. Also listed in the table are amounts which have been paid by the Queensland Government to the Brisbane City Council. The table is based on Commonwealth Grants Commission reports, Mr Nixon's answer, to which I referred a few moments ago, and information provided by the Parliamentary Library and the Brisbane City Council. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table reveals that in 1974-75 the Queensland Government received $7.085m because of the inclusion of metropolitan road transport in the assessment of Queensland's needs. In that year the Queensland Government passed nothing on to the Brisbane City Council. In 1975-76 and 1976-77 amounts of $6.622m and $9.652m respectively were included in the Queensland Government's assessed needs because of the metropolitan road transport factor. In those two years $900,000 and $1m respectively were passed on to the Brisbane City Council for fare subsidies for students. In 1977-78 $12.274m were paid to the State Government because of metropolitan road transport undertakings in Brisbane but only $4.886m were passed on to the Brisbane City Council. In 1978-79 the figures were $13.927m and $5.17m respectively. Finally, in 1979-80, the year discussed in the 48th report, which is the basis of the Bill before us, $16.3m were paid to the State Government because of the metropolitan road transport undertakings of the Brisbane City Council, but only $6.405m were passed on to the Council. I should mention at this stage that for 1979-80 a slightly different methodology was used by the Grants Commission. The figure of $16.3m which I mentioned for that particular year did not appear in the 48th report but was provided to me by the Grants Commission through the Parliamentary Library.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one examines the table it is possible to see that between 1974-75 and 1979-80 Commonwealth funds made available to the State Government because of Brisbane City Council metropolitan transport undertakings totalled $65.86m. In the same period the State Government funded the Brisbane City Council for its transport undertakings to the tune of $18.361m; that is, about $47m stayed in the coffers of the Queensland Government. What this means is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission has recommended that funds be paid to the Queensland Government for metropolitan road transport but that those funds have not been passed on to the operators of the metropolitan transport, namely, the Brisbane City Council. Whilst there is no legal basis under the legislation we are now debating for certain funds to be passed on to the Brisbane City Council, there is certainly a moral obligation on the Queensland Government to do so. Many political observers would understand that sometimes in the current government in Queensland-one which owes its present majority to a severely malapportioned system of electorates-almost anything goes. It is, of course, noteworthy that the major party in the coalition Government in Queensland, the National Party, does not have one seat in the Brisbane metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> This account that I have given in relation to the way the Queensland Government has withheld funds from the Brisbane City Council is just one more example of the way the Queensland Government operates. It must feel very smug when it reflects on how, in the last six years, it has received $65.86m because of the Brisbane City Council's bus operations but it has passed on only $18.361m to the bus operators. A cool $47.499m has been socked away because of a clear disregard of a moral obligation of the Queensland Government. I have brought this information before the Senate to make it possible for honourable senators to see the way in which Commonwealth funds are being misapplied by the Government of Queensland. I do not oppose the passage of this legislation because I am anxious to see the recommended funds go to the State which I represent. I do, however, strongly condemn the Queensland Government for withholding funds which rightfully belong to the Brisbane City Council or, to put it another way, to the citizens and ratepayers of Brisbane. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill 1981, which gives $58.5m in 1981-82 as special grants in respect of 1979-80 and 1980-81 on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It is my pleasure to make some comments in this debate on behalf of Queensland. As has already been established in the debate, the basis of the grant is established by the Grants Commission. Factors taken into account in assessing the grant are the tax raising capacity of Queensland and the cost of providing government services throughout Queensland. There have been previous debates in the Senate-I must admit not this debate-in which it has been suggested that Queensland receives too much from Federal Government revenues and there ought to be some equalising process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to canvass all those issues tonight. I shall if invited, of course, but it was not my intention when I rose to speak to canvass all those issues. The simple fact is that Queensland has some special grounds for claiming special assistance via the Grants Commission. The amount provided in this Bill is the amount recommended by that independent body. Of the two bases for the grant, the cost of providing government services in Queensland is, of course, very large. Two factors are involved, the size of the State and the distribution of the population. Size in itself is not the total factor. The fact that we have a population of approximately two and a half million spread throughout our State, which is one-fifth the area of Australia, makes it very difficult for government to provide services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Decentralisation of industry and population is something that we all claim to espouse in Australia today. We need to face the fact that certain costs come with it. Queensland is a highly decentralised State. It has significant townships spread throughout its area. Those townships are growing as Queensland develops. That means that certain extra provisions must be sought. The State Government does its own bit in the development of Queensland in providing some of the costs of that development. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some criticisms, particularly from certain industries, about the fact that industries are required to pay infrastructure costs and high royalties as they develop in Queensland. Nevertheless, they obviously find it very profitable to develop those industries in Queensland or they would not be there. It is reasonable to expect that certain infrastructure costs should be borne by industries and not by government, either State or Federal, because those industries go to certain parts of Queensland in order to develop profitable prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax raising capacity of Queensland is also limited. In a previous debate on the subject in the Senate I drew the attention of honourable senators to some of these factors. Queensland has been in receipt of a special grant from the Commonwealth on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in every year since 1971-72. These special grants are assessed only after comprehensive inquiry, with evidence under oath, by this expert independent body. They are based on a direct comparison between Queensland and the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Western Australians speak very well for themselves. Queensland has been assessed as being entitled to supplementary assistance because of its relative fiscal position compared with New South Wales and Victoria. Further, whilst it is true that Queensland has no statutory corporation payments, no petrol tax, no tobacco tax and no probate duty whatsoever, the Grants Commission through its procedures calculates the notional revenue for Queensland based on the taxation rate applicable in the standard States. In other words, it assesses what Queensland would raise if it had those taxes and incorporates this in the assessment it makes of Queensland's revenue and expenditure needs. It even calculates the revenue that Queensland would raise if it had poker machines-perish the thought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland has over the past decade received no more than its just entitlement from tax sharing. It has been able to achieve this only through constant application for grants and special assistance which entail a great deal of extra work and submission to searching inquiry from the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Of course, the matter of taxation assessment is not the whole story of Queensland and its claim to certain consideration under Commonwealth Government financial arrangements. The contribution of Queensland to the Australian economy as a whole is very great. It is because of the contribution that States such as Queensland and Western Australia make that all Australians enjoy a high standard of living. It is a pity that credit is not given to that fact by other States. I think the claims that some other States have to special consideration in matters relating to things such as tariffs would have more credibility if they would take a national view of the situation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to Senator Missen that it is Victoria that is complaining. While States receive a percentage of personal income tax back from the Commonwealth, their contribution to Commonwealth revenues to the economy generally can be far greater than personal income tax alone. In this regard profits from unsubsidised industries in Queensland and Western Australia add significantly to national economic wealth, as do the substantial export earnings generated again by both Queensland and Western Australia. Indeed, if it were not for the export surpluses that Queensland and Western Australia earn, we could not afford the tariffs which presently obtain so advantageously for Victoria. Overall, Queensland is not a favoured State. As has been pointed out in debates since 1971-72 it has been claiming special consideration from the Commonwealth Grants Commission and has been receiving special grants. As I have pointed out these are assessed on an objective basis which has no disadvantage at all for any of the other non-claimant States. In fact there are certain inherent disadvantages for Queensland in that taxes which do not normally apply in all States in Australia are taken into account in assessment of the amount of money Queensland should receive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of specific purpose payments and borrowing programs Queensland does not receive an advantage.

Under 'Works and borrowing programs' Queensland again ranks third with 17.3 per cent. So, there is no inherent advantage for Queensland in those areas either. I take the opportunity to make a couple of comments in general terms about the economic position in which Queensland finds itself relative to other States. In fact, the subject to which I particularly refer, a subject about which I have not had an opportunity to say anything since Senator Siddons became a member of this chamber, is the subject of tariffs which has been raised in the Senate in a number of ways in recent times. I will refer to tariffs only briefly. Nevertheless, it is a subject of quite some active debate. I think it is relevant in this context because the subsidies to States and to individuals within States, in the form of tariffs, are not factors which are taken into account in assessing the relative economic positions of States, in particular Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

If he did he would know that in pure dollar terms industry in Victoria is subsidised through tariff protection to the extent of over $750m annually. The Bill we are debating tonight about Queensland concerns a grant of only $58.5m and that is for two separate amounts of assistance. Looked at in another way, Victoria receives tariff assistance estimated in 1977-78 at $430 a head, compared with the Australian average of $289 a head, Queensland, receives only $123 a head. Again, Victoria has 27 per cent of the population but receives 41 per cent of total tariff assistance. Queensland has 16 per cent of the population but receives only 7 per cent of total tariff assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point that out just briefly to show that many Government policies can favour States. Queensland is not favoured in the grant made in this legislation or in any of the other programs to which I have referred. Other States are favoured in certain ways. Other States can argue their case. Nobody would debate the right of Senator Missen or Senator Siddons to put forward Victoria's case in this chamber; in fact, we would welcome their using the Senate, the States House, as a forum. However, I think they have to realise that when they do that they will meet a reply from honourable senators from other States. Senator Missen and Senator Siddons and people in their States ought to recognise that it is States such as Queensland that enable the workers in their States to enjoy the high incomes and high standard of living that they do enjoy. </PARA>

It would suit Queensland if tariffs were lifted, not only because certain goods would be cheaper, but also because Queensland industries could employ more people. We would then have that broader tax base that Victoria so earnestly seeks in its submissions to government and we would be given special consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point ought to be made that Queensland is not being given special consideration in this grants legislation, as the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, pointed out in her second reading speech. She pointed out that the total amount of $58.5m consists of a completion payment for 1979-80 and an advance payment of $25m in respect of 1980-81 and that Queensland requested an advance grant only towards the end of 1980-81 after the Commonwealth Grants Commission's methodology for its review on tax sharing relativities and the processes surrounding the review became known. The completion payment in respect of 1980-81 will be assessed by the Commission in 1982-83. I do not wish to be unduly charitable to my colleagues on both sides of the chamber from that very worthy State of Victoria. I know that they came into the chamber because they thought they might learn something. I hope my speech has assisted them a little further in their understanding of what this country needs. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is surely something of an irony that the contents of this Bill were originally drafted by the Fraser Government. Before the last election the Government, in consultation with employers and unions, agreed on a program according to which the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would be amended to more easily facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions where there was a community of interest. That was a course of action which had been worked out over some years. It was acceptable to trade unions. It was acceptable to employers. It was accepted widely in the community as one of the very few constructive proposals by this Government, in the industrial relations area. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly it became part of the Fraser Government's bold new program for re-election in 1980. This is what Mr Street said in the House of Representatives on 18 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA>If elected the Government would move to facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Street went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The new amalgamation provisions are yet another demonstration of how the Government is meeting its responsibility to provide an industrial relations framework which takes account of the views of the parties and meets their needs, while paying due regard to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his policy speech for that election last year, said this:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposes to . . . legislate to facilitate the amalgamation of unions where there is a 'community of interest'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill I am moving is a Bill which seeks mainly to give effect to a report of the National Labour Consultative Council. The National Labour Consultative Council is a creature of the Fraser Government. That Government created it. Over a year ago the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Street, speaking of the National Labour Consultative Council and its work on union amalgamations said:</PARA>
<PARA>This achievement shows that government, employers, unions can work together and produce tangible results for the benefit of each other and the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I began by commenting on the irony of a situation where it was left to the Opposition to introduce legislation into this Parliament which the Government has promised. There is an irony also in the fact that the Government has, in the past year, done many things which it either did not mention, or specifically promised not to do. The Government has, for example, amended the Broadcasting and Television Act to accommodate large corporate interests. It has sought to introduce fees for education. It has dramatically increased indirect taxes. The Government did all those things without any promises before an election. Here it has a commitment, a promise, but we get no action.</PARA>
<PARA> That irony is compounded by the fact that just six years ago the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition blocked legislation to facilitate union amalgamation-legislation prepared by the then Labor Government. Only five years after that it had the hide to tell the electorate about its 'constructive' approach to trade union amalgamation. It has long been recognised that Australia has too many trade unions. As a result of the sheer number of trade unions and as a result of the sometimes uneasy demarcations between their responsibilities, a number of unfortunate consequences have flowed. Many industrial disputes arise between rival unions about demarcation issues. Rational approaches to wage fixation are often frustrated or made more difficult by union demarcation disputes and the number of unions. In December 1976 there were 282 trade unions in Australia. The nine largest unions accounted for 39 per cent of total union membership and 51 unions accounted for 87 per cent of the membership. </PARA>
<PARA> A reduction in the number of unions through amalgamations and the reorganisation of unions on an industrial basis will have advantages for union members and for the community in general including, in many cases, employers. These advantages will include the following: Firstly, the greater resources of the amalgamated union will allow the provision of a wider and an improved range of services to the members as well as more effective representation in the conciliation and arbitration system. Secondly, fewer unions will mean easier lines of communications between employers and employees. Instead of having to negotiate with several bodies representing employees, employers will only have to deal with one body. This may lead to better relations and greater understanding between employers and unions. Thirdly, employers and the community will benefit from union amalgamations as a reduction in the number of unions will mean fewer demarcation disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, Part VIIIA of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides a code dealing with amalgamation of registered organisations. When two or more organisations propose to amalgamate, they must submit a detailed scheme to the Industrial Registrar setting out the particulars of the proposed amalgamation. This scheme is catered for by certain sections of the Act and by regulations made under it. The Registrar examines the scheme and, upon being satisfied that it is in conformity with the Act and the regulations and that any valid ground of objection to the amalgamation has been removed, approves the submission of the scheme of amalgamation to a ballot of the members of each of the organisations involved. Unless an exemption from the ballot requirement has been granted, the amalgamation may proceed only if it has been approved at the ballots. The amalgamation is not taken to have been approved unless, in each ballot, firstly, ballot papers are returned, on or before the closing date, by at least one half of the members on the roll of voters and, secondly, more than one half of the members who record formal votes vote in favour of the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> Those provisions have created a number of serious practical difficulties. The main difficulties arise out of the requirement in section 158N that at least one half of the eligible members must vote in an amalgamation ballot before the proposed amalgamation will be taken to have been approved. This is an unreasonable requirement for two reasons. Firstly, it encourages the opponents of a proposed amalgamation not to vote in the amalgamation ballot, as not voting may be a more effective way of blocking the amalgamation than in fact voting against it. In this way the desire of the majority of union members who have formed a view on the issue of amalgamation may be frustrated by a well-organised minority, something about which I understood this Government to be very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objection to the section 158N requirement is that it calls for a higher return rate of ballot papers in amalgamation ballots than is achieved in many ordinary union elections. For example, in 42 per cent of the elections conducted by the Industrial Registrar or the Electoral Office under section 170, less than one half of the members entitled to vote did so. In recent years the return rate has declined. In other words, section 158N requires a higher return rate in amalgamation ballots than is achieved in more than 40 per cent of ordinary union elections. </PARA>
<PARA> If unions are required to obtain at least a 50 per cent return in amalgamation ballots, they must conduct an expensive and time-consuming campaign, not aimed at how a member votes but merely to get a vote returned. Many unions simply do not have the financial and physical resources to risk on such a venture. Obviously that is a particularly bad problem for unions with a high turnover of members. Where members leave employment and consequently lose interest in the affairs of the union, they are very unlikely to vote in an amalgamation ballot, although they will be counted for the purposes of the 50 per cent return of ballot papers threshold requirement of section 158N. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the above problems, the present legislation fails to deal adequately with the situation where more than two unions propose to amalgamate. Where a scheme of amalgamation between, say, three unions is submitted to ballots of the members of those unions, the whole scheme will fail should any one of the unions fail to secure the required membership 'approval'; for example, if the requirements of section 158N are not met. The effect is to frustrate the efforts of the unions which have obtained the necessary membership support for amalgamation, and to require them once again to go through the long, expensive and complicated process laid down by the Act in order to bring about an amalgamation. Further, the present position of the law discourages and delays attempts to form industry based unions by adding another pitfall in the procedure which must be followed to effect an amalgamation between more than two unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill seeks to give effect to the National Labour Consultative Council recommendations in the following ways. Firstly, clause 7 provides for a proposed new section 158FA under which the Full Bench would declare a proposed scheme of amalgamation to be in the public interest. That is the first requirement. It shall do so if substantial numbers of members of one union are eligible for membership of another, or they are engaged in similar work and/or bound by the same awards. Secondly, when such a declaration of public interest is made a proposed new section 158N will apply. Thirdly, section 158K of the principal Act is amended by clause 11 of the Bill to provide that the roll of voters for an amalgamation ballot would be those persons who were eligible to vote in accordance with the rules of the union as at one month before the opening date of the ballot. </PARA>
<PARA> The old sub-sections 158 (4) and (5) which have caused considerable problems in the past are repealed. Clauses 11 and 14 add proposed new sub-section 158K (1A) and section 158PA. Those sections will help facilitate arrangements in the case of proposed amalgamations of more than two unions. The amended act will provide that where three or more unions propose to amalgamate, members would be able to vote on alternative forms of amalgamation, and so avoid the need, where the members of one union fail to approve the amalgamation, for the entire amalgamation process to be gone through again by the remaining unions. In addition, clause 11, paragraphs (G), (H) and (J), changes the present requirement concerning exemption from amalgamation ballots. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing arrangements as outlined in the sections referred to, if a small union seeks to amalgamate with a union which is approximately 20 or more times larger than itself, the Registrar may permit an amalgamation upon a successful ballot being held in the small union-that is, the Registrar may exempt the larger union from the requirements of a ballot. That provision is a legislative recognition of the need to encourage small unions to amalgamate. It has been necessary to invoke it in every successful amalgamation since the present regime on amalgamations was established. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has seen fit to add a further requirement that the smaller union have less than 5,000 members. It did not take that proposal to the National Labour Consultative Council. So much for the attitude of this Government to consultation. Nevertheless, the Opposition has included the provision of the Bill as drafted by the Government because it wishes the Government to pass its own Bill. </PARA>

In the same year, the average number of days lost per 1,000 employees in West Germany, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden was 30.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Button introduced his very important piece of legislation on union amalgamations, the Senate discussed and agreed to pass the Queensland State grant legislation which was the product of consideration by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill seeks to amend the composition of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It was interesting to hear Government senators in that earlier debate refer to the Senate as a States House. That is an admission that we have not had from Government senators for a considerable period. I make it clear that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. However, we do have a number of comments to make on the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill relating to the tasks of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. This Bill allows the Commission to carry out those tasks. I will refer also to the delay that the Government has caused to the ability of the Commission to perform these tasks. The presentation of this legislation has been an on and off affair, like the working of an automatic refrigerator. In fact this on-off situation existed this evening. After almost a month, this legislation, which is designed to provide processes by which the Commmonwealth Grants Commission can carry out the tasks allocated to it by the Government, has finally reached a stage where it will be given consideration by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the Bill amends the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act which was passed in 1973 by the Government of which you were a member. The Commission is an important process in our system by which the problems associated with Commonwealth-State relations are properly arbitrated and properly determined. One thought that continually comes to my mind about the Commonwealth Grants Commission, particularly concerning the years 1975 to 1980, is that we were constantly regaled in this chamber by Senator Carrick about the virtues of the new co-operative federalism which was to be the answer to all of the problems of the Commonwealth-State financial relationship. I think I would be correct in saying that since the last election in 1980, more than a year ago, I have not heard Senator Carrick mention the words 'co-operative federalism' in this place. This shows how much it has faded from the consciousness of the Government. That is indicated by the way in which this legislation has been on the Notice Paper for the past month. It is an indication that the States are put in a mendicant position, from which they have to rely on the Commonwealth and its good graces to get adequate funds to carry out their proper functions. It is very pleasing to hear Government senators talk about the Senate being a States House, a point that this side of the Parliament has constantly attempted to make over the last 10 or 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to increase the number of members on the Commission. To that extent, it is not a Bill that has any great significance, except that it provides the machinery base for the Commission to work more effectively. It removes the upper limit on the number of commissioners so that the Commission can now be comprised of sufficient members to enable it to conduct an inquiry into Australian Capital Territory finances and review its report on State tax sharing entitlements for use by the Premiers Conference when it meets in June 1982. I remind the Senate that, when we talked about Australian Capital Territory finances in the early part of this session-we are now just one day from the end of the session-we criticised the Government's failure to take the essential steps to have the Australian Capital Territory finances properly examined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. That just shows that we could go through a whole session before the Government acts. It is such an inept and lazy Government that I got to the stage, as the shadow Minister in charge of this legislation, of wondering whether we would deal with the legislation at all. In the second reading speech on this Bill we were told very little about the background to which I referred. As members of this Senate would be aware, the States have varying capacities to raise revenue and the cost of providing services also varies widely between the States. We had some indication of that in the debate on the previous legislation this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore the Commonwealth Grants Commission has an important function because the Commonwealth allocates its tax sharing payments to the States in a way which takes account of these variables I have referred to which are important from the point of view of the allocation of funds. The Grants Commission in the past has been given the task of determining these State tax sharing relativities. In 1978 the Commission was asked to determine whether any change was desirable in the factors which are used to adjust State population as the first step in the process of calculating the percentage distribution among the States of the total tax sharing entitlements. The Grants Commission, after careful analysis, submitted a comprehensive report to the Government on 9 June this year. That is almost five months ago, just before that important 1981 Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the changes in the tax sharing relativities proposed by the Commission would have been to increase the proportion received by New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland and to reduce the proportions received by the smaller States-South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. I surely do not have to remind the Senate of the hullabaloo that occurred and the concern that was expressed by the governments of those smaller States. The task, of course, was such that the Government reacted to the criticisms by the State Premiers and sent the issue back to the Commission. In other words now what the Commission will be required to do as one of its tasks, as a result of the carrying of this amendment, is to review its own report which, I suppose, is just another way of saying that we pass the buck back to the Commission. By neglecting to describe the background of the Bill the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) also managed to neglect to refer to the fact that the Bill is long overdue. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, for example, announced on 21 June-that is quite some time ago considering the number of sitting days we have had in this spring session-that the Grants Commission would be asked to produce a further report on its assessment of State relativities and to present this report early in 1982. However, the matter has only now been referred to the Grant's Commission, four months after the Treasurer's announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> This totally unexplained delay in making the references will now make it impossible for the Commission, having regard to this time lag I referred to, to report early in 1982, unless it will be working over the Christmas period. That was an agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States. The Commission is now being asked, as a result of this slowness by the Government, to report by 31 May 1982. I believe, and the Opposition believes, that the Commission will need every day of the next seven months adequately to prepare its report by that date. The States and the Commonwealth will have too little time after receiving the report to evaluate it carefully before it has to be discussed at the June 1982 Premiers Conference. One can imagine the state of disarray and confrontation. The States and the Commonwealth will be locked in conflict. As a result, conflict between the States and the Commonwealth is as inevitable as night following day. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of the review of the Australian Capital Territory finances, there has been the delay I referred to. On many matters that have been before us-the Australian Capital Territory stamp duty legislation and the like-the Opposition has sought to take the matter of finances in the Australian Capital Territory to the Grants Commission. Yet every time we have raised the matter in the Parliament the Government has said nothing and done nothing; that is until now, when we have this legislation before us. There is no question-no one denies it-that the Australian Capital Territory's finances are in a state of disarray and do require the assistance of a Commonwealth Grants Commission inquiry. Residents of the Australian Capital Territory have no influence whatsoever over these chaotic finances. They have no system of self-government like that of residents of all the Australian States. So all that Australian Capital Territory residents can do is to pay the same sorts of taxes as those in the States and hope that they will be used effectively and efficiently. There is a need for the Australian Capital Territory to move towards a system of self-government and the findings of the Commission on the finances of the Australian Capital Territory would be very important in this regard. However, the Government keeps hedging around the issues because of the failure of the Australian Capital Territory to resolve this matter itself when it had it on the agenda a year or two ago. I understand that the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, has been referring for some time to the possibility of a Commission inquiry; yet to date no terms of reference have been set up. At least the intention to go ahead with the inquiry has now been made public by the moving of the amendment before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of self-government is even further off than it should be. In October last the Minister had this to say at a seminar on self-government for the Australian Capital Territory:</PARA>
<PARA> I have said it before, but let me say it again today. Some form of 'self-government' will be developed for the Territory. I cannot say when, nor should I speculate upon the degree and type of devolution... </PARA>
<PARA> I want the financial issues clearly understood before any decisions are taken. This is the reason I have placed such importance on the Grants Commission Inquiry into Territorial Finances. </PARA>
<PARA> This dilly-dallying, this delay, has in fact impeded the development of devolution of power in the Australian Capital Territory. I am sure that that sort of explanation is just not good enough for the residents of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Government dilly-dallied, why has it delayed the passage of this legislation when it knew that it had the support of the Opposition, when it knew that it had only to bring the Bill forward and allow a very short debate on the matter? The Commission could have been organised in such a way as to have been carrying out its function in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. The people in the Australian Capital Territory believe they have been disadvantaged. Whether that is so, of course, has to be established. The reconstituted Commonwealth Grants Commission will have that responsibility to do so given to it once this Bill receives the assent of the Senate this evening. So all the Opposition can say is that it regrets the delay in the Government bringing this Bill to the Senate. Nevertheless, we will continue to give it our support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a proposal brought foward by Senator Haines to amend the Banking Act 1959. On behalf of the Government I say that whilst the objectives of this Bill are most worthy in themselves, the Bill would be ineffective in achieving those objectives. Indeed, the amendment proposed to the Banking Act 1959 would have the effect of disrupting the provision of finance for housing through the banking system and harming those it seeks to help. The amendment would be intended essentially to contain increases in all bank interest rates to 0.5 per cent in any six-monthly period unless both Houses of Parliament otherwise decided and, for new first home buyers, to rule out any increase in the rate of interest for at least five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate seeks to impose in the housing area additional rigid, arbitrary interest rate controls which would exacerbate those problems which were recently identified by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. I am sure that that is not the intention of the proponents of the Bill but it would be its inevitable effect. No government, including this Government, welcomes increases in interest rates, particularly where they affect people buying their own homes or where the operations of small business are affected. However, because there are certain market realities that have to be faced, governments that pretend that they can achieve the utopia of unrealistically low interest rates through pursuing easy options only cause much greater economic difficulty for the people they are elected to serve and in the long run only stimulate much higher inflation and much higher interest rates. Nothing that I have said implies that there is not at times some balance to be sought between maintaining a reasonably flexible and efficient financial system and the particular needs and problems of certain participants in the system. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) highlighted the need for such a balance in his statement when he tabled the Campbell report. My remarks have been directed towards a Bill which I believe would dramatically upset the balance to the cost of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make some reference to the assertion in Senator Haines's second reading speech that banks would be to some extent compensated for the cost of the lending interest rate controls by a proposed amendment to the Income tax Assessment Act. Whilst that amendment, if passed, would no doubt attract some funds to banks and buildings societies, it would also create a number of important problems. Some of these would be that the effective benefits of the scheme would relate, inequitably, to savers' marginal rates of tax with higher income earners receiving the greater benefits. There is no guarantee that lenders would apply all or most of any resulting increases in deposits to low or pegged interest housing lending if they had more attractive alternative investments. Yet another incentive for income splitting would be opened up. It would distort flows of funds in financial markets and resource allocation to the detriment of overall economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not see this Bill as being consistent with its economic strategy, with fundamental economic logic or with recent practical experience. Indeed, it would very likely prove counterproductive for those it purports to assist. The Government therefore cannot support this Bill that has been brought forward by Senator Haines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill which was introduced by Senator Haines some three months ago seeks to transfer the regulation making power, which includes the power over certain interest rates which is currently contained in section 50 of the Banking Act, from the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Parliament or, in the jargon which is used in these cases, to the Governor-General. It seeks to add to existing section 50 of section 50A which requires that regulations be made to ensure, firstly, that no increase in interest rates for housing loans for first home buyers be allowed for the first five years of the duration of a loan and, secondly, that no increase in any interest rate for a housing loan may be greater than one-half of one per cent in any six month period without the permission of Parliament. The area of housing loan finance, to which this Bill would have application, involves much less than half of the total housing finance market. I will say more about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want firstly to say something about the technical aspects of the Bill. Sub-clause (2) of clause 4 of the Bill states that if regulations are not made within 90 days section 50 and the proposed new section 50A of the Banking Act is repealed. The legal advice which I have been given regarding the sub-clause states:</PARA>
<PARA>This sub-clause tends to take away the obligatory tones of sub-clause 4 (1), by saying that if the Governor-General does not make regulations then section 50 is repealed anyway. By inserting this provision, the Bill has the effect of also repealing its own amendment to section 50 in clause 5, which is the clause that gives the Governor-General his regulation-making power. </PARA>
<PARA>Returning to the Bill itself, I refer to sub-clause 4 (1), which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Within 90 days after the commencement of this Act, regulations shall be made under section 50 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act in accordance with section 50A of the Principal Act as amended by this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>As a layman, I would have thought that if a clause said that regulations shall be made within 90 days, it would be mandatory that such regulations be made. However, a legal opinion has been provided to me and, as a layman, I do not feel inclined to take issue with lawyers on technical matters such as that. If the opinion which has been given is correct and if this Bill becomes law, a government could remove from the Banking Act the power to regulate interest rates at all simply by doing nothing for more than 90 days. In other words, it would provide a mechanism for enacting by inertia the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. Certainly the Australian Labor Party does not want to see that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the legal problem which has been identified for me, the whole issue of interest rate regulation is now very uncertain. It is in a state of flux following the presentation of the Campbell report last week. To the extent that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), in characteristic Country Party style, has been running around Australia pre-empting Cabinet decisions-as the Country Party normally does-in regard to what action the Government will take on the recommendations of the Campbell Committee, and given that we have a closet Country Party Prime Minister, certain decisions have already been made prior to Cabinet even having considered the Campbell report. But not all decisions have yet been pre-empted by Mr Anthony and it would be inappropriate to make one small adjustment to the finance policy area when massive upheavals might well be in the pipeline if the Government is to adopt any number of the more substantial recommendations of the Campbell Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point is that according to page 633 of the Campbell report the area of housing finance to which this Bill applies, which includes savings banks and trading banks-I add that the State Savings Bank would be excluded-accounts for only 46.8 per cent of total lending for housing finance. That comes from a table in the Campbell report. It could be argued that the figure is considerably less than that because the Campbell Committee estimated that $5 billion-I must say I was astounded by that figure-is at present on loan from solicitors' trust accounts for housing finance. When account is taken of that figure the proportion of the total housing finance market to which this Bill would have application is less than 40 per cent. That obviously raises the question of whether it is sensible to bind less than 40 per cent of the total housing finance market in the way proposed by this Bill if more than 60 per cent is not regulated at all. It could cripple the 40 per cent which is controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a particular problem in the provision in the Bill which seeks to fix for a five-year term the interest rate on loans to first home buyers. If a substantial part of any financial institution's total business were to be tied up in five-year fixed interest loans it would be essential for those institutions to match their lending and borrowing requirements, with the requirement that borrowing also at a fixed interest rate, otherwise the institution would be running a grave risk of becoming insolvent. Perhaps I should expand just briefly on that proposition. Let us suppose that an institution had 50 per cent of its total lending funds on loan to first home buyers within the first five years of the loan and therefore at a fixed interest rate. Let us then suppose that the general market interest rates lifted by 3 per cent or 4 per cent, as they have done in the last 18 months or two years. Presumably, if the deposits with that institution were held on short term or even at call, as they normally are, there would be a flight of depositors' funds out of that institution, which would then lead very quickly to insolvency by the institution. It would not be able to pay out the depositors' funds because its finances would be tied up. It could not redeem the loans that it had made and it could not increase to a significant extent the interest rate on depositors' funds because it could not increase the interest rate on the money that it had out on loan. </PARA>
<PARA> As we see it the Bill, at best, is a palliative and not an answer to the present record interest rates which, as Senator Haines correctly pointed out, are both crippling a substantial proportion of existing home buyers and preventing a very large proportion of potential home buyers from entering the market at all. This, Bill however, does not answer that problem. Even if all the difficulties to which I have drawn attention could be overcome, at best it provides a palliative for something that gnaws away at the fringes. The only answer to the problem is, of course, the removal of the Fraser Government, which has presided over this unprecedented increase in interest rates to record levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that all of the points I have raised could be seen to suggest that the Bill should be rejected at the second reading stage, but the Opposition sees some merit in some of the propositions which are canvassed-with or without a Fraser Government. We have some interest in further exploring the proposal that interest rates be fixed to the borrower, although recognising that if a loan represents a significant proportion of a building society's total business, the deposits held by that society will have to be matched both in interest rates and in the term of deposit with the society's lending policies. I understand that some building societies are interested in experimenting in some innovation in this area. We of the Opposition believe that such innovation ought to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, although this matter goes beyond the scope of this Bill, a proposition worthy of serious consideration is that the interest rate charged to a borrower and the interest rate paid to a lender by a financial institution could be fixed at a very much lower level, perhaps as low as around 2 per cent, provided that the outstanding principle or the deposit is indexed each year in accordance with the increase in the consumer price index so that the real rate of interest would be known at the time of the deposit and the real value of the loan would be maintained permanently. The present arrangements with high nominal interest and inflation rates for the repayment of housing loans lead to a situation in which there is de facto an early repayment of loans although the real burden of the repayment is concentrated in the early years of the loan and in the later years of the loan, given the continuing high rates of inflation, the repayments at the end of 30 years become almost negligible. Obviously that sort of repayment condition, although not intended and not deliberately planned by anyone, leads to a situation whereby it is extremely difficult for a very large number of borrowers to meet their commitments in the early years of a loan. For those reasons I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'this Bill to be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for inquiry and report on the provisions of the Bill by 31 May 1982.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 August this year I gave notice of my intention to introduce the Banking Amendment Bill 1981. On the following day I introduced the Bill and made my second reading speech. That was some three months ago. In the intervening period the matters which are the subject of this Bill have not been far from the minds of the people in the electorate, the people in the community; nor have they been very far from the political stage. A number of meetings have been held across the country. The last that I recall was held on the first Saturday of this month. That was a fully co-ordinated national meeting of people complaining about constantly rising interest rates. I spoke at a number of those meetings. Australian Labor Party members and senators spoke at a number of those meetings. Liberal Party senators and members also spoke at them. On a number of occasions we shared the stage. The Opposition in this place and Ministers in State Houses, of all political persuasions, have kept up a constant barrage of criticism against the present Federal Government for not taking immediate action to do something about the high interest rates-a situation which is forcing more and more people out of their homes and making it more and more difficult for those who would like to buy or to build a home to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to remind honourable senators that an interest rate increase of one per cent is, in actual repayment rates to the people concerned, an increase of 8 per cent. In other words, if they have a mortgage which requires a repayment of $300 a month and the interest rate goes up by one per cent, their repayment goes up to $324 a month, which is an increase of 8 per cent-an intolerable increase. All that has happened over the past 16 months to two years, over which time interest rates have risen on at least four occasions, is that the Opposition has been complaining constantly and demanding that something be done by the Government. It has done nothing more concrete than that. It asked questions, it pestered, it raised matters of public importance. It got out on the hustings and raised the issue, but it did not do anything concrete. The action, the movement to do something positive to help people like the young couples living in the Adelaide suburbs of Elizabeth to the north and Hallett Cove to the south, for instance, was left to the Australian Democrats. The machinery for doing something has existed for a number of years under the Banking Act. It would appear not to have been terribly difficult to come up with a simple amendment which would take over from the banking world the power to control interest rates and give it to the members of parliament so that they, at least, could respond to the needs and wishes of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the response of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to this Bill being at considerable variance with the philosophy of the present Government. The Government has made that demonstrably clear. It has never waivered from that and has never tried to hide it. This is in some contrast, however, to the behaviour of the Australian Labor Party, which has supported the contention of the Bill, that is, that something should be done to help the people in need, but it has never attempted to do anything at all positive about it. The fact that this Bill is, according to the list of woes put forward by Senator Walsh, considerably less than perfect is something for which I do not feel inclined to apologise. The Democrats do not have ready access to the Parliamentary Counsel. At this stage I pay tribute to the Senate staff, who have done what I consider to be a first class job in producing the Bill. It may be flawed, but it was something--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently not, but then apparently neither could the honourable senator with all his brilliant legal experience and brain in the three months that he has had to cogitate on the matter. Any rough edges that were incorporated into this piece of legislation could have been altered by a positive amendment or a series of amendments suggested by either the ALP or, if they had been so inclined, by any rebel Liberal senators. It is no justification for anybody to get up in this place and say that because only part of the problem is being solved we ought not to go ahead with it. If we all waited for perfection, none of us, especially Senator Evans, would ever get anywhere. I suggest to Senator Walsh that it is surely better to come up with some sort of palliative than to destroy the hopes and dreams and future of a lot of people who could have some of their problems solved by that palliative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have absolutely no option, if they want to help the people in Australia who are in need because of high interest rates, in the housing industry in particular, but to acquiesce in the ALP's referral of this Bill to a Senate standing committee. We have no option at all. If we oppose that, presumably the ALP will be sufficiently bloody-minded not to bother to put up any sort of amendment but simply to oppose the legislation lock, stock and barrel, good intentions and all. I suspect, however-it was for this reason that I asked Senator Walsh to add the time element to the amendment-that if the amendment were left open-ended in effect nothing would have been done and the Bill would have been dropped to the bottom of the list of the appropriate standing committee's agenda, never again to see the light of day. It would disappear into obscurity, along with all the young and old home owners in this country who will continue to be put out on the streets because of the situation that exists at the moment. It is cold comfort to them, I am sure, to know that after this Bill has been before the Senate for three months, the Australian Labor Party has opted to put it into the hands of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, which will not report until 31 May next year. It will be some comfort, if something comes of that report, to those people who will be affected after that date. Working on a system which appears to be anathema to the ALP that helping some people is better than helping no people at all, the Australian Democrats are prepared to allow this amendment to go through in order that the whole Bill is not sacrificed in its entirety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill does two things. It finalises the long running dispute between the Government and people in various parts of Australia regarding the imputation for taxable income purposes of the subsidised rent on company provided houses. The second matter which it covers is the provision of income tax at the rate of 32c in the dollar on lump sum settlements granted to employees at the termination of a strike. The latter provision was quite clearly provoked by the settlement to the striking workers at the Loy Yang power station. The Opposition supports it on the grounds that it is absurd to tax wages and not tax lump sum settlements paid in lieu of wages at the conclusion of an industrial dispute. The Australian Labor Party is against all forms of tax evasion whereas the position of other parties on the question is quite clearly prevaricatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also support what is proposed in the Bill regarding the settlement of tax on subsidised housing which arose from what is commonly referred to as the Utah dispute since it was among the Utah Development Co. workers in central Queensland that the dispute was most intense and prolonged. The provisions provided in this legislation are, in brief, that the value of a company or employer provided house will be assessed for taxation purposes at 10 per cent of market rental less any rent that is being paid. The eligibility criteria are that a taxpayer must live in a remote area which is defined as being 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000 people or 40 kilometres from a town of 12,000 people, using the 1976 Census figures as a base. There is provision that where a taxpayer does not meet either of those criteria he or she may be eligible under certain other criteria which were designed primarily to meet the requirements of certain sugar industry workers on the north Queensland coast. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach to tax evasion has, as I said earlier, been highly selective over a number of years. It decided to crack down on taxation of imputed rental for the Utah miners after the $95 a week wage increase settlement of 1978. I have absolutely no doubt that that crackdown was motivated by a vindictive desire by the Government to get even both with the Utah workers concerned and, to a lesser extent, with the company. The dispute dragged on for more than two years. It was marked by a great deal of prevarication by on the one hand, the Government in its inconsistent attitudes towards basic policy issues and, on the other hand, a series of highly misleading statements from various Government Ministers, the most outstanding of which came, predictably enough, from the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser following a visit to Blackwater in late June 1979. He told a deputation of miners that they could 'sleep tight at night'. All the miners were led to believe that there would be no tax. From the reports that came from that meeting, quite clearly, all the Canberra journalists who accompanied the Prime Minister reached the same conclusion. As with so many other prime ministerial promises the miners were to discover, of course, that it was operative only for as long as Mr Fraser remained in Blackwater. The dispute dragged on for more than 12 months, finally reaching a climax with a pre-election backdown just before the 1980 election when the Government forecast the sort of legislation which is now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to speak for very much longer on this Bill, but I draw attention to the highly selective nature of the Government's attitude to tax avoidance, to the crackdown initiated against the Utah miners in 1978 and to some extent subsequently carried over to miners in the Pilbara, to sugar workers and to some-both State and Commonwealth-public servants in remote areas. I contrast that with the simultaneous actions by the Government to open up tax havens such as the income equalisation deposit tax rort under which a qualified person-and half the Fraser Cabinet qualifies-may borrow $15,000 from the Government for two years, lend $10,000 to the Government for one year and, for that action, receive a bonus of $4,600, half of which is non-taxable. I cite those figures but the proportions will hold whether lower or higher figures are used. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost unbelievable that any government could have written legislation which permits this. I repeat: It is possible to borrow $15,000 from the Government for two years, lend $10,000 to the Government for one year and pick up a $4,600 bonus, half of which is free of tax. That is the rort which was designed and engineered by this Government and which can be exploited by half the Ministers in this Government. They refuse to give any assurances as to whether they are exploiting it. This is a rort preserved last week by the Australian Democrats. This is preserved by the Government with the assistance of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine who at various times has purported to retain some residual Labor Party principles but who last week voted for a tax rort which enables eligible persons-which includes half the Fraser Cabinet-to borrow $15,000 from the Government for two years, to lend $10,000 for one year and to pick up a cash bonus of $4,600, half of which is free of tax. That is the rort. I am not so surprised that the Australian Democrats decided to support that. I must say I was genuinely disappointed that Senator Harradine, who purports to have some residual Labor principles, decided a week ago to preserve that tax haven. </PARA>

The public will be continually reminded, Senator Mason, that the Democrats are on the side of the tax dodgers-along with Senator Harradine and the Liberal and National Country parties. The final irony in this issue was when a study by the Livestock and Grain Producers Association of New South Wales fell into my hands last week. The study concluded that any measures which made agriculture a tax haven attracted capital from outside agriculture and, to a lesser degree, capital from outside Australia purely to take advantage of the tax haven provisions. The predictable consequence of such a capital inflow is inflation of the price of land and other agricultural inputs. The conclusion reached in this study by the Livestock and Grain Producers Association was that the medium and lower income farmers actually dependent on agriculture for a living were harmed by it. That is not an original conclusion. I have been attempting to educate the agricultural community along those lines for about 10 years. The former Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics explicitly stated this at the Agro 79 conference in Perth more than two and a half years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is new, and what is very welcome, is that Australia's largest State based farmer organisation has reached a degree of sophistication whereby it has recognised that fact and, it has reached a degree of moral and/or intellectual honesty whereby it has given primary attention to the interests of the great majority of its members, who are disadvantaged by provisions which make agriculture a tax haven, instead of to the interests of the elite few who actually make a personal gain from it. I commend to the Australian Democrats a study of that paper and a study of the issue. I think that there might be hope for the Democrats in the long term, although they threw away the only weapon we have at the moment. Once they understand the issue, they might change the way they vote. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, Senator Harradine, who postures and poses as a man having fundamental Australian Labor Party principles, showed himself last Wednesday night to be on the side of the tax dodgers. On the matter of inconsistent application, and inconsistent attitudes towards tax evasion and tax avoidance, less than six months ago the Government passed amendments for the film industry under which a hidden subsidy varying in magnitude between 90 and 120 per cent of the cost of making a film will be paid by the Treasury to film makers. I see that Senator Harradine has come into the chamber. I suppose he will now attempt to make a personal explanation to try to explain why he did what he did last week. I certainly hope he can make a better job of it than he has so far because so far he has given no explanation of why he voted for the tax dodgers last week instead of maintaining those fundamental Labor Party principles which from time to time he purports to hold. </PARA>
<PARA> As revealed in the most recent report of the Commissioner of Taxation, there has been a very large increase in the incidence of tax avoidance in the last 12 months. The Commissioner estimates that almost $1 billion is currently outstanding. In the past the Government has made puny attempts to recover a bit of revenue here and there, such as the attempt to impose tax on the imputed income of Utah coal miners. At the same time, it deliberately opened up tax avoidance schemes, the cost of which to revenue is greater than the cost to revenue of the Utah and Pilbara miners and sugar workers put together. Most importantly of all, quantitatively of course, it refuses to do the one thing which effectively will stop the social evil of tax avoidance: It refuses to legislate retrospectively to close off blatant tax avoidance schemes. The Opposition will support this Bill. We hope that, as a result of this legislation being passed, the disruptive, bitter and extremely costly disputes which plagued Queensland and to a lesser extent some other areas in a bit of 1978 and throughout 1979 and 1980, will not recur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, firstly, to discuss generally some of the points raised by Senator Walsh in regard to this Government's approach to tax avoidance. I think it has been demonstrated quite clearly, particularly since 1978, that this Government has adopted a very firm stand against tax avoidance in various areas. It is perhaps this Government's approach which has done a great deal to protect the revenue from the great rip-off schemes, the paper schemes, which have been devised by lawyers and accountants over the last few years, in order to ensure that the maximum revenue has gone into the hands of those who need it most. Perhaps we can just examine the approach, firstly, of this Government to tax avoidance and so get a clearer impression of the way in which this has been handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some time, particularly since the advent of Senator Evans in this place, the Opposition has been advocating a different kind of approach to tax avoidance in that it has been advocating retrospective legislation. This is to apply to all forms of law as soon as those things become apparent. The Government's approach, on the other hand, has been to try to stem the tide of those schemes, which have been established over time within the commercial community, by legislating specifically in regard to them. It is certainly clear so far that that has been a very successful approach. I think even Senator Evans, who is in the chamber for a change, would recognise that matter. Senator Evans seeks to make a great deal of specific points but ignores the broader issues that are most important in the discussion of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the most significant point of all is the fact that the Labor Party Opposition proposes retrospective legislation in respect of tax schemes and at all levels. This means that there is a non-discriminatory approach to matters of this kind. Clearly, the Opposition would have no regard to the issues of individual enterprise, to the problems of different kinds of businesses and to the difficulties which individual firms would face in this kind of legislative broad brush. This Government has taken a totally different approach to that advocated in such a normal way by the Labor Party-according to its socialist tenet-and by Senator Evans. Nonetheless, the Opposition's method has not been tested as has the Government's. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, significant changes have occurred in the industry with regard to tax avoidance and there has been a very considerable change in attitude in the business community to the exploitation of various paper schemes. That is very clear from the evidence and from the fact that if one mixes in the community today one can see that there is certainly a different atmosphere. One has to think back only 10 years or so to the days when tax avoidance was, indeed, practised from time to time but in such a way-things were designed in a very commercial way and this was and is condoned by the law-as to take advantage of particular situations rather than to devise artificial schemes in order to attract the least possible attention from the Commissioner of Taxation. It is that difference which has crept into the practice of tax avoidance over the last few years and which has significantly changed the atmosphere in the taxation avoidance industry in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, this Government's attitude has been to approach the issues as they become apparent from the point of view of legislating specifically in respect of particular schemes. That necessarily has not been an easy task. Schemes today are certainly very complex and have been devised in such ways that it is extremely difficult to bind up all the corners which people might seek to exploit from time to time. Nevertheless, on the whole this has been a very successful exercise. Indeed, we might observe that starting in 1978, as I recall, the Government made one very significant decision, which it implemented via legislation, to tighten up those schemes that exploited the decision in Curran's case which was handed down by the High Court of Australia in 1974. It might be advisable to recall that at the time the Labor Government was in power. The decision opened a very wide hole for tax avoiders and did much to foster the tax avoidance industry. Of course, the Labor Government, which served until 1975, took no action to shut off that loop hole. I understand that an intention to do so was announced by the then Treasurer, the Honourable Frank Crean. He indicated that he would bring in legislation on the matter but, as with other matters that were of concern to the then Labor Government, its priority suffered amid the plethora of legislation brought down in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in 1978 the present Government did enact legislation on the matter and made clear its future intentions with regard to schemes which were associated with the Curran decision and which sprang from it. Indeed, the Government subsequently legislated accordingly. Additionally, further Bills have covered other areas of tax avoidance, specifically in relation to particular schemes found to be operating within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there is a major philosophical difference between the Government and the Opposition with regard to tax avoidance. On the one hand, the Government is prepared to do something about particular schemes as soon as they are brought to its attention, and ensure that they are brought under control. The Opposition wants retrospective legislation so as to ensure that it will cover a multitude of sins. In fact it wants to take a sledge hammer to crack a nut. By such action, it will merely ensure that the net is spread so widely as to ensnare, on the fringes, people who conduct legitimate activity in the business community. I highlight that point particularly by referring to the legislation that was passed in the Senate some six months ago in relation to Part IVB of the Income Tax Assesssment Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans. I knew I could rely on him to correct me on any detail if necessary. Part IVA is this Government's new provision relating to the general tax avoidance area and in particular to section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applied at that time. This Government's legislation demonstrates maximum concern for those people in the community who in fact conduct legitimate business enterprises. The various tests set out in the legislation ensure that such people will not be drawn into the net of the tax collector by activities which are legitimate but which, by virtue of the application of some section of the law, might be interpreted as being illegitimate. As a result, I believe we have established the best possible circumstance for the continuance of the anti-avoidance thrust of the Government's policy. At the same time, we have ensured that maximum freedom is given to those who legitimately arrange their affairs in terms of the present law, who organise their business arrangements in a proper commercial way, so that they do not inadvertently become liable to pay more than they should</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to one or two other matters, we should perhaps direct our attention more particularly to the provisions of the Bill. We have been discussing the question of tax avoidance somewhat generally. We might, perhaps, address our minds to that very significant event that occurred last year in relation to the Blackwater coal fields and the determination of this Government's policy in relation to remote area housing. It is quite clear that this Government encourages development in remote areas. We know, of course, that there are significant resource developments in parts of Australia which need people to work there and to be attracted to those places in order to ensure that they get off the ground and create wealth for Australia and those Australians who work there. It is clear that by virtue of this Government's general encouragement of resource development and of industry generally that is our policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that our taxation policy in relation to remote area housing should confirm that viewpoint. This is, of course, explicitly spelled out in this legislation whereby the amount of imputed rental which is attributed to the residents in houses that are available or are made available by employers in remote districts is, in fact, discounted by some 90 per cent of its value in order to ensure that there will be a minimum taxation effect on those workers who live and work there. That taxation, as we all know, does have its disincentive effects, irrespective of the point at issue as to whether or not taxation falls equitably or otherwise. But clearly it is important that the community, as a whole, enjoys the benefits of the resource development of Australia. Consequently, by encouraging resource development in the way that this taxation law is framed we will ensure that the maximum benefits are spread amongst the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the manner in which this decision was made some time during 1979 and in later times, we have seen much discussion on this matter on various occasions throughout the last 12 months or so. But clearly we do, in fact, encourage by this very positive move, our whole pragmatic and practical approach to this kind of resource development throughout Australia. This Government wants to see it go forward. We will be encouraging this kind of approach, not only in legislation but also by practical government effort, to ensure that this kind of thing does occur in the future. I think we have probably dealt very significantly with the major points which were raised by Senator Walsh during his speech concerning tax avoidance. I am sure that we have demolished his arguments quite well. The Government wishes the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981 is something of an Aladdin's Cave. Behind its bland and utterly uninteresting looking titles lies a wondrous miscellany of mysterious and interesting things. In the Bill 17 major Acts are amended in major ways, Acts ranging from the Commonwealth Electoral Act to the Bankruptcy Act, the Health Acts Amendment Act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, the Trade Union Training Authority Act, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act and a dozen others as well. Something like half a dozen significant or substantive changes are being made to each of them. It is not just a matter of a comma being added here or a drafting error being corrected there or an obvious piece of updating being made somewhere else. We are talking about substantive amendments. Perhaps the most substantive of all is the change to the Commonwealth Electoral Act which has the effect of changing the qualification to vote in this country, at least for persons coming on to the rolls in the future, from the traditional reference to British subjects now to Australian citizens. That change was foreshadowed by the Government earlier this year and it has the full support of the Opposition. Nonetheless it is not the kind of change which we believe ought to be hidden away in this fashion in this kind of Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, the Bill does not just stop with the 17 major Acts to which I have referred. If one turns to the schedules to the Bill one finds another 12 Acts which are amended in various ways, mostly in formal ways rather than substantive ways, but, of course, one does not know that until one examines them closely. Then another three Acts are repealed altogether. So the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill is not just one Bill but, in fact, 32. This Bill, being brought forward by the Government in this way, represents in the Opposition's submission a most unhappy development in our legislative practice, particularly following, as it does, the introduction in May this year of a Statute Law Revision Bill which similarly was full of substantive provisions, most notably the new section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, and to which, at the time, we made similar objections. </PARA>
<PARA> In this kind of omnibus Bill which contains substantive amendments to the Act with which it deals, not merely formal ones, not the least of the difficulties presented to parliamentarians, and especially to Oppositions trying to consider its implications, is that one has to farm it out for reaction not just to one shadow Minister or to one Caucus or party committee as the case may be. To do the job properly one has to have, in this case, nearly a dozen different shadow Ministers and half a dozen different parliamentary party committees looking at its terms. This sort of scrutiny cannot always easily be accomplished in practice in the time available for us to consider these things, that is between the introduction of the Bill and the debate in this place. This means that perhaps one or two shadow Ministers and perhaps one or two committees simply try to scrutinise and understand the implications of these kinds of provisions which operate in areas outside their immediate expertise and experience. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the view that Parliament is a mere rubber stamp whose legislative role in particular is a complete formality, then one will not be very much moved by this state of affairs. But I believe that most of us have some larger sense of responsibility than that. Bills like this make it very difficult for us to exercise that responsibility. I make this point with all deliberation and seriousness. I appreciate the difficulties of accommodating a series of small legislative proposals to busy parliamentary timetables; but there are acute difficulties in dealing with legislation of this kind, not only for us as parliamentarians in trying to understand its implications and to deal with it in our rushed programs, but also, of course, for those outside this place who are trying to follow the tortuous web that statutory amendments weave in the statute book. Their task is not made easier by this kind of approach to the legislative process. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seventeen different Acts are dealt with in the major part of the Bill before us. Each of those 17 Bills is dealt with in a substantive way with up to, in each case, half a dozen different sections being amended and many pages of text being covered by the terms of those amendments. If one then goes to the Schedule one finds, as I have said before, another dozen Acts which are amended, some in significant ways but most, from the Schedule, in purely formal ways. However, we do not know this until we dig them out one at a time and look at them. Another three Bills are being repealed altogether. So we have a situation of not just one Bill before us now but 32 different Bills, and that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulties in dealing with this sort of legislation are compounded when one finds that the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is inaccurate. One would think one could rely at least upon that for an accurate summary, in outline, of what the Bill contains and at least to alert one as to the substantive nature of the provisions which are being brought forward in this way. When one finds that the speech is inaccurate in significant respects, as it is in particular in the context of the changes to the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act, then that further weakens any residual faith one might have had in the legitimacy of this kind of approach to the legislative process. In the event, having gone through the very laborious task of checking in detail what all these various amendments are about, looking to the original Acts, checking with other shadow Ministers, checking with the relevant parliamentary committees, at the end we find that it does not appear that there is anything, apart from the amendment to the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act, which I will come to in the Committee stage, which is of a sufficiently either substantive or objectionable character for the Opposition to oppose this Bill at either the second reading or the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, a number of things could be said to put on the record the implications of these various changes and to describe them to the no doubt breathless public which listens to and reads our proceedings. Since that task has already been successfully accomplished by Mr Bowen, the Opposition spokesman in the House of Representatives debate on 17 November, I do not propose to delay the Senate any further at the second reading stage. The main object in my rising to speak to this Bill, and to do so quite forcefully on behalf of the Opposition, is to express our concern at what seems to be an accelerating pattern of legislative practice with these omnibus Bills. It is a pattern which we do not object to in the slighest when purely formal changes are being made, as they must be from time to time to accommodate drafting errors or very minor corrections to Bills. But when substantive provisions of very great significance are in issue here, we believe that the legislative process is not being treated with the respect that it should be. It is not possible for us to perform as parliamentarians, and particularly as Opposition senators, the functions that we would wish to as legislators, and we hope that the Government in this respect mends its way in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981. I will comment firstly on the remarks and views Senator Evans expressed, which I must say seemed somewhat inconsistent. Senator Evans said that 17 major Acts are involved. I think some of them are major and some of them are not; it is probably a matter of degree in interpretation. The honourable senator said that, altogether, 32 Acts are amended. Surely it follows logically from his statement that he believes we ought to have separate Bills in respect of each of these Acts. Apart from suggesting that, something like a cricket score, we pass so many Bills this year-we know that already we sometimes have to have separate Bills because of the requirements of our Constitution to have the numbers build up-to have separate Bills which have to go through separate stages in the legislative process is, to my mind, not justified. If the conclusion Senator Evans made was that there are some very tricky, difficult and objectionable matters in parts of this Bill, one could think that that might justify separate Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But he came to the conclusion, albeit after quite a lot of hard work, that there is one part that he objects to. Actually, there is one thing I want to query among this miscellany, but I would suggest that apparently the Government has been right in its conclusion that these were relatively uncontroversial items. They may affect fairly major Acts in some respects, if we take the example the honourable senator gave in regard to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the very useful provisions that we now talk about in respect of Australian citizenship. Along this line, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, reporting on the qualifications of members of parliament, made the same sort of recommendations. I trust that the implementation of those recommendations may follow. We had the same view as in this example. Of course, the Commonwealth Electoral Act is an important Act but the fact is that this is not a controversial proposal, and pretty obviously is not judged as being so by the lack of objection here tonight. I therefore suggest that there is very little merit in the idea that these should be separate Acts and somehow-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirty-two Bills will make a difference to that argument. It can be done here in one Bill. I suggest that is not really a fair criticism. I think Senator Evans and I will probably agree that in fact it is difficult to scrutinise Bills of this nature and other Bills. We have had some discussion about this in recent weeks. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which is now in operation, has not been able to turn its attention this week to Bills that are coming on for debate this week, although it has already met and made its plans. I will make a statement about it tomorrow. Indeed, one would expect that Bills like this would be carefully scrutinised by that Committee in the future. Therefore, I suppose it will assist members of this Parliament who at the moment find it difficult to put the time aside to check what is being done in a Bill like this and whether there are problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to one of the parts of this Bill and query one matter in it because it has had some history, and I am not too certain as to what the intention of the Government is in regard to it. I refer to Part V of the Amendment of Australian Capital Territory Evidence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1971. That is quite a short Part but it does two things. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) set out the reasons why this has come about. It has had quite a complicated history. The clause in this Bill now amends the Australian Capital Territory Evidence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1971. It seeks to enable that Act in future to be amended or repealed by an ordinance and not to require a further Act of the Parliament. That is an unusual provision. Over the years there has been a great deal of criticism of provisions in various Acts of Parliament which have enabled them to be altered without coming back to the Parliament but by an ordinance or some regulation introduced by a Minister. Clauses which are known as Henry VIII clauses have been criticised in a number of reports which my Committee-the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-has made. I think it is generally undesirable that changes be made to Acts or to Schedules to Acts taking away provisions or adding to them without reference to the Parliament. But there are, of course, some occasions when this might be done, and I think this is one. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation with regard to the evidence laws of the Territory is that in 1971 the Evidence Ordinance was put down. As the Attorney-General stated in his second reading speech, it 'contains comprehensive rules of evidence for civil and criminal proceedings in the Australian Capital Territory'. He also said that the Ordinance was disallowed by the Senate in 1971. That was done on the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The reason it was disallowed was not really related to the actual terms of the Ordinance, but to the fact that that Committee took the view-and the Senate supported it-that those provisions ought to be contained in an Act of Parliament and ought not to be contained in an ordinance which was not capable of being debated in the Parliament, except by way of disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> A series of actions was then taken because the effect of disallowing that particular Ordinance was that there were no provisions left in the Territory for evidence laws for criminal trials, for example. Those provisions had gone, so it was necessary to bring in Acts to reinstate, temporarily as it were, the Ordinance while the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee undertook an investigation. Year after year there were repetitions of this temporary law. At first it was confined to only one year; subsequently that provision was taken away and it became permanent. In fact, from 1972 to 1976 the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee did not turn to this investigation at all. When I became Chairman of that Committee in early 1976 we found this reference still sitting there, practically unattended to, although I think some evidence had been called for and a little evidence had been received. We held an inquiry and in November 1977 presented a report to the Senate entitled 'The Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972'. That report went into a number of areas. It went through the Ordinance and suggested quite a number of alterations to it. But it also suggested that the whole of the evidence laws for the Commonwealth ought to be re-investigated by the Australian Law Reform Commission and that it should not be done in a piecemeal manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In that report the Committee also made recommendations on this general question of whether matters such as the laws of evidence for the Territory ought to be dealt with by an Act of the Parliament or by ordinance. I think it is worth mentioning, because it affects this particular provision in the Bill, that among the recommendations which the Committee made was one which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation which, in Australian States, would usually be made by Act of a State Parliament, should normally be made by Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>It can well be said that this is one such provision in that matters of evidence are dealt with in the Australian States generally by an evidence Act. Therefore, it is proper that this legislation ought to be by ordinance, and that should be the final situation. To back-up that assertion, I point out that a further recommendation which we made in that report was:</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation of a particular Territory which is socially innovative or affects fundamental rights and liberties, if it is of the kind referred to in sub-paragraphs (d)-</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-paragraph (d) is the one to which I have just referred-</PARA>
<PARA>and (e) above, should be made by Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the new evidence Bill or ordinance which will come from the final determinations of the Australian Law Reform Commission probably will make quite considerable suggestions for change in the evidence law, because the evidence law of the Territory is very backward. In fact, it very much depends upon the New South Wales law. I think the original Act of 1898 has not been brought up to date in many respects. There is great dissatisfaction, I think, with the evidence law. Proposed new section 3(2) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in sub-section (1)-</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section (1) adds to the principal Act-</PARA>
<PARA>prevents the amendment or repeal by an Ordinance under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 of the provisions continued in force by that sub-section. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that alterations can be made in the future, while the provisions continue by ordinance, without having to come back to this Parliament and legislate for them by Act. Curiously, the Minister, in his second reading speech, goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Following a recommendation of the Commmittee-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>the law of evidence applicable in proceedings in Federal and Territory Courts was referred to the Law Reform Commission in 1979 for review and report. The Commissioner's report is not expected for some time. The amendmant proposed by the Bill is an interim measure only, pending the Report of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate what is in that statement. I take it that is the intention of the Attorney. There is, in fact, nothing in the clause which says anything about any interim nature. I suppose it would probably be very difficult to have such a provision. I am glad to see that there is in mind that this practice will be brought to an end and that there will be at some time in the near future a further and up-to-date law on evidence which will enable the Territory to join the twentieth century so far as these matters are concerned. I think the position there in regard to business records and the whole law of hearsay is very unsatisfactory. I hope that the position will be improved. I trust that this temporary provision will not apply for too long. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to one other matter which I think is somewhat mysterious. I draw the attention of the honourable senators to proposed new section 3 (3) in clause 12 which is concerned with the validation of provisions of the Australian Capital Territory evidence Ordinance. The proposed new section states:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Interpretation Ordinance 1967 of the Australian Capital Territory, as amended and in force from time to time, applies, and shall be deemed to have always applied, to the provisions continued in force by sub-section (1).''. </PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at the types of provisions in ordinances which have been objected to from time to time by the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the types of provisions in Bills which I would hope the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills will be looking at, one would like some explanation why this somewhat mysterious provision appears in the legislation. The legislation appears to be retrospective, if I can use that terrible word. I do not have a complete objection to retrospective legislation. I think that legislation of this type is necessary on some occasions. But I think that as a matter of general principle, it should be avoided. I would like to know why this provision is deemed to be necessary. Why do we deem the Interpretation Ordinance to have always applied to the provisions in force? One would like to be assured that there is no existing litigation that might be affected by this provision so that the introduction of this clause would affect people's rights retrospectively. It may be that this provision has been included for some cautionary reason and that there is no intention of that sort. I ask the Attorney why that provision is in the clause because I think we ought to know why any retrospective provision is included. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we will soon get to a situation where these temporary provisions involving a long and complicated procedure which has been followed to keep evidence laws on foot but in a rather sickly state will cease. We also have a curious and unexplained provision which is not mentioned in any way in the Minister's second reading speech. Apart from that, I believe that the provisions made in this Bill are worth while. They cover a considerable number of Acts. A great deal of busy attention has been given to updating the laws and removing unnecessary ones. Rather than the legislation being the subject of some criticism on the part of Senator Evans, it ought to have been the subject of some praise. Unfortunately, the honourable senator did not stay to praise tonight, but to criticise. On the whole, I think this is a very useful piece of work. The legislation may not be exciting for people who are listening to this debate but I think it will be taken as one of the useful pieces of law reform carried out by the Government this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its support of the second reading of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, despite the criticism levelled at the Bill by Senator Evans. However, unqualified support was given to it by Senator Missen, for which I am very thankful; as I am for all the support I can get in this Senate. Senator Evans continued his criticism of the policy behind this form of legislation. I do have some concerns that legislation of this sort should be very strictly confined to non-controversial matters but, as Senator Missen has pointed out, the alternative to legislation in this form is to bring in a great miscellany of separate Bills which, although they may be dealt with quite expediently, would certainly add to the time required of the Senate to attend to them. Provided this form of legislation is properly confined to non-controversial matters it seems that it is a convenient way of approaching the situation. I am conscious of the problem that is presented by making any judgment about whether matters are non-controversial. However, I think it is clear from the debate we have had that a fairly reasonable judgment has been made in that regard on this legislation because, subject to what Senator Evans may have to say about one particular part of it, nothing has been raised which would reflect in any way on the broad judgment that this legislation does contain non-controversial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have changed the title from the Statute Law Revision Bill to the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill because it does contain more than just the ordinary statute law revision type of legislation. A change of title has been made to reflect that situation. I hope that the Parliament will continue to support the concept of tackling these problems in this way because of its convenience. However, I appreciate that if this form of legislation were abused and used to sneak in amendments of a controversial kind then the Parliament would not allow that abuse to continue. So long as we can confine such measures in broad terms to non-controversial matters this procedure has a role to play. It has now become accepted as part of the program for each session of Parliament and I think a lot of parliamentary time can be saved by legislating for this type of amendment in this way. The Government hopes to continue legislating in this way and hopes to have the support of the Senate to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen raised a matter in relation to one part of the legislation which it might be convenient to deal with now even though perhaps it would be appropriate to deal with it in the Committee stage. I am glad that Senator Missen has supported this provision. I must say I had some doubts about including this part of the legislation because I thought it may be controversial, the Senate having taken-albeit 10 years ago-the stance that it did in requiring amendments to the evidence laws of the Australian Capital Territory to be made by legislation. However, if 10 years ago the Senate had had the benefit of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on this subject it may well have taken a different and more reasonable approach than it took at that time. It would be really inappropriate for this Parliament to take up time in debating amendments to the evidence laws in the Australian Capital Territory unless they were being implemented pursuant to a codification of the law on evidence pursuant to the Law Reform Commission report. I have left that question open. I think it is a matter which, in an exceptional case such as that, may well be appropriate for the Parliament to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem we are faced with at the moment is that we have this strait-jacket in the shape of provisions of an ordinance being validated by an Act of the Parliament and amendments, even ones of only a fairly minor kind, being made by amendments to that Act of Parliament. The simplest way of overcoming the problem seemed to be the solution proposed in this legislation. I am glad that the Senate is obviously supporting it. As I have said, I keep open the question of what we may do if we receive ultimately from the Law Reform Commission a report which suggests a new code of evidence. The immediate reason for this amendment, as the Senate would be well aware from my answers to questions asked largely by Senator Ryan, is that we are ready to have a new rape ordinance for the Australian Capital Territory which will, of course, include a number of evidentiary provisions as well as provisions relating to substantive law of rape. It is much more appropriate for all of that to be done in the one ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen raised a question in relation to proposed new sub-section (3) of section 3 as contained in clause 12 of the Bill. I understand that the reason for that is simply abundant caution. Obviously, an interpretation ordinance would have applied to the previous ordinance, but, as that had been continued by an Act of Parliament, the Acts (Interpretation) Act might be thought to apply to it and therefore there would be some doubt, after this Bill had gone through, as to which provision would apply. I understand that that was inserted simply for that reason. I thank the Senate for its support of this measure. I hope that, despite the fact that further matters may be raised by Senator Evans, the Bill will have a passage this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the points that were made by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his reply to the second reading debate. I do not propose to prolong the debate, on which there is obviously a difference of opinion between us, except to make a couple of points to introduce the matter to which I wish to draw attention, namely, clause 24. I appreciate what has been said by both Senator Missen and the Attorney-General about the Australian Capital Territory Evidence Ordinance provision that is buried in this Bill. The Opposition is well aware of the long history behind this provision. Indeed, it had a number of reservations about the legislative exercise being proposed; namely, to give the power of amending the Australian Capital Territory evidence law back to the Governor-General in Council by way of ordinance, rather than having it reside in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We knew what was being proposed. We had reservations about it because we were well aware of the long and and controversial history of this matter. But we accepted that because we were prepared to accept at face value the clear statement of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) in his second reading speech that this legislation was simply a temporary approach to this matter until such time as the Law Reform Commission could bring down its full recommendations, that the Government was in no way foreshadowing its likely approach to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and that it was indeed perfectly possible that the best way of dealing with those recommendations would be by way of an Act of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of that clear ministerial statement in the second reading speech we on the Opposition side swallowed our reservations and, as I have done tonight, passed over any possible reservations or objections to that sort of clause. But that shows the importance of there being absolute scrupulousness in the presentation of these sorts of provisions, absolute accuracy in the description by the Minister in his second reading speech of what is understood is going on with these amendments and what is proposed to be accomplished by them. When in that ministerial statement in the second reading speech there is inaccuracy as to what is embodied in these provisions, that cannot do other than arouse our hackles about being confronted with this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the point which comes in issue when we get to the provisions dealing with the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act. The second reading speech of the Minister, on which as I said we have had to rely necessarily to get the gist of proposals particularly when they are buried in compendius Bills of this kind, is quite misleading. What the Minister says in describing the ambit of these changes is this:</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments embrace four particular areas of concern and propose: (i) an expanded definition of 'development project' as contained in the Act to include projects concerned solely with the supply of services; (ii) the inclusion of a provision to enable the Corporation to engage directly in negotiations on overseas projects with overseas clients at the request of the Australian Government; (iii) the inclusion of a provision to enable the Corporation under certain circumstances to act at the request of an authority of the Commonwealth or a State government; and (iv) the replacement of the maximum contingent liability concept in the Act which has proved difficult to define precisely in terms of the Corporation's activities with the concept of assessed net commercial risk. The effect of implementing these amendments will be to enable the Corporation to operate more effectively and in line with the original objectives of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not have just a bland general statement; we have what purports to be four rather precise descriptive statements about the ambit of these few new or amended sections in that Act-the amendments accomplished by this Bill. Yet when we look to the detail of the Bill-I refer to clause 24 and the proposed new section 8A that this clause will introduce into the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act-we see that something rather different, very different, is being accomplished. What is being accomplished by this new section is a significant limitation on the scope of the activity of the Corporation. The existing section 8 of the Act rules out the Corporation's capacity to compete directly against Australian private enterprise. This proposed new section 8A goes further than that and prevents the Corporation from assisting Australian public authorities or public consortia to compete against private enterprise to carry out an overseas project. So we have a further constraint being imposed, one that is not flagged, not foreshadowed, not identified and not referred to in the second reading speech, even though it is, on the face of it, a speech which purports to deal with this subject matter in some little detail. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being done in this proposed new section, to take one possible example, is to rule out the capacity of the Corporation to give assistance to some authority such as the Snowy Mountains Authority in competing for engineering contracts in South East Asia or anywhere else in the world. I will not mention the Australian Dairy Corporation in that respect. That is another example of an authority which has been operating overseas in a commercial way. There are other authorities which perhaps would want to get into those markets and would very much welcome the assistance of the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation in doing so. Their competition in those markets would quite likely be advantageous to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, is a provision which is controversial. I do not go into the boring detail about why it is controversial; it should be obvious enough. We of the Opposition would not accept the kind of ideological proposition that is so dear to this Government's heart that anything that public authorities do ipso facto is less attractive and less in the national interest than anything of the same kind which private enterprise might be minded to do. We take the view that public enterprise is perfectly capable of acting to the nation's commercial and economic advantage and in fact is quite likely to be more efficient and certainly more equitable in the way it approaches the redistribution of the profits that it makes than a private competitor or private alternative. I will not go into those details; I simply make the point that the Opposition opposes this clause. We are unhappy about a clause of this naturally controversial kind appearing in a Bill of this kind, and we are even more unhappy about such a provision not being flagged as it should have been in the second reading speech. Having made that point and indicated the Opposition's opposition to this proposal, I resume my seat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will comment very briefly. I agree with Senator Evans that the Parliament requires fairly detailed assistance with a second reading speech for a Bill of this kind although, of course, it is the obligation of members of parliament to scrutinise the legislation. They should realise that a second reading speech cannot cover every feature of legislation and remain within the bounds of readability. A compromise has to be struck in drafting second reading speeches. In this case the principle of the proposed new section 24, although not mentioned in the second reading speech, is covered already in the existing Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act. Section 8, of that Act states that the Corporation is not to take up work which private enterprise is interested in carrying out. Proposed new section 8A is really only an extension or a further application of that principle. I defend it on that basis. It is not a new principle being introduced. However, obviously no harm has been done. Senator Evans and his colleagues have picked up the point and have been able to make their comments about it. Obviously there are differences of ideological approach between the Government and the Opposition in relation to these matters. The Government's policies are already set out in the existing Act. The proposed amendment is only giving some further definition, and perhaps width to that policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. The Government's reasons for adopting this course are clear and unambiguous. On 2 June 1981, when I introduced the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1981 into this chamber, I indicated that at the time amendments were not being sought to the amalgamation provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904. The second reading speech-I quote from Hansard, page 2477, of 2 June 1981-stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The creation of industry based unions is an established policy of both Government parties and the ACTU. Work has been done, in the consultation with the NLCC, on amendments to the amalgamation provisions of the Act on the basis of a criteria of the community-of-interest of the unions desiring amalgamation. However, the Government parties wish to consider the full implications of such a criteria for amalgamation and its relevance to meeting the objective of encouraging the formation of industry based unions before proceeding further with any such amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government parties will be examining what other means might be available to achieving the formation of industry based unions and also, within that examination, the possibility and practicability of the formation of enterprise based unions as part of the concept of industry based unions. The Government will be doing this, Mr President, because of the belief that the general public wish to see a stronger movement towards industry based unions. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said at the outset, there is nothing ambiguous about those words or the Government's course in this area. The proposals for amalgamation were to be subjected to further examination against the Government's overall objectives of encouraging the formation of industry based unions. Since that time the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and the Government Members Employment and Industrial Relations Committee have been conducting a detailed examination of the proposals. The Government makes no apology for the fact that the proposals have been subjected to such detailed scrutiny and that earlier legislative drafts have been put aside whilst this is undertaken. The issues are complex. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) said in this chamber on 2 June 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>the case for industry based unionism is overwhelming if we are to improve industrial relations in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition and the Government are on common ground on this but on opposite sides in believing that the amalgamation proposals will bring about the creation of industry based unions. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not so naive as to say that it would be an easy task to change the basis of Australian trade-unionism to industry based unionism in the foreseeable future, but there is scope for consideration for union amalgamations on the basis of the community of interest concept. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Button" NAMEID="4F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did I say all that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the honourable senator did. I am not surprised that he should be resiling from it. The Government parties 1975 employment and industrial relations policy states that industry based unions would reduce the frequency and likelihood of industrial disputes. From what Senator Button has said, the Opposition would not contest that proposition. However, as Senator Button recognises, it is another thing to find the right legislative formula and to put such a policy into practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill which Senator Button has introduced reflects the provisions which the Government had recommended to it by the National Labour Consultative Council. Those provisions do no more than facilitate the amalgamation of organisations registered under the Act. In fact, it is simply an alternative course to be followed from the current provisions and would enable a return of 25 per cent of union members to vote rather than 50 per cent as provided for at present, if the Commission decides that the organisations proposing to amalgamate have been able to establish what is called a 'community of interest' between them. I would add of course that that means that one is looking for no more than a favourable vote of 12 1/2 per cent of the membership of the union plus one, a relatively small proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a less stringent voting requirement was proposed by the NLCC because of the difficulties which organisations allegedly have in ensuring that a majority of their membership vote on the question of amalgamation. However, the fact that organisations find it difficult to obtain a 50 per cent membership vote as required by the existing provisions of the Act does not necessarily justify making it easier to amalgamate. It can be legitimately asked whether in those circumstances the desire for amalgamation by the rank and file as distinct from the leadership is in fact very strong. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is not then there is, of course, less reason to alter the law simply to make amalgamation easier. However, irrespective of that exercise in logic as far as democratic processes go, the proposals we are looking at do not guarantee that there will be amalgamation of existing organisations which will result in the formation of industry based unions. The criteria for establishing community of interest is not directed towards industry unions but rather would reinforce the existing structures and allow their aggregation without any change towards an objective common to the Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, apparently, the Opposition; namely, industry based unions. That is why the Government is not prepared at this stage to proceed with legislation in the form of the NLCC proposals or to support Senator Button's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We are conscious of the election statement on amalgamation but consider it prudent to take discussion and policy development within the Government parties a good deal further before putting firm legislative proposals before the Parliament. The kind of consideration being given to the most appropriate means of achieving industry based unions, for example, ranges over the sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which would need to be amended to ensure that new enterprise or industry based unions are capable of achieving registration. One measure which could be examined in this respect is the removal of the 'conveniently belong' limitation from section 142. Another matter which could be looked at is an amendment to the objects of the Act in section 2 as well as a definition of 'industry' for the purpose of union formation or the reformation of existing unions. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other relevant matters are in fact currently being examined by my colleague, the Minister for Industrial Relations, with a view to developing policy proposals for legislative change which will more accurately provide a framework for the formation of industry based unions. Honourable senators will appreciate that they are matters both important and complex and not lightly to be played with in the manner in which this private member's Bill is being put forward by the Opposition. The Government recognises that this process may cause some concern to members of the NLCC, especially as they spent considerable time and effort in formulating their proposals. However, consistent with the processes of the NLCC, my colleague has informed that body of the work being carried out on the issue and, when the policy proposals are formulated, he will be taking them back to NLCC for the necessary consultations. The Government, therefore, opposes the Bill which is at present before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Union mergers are vital for the future well being of workers and employers in this country. The existing crazy patchwork quilt of unions and staff associations is a legacy of industrial history with which we should long ago have dispensed. Recent events, notably the abandonment of wage indexation, have increased the pressure for this long overdue reform. Why have there been so few amalgamations if merger is such a good thing? The first impediment was the requirement for the registration of trade unions at the turn of the century. The intent of this requirement was to bring unions under judicial control. Its effect was almost to freeze the number of Australian unions at 19th century levels for 80 years. The development of unions in other democracies has continued apace in all this time. As already pointed out by Senator Button, the Federal Republic of Germany has only 16 unions despite the fact that it has a large number of workers and is highly unionised unlike, for example, the United States. Most other European countries have followed a similar path but the impediments to union amalgamation in Australia have prevented much progress to date in this country. Instead, we have followed the conservative example of the United Kingdom in this, as in so many things, and have remained blind to the changed shape of modern industrial society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian unionism continues to try to adapt this society to its own antiquated shape. Industry unions have so many advantages. Sensible, rational countries adopted them long ago and abolished craft unions. Industry unions make for better relations between management and staff by giving the staff a closer identification with and involvement in the fortunes of the industry rather than, as now, a tendency to be locked into their own separate craft union boxes. As Senator Button has already mentioned the virtues of union amalgamation in regard to demarcation disputes, I will not belabour this point. Suffice it to say that several major disputes, notably on the waterfront and among the postal unions, had nothing to do with employers and cost the country dearly. Anything which would prevent or resolve disputes such as those without recourse to strike action is certainly to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I said that the abandonment of wage indexation had increased the pressure for amalgamation. In a collective bargaining situation the strong thrive and the weak suffer. I have long advocated, and will continue to do so, collective bargaining on the American model. I believe employers and employees should be able to negotiate legally enforceable contracts which give both sides stability and prosperity. In fact, such a system has begun to arrive in this country on a de facto basis. Within the overall framework of the Australian system we now have major unions negotiating directly with employers for mutual benefit. Such a development is to be welcomed and could lead to an unparalleled period of industrial peace and prosperity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be asked along what lines union amalgamations should proceed. In the Melbourne Age of 28 August 1980 the former Prime Minister, Mr Gough Whitlam, suggested that unions amalgamate along the same lines used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics when it publishes industrial information. In fact, the ABS uses 15 groups, including mining and quarrying; engineering, metals and vehicles; textiles, clothing and footwear; food, drink and tobacco; sawmilling and furniture; paper and printing; railway services; road and air transport; shipping and stevedoring; communications; wholesale and retail trade; public authorities; and amusements and hotels. Although one might quarrel with a couple of the details, this at least provides an intelligent basis on which to discuss details and perhaps guidelines for amalgamation. I stress guidelines for amalgamation only. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential thrust of union amalgamations must be at the grass roots. In the final analysis the unions themselves must decide who shall amalgamate with whom. At least we have to have guidelines. I suggest that these 15 groups could be used as a basis for discussion and as a general objective for the unions concerned. At present a major impediment to amalgamation is the 50 per cent rule brought in by McMahon in 1972, and this was covered at some length in Senator Button's speech. </PARA>

The question of union amalgamation is like the weather. Everybody complains about it but nobody does anything about it. The Democrats are happy to be seen to be helping to do something about it on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr Deputy President, I hope that I do not lapse into my old habit and speak for an hour as I used to do in lectures. My purpose in talking at such an unconscionable hour is to discuss a matter of considerable national importance to Australians, namely, the purchase of another aircraft carrier for the Royal Australian Navy. Indeed, according to the Press reports and rumours in this town-it is a very topical subject-it is widely believed that the Department of Defence has recommended the purchase of a British ship and that a Cabinet decision favourable to purchase is imminent. I sincerely hope that those rumours are not true because there is absolutely no case for panic buying in this matter. What I have to say is relevant to the purchase of a carrier, irrespective of the stage the negotiations have reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to take two issues separately. The first is the purchase of another carrier and the second is the purchase of the Invincible or one of the three British Invincible class ships. The Navy justifies the need for a new carrier on two broad grounds. The first is convoy protection. In that it is talking about providing organic air, in the jargon of the Navy, which just means having air power at sea, and about providing an anti-submarine warfare capacity by means of rotary or fixed wing aircraft. The second justification which the Navy gives for its decision is the power projection argument, the gunboat diplomacy argument, of being able to send a great big ship into a harbour and convince a dictator that he really should not do what he has set out to do. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little toy; the honourable senator is right. I reject the puerile, semantic argument that we are talking about a Department of Defence decision in this. Sure, it is a Department of Defence decision insofar as it comes through that Department but what we are talking about is specifically a Navy decision, a Navy need as it perceives it. I propose to call a spade a spade and talk about the Navy's case justifying the purchase of a carrier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I examine those two cases that the Navy has established it is as well to remind honourable senators of some points that they know very well, fundamental points about a carrier. The overwhelming point about a carrier in today's weapons systems is its vulnerability. It is an extremely vulnerable weapons system, an extremely expensive weapons system. We are not talking about something of the calibre of the USS Enterprise or one of the Forrestal class ships of about 70,000 or 80,000 tonnes. As Senator Mason said we are talking about a very small and a very poorly defended ship. The reason this ship is so vulnerable is that there is no secrecy about its position. A carrier or any other ship cannot be hidden on the surface of the water any longer, in this age of satellite technology. The Navy claims that when we reach the point of war there will be no satellites. The only scenario to which that could apply is one in which there is total war with Russia; then the killer satellites may eliminate the surveillance satellites of the opposing power, but I think is very unlikely. I do not know what the Russians have, but it is my advice that despite many millions spent on laser technology for killer satellites, the United States has not got to the level where it can knock out Russian surveillance satellites. I would think that we would be involved in much lower levels of conflict than World War III, so it is a safe presumption that satellite technology will always exist. While that is so, the position of the ship will be updated hour by hour. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the problems of air surveillance by maritime reconnaissance aircraft, to say nothing of surface ships and underwater surveillance. An important point in relation to the vulnerability of the type of carrier that the Royal Australian Navy wants to buy is that it will have no radar defence of its own against low level strike aircraft, or against low level surveillance aircraft for that matter. It will have a capacity from its own seaborne radar to pick up high flying aircraft to ranges in excess of 200 nautical miles, but the radar horizon is only 20 nautical miles away and any aircraft coming in on strike or surveillance mission below the radar horizon will come to within 20 nautical miles of that carrier before it can be detected. The reaction time from a 20-nautical mile radius is very small and, unless there is a standing air patrol over the carrier, effectively no counter-defensive capacity can be mounted. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to this that the Americans adopt with their bigger carriers is to use a standing radar picket flying over the fleet, a Grumman E2C or one of the radar surveillance aircraft. But the RAN cannot use those aircraft with the type of ship envisaged because the flight deck is too small to allow them to land. Also, the type of aircraft we are proposing to buy, the Sea Harriers, do not have the radar capacity, the look-down capacity, to mount an effective radar picket. Added to that, the number of Harriers that would be embarked on a ship of this nature is very limited and there would be great difficulty in maintaining a continuous air patrol over the ship. So, the ship's position can be fixed continuously by an aggressor force. In an age of missile technology-air to surface, surface to surface and underwater-the carrier can be taken out. Indeed, this has been the record of the Royal Australian Navy with the Melbourne in all the Kangaroo exercises that have been held. I do not know how many times it was destroyed in Kangaroo 81 last month, but it did not survive at all; it was being refurbished by the umpires every few hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fundamental point about this type of carrier is the poverty of the air defence system that it can carry. The type of carrier we are talking about has a very short deck. It is committed to operating only one type of aircraft, the VSTOL aircraft. There is only one of those in the Western inventory and that is the Sea Harrier or the AV8B which is being developed for the United States Marine Corps. The Sea Harrier has a very limited capacity as a fighter. It has quite a short range and is very slow. Not only is it subsonic but it is also considerably subsonic. As I said earlier, the development of its radar, the Blue Fox radar of Ferranti, is not coming along as it might. It has the inherent problems, as had the radar of the F16, of being limited by the small amount of accommodation available in the fuselage and nose of this aircraft. It will not have an adequate look-down capacity to pick up low flying aircraft against the sea returns to the level needed for the security of the carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate thing about the Sea Harrier is that it is a very old design. It is a development of a design that I first saw fly at Farnborough in 1959. One cannot really do much with it. We have to go ultimately to supersonic aircraft, but the problems in developing an engine with the required power are considerable. The AV8B is the alternative aircraft. Basically the AV8B is being built for the United States Marine Corps. Quite simply, it is a bomb truck. It is a very effective bomb truck. It will carry a good load, come back, rearm and go out again. But it is a close support weapons system for the United States Marine Corps in beach landings and in a land environment. It is not a fighting aircraft at all in the sense of being an air to air weapons system and, while it could be modified to provide it with some air to air radar and air to air weapons systems, the cost of doing so would be quite unmanageable. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Navy requirements that were advanced. Firstly, there was the requirement of convoy protection. That is not a realistic need for the Royal Australian Navy at present. The Navy puts the case that we are a great trading nation, that we rank seventh, fourteenth or whatever it is in the world and that nearly all of our exports and imports move by sea. That happens to be perfectly true. It also happens to be perfectly true that Australia owns very few of the ships that are engaged in international trade. In a time of tension, the ships of foreign nationals would have to fly under Australian flag escorts; and this simply is not a realistic situation. The countries either would not trade with Australia or, if they were going to trade with Australia, would use their own Navy ships to provide the escort services for that trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I go to all the lectures that the Navy has on justifying the need for this carrier, sea power and all the rest of it, and I hear senior naval officers talking about fighting oil convoys through from the Persian Gulf. Frankly, I cannot comprehend anyone who suggests that, with one small carrier, the Royal Australian Navy would be able to keep Australia supplied with oil by operating a convoy system from the Persian Gulf to Australia. It would be very much better to take the $1,500m that the Navy proposes to spend on this vessel and put it into researching alternative forms of energy in Australia such and putting it towards a Sasol plant or something like that so that we have 100 per cent self-sufficiency of fuel supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> The second basis on which the Navy justifies its proposed purchase is the ground of gunboat diplomacy. That has never been practised by Australia and the opportunities for practising it in the foreseeable future are just nil. We do not indulge in that sort of operation and we are unlikely ever to do that in the future. At a lesser level two other cases can be considered. The first is the business of amphibious landings and the second is the evacuation of Australian nationals from islands in the Pacific area. There is no way that the Australian Navy would have the capacity to mount opposed landings over the beach. We do not have the technology for it. It is very complex technology. The United States is the only country practising amphibious warfare techniques at any level at all. The standard approach, of course, is by air insertion-to take an airfield and fly troops in until a beachhead can be established. The better way for the Australian Navy to go would be to use the great advance it has in HMAS Tobruk, which provides a support facility for getting stores across a beach either by direct beach landings or in LCHs-that is, landing-craft (heavy)-and the smaller landing craft which can be loaded through the bow and the stern of the ship. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the evacuation of Australian nationals, the country often mentioned is New Guinea. Again, that is not a practical scenario. We will never get all Australian nationals at one point at one time. If we had to evacuate nationals out of New Guinea or any other Pacific island, such as Indonesia or anywhere like that, we would have to look at multiple pick-up points. We would need to have either multiple ships or multiple aircraft going into multiple airfields to get them out. I can see that it would be nice to have a carrier in some ways, but I do not believe there is an overwhelming priority for it in view of the great cost involved. We are talking about an involvement of around $1,500m, when everything is counted. It is not a matter of $200m or $300m-as the Navy likes to say-for a carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe approval went through this chamber in this session for the spending of $1,000m on the funding for one of the three ships which are under review in America. Presumably that is an accurate estimate of what one ship would cost in the end-to which we have to add aircraft-and remember we are talking about the Sea Harriers, which are probably more expensive than the F18. A great deal of money would be involved. In addition to that we would need to have all the training and support facilities. A figure of at least $1,500m is the sum involved. We would have this great, expensive, vulnerable asset sitting out there which we could not use for much. Just by way of comparison, we can buy two squadrons of P3C Orions for $400m to $500m. For about one-third of the cost we could buy 24 Orion aircraft. Such aircraft have a far greater range and surveillance power in anti-submarine warfare. Moreover, with four Harpoons each, they have a far greater offensive power than a carrier and its embarked aircraft would have. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia needs is a balanced force structure for the Army, Navy and Air Force. Also, it needs a balance of all three arms. We cannot have the Navy fighting the battles of Midway and the mid-Atlantic all over again. They passed us by 40 years ago and technology has proceeded enormously since. One does not get the idea at all that senior people in the Navy realise the great changes that have taken place in technology and modern weapons systems. They have not appreciated the way in which submarines, when coupled with smaller surface ships, would provide most of the defence capacity that Australia needs. A diesel-electric submarine, with its crew of 60 to 65, as opposed to a carrier with its crew of 1,000, represents a far more cost-efective way to go. When you add to that the fact that a submarine is virtually undetectable-I do not believe that the submarines which took part in the recent Kangaroo 81 exercises were detected by any of the Services at any time-you realise the attractiveness of alternative systems to the big ship syndrome from which the Navy is suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second part of my discussion and relate it specifically to the rumours concerning the purchase of a British ship, whether it be the Invincible, the first one of the class built, or the Ark Royal, which was launched the other day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To take up Senator Tate's point, the subject I am discussing is a matter of considerable concern to most people in my electorate. Maybe it does not matter in Tasmania. The point of concern to most of us in relation to the rumours that the British ship is now being considered is the position that the Navy adopted right up to recent times-that it would not consider any of the British ships in any way. Now its former rejection has apparently turned to acceptance, based purely on the fact that the ship may be available more cheaply than was initially thought. There are very grave problems in the Royal Australian Navy buying a ship of this type. For many years, ever since the purchase of the DDGs, the Royal Australian Navy has adopted United States equipment as the standard for its ships. Ships are very complex. They have in them a lot of equipment, and great cost is involved in maintaining a spares inventory for them. One of the great advantages of the FFGs, the buying of which we are now embarked upon, is the fact that they are one-design and will give us considerable savings in our support equipment holdings. The British ship comes with an entirely alien equipment fit. The power units are Bristol or Rolls Royce marine turbo-jet engines which are not used in any ship of the Australian Navy. Incidentally, they are very old engines and have no commonality at all with anything that Australia has. The electrical services are all British. The weapons sensors, armaments and missiles are all British and most significantly the communications system, which is very important to a capital ship, would require considerable modification to produce a degree of commonality with the communications systems that we have on all our ships, and on all our proposed ships, in the Australian fleet. The net effect of all of this is that the operational cost of the ship and the modifications inherent in raising it to the level of compatibility that we would want it to have with other ships in the Australian fleet would be considerably greater than the purchase price. (Quorum formed).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now that we have an audience for Senator Grimes, I will deal with the characteristics of this British ship. It is basically an anti-submarine warfare ship built for the North Sea. It embarks only five Harriers, although it would take 20 at a pinch. But that would mean that about 12 of them would have to be stored permanently on deck because the underdeck accommodation out of the weather is not available. It has only a six degrees ski jump on the front of it, which means that in the high ambient temperatures in which it would be operating in the tropics there would be a limitation in the all-up weights that we could put on those aircraft. Most importantly, it has a range of only 5,000 nautical miles at 18 knots, which is less than the Melbourne and only half that of the LPH, which was one of the ships from the United States Navy being considered for the Royal Australian Navy. Incidentally, the RAN's specification was for a range of 10,000 nautical miles at 18 knots. </PARA>
<PARA> By all accounts the ship has been plagued by mechanical problems. It is rather interesting that it was commissioned on 11 June 1980, last year, and was worked up to full operational standard only in June 1981. However, the British Navy is very keen to get out of it as fast as it can. The cost rumoured for this ship is $320m or about #stg200m. Since the British paid #stg184m, according to their parliamentary estimates, it is hardly a cheap ship for us to buy on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with the position of the Department of Defence and the Navy in relation to this projected purpose. We have just been through the whole exercise of the new tactical fighter. The need for that was justified. The specification was written, the evaluation teams were appointed and an exhaustive and impartial examination was made of the contenders, extending over nearly 10 years. We came to the point where a decision was deferred nearly 12 months ago. Finally the announcement was made last month. But at every point in that investigation, the Air Force, the Department of Defence and the Government could substantiate what they were doing in public. No justification for the need for the carrier has ever been established in public. We went to the level of reviewing designs and at that initial review point the British design was rejected. We then went into an investigation or a feasibility study last year of three ships-the LPH Iwo Jima class, the Sea Control ship and the Garibaldi class. Now we have jumped away from those we were reviewing and we are apparently going to look at a British ship. Last year's Auditor-General's report showed that we expended $7.27m in 1980-81 on the evaluation of those three ships alone and a budget was approved of $8.6m-odd for the evaluation of the three ships I have already mentioned. To throw that away and buy a ship-</PARA>

<PARA> In summary, there is no need at all for haste in this decision of whether to buy a carrier. If the decision is correct then it must be justified. If an argument is valid in private then that same argument is valid in public. I emphasise that there is no need for haste in this decision at all. One thing is certain, and that is that the British cannot sell this ship to anyone else. If they do not sell it to the Australian Navy it will just be put into mothballs in Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to deal with the politics of it all. There is an increasing level of interest in defence in Australia. The interest is in having an appropriate defence capacity for this country's needs. We do not want to go back to fighting the last World War. The Navy has had a massive public relations campaign through the Navy League of Australia, through retired admirals and serving officers to sell the concept of a new carrier to Australia. I regret to say that it has failed because the great majority of people to whom I have spoken-I am interested in defence-volunteered the information that they think we should not buy a carrier. It is impossible for the Government to proceed in the face of this community rejection of the idea of a carrier. A case must be established for its need. A case must be established also that the most appropriate ship, if we are to buy one, is bought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this late stage of the night I will not take 27 minutes of the Senate's time. However, I remind the Senate that this is the second time this week that we have been subjected to a rather lengthy speech on defence by Senator MacGibbon. We have to look at the Standing Orders, which reflect the attitudes expressed in this Parliament, if the adjournment debate or any other debate is to operate in the manner in which it is anticipated it should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise a matter tonight as a result of an attitude expressed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) during Question Time this morning. I express not only my surprise but also my disappointment at that attitude. It is the first time in my parliamentary career, which now spans in excess of seven years, that I have been the object of what could be considered to be a sexist attitude by a person who should certainly know better-a Minister of the Crown. I stress that it is little wonder that the cause of that half of the population of Australia which happens to be female is not being furthered by a government whose Ministers demonstrate attitudes such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that I am speaking only because of the attitudes expressed by the Minister this morning and his refusal to endeavour to obtain information that I sought. I asked a series of questions without notice relating to the use of private hire cars by the Department of Trade and Resources. It is a matter of great concern to me and I am sure that it is a matter of great concern to other members of this Parliament. It certainly is a cause for concern by members of the community. Senator McLaren raised this matter quite recently and I have raised it on a number of occasions. When I insisted during Question Time by way of a supplementary question that it would take a phone call to the Department of Trade and Resources to obtain the information I required, the Minister then jumped to his feet and described me as being petulant. As I said, the connotations of that word are sexist-perhaps only by common usage; nevertheless, they are sexist. I cannot imagine the same Minister ever describing the attitude of a male colleague or, more particularly, a male outside this place as being petulant, because he would be bound to get a belt on the nose. I assure him that if he used the same word to describe the attitude of a female outside this place he would get a belt on the nose. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister is really aware of what goes on in this chamber, he would know that I never ask a question in this place unless I am genuinely looking for information. I think this has been demonstrated on a number of occasions and I have always found the Minister to be most obliging and even helpful in giving answers to questions. In fact on my desk tonight I have a two-page response to a question which I asked in June which the Minister has very kindly provided me with and for which I am extremely grateful. But let me give the Minister a piece of information that he may not be aware of and perhaps it will enlighten him a little as to why I feel so strongly about his attitude and the phraseology that he chose to use this morning. The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'petulant' in three ways. The first is 'forward or immodest in speech or behaviour; wanton, lascivious'. My question could not in any way be described as forward or immodest; nor could my behaviour-unless the Minister took exception to the fact that by way of a supplementary question I insisted that the information I sought could be available if he took the time to make a telephone call. In no way could my attitude be described as wanton or lascivious and I accept, without being told, that that was not the intention of the Minister. The second definition by the Oxford English Diction- ary is 'saucy, insolent or rude'. I maintain that my attitude was none of those unless, of course, the Minister felt that I was insolent or rude in suggesting that I was entitled to receive answers to questions and that he could have quite easily made a telephone call. The third definition by the Oxford English Dictionary is 'displaying peevish or pettish impatience and irritation, especially on slight occasion'. It could be said that I displayed some impatience or irritation when I asked my supplementary question but I would not and could not agree that it was especially on a slight occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, on most occasions I have found the Minister to be most helpful and obliging in obtaining information. I am interested to know why he was so concerned at the questions that I raised this morning to the extent that he suggested that I should put them on the Notice Paper, knowing that if I did so I would not get a printed response in Hansard, the sort of response which is of interest to other people, until after 16 February next year. The use of non-government cars for government work is of great importance, as I have said. My question was asked because of my concern that Government departments are using private hire cars when Commonwealth cars are available. Because of my concern that Commonwealth drivers are being made to appear inefficient so that the Government can turn that area over to private enterprise and because of my concern that if hire cars are used and Commonwealth drivers are sitting around picking their noses because there is no other work for them then dual payments from the public purse are being made. I am given to understand that the standard rate for a private hire car in Canberra is $30 an hour but the two vehicles that I mentioned this morning are apparently-I say apparently because I am waiting for the Minister to tell me that the matters that I put before him this morning are not factual-on a special hire rate of $18 an hour each. That, of course, is part of the information that I wanted to get from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never professed, nor would I ever profess, to be an economist but I can multiply a 40-hour week by $36 an hour-that is, two cars at $18 an hour, if that is the going rate. I come up with the extraordinary figure of $1,440 a week. Is the Minister now saying that the Senate is not entitled to ask whether this is happening? Is the Minister saying that the figure for a 40-hour week for two vehicles over a 52 week year would come to nearly $75,000 and we have no right to ask whether this is being done by one department? Of course we are entitled to ask, and of course we are entitled to get the response. If in fact the Department of Trade and Resources has on permanent hire two private hire cars and drivers at the rate of $18 per car per hour, then that amount of $75,000 would pay an awful lot of Commonwealth drivers' wages. I remind the Senate that already we have seen in the last four or five years a diminution in the number of Commonwealth drivers here in Canberra so that more and more work is being farmed out to private car hire operators. </PARA>
<PARA> My question also raised the issue of who owns the cars. I think we are entitled to know whether there is a permanent contractor who has these two cars. All of this is supposition because I cannot get a response from the Minister as to whether this is actually happening. But the information I have been given is that those two cars are part of a package deal with a private hire car owner in the Australian Capital Territory-that to get two other cars that he wanted he had to buy four. Having got those two extra cars and recognising that perhaps there was not sufficient work for two more private hire cars in Canberra he shopped around for a permanent client and got the Department of Trade and Resources. That is a question to which I am entitled to have a response. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question I raised was whether this was authorised by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) or the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony). I assert that this is very real information that we are entitled to have. It is not a privilege; it is a right that members of this Parliament can ask questions and get responses. The use of Commonwealth cars, as we all know, comes under the direction of the Minaster for Administrative Services. If in fact he has authorised this then I believe we are entitled to ask when the request was made, by whom it was made and when and if it was acceded to. As I said, we are noticing some strange things happening in regard to Commonwealth vehicles. We are seeing departments make bookings with private hire firms-this is government departments I am talking about-without ever establishing whether a Commonwealth car is available. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable senators about an incident that occurred as recently as last Sunday afternoon when an overseas trade delegation arrived in Canberra. One would anticipate that an overseas trade delegation would be extended not only the courtesy but also the security of a Commonwealth car. The counter at Canberra Airport where the Commonwealth car drivers wait for their passengers was approached and the question was put about the four cars for the Department of Trade. The gentleman inquiring was informed that no Commonwealth cars had been booked. Surprise, surprise-within a matter of minutes four private hire cars arrived. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They can be extremely fortunate. It is interesting to note that they left Canberra yesterday, so for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday they had a private hire car when Commonwealth car drivers and Commonwealth cars were available. I am not raising queries in other senators' minds but I have a number of questions in my mind and I am entitled to the answers because it is becoming more and more obvious to me, as I am sure it is to other members of the Senate, that whoever is responsible for booking the cars for the Department of Trade and Resources goes straight to the private hire car firms and at no time establishes whether in fact a Commonwealth car is available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other very important aspect is that of security. If two cars are posted at the Department of Trade and Resources all day one presumes that they are there for the purpose of transporting documents and people from point A to point B. Are documents which may be considered not public rather than top secret being transported by private hire car firms across or around Canberra? Is this perhaps one of the explanations for the spate of leaked documents from a number of departments? Has that been considered by those departments which constantly use private hire car firms?</PARA>
<PARA> I have raised these questions in relation to the Department of Trade and Resources but I believe we are also entitled to know what other departments consistently use private hire cars without establishing whether in actual fact Commonwealth cars and drivers are available. We are all aware, I am sure, that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation never uses Commonwealth cars but uses taxis or private hire cars. I want to know just how many other departments do that. My point at this time-I informed the Minister this morning that more comprehensive questions would be placed on notice-is to establish just what the situation is with the Department of Trade and Resources. I am sure that government departments would be able to organise themselves in such a way that if they have documents going from point A to point B their travel officer could ring and find out whether a Commonwealth car is available. If one is not available then it would be up to the Commonwealth cars transport office-not to the departments themselves-to arrange a separate booking. May I suggest that perhaps there is a directive to travel officers, at least in the Department of Trade and Resources, that whenever transport is required private hire cars are to be used. I maintain that we should expect that a directive be issued by the Minister for Administrative Services to all departments that Commonwealth cars be fully utilised. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the liberty, and paid the courtesy, of advising the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs this morning that I intended to pursue this matter during the adjournment debate. I can only anticipate that, even given the lateness of the hour, he will have the information I requested at that time. If there is any further information which the Minister has available I will listen agog. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to be raising this matter at this hour but it is one which has been worrying me for nearly two years and it must be referred to the Senate at this time before it rises for the Christmas recess. It relates to the attempts by Mr Max Thorburn and other persons in the Mildura district to try to obtain a licence for a radio station under the name of Mildura News Group Pty Ltd. Negotiations with successive Ministers concerned with communications in that period have been frustrated and, I believe, do not reflect creditably on the Ministry and the way these matters are conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The application by these persons is to establish a 250 watt low-powered commercial operation broadcasting daily from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and servicing an area of 16 kilometres radius with a population of 26,000 people. The service would be in addition to an existing 2,000 watt station, 3MA, which serves a 100 kilometre radius with a population of 41,000. Good reason was shown why it was necessary to have an additional service. In America, such an area with such a population would have four commerical operations but in Australia there is only one radio station for 78,000 people. Rather than provide Mildura with additional radio through overlapping of high-powered stations, it was suggested that a low-powered additional station be established in Mildura. The details of this proposal are in the hands of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). They seem to me to be very sensible. They have the support of all three municipalities in the area. The Mildura Shire Council, the Mildura City Council and the Wentworth Shire Council have supported the proposal unanimously, as have the Mildura Chamber of Commerce and the Mildura Tourist Association. So the representatives of 38,000 people have pledged their support. There were no known objectors to the proposal at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the attempts ever since to get some action in regard to that matter which have been a cause of concern to them and to me. This matter was brought to my attention by a former mayor of Mildura. At various times I have made representations to the Ministers involved, first to Mr Staley and subsequently to Mr Sinclair. On 8 February 1980 I wrote to the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, the Honourable A. A. Staley, M.P. I pointed out the details of this application, the problems that they were then having, and the strong local community concern and emphasis on the need for this station. I set out the reasons why it should be supported. I drew attention to the employment it would give to townspeople in the district and the support it had from the various municipalities. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Given both the merit of the proposal and the wide support which it has I ask that consideration be given to granting an experimental licence to the Mildura News Group whose operation could be monitored by the Federal Government for, say, a period of three years. </PARA>
<PARA>It has a belief in the economic viability of this proposal, and that seemed to me to be a reasonable proposal. I wrote again to the Minister on 28 March. I had received a reply from him dated 26 March in which he acknowledged having received the proposal form Mr Max Thorburn. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In circulating the proposal to the industry, I have stressed that no commitment to proceed further should be implied. Nevertheless, I feel there is some merit in the concept as outlined and have therefore, invited comment on both the principle involved and the detail of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Some merit appears to have been accepted by the Department. So the matter proceeded. However, the application was subsequently refused in June 1980. It was rejected because of the hours of operation, in the first place, and because it was said it would run the existing operator broke. The first objection was easily cured by changed proposals from the persons who are concerned in this and who are men of experience in the commerical world. The second was, as they said, a matter of the viability of the operations in this district and that should have been referred to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and not be determined by the Department. The Mildura News Group pointed out to me in a letter in November of last year that Mr Staley had conceded this point before leaving office and had advised that it should go to the tribunal for ultimate decision and allocation of licence. It has never gone to the Tribunal. It has never been determined. Of course, the monopoly which exists in Mildura continues to this day. </PARA>
<PARA> I summarise the material and debate since that time. In November the proponents of the scheme made a statement about the supplementary licence system which was then favoured for the establishment of FM rural radio in areas where an AM station already existed. This is said in a letter dated 23 September 1980:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the proposed scheme, prosperous expanding radio markets such as Mildura, geographically and radio signal isolated, would be denied a fully independent FM operation. Mildura, for example, has been cited by the former Minister for Post and Telecommunications Mr Tony Staley as 'a very viable commerical radio market and believe that a second commerial outlet could be established under certain conditions'. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, has not happened. Many other matters raised in documents in support of that proposal are in the Minister's possession. Further, Mr Thorburn told me by letter that year:</PARA>
<PARA>Now further information is available and as the growth rate in Mildura has jumped 100 per cent in the past 12 months, new relevant information is available justifying further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>In November of last year I wrote to the Minister again setting out the situation and advancing further arguments. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my letter dated 28 November 1980. </PARA>

In view of what I'm told I will certainly write to the Minister suggesting that the matter be reconsidered, and asking whether he would be prepared to receive a deputation.

<PARA> As we have previously informed the Department, because of no forward planning, it has come to the task of now deciding where stations should go in the FM mode. Obviously the system cannot possibly introduce 125 FM stations at once, in places where AM stations already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only THREE centres in Australia where planning has been carried out for independent FM operations by private groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to state that one of those centres is Mildura. While I was overseas my office wrote to Mr Sinclair following receipt of this information. The letter stated, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> While I understand that your Department accepted a planning proposal from the Group at the end of May, I am informed by Mr Thornburn that they have again delayed any action on moving this project by calling for further reports. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be the situation that has continued. It has also been a matter of passing the buck from one person to another. We had an acknowledgement from Mr Sinclair on 7 August in which it was stated that he had asked for this matter to be considered promptly and that he would write as soon as possible. But apparently this is the type of reply which Mr Thorburn has been receiving for some considerable time, and he finds this to be very unsatisfactory. I must say that following there has been a continual effort an pressure by the Mildura News group to try to get some satisfaction. Yet, in a letter to me the News Group refers to the following situation:</PARA>
<PARA> When asked about the 'spectrum' of FM broadcasting . . . the Minister says the Department will give him a report. Mr Tony Norris of the engineering division says it is not his problem. So does Keith Sandman of the same department. Mr Don Kelly of Broadcast and Planning says that it is not his and he does not know whose it is. </PARA>
<PARA>In a further comment in the letter to me, the News Group states:</PARA>
<PARA> Bluntly, we have a Minister who does not know enough about radio to know if what the Department says is plausible or not. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of some very indignant people. They have good cause to be quite unsatisfied with the way in which this matter has proceeded and the way in which it has not been referred to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It is their belief that the existing owners of the monopoly in Mildura have altogether too much influence in this area. It is said-my discussion with Mr Thorburn indicated this-that the argument might be raised that the Group cannot do anything about the situation at the moment because the supplemental licences may be dependent upon the removal of television stations from the FM band. I am told that that is not so and that it would be possible to introduce a number of new stations at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that persons who want to undertake new radio stations and who have the finances and the desire to create employment in this way should have that opportunity. It is apparently said that nothing can be done at the moment but that is not right. At least one or two FM stations-perhaps more-could be put on the band. But for all this time there has been constant delay, constant refusal to refer the matter to the Tribunal and an inability for people in this community to create new enterprises and to create competition where monopolies exist. I believe that this is a disgraceful situation and I urge the Minister to take action to get this matter before the Tribunal as early as possible so that these people will have justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must commence by thanking honourable senators who are here at this hour tonight for being here and listening to me. At the moment South Australia is entering a rather heated, emotional and distorted debate. It is a debate of lies, deceit and, as I have said, distortions in an endeavour to maintain the political skin of the State Liberal Government. The debate is centred about the proposal for a mining development at Roxby Downs. I would like to refer to one aspect of this campaign and discuss the performance of one particular person both in respect of this campaign and also generally in Australian business and political affairs. The person is Alan Carroll, who has quite often been used by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and has often been used as an independent business analyst. On the ABC news in South Australia on 29 September Mr Carroll said that Roxby Downs clearly does represent the biggest opportunity South Australia faces. In the news items of that day he went on to say that Roxby was unquestionably the centrepiece of a development approach to South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Carroll was introduced on that news service and on other Australian Broadcasting Commission radio and television services as a leading business analyst. In fact, as I said earlier, he has been used quite often. He regularly appears on the ABC programs AM, PM, Money Talk, and talk back and other current affairs slots. During 1979 and from 1 January 1980 to the end of 1980 he appeared 41 times on ABC radio and 27 times on ABC television. He has continued to appear on both ABC forums this year. When the ABC uses Mr Carroll it does not tell the whole story. Mr Carroll is not an independent analyst. It should be carefully explained that he is a man at the centre of an enormous amount of business wheeling and dealing and political manipulation in Australia. In fact, he is the director of Business International Asia Pacific Ltd, a subsidiary of the giant New York based firm, Business International Corporation, and he is also director, Australia and South East Asia, of Business International Corporation. This company is a service organisation for almost three-quarters of the world's transnational corporations. Many of those transnational corporations have great interests in Australia. They are crucially intertwined with the Australian economy in terms of both investment and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me list some of the companies involved. There are companies based in Sydney which include General Electric, Mitsubishi, IBM, Union Carbide, Warner Lambert, Parke Davis, Goodyear, Pioneer Concrete, the Swiss Bank Corporation, Richardson Merrell and Wormald. The Melbourne based companies include ACI, Beatrice Foods, Chase Manhatten Bank, Conzinc Riotinto, Monsanto, Nicholas International, Sperry Rand, Hoechst, Billington ACI and Coopers and Lybrand. A brief profile of the participating firms with which Business International is involved, firms with over $4,000 billion in local assets, would show that the largest United States company, General Electric, the largest Japanese company, Mitsubishi, the largest British company, CRA, and the largest German company, Hoechst, are currently operating in Australia. It would also show that the four largest Australian multinational corporations in terms of income derived from their overseas operations are ACI, Pioneer Concrete, Wormald and Nicholas. It would show that the Japanese firm responsible for almost 33 per cent of the total trade flows between Australia and Japan is Mitsubishi and that two of the most influential foreign banks operating in Australia are the Swiss Bank and the Chase Manhatten Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Allegations have been made about Mr Carroll in the past. They have concerned Mr Carroll's deep involvement in political events in Australia. He was reputed to be the driving force behind the organising of British and American financial houses which mobilised against the former Victorian Premier Hamer, a mobilisation which we all know led to the downfall of that man. Mr Carroll is also said to be deeply involved in the political destabilisation going on within the Federal Liberal Party-a move aimed at removing the present Prime Minister; a move with which we on this side of the chamber would not disagree. But Mr Carroll's political meddling is not confined to the right wing of politics. He has also tried to involve himself in Australian Labor Party affairs and in the trade union movement. In a supposedly secret speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia in April this year he laid his scenario for the future of the Labor movement and the machinations of the Labor Party, both federal and State, as well as the political wing and the trade union wing. On the trade union front he actively called for the removal of Cliff Dolan. So when it comes to assessing the role of Mr Carroll one should see him as being intricately intertwined with vested political and business interests that have major concerns in the Australian economy. Just to show how serious Mr Carroll and his associates are about running countries and undermining democratic governments, I will quote from a Business International document which was released quite recently. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> International corporations possess a high proportion of the technology, the managerial talent and the private capital required for the solution of the economic and social problems of this planet. They can tackle development of the resources of the sea, economic development of poor countries, new housing everywhere, the protection of the human environment, the training of people for skilled managerial and technical work, and the creation of jobs for underprivileged people. </PARA>
<PARA>This quotation is from the Business International conference in Jamaica in 1971 which was attended by the presidents of 38 leading global companies. What the quote shows is that Business International has no respect for the democratic right of people to their own self-determination within their own communities and countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn once again to the South Australian situation. In the rash of speculation about an early election in South Australia, Mr Carroll bobbed up on the main Australian Broadcasting Commission news services in Adelaide. As I said, he was introduced as a 'leading business analyst'. He said that Roxby Downs was the biggest opportunity South Australia faced. What was not stated in all those news services was that Mr Carroll was a consultant for the Western Mining Corporation and BP Australia, the two giant firms exploiting the ores of Roxby Downs. In evidence of that statement, I turn to the report in the Adelaide News of 14 September 1980 in which the financial editor, Mr Frank Moore, said:</PARA>
<PARA>And Alan should know-he is a consultant to both partners in the amazingly rich uranium-copper-gold prospect, Western Mining Corporation and BP. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the problems raised in this instance are not the direct ones of Mr Carroll trying to sell up a project but they are twofold and in both instances the public is the loser. For a start, we have this political interference in the community's affairs and interests. We also have a situation which has been defined time and time again in Government and parliamentary reports, that is, one in which a business analyst, a business commentator or a journalist comments on the activities of a company in which he or she has a direct or an indirect interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn very briefly to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. In Part 1 of Volume 1 at page 205 of that report very much the same problem is identified. The report, in commenting on Australian Investments Counsellors Pty Ltd and Patrick Partners, said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is relevant is the fact that it was possible to act in two roles at the same time, that is, as a tipster and a share trader, and to use the combination of those roles for personal interest, while acting irresponsibly to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem was raised there; it was identified there. It was a problem of financial interest conflicting with public interest. The Riordan Committee, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament, which reported in 1975, also identified this problem. As a response to this problem the Committee advocated setting up a media council with a media register of pecuniary interests. It advocated a code of conduct on all media elements and all media programs. It also advocated an enforcement tribunal. The Riordan Committee in fact suggested that the general guardianship of the highest professional and commercial standards which would include the preservation of a free, varied and non-monopolistic media devoid of myopic and base propaganda should be the aim of the operations of such a body. </PARA>
<PARA> So the problem has been recognised in the past. It has not in fact been recognised by this Government despite the two initiatives with which this Government has been involved. The Bowen report, from the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest in 1979, neglected all aspects of this problem. In fact, the Securities Industry Act of 1980 does not cover the position of business analysts. It may cover the position of journalists but not business analysts. The problem raised by Mr Carroll's intervention in South Australian politics is a very serious one. It is serious because it has the effect of aborting rational debate in that a person is portrayed as an independent business analyst but, at the same time, has a very vital financial interest in the business on which he is commentating. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem that is raised by Mr Carroll's intervention is the continued problem of his use by the ABC. The problem has been raised in this place in the past by my colleague Senator Ryan and in another place by another one of my colleagues, the honourable member for Lalor, Mr Barry Jones. The point is that Mr Carroll should not continue to be used by the ABC and described as an independent business analyst. His continued use is nothing more than a manipulation of a very important information flow to the public and should cease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is very late and I will be as brief as I can. A number of honourable senators have taken the opportunity this evening to raise in the adjournment debate matters of general interest because at this stage of the session the opportunities of doing that are limited and patience gets worn a little thin. I will do my best not to weary my fellow senators any more than is necessary this evening. I want to take the opportunity before this session ends to raise a subject of concern; that is, whether Australia will host an international exposition in 1988. The Government has to come to a decision on this matter within the next few days. I will place on record for the benefit of honourable senators and others some of the factors that need to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present situation is that Australia has indicated-and indicated several years ago-that it would like to stage an international exposition in 1988 to coincide with Australia's bicentenary. The Bureau of International Expositions, which is headquartered in Paris, has been aware of this for some time and we have had a tentative bid to hold an international expo in Australia in 1988. This matter was raised with me as long ago as 1974 by a group of Brisbane businessmen and activists who were then putting forward a proposal that there be an international exposition in Brisbane in 1988 for the purposes of the bicentenary. With the passage of seven years the situation has developed past that; it developed to the stage where it appeared that Melbourne was to stage the international exposition if Australia in fact finally decided that it wanted it. I understand that feasibility studies were undertaken. These studies indicated something very favourable for Australia if Melbourne were to stage it. Subsequently the Government of Victoria decided that it did not want to be involved in staging an expo in 1988 and Sydney became the centre of attraction. I understand that a feasibility study was done in relation to Sydney. The outcome of that study was not altogether unfavourable. Due to certain happenings in New South Wales, it indicated that it would not go ahead with it. At that point the whole business went full circle and it then went back to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government from the beginning has enthusiastically supported the concept of an international exposition in Australia to coinside with our bicentenary in 1988. It now says, just as enthusiastically, that it is prepared to be the host State. The basic situation is that the cost of mounting the exposition, as it has been discussed throughout with all the State governments I have mentioned, is that half the cost would be met by the Commonwealth Government and half by the host State government. The Queensland Government has indicated firmly and enthusiastically that it is prepared to undertake half the cost of staging an international exposition up to an upper limit of $200m in 1981 terms, which is the amount of money which was talked about when it was also discussed in relation to Sydney and Melbourne. For several years it looked as though, if Australia wanted the exposition in 1988, it was Australia's. That situation has changed. France has now entered a firm bid to host an international exposition in Paris-as I understand it, in 1988. Australia's bid is not firm. In early December of this year, just a few days away, there will be a meeting of the Bureau of International Expositions at which the city where Expo 88 will be staged will be finally determined. At that meeting the Commonwealth Government, as the national government, must say to the Bureau of International Expositions: 'Australia wants the expo in 1988 to coincide with our bicentenary'. If Australia does not say that at the meeting it will be lost to us forever and it will go to France. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to play my part in urging the Government not to allow that to happen. World fairs are things that seem a little distant to Australians in general terms. That makes it a little more difficult to persuade people that it is very important that we make that a firm bid to the Bureau of International Expositions. Australia has not hosted a world fair for several years. In the nineteenth century we hosted three of them-in Sydney in 1879 and in Melbourne in 1880 and 1888, which coincided with our first centenary. We have not hosted one since, but we have been participating in them in recent years. We participated in twentieth century expositions in 1967, 1970, 1974 and 1975, so Australia is established as an exhibitor in international expositions. That certainly assists our bid. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the benefits of an international exposition? For those of us who have not actually witnessed one and been intimately involved, it is very difficult to envisage. But it does give a country a unique opportunity to display itself to the world. Countries are invited to participate and to mount part of the exposition. They are meant to be expositions of human achievement and, of course, countries take the opportunity to indicate particular things in relation to themselves. It is not, I emphasise, a trade fair. Nevertheless, it does give a country an opportunity to display to the world its achievements and aspirations. The host country, of course, is the country on which the main spotlight falls. We have not hosted an exposition for almost 100 years. We last hosted an exposition in 1888. But we have been an exhibitor. The time for being a host country again is well and truly due. </PARA>
<PARA> All things are favourable to us to be the host country. There are advantages to the citizens of the host country. They have the opportunity of seeing at first hand the achievements of their own country in a global context. They can see the advances we have made in areas of technology and in society and they can compare them with the bright ideas that come from other countries that exhibit. They give us the stimulus to look ahead. No year could be more appropriate for this than our bicentenary year. It would have a very particular meaning to our very large population of recent migrant origin. The very large proportion of our population which is first generation recent arrival migrants or refugees would have the opportunity to look at what their own country is achieving and to be proud in their new country of part of their heritage. It would give us the opportunity to understand even better that heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> There are specific material benefits relating to an international exposition. Local industries, businesses, motels and, of course, the travel industry benefit. During the construction phase there is a huge boom. Permanent facilities remain in the host country and have benefit to the country for ever. The economy receives a very direct and major stimulus at the time of the staging of the exposition. World attention is focused, in particular, on the host city and the host State with all that that means to them. I say unashamedly as a Senator for Queensland that I hope very much that Expo 88 will be held in Brisbane. It would be very appropriate if it were to be held in Brisbane. Queensland is now Australia's number one tourist State in terms of both domestic tourism and growth of international tourism. The Commonwealth Government has committed itself to and is proceeding with the construction of a fully international standard airport. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the facilities that must be provided in the staging of an international exposition is a convention centre of international standard. Australia does not have a convention centre of international standard. This would be the fillip that would give us that facility and put us on the map for that form of international tourism, which is probably the most significant in terms of single sectors of types of international tourism. All of that would ultimately benefit Australia. The facilities would be permanent. The benefits to Australia would be permanent. There would be specific benefits, of course, for Queensland. But, I repeat, the basis of staging the exposition is that the host State government pays half the costs. It would be, in that sense, earning the permanent facilities. As I understand it, the benefits that would flow during the staging of the exposition would be not only to the host city or State. The types of activities and the things that would come to the exposition would be spread ultimately throughout Australia so that all States and all major cities would have the benefit of seeing at first hand significant parts of the exposition. A good number of Australians would travel to Brisbane if it hosted that international exposition. Even those who did not travel would have brought close to them some of the interesting aspects of the exposition and would be able to participate in and benefit from them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very exciting concept. It is appropriate that we should be thinking in those terms for our bicentenary year. We should take a bold step and put ourselves on the world stage in that way. We should show people that it is our bicentenary and, in a very special way as an international happening, show what has been achieved in this country in 200 years and what we hope for in the future. If we do not host that exposition I suggest respectfully, Mr President, that Australia's bicentenary in 1988 will be, in international terms, a non-event. That year South Korea will host the Olympic Games. If it happens that coincidentally the other major international event, the international Expo, is held in France, Australia's bicentenary will have very little attraction in competition with those two events. To stage the exposition would bring to world attention the fact that it is our bicentenary. We have much to be proud of. I hope that the Government will take what is a bold step. </PARA>
<PARA> The down side of the proposal is, I suppose, the fact that in current terms it is estimated that it would cost $200m. We are talking about that sort of expenditure over the next seven years. In the current economic climate I can understand that the Government would feel some small hesitancy about committing itself to a sum of that size. I emphasise, however, that the Queensland Government has committed itself to half the cost. In those circumstances one would hope that the national Government would have the same sort of courage to commit itself to half the cost spread over a period of years. The benefits, financial and otherwise, would come back many times over. I do not have available to me the content of the feasibility studies that were done in relation to Melbourne and Sydney but I am informed by those who have seen them that they show that the cost of staging the exposition would be more than met by the benefits that would come in the time that the exposition was being staged. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that it is necessary that Australia make what might appear in current terms to be a bold move. It is a move that would do us credit as a nation of the future. It would demonstrate some of the pride that we have in ourselves as a nation and the aspirations that we have for the future. Australia aspires to be a world leader. I think we can be proud of many of the things that we have done. I very much hope that our Government will, in the next few days, show the sort of moral, if not political, courage which is necessary in the short term to make that decision. I emphasise that if the decision is not made in the next few days the exposition will be lost to us forever. That would be a very great pity, not just because 1988 is our bicentenary but because it is time we gathered ourselves together and put ourselves on the world stage given that it is 100 years since we have had that sort of courage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The adjournment debate has taken one and a quarter hours. I think that five senators have contributed to the debate. My aviator colleague Senator MacGibbon addressed us first on matters of aircraft carriers. I am sure that at least a number of senators will feel better informed in their understanding of the strategic options facing Australia and the machinations of retired admirals. I will undertake to make sure that Senator MacGibbon's comments are brought to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). I doubt whether there is much else I can say to address the particular matter he raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Missen raised the question of Mr Thornburn in Mildura. Of course, Mildura is of interest to those New South Wales senators who are interested in the reception of radio and television across the other side of that body of water which separates New South Wales from Victoria. I also have had contact with Mr Thornburn in Mildura and have been aware of his problem for some time. Senator Missen set out a sequence of events which he considers to be unsatisfactory and has indicated his concern that there is a continuing unresolved problem. It is appropriate that that be referred to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) for response. I doubt whether there is much else I can do tonight except to undertake to pass on that matter on Senator Missen's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Coleman raised substantial matters I will leave my reply to her comments to the end. Senator Bolkus in his interesting and partly read address made some comments about a Mr Alan Carroll on an ex parte basis. Many contributions in the Senate on the adjournment are on an ex parte basis. That does not mean they are incorrect but it means that one has to remember that there may be another side to the story and one has to take them on that basis. I do not know whether I agree that all practitioners in any field should be disqualified from commenting. I think it is important that people know who is addressing them. If Senator Bolkus was seeking to have certain people disqualify themselves from public comment on certain matters I hope that he was seeking to do so in a broad and even-handed way. I think he was stating certain matters which do not require ministerial consideration at the Federal level. I have noted what he had to say. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Martin commented about an exposition in 1988. Again as a senator from New South Wales I am aware that in 1788 an event occurred not on the banks of the Brisbane River but at Sydney Cove. If we are going for panem et circenses and looking for circuses for 1988, as a New South Wales senator expressing a preference, I would like to see them in New South Wales. Having said that, I think Senator Martin is quite correct. There are a number of propositions before government in relation to 1988 and if, as she says, there is a proposition in relation to an expo in Brisbane and if in fact it requires a decision by government that is a decision which has to be taken by government. It is not proper for me to anticipate that decision or to say anything of substance in response to the matter she raised. </PARA>

<PARA> I now come to Senator Coleman's contribution. It contained some matters of detail to which I have some answers. I am glad she looked up the dictionary meaning of the word 'petulant'. The third meaning she quoted is the sense in which I used the word. That she considered it sexist is something that surprises me. I cannot see how that could have been. I will be happy to discuss with her later how I could possibly have been sexist in using that word. It is a word I think I might use in relation to anyone who spoke the same way. Knowing that the honourable senator asked some questions this morning and that she was keen and quite concerned that some information should be given tonight, I have in fact tried to locate some information on the matters she raised. In fact it seems that in raising the matters of concern she has probably drawn the incorrect conclusions or has been given incorrect information, probably on all of them. I will give her the information I have. Senator Coleman may wish to test that and to take the matter further. I have spoken to people in the office of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and they in fact have been in touch with the Department of Trade and Resources. The Minister for Administrative Services has supplied answers to the questions asked by Senator Coleman. Senator Coleman's first question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that two private hire cars and drivers are stationed at the Department of Trade and Resources all day each working day in case the Department has a need to transport persons or documents to other departments?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer I have been provided with is that the Department of Trade and Resources has advised the Department of Administrative Services that it only hires vehicles through the Department of Administrative Services. There are no private hire cars allocated on a continuing basis to the Department of Trade and Resources by DAS in Canberra. Apart from casual car pool car-with-driver hirings, and for which a Commonwealth car, a hire car or a taxi may be provided, there are only a few vehicles which the Department of Trade and Resources has on permanent hire without driver which are provided to the Department of Trade and Resources in Canberra. I have been told that they are the only vehicles-the word 'only' was emphasised-on hire to the Department of Trade and Resources in Canberra. Those vehicles constitute two Datsun 200B sedans, two Datsun 200B station sedans-I have the licence numbers but I am sure the honourable senator does not want them-two Toyota Corolla sedans, all fairly small cars, plus two Holden utilities and a Toyota panel van. That, for a large department, is not a large number of vehicles. The second question asked by the honourable senator was:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that those two cars at the moment carry New South Wales number plates?</PARA>
<PARA>Both that question and the honourable senator's third question are irrelevant in view of the answer I have just given. I was offered some additional comments, which I now make available to the Senate. I am advised that the Department of Trade and Resources is accommodated within the Edmund Barton Building in Canberra and that several other departments also occupy that building. Therefore, the presence of vehicles outside the building may not necessarily have any relationship to the Department of Trade and Resources. The Department of Administrative Services has not arranged the allocation of any private hire cars to those other departments on a continuing basis. That covers the second matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The office of the Minister for Administrative Services has advised me also that it is not familiar with the details of any privately owned vehicles which might regularly park in the vicinity of the Edmund Barton Building and which might not in fact be on hire to anyone. I have been advised by the Minister, whom I represent, that two luxury sedans with New South Wales registration plates were parked outside the Edmund Barton Building today. Those vehicles were not hired by the Department of Administrative Services for allocation to any Commonwealth department or Commonwealth authority; nor were they hired by the Department of Trade and Resources. I must say to the honourable senator that, in the light of that information, there is no basis for the concern she has expressed. The vehicles were not hired-</PARA>
