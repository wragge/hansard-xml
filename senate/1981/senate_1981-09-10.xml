<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sir Robert Askin and his career have been widely described in the media today and are known to all. Basically, I direct my attention to the real matter of concern at a time of such a death. We tend to look at and dwell upon those who have achieved some distinction and greatness in life and overlook the fact that we should turn to those who remain, those who mourn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I specifically want to express our deep sadness to Lady Askin, a woman of rare qualities. Mollie Askin was married to Sir Robert for some 41 years. She, in her own way, earned distinction in her local community. Nobody could have been a more loyal and devoted wife to him. Nobody could earn more respect and, indeed, affection from those who came in contact with her. Therefore, I think it is appropriate, particularly as the last few weeks and months have demanded great strength, courage and dedication from her, that we should send to her a very special message. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge that in Sir Robert Askin we had in New South Wales a Premier of record breaking qualities. We acknowledge the man himself, who rose from humble beginnings to achieve the highest position in his own State. There are many qualities that one could attribute to him. I, having been privileged to walk alongside him over that journey from his first pre-selection to his retirement in 1975, pay tribute to the man himself. It is a story of a man from humble beginnings who achieved very great distinction, and that has been recognised. On behalf of all senators, and of course personally, I convey to Mollie Askin our sharing of her sense of loss and our sadness at his passing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer: Is it a fact that the former Minister for Industrial Relations yesterday strongly criticised the means adopted in the 1981 Budget to achieve the Government's economic aims? Did he say that families have been hit with higher taxes and charges, small businesses hit and State governments squeezed, while Commonwealth spending has continued to increase? I ask the Minister whether, in her opinion, those criticisms are justified?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I did not have time to read the precise remarks of the former Minister for Industrial Relations in his speech on the Budget, but I did see some headlines covering perhaps some of the items mentioned by Senator Button. Perhaps it would be advisable for me to read the speech of the former Minister before making any comment on it. However, I can say that the structure of the Budget was designed to assist families, indeed all Australians, to give them the opportunity to have as low a rate of inflation as is possible, to have as wide employment opportunities as are possible and to continue the development of this country in a way that will give those advantages to all Australians. If the former Minister has other views, he may express them. The strategy of the Budget as outlined by the Treasurer on Budget night was to achieve the very reverse of some of the things that were mentioned in the question by Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Transport to air navigation regulation 249, which restricts the distance from land for flights over water. Is the Minister aware that there are several sea planes, float planes and amphibians operating in the Queensland tourist industry, especially in the Great Barrier Reef area, but that the distances to various outer reefs and sections of the Great Barrier Reef itself are in excess of the stated water distance? Will the Minister consider altering the air navigation regulations to exempt these categories of aircraft from these restrictions and thus provide added and needed facilities for Queensland tourists?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware that these limitations have applied. The 50-nautical-mile limitation is a stated safety requirement related to the period of exposure to the risk of engine failure in a single-engine aircraft. Clearly there are a great many parts of the Great Barrier Reef which might provide suitable protected alighting areas for this type of aircraft but which involve flights in excess of 50 miles. The responsibility for aviation safety regulation lies with the Secretary to the Department of Transport. There is the power under air navigation regulation 249 to vary its conditions and limitations. Any submission should therefore be made to the Secretary to the Department. I am happy to facilitate that if Senator Collard has an individual matter which he would like to put to the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. By way of preface, I refer to yesterday's declaration by the Australian Council of Trade Unions that greater attention should be paid by all governments, particularly this Government, to industrial safety. I remind the Senate that, during the last session, Senator Peter Baume said that an interdepartmental committee was determining whether industrial safety in the Commonwealth sphere would be the responsibility of the Minister for Science and Technology or the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the Minister whether any decision has been made. I would imagine that the Minister for Industrial Relations should be the one to look after industrial safety.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some information on the matter which has been raised by the honourable senator. A review is currently being undertaken by the Public Service Board of the human relations and working environment functions, which are to be scaled down, with any residual functions being transferred from the Department of Science and Technology to the Department of Industrial Relations. The review by the Public Service Board has not yet been completed. The functions concerning industrial safety remain, for the time being, responsibilities of the Department of Science and Technology. This is an area in which, as the honourable senator from New South Wales would be aware, the primary responsibility lies with State departments and the supervision of conditions and so on directly relating to industrial safety rests with State departments. A relatively small Commonwealth function is involved here. It is under review and that review has not yet been completed.</PARA></TALK.START>

I remind the Minister of the fateful words of Senator Peter Baume at an Estimates committee hearing last session in answer to my question regarding how long the review would take. Senator Peter Baume gave the impression that it would take only a couple of months. I remind the Government that that occurred in April and it is now September.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The further words of Senator Mulvihill in that question will be directed to the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations. Sometimes these matters do take longer in review than was originally anticipated. I accept that this is an area of importance. I qualify that only by reminding the honourable senator of what I said a few moments ago; that is, that it is an area in which the principal operating responsibility lies not with the Commonwealth but with State departments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer to the Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Scheme, which has done a great deal towards improving the quality of life of people living in remote areas of Australia. People with modest means are experiencing difficulty in meeting the cost of plane tickets even though most of the cost is subsequently refunded to them. This applies particularly to patients who have to travel long distances or who need regular treatment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Scheme has been of benefit in most remote areas in Australia. I know of a large number of people in my own state of New South Wales who have sought to take advantage of its provisions. Of course, it is an initiative of the Fraser Government designed to bring benefits to people in non-metropolitan Australia, and it has been appreciated as such. I understand the thrust of the honourable senator's question to relate to the cost, whether or not the initial outlay which people are required to make can be recouped later. I will certainly undertake to put Senator Thomas's very reasonable proposition to the Minister whom I represent to see whether the honourable senator's constituents in Western Australia, and others, can derive any benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister will be aware also of the recent prediction of racial violence at the Games by his chief Aboriginal adviser, Mr Charles Perkins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last thing any Australians want to see is violence at the time of the Commonwealth Games. It is an important international event and I think all Australians would want to see it go ahead in a spirit of comity and amity. I think people want to see a successful carnival. If the stage is being set by anyone, it is being set by the Australian Labor Party because the actions which it is proposing to take to pre-empt a reasonable decision by Queensland are the very kinds of actions which can lead only to a hardening of attitudes on all sides. The Australian people want a solution in Queensland which meets the very best aspirations of the Aboriginal communities there, to provide them with the tenure they require on their reserves. I do not think any attempt, for cheap political purposes, to pre-empt the consultative processes in Queensland will be in the best interest of Aboriginals and I certainly do not think it will be in the best interests of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment to an Age report of 22 August which claims that the Great Barrier Reef is once again threatened by millions of coral-devouring crown of thorns starfish. Will the Minister comment on this report and, in particular, the statement by Dr Robert Endean of the University of Queensland, a world authority on the crown thorns, that it is vital that the Federal and State governments act quickly to put teeth into laws designed to protect natural predators of the starfish? I ask the Minister, firstly, what restrictions and bans presently exist on the harvesting of the fish and shellfish which control the crown of thorns; secondly, are these restrictions and bans adhered to by spear fishermen; and, thirdly, will increased efforts be made by the Government to police and enforce these laws so as to ensure that the natural predators of the starfish are protected?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain that I have the answers to all the honourable senator's questions. However, having seen the article in the Age newspaper of 22 August, I do have some notes on the statements made by Dr Endean. The Queensland Fisheries Service and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority last year undertook surveys on the crown of thorns infestations on reefs between Innisfail and Cooktown. Further investigations are being developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, including a detailed historical study of previous crown of thorns populations and their relationships, if any, to human use of the reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Authority is concerned about the recent apparent increase in crown of thorns starfish populations, but it must be added that despite extensive research there is still no hard evidence to support the suggestion that large crown of thorns populations are the consequence of human activity on or near the Great Barrier Reef. The Marine Park Authority will continue to monitor the crown of thorns situation and to support appropriate research programs into the key questions of the causes and possible controls. In view of experience of the starfish since 1960, it would be unrealistic to expect quick answers.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to commercial spear fishing, the Authority is well aware of problems which may be caused by this activity. Commercial spear fishing has therefore been completely banned in the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under the zoning plan and regulations which came into operation on 1 July this year. In addition, other regulatory controls for the protection of certain forms of marine life, including the giant triton shellfish, apply throughout the Great Barrier Reef region as a result of existing Commonwealth and State legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Has the Minister noted an article in the Sun of 7 September, under the title 'Crisis Warning Over Lack of Teachers', stating that Australia could face a massive teacher shortage unless the Government trains more teachers? If I recollect correctly, a completely different report was publicised a few months ago, indicating that there is a surplus of teachers in Australia due to the diminishing number of school children.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that there has been a very great slowdown in the birth rate in Australia and therefore a decline in the enrolments in most but not all States. In a large part of this decade there was a very great expansion of the number of teachers in the work force. I think some 30,000 teachers have come in in a matter of six years. This has taken the figure from about 140,000 teachers to 170,000 teachers. That was an enormous increase at a time when the school population rose at a much slower rate. The predictions, as I recall them, were that there would be surpluses of teachers in various capacities, but not in some specialist capacities, for some years and that perhaps in the middle of this decade or beyond there would be some need for increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that at the moment persons seeking work as teachers are available in the community and, therefore, are capable of being employed. One of the difficulties is often geographical in that teachers seek to obtain work close to their homes. Many of them are married women with families and, therefore, there is a geographic rigidity. I did not see the article in the Sun. I am not aware of any facts which suggest that at the moment there is a crisis because of a lack of teachers. My understanding is that more recently in New South Wales it was disclosed that a number of teachers were seeking employment and an undertaking was given by the Wran Government that it would provide jobs for all of them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue in Queensland is that of land tenure. The issue is about whether the Aboriginals are able to get tenure, under adequate terms, for the reserves on which they live. That is what the argument is around. That should be the only goal and the only end people seek to achieve. The Commonwealth position has been made quite clear. I have made it clear on a number of occasions. In this place I have tabled the four principles on which the Commonwealth has based its case. I remind honourable senators that those principles include the integrity of the reserve boundaries, an adequate form of tenure, an adequate role of self-management and consultation with the communities. These are the principles on which the Commonwealth is pursuing this matter of land tenure. It may be that the words 'land rights' are just a slogan which people use. The end which people can achieve must be looked at. If a form of land tenure can be achieved which includes those four principles I believe the aspirations of the Aboriginals in Queensland, as I have heard them, will be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Queensland position has not been stated by the Queensland Cabinet or Government and, in fact, what Ministers have said during this year has moved somewhat. I think it is quite improper to try to assume that we can know what the Queensland Cabinet will decide at some time in the future. If people are talking about deficiencies in what is being proposed, they might find it of some interest to know that a Bill presently before the Senate provides that certain communities and reserves will be completely free from the operation of any law of Queensland. If honourable senators examine the Bill, as they are to be called on to do, they will see that it actually proposes that these reserves will be free of the operation of any Queensland law. I think the people who are proposing that Bill need to be quite certain that they are not putting into statutory form what is the essence of apartheid, that is, that one portion of the community should be under a separate legislative structure and statutory basis from other areas. I know what the people of Australia decided at the referendum, and so does everyone else. The position that the Commonwealth has taken is one designed to make sure that Aboriginals in Queensland are able to achieve that desirable goal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is true that the meaning of the term 'average weekly earnings' is sometimes misunderstood. The main difficulty with terms such as 'average wage' or 'median wage' is in determining and identifying for collection exactly what should be considered as a wage. Perhaps Senator Archer will appreciate that the present alternative used by the Australian Statistician-'average weekly, ordinary time earnings for full time, non-managerial adult male employees'-presents difficulties, for instance, in a 20 second television grab and it is perhaps difficult to have a term that is easily understood. But it is a matter that I could refer to the Treasurer to see whether there is some other way in which an interpretation could be given or some better degree of understanding could be provided of what is in our minds. As I say, the Statistician does use the term 'average weekly earnings' and, if there is misunderstanding, we may be able to assist in interpretation of that.

Ten other applicants, including several voluntary groups and local government authorities, are still awaiting funding. Several agencies have for some time accepted referrals from the State Department of Community Welfare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not able to give the honourable senator from Western Australia all the detail that she has requested. The youth support scheme to which she referred is, as she indicated, a pilot project and the term of the pilot project will expire on 30 June 1982. It is my hope that the evaluation of that scheme will be completed during the course of the latter part of this financial year-that is, before 30 June 1982-so that we can examine in good time the future of the projects which have been funded under the scheme. The sort of thing which needs careful consideration from a Commonwealth viewpoint was thrown up by an element in the honourable senator's question. The honourable senator referred to the fact that some of the agencies in her State and my State of Western Australia have been receiving referrals from the State Department of Community Welfare. I would say to the Senate that I am not anxious to see the expansion of a Commonwealth project which simply involves the Commonwealth taking over State responsibilities with respect to the care of children. I think that would not be a particularly productive initiative on the part of the Commonwealth. We are looking to providing ancillary and additional services rather than merely substituting services for what the State provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The funding of youth support scheme projects in Western Australia has not proceeded on the same basis as the funding in other States. In other States there has been a joint funding of projects between the Commonwealth and State governments. In Western Australia, after some very long discussions which occurred prior to my becoming Minister for Social Security, it was finally agreed that the Commonwealth would fund certain projects on a separate basis-that is, totally fund those projects-while the State would continue to fund its own projects. It is true that only a small number of projects-the honourable senator said four and I think that is correct-have been funded under the scheme in Western Australia. I have before me at the moment requests with respect to the funding of additional projects in Western Australia. However, because of the relatively short time to the completion of the pilot project, I am not very anxious to see additional projects funded when on an evaluation it might be determined that the scheme will not continue the funding of those projects after 30 June 1982. It seems to me that that would be a rather pointless thing to do. I have no doubt it is coincidental but I discussed this area with the Western Australian Minister for Police and Traffic, and Community Welfare, the Honourable Bill Hassell, by telephone yesterday and I anticipate further communications between us over the coming week. I may then be in a position to give more definite information to the honourable senator and the Senate following those discussions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that Senator Hill has an interest in the needs of his electors in South Australia and his question is related to that interest. I am advised that this financial year the Commonwealth made available for the program a total of $2.4m, of which the substantial sum of $200,000 was earmarked for South Australia. Unlike the States of Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, and the Northern Territory, the South Australian Government has decided not to participate in the implementation of this important program in its State. Of course this will greatly complicate the task of introducing the program in South Australia and of enabling disabled South Australians to benefit from the provision of $200,000 for aids to assist them to live more independently within their communities. The exact level of demand for the aids to be provided under this new program is not known at this stage. For that reason, it is not possible to give a guarantee in the exact terms sought by South Australia. However, what can be said is that this is an ongoing program in terms of Commonwealth funding. My colleague, the Minister for Health, made that point known in writing to all State Ministers for Health but apparently it has been missed by the South Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's objective of having this program administered through the State health services is soundly based. The main reason for this approach has been that the State health services are very widely dispersed throughout Australia and this method of implementation would give disabled persons the maximum ease of access to the program-an opportunity which will now be denied if we cannot get the co-operation and involvement of South Australia. Following advice of the South Australian Government's decision, urgent consideration is being given to the possibility of alternative methods of introducing the program in that State. Obviously, my colleague is not yet in a position to inform the Senate or the honourable senator which method, whether through a Commonwealth department or some other type of agency, may be suitable. If any other parts of the question remain unanswered I will be happy to refer them to my colleague.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, refers to a report in a newspaper today that another Royal Australian Air Force Mirage jet fighter has crashed. Since 1964, 31 of the 116 Mirage aircraft have crashed. The matter which concerns me is that if one takes 31 from 116 one is left with 85. The report states that, in fact, there are only 84 aircraft left and that is because another Mirage aircraft became unusable when it corroded beyond repair. Could we have some explanation of how it is that an aircraft worth so much money should be allowed to corrode beyond repair?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that one Mirage aircraft became unserviceable due to extensive corrosion. The aircraft was a dual-seater Mirage stationed at Butterworth. The corrosion was caused by a higher level of moisture in the rear of the cockpit which was exacerbated by the climatic conditions at Butterworth. The corrosion occurred in an inaccessible area of the aircraft not normally subject to routine inspection. When it was detected during a major servicing, corrosion had rendered the aircraft unserviceable. Preventive measures have been taken by increasing the frequency of such inspections. As I have said, the aircraft was one of two dual-seaters at Butterworth. There are other dual-seaters stationed in Australia. None has exhibited similar corrosion problems. The preventive measures referred to make this extremely unlikely. Certainly no aircraft has been lost due to corrosion, except for the one in which corrosion was discovered before it did crash.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of housing, particularly public housing, is extremely important. It is clear, when we look at the Budget allocations by the Fraser-Howard-Anthony Administration over the last six years, that this Government considers housing as being of declining importance. Our purpose is to highlight in the Senate, which is supposed to represent the rights of the States, the growing public concern about the cutbacks in allocations of Federal funds for the purposes of providing accommodation through the various State housing authorities. In the weeks since the Budget the Government's chickens have really come home to roost on a number of major issues. Many Government members may not be able to work out the problems but observers, political analysts and, most importantly, the people of Australia have easily identified the Fraser Government for what it is. It is uncaring, cynical, unconcerned and indifferent in relation to the welfare needs of people and much more interested, as the Budget shows, in the demands of the big business corporations, the foreign investors and its financial backers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Alongside the abolition of the Community Youth Support Scheme and the new sales tax increases this attitude is clearly shown in the Government's refusal to service adequately the housing needs of the nation. The pitiful handouts and drastic cuts in the 1981 Budget in the area of housing just add to the years of neglect by the Fraser Government. Yet surely it is recognised that housing accommodation has risen not in line with rises in the general rate of inflation but at a rate at least two or three times higher than inflation depending upon where one lives in this Commonwealth. The rate of inflation in the housing accommodation area has increased out of all proportion. Housing shortages and the homelessness which now faces so many of our Australian people rank second only to the tragedy of unemployment as Australia's major social problem. The housing crisis in this country has been highlighted once again in recent times, in this case by the firm statement of condemnation made by State housing Ministers at their recent conference. The most prominent of these Ministers has been the Victorian Minister, Mr Jeff Kennett. What did he say? A report in the Age states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kennett said the Federal Government did not deserve to win the next election and probably would lose it if it did not provide more money for housing. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in funding to the States for housing is, in Mr Kennett's words, 'totally unrealistic'. Unfortunately, Mr Kennett believes that the problem should be solved by the Federal Government, not by changing the Government's economic direction or economic policies, but rather by cutting back in areas such as foreign aid, health, welfare, education and other matters which surely deserve some priority when considering the needs of the Australian people. Mr Kennett is not the only Liberal Party member who feels the wrath of the electors fast approaching. On Tuesday, Mr Burr, a Liberal member from Tasmania, in a radio broadcast, publicly attacked his Government's policies on interest rates and housing. On the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Housing could well be the key issue at the next election and I believe that if the Government doesn't change its policies . . . I believe the Government will pay a very heavy price at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>So, even Government members and Government supporters are plucking up sufficient courage, which was evidenced in some of the debates last evening on the Budget, to criticise the Government's inadequacy and failure in a variety of areas. These comments underline the crisis within the Government parties on housing and other related issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not think that the only criticism to be heard is that from a few maverick Liberals. The complaints are widespread and frequent. For example, all State housing Ministers recently joined to condemn the Fraser Government's policies. This condemnation took place only last week at their most recent meeting in Sydney to analyse the effects of the Budget on housing. Today we heard reports from the building industry. It has added its most trenchant post-Budget attack upon this Government. The Sydney Daily Telegraph reports that the national Housing Industry Association, in a letter to Mr Fraser, warned him of:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the electoral consequences of this Government's present inadequate housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Industry Association has written to 45,000 master builders warning them that, unless this Government changes its policy, the Government will have to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on and on with more examples of condemnation from housing groups, welfare agencies, real estate organisations, building associations as well as building unions, all of which seek to change the direction and policy decisions that this Budget has made with respect to housing, but I will not trouble the Senate with further quotations. I will simply say that all the responses to the Government underline two things: Firstly, that the people of Australia have finally got the message that this Government does not care about their housing needs; and, secondly, that the Fraser Government's housing policies will collapse on top of it come election time. As the opinion polls show, it will be thrown out of office because of its welfare housing neglect, its interest rate policies, its cuts to the States and its increase in sales tax and other forms of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McVeigh, the responsible Minister, when being criticised by a variety of people, was quoted as saying that the States do not know the meaning of the word 'shared'. This is absolute hypocrisy. It is Mr McVeigh who does not understand his responsibilities. He believes that in a word-sparring exercise with State Ministers the matter will simply fade away. I can assure this Government that it will not fade away and that we will continue to talk about the problems of housing in our community. How can a Minister of a government, which has cut real net payments to the States for housing by $526.4m since 1975, have the gall to push the blame on to the States? How does Mr McVeigh explain a cut in capital payments to the States of $54,642,000 in projected 1981-82 prices for this coming year? In response to Mr Kennett's criticism, Mr McVeigh attempts to blame Victoria and New South Wales-the big States-for neglect. Of course the Victorian Government is guilty of neglect in this area, but the fact remains that the Federal cuts have been made and they have seriously impeded the ability of the States, particularly the big States, to carry out their responsibilities. How does the Minister explain the fact that all States have suffered these sorts of major and drastic cuts in Federal funding for welfare housing? The McVeigh double talk and double think is an attempt at pure deception. It is an attempt to palm off responsibility and deflect criticism for what we know is a deliberate Fraser Government philosophy and policy. The Fraser philosophy for housing was spelt out recently by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in a speech to the Co-operative Housing Societies Association of New South Wales conference on 25 June this year. Mr Howard said that the key instrument in the Government's housing strategy is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely the agreement which was re-negotiated this year and which has been used to rip money away from the States while placing an extra burden upon them. Mr Howard said that the aim of the policy was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a significant winding back of public sector demand for funds in the coming financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>In plain terms this means that the Government does not want to see the States provide the facilities for housing, especially welfare housing, which is a major State responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Welfare housing and housing provided by the public sector just does not fit into the schemes of the Fraser Government. Figures obtained from Commonwealth and State housing authorities show that there has been a drastic decline in public sector housing in recent decades. I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which gives details of the houses and flats completed by State authorities as a percentage of the total houses and flats built. The table shows that in the 1950s and 1960s public sector housing amounted to about 20 per cent of total building. Today the public sector accounts for only 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to read the speeches of Mr Menzies, the Prime Minister of the 1950s and 1960s. If we examined the sort of Federal funding that was made available to the States by Mr Menzies we would have to say on a superficial analysis that Mr Menzies would be regarded by the present-day Tories as being somewhat of a left wing Liberal. As the Australian economy developed and as Australia's manufacturing base increased, so did he provide funds for a development of our public housing. It is interesting to compare the percentage of public housing constructions projected in this coming year with the percentage in the last period of the Whitlam Government, 1975-76. This Budget projects that public housing will make up 6 per cent of total housing constructions, whereas the Whitlam Budget provided funds on the basis that 12.2 per cent of constructions would be in the public area. I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These figures have to be looked at in the light of changes and structural shifts in the economy. Manufacturing, as we all know, no longer plays the part it once did in the Australian economy. The further running down of manufacturing is a major policy decision of this Government and an effect of Fraser's policies. Mining investment and land speculation continue, despite all the current doubts of the resources boom, as the cornerstone of Australia's proposed economic development. For this sort of development the Fraser Government sees no need to provide housing funds, unlike the Menzies Government during its attempts to foster manufacturing in the 1950s and 1960s. Even in the context of Australia's conservative tradition, Fraser is out of step. The Government finds some money to assist housing development in line with its vision of a resource-based economy, however. An amount of $45,000 has been set aside for a public awareness program to promote low cost mobile homes for use in resource development regions and on the outskirts of capital cities. That is all this Government is prepared to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the result of this squeeze on the States combined with the interest rate increases and sales tax changes? Let me return to what has been said by the critics of the Government's housing policies-in this case the Real Estate Institute of Australia. The Institute said:</PARA>
<PARA> People who have been forced out of the home buyer market and cannot afford to rent in the private residential market will have to join the ever lengthening queue for a diminishing supply of government welfare housing. </PARA>
<PARA>So, as a result of this Government's economic policies, fewer people can provide for their own accommodation. They are being forced into the queues for welfare housing at the very time that this Government has drastically and dramatically reduced the amount of funds for the States. What do people do when they cannot get access to welfare housing? They are homeless. To the maxim that Australia is becoming a nation of tenants and landlords we should add 'and homeless people'. How many people are homeless? This we do not know for sure. We can only rely on estimates such as those of the Victorian Housing Minister, who says that there are at least 100,000 households in need of housing in his own State, or the estimates of the Housing Industry Association, which claims that there are 280,000 homeless people throughout Australia. I think even honourable senators opposite would concede that that organisation is no general critic of the Government, that it is not influenced by the philosophies of the party to which I belong. The Housing Industry Association says that a further 250,000 people are living in makeshift or mobile homes. Surely, those figures underline the indifference and indolence of the Government's attitude to this problem. This is a Government that claims to represent and to govern for all of the people in this country. Yet that is the state of the nation so far as housing is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McVeigh, in debate on this matter in the other place, poured scorn upon the criticism made by the Australian Labor Party and poured scorn on the criticism made by his own political counterparts in the various States of the Commonwealth. We can only say that McVeigh as the Minister responsible does not know, does not care and has done nothing to find out about the basic needs and requirements of the States as they endeavour in their own way to provide some alternative accommodation for people living in the States. Of course, Mr McVeigh's attitude illustrates the attitude of the Government as a whole. The Government does not understand or care about the state of the housing crisis. It does not concern itself with the homeless or with those people, particularly in the capital cities, who are now paying the biggest proportion of their social welfare payments in higher rents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is squeezing the majority of householders out of the home buying market. It is offering nothing but reduced and inadequate funding for State housing grants and is passing the responsibility off to others. It is not hard to understand how the real estate organisations have reacted. As reported in the Canberra Times on 21 August, the executive director of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, Mr Lawrence, said that Mr Howard had-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . made an extraordinarily weak commitment to the housing needs of Australians . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government appears to be out of touch with the housing world. The article reported Mr Lawrence as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the introduction of sales tax on building materials would increase the cost of new houses by several hundred dollars and would continue to deter the construction of badly needed rental accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . Home ownership will now fall even more, this will put further pressure on rental accommodation which is already in short supply and no new flats are being built. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that relates to building in the capital cities. I have not time to detail the comments by the Real Estate Institute of Australia but it gives figures to show how in recent times rents in all capital cities have risen dramatically therefore affecting the capacity of tenants to meet that growing rental commitment. Of course, this was apparent earlier this year when the Age wrote about homes being taken from the poor. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a job we are doing less and less well the longer the Fraser Government stays in office. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . The Fraser Government has still not explained why it has singled out the housing of the needy as an area where spending should be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The comments I have recorded today and the responses of many other people in the community who are not politically involved make it clear that soon enough the Government will be forced either to change its policies or do what has been requested of it by the Victorian Minister, which is to increase by $450m in this current Budget the amount of money allocated for welfare housing. If it does not do so it will be forced by the voters to face up to its responsibilities which it has neglected. It will be forced to the polls prematurely with a result that will rectify the grave disservice that this Government is doing to the housing needs of the Australian people. We make no apology for suggesting that the Senate particularly ought to be discussing the cuts in public funding to the States for welfare housing. It is in this place that we should be carrying out our responsibilities of protecting the interests of the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we listen to Senator Gietzelt speaking in this place we are never disappointed because he always draws our attention to the vast philosophical gaps that exist between the Government and the Opposition on fundamental matters. But, of course, these gaps exist in all areas which affect the economy including taxation and housing. Senator Gietzelt has sought to make out a case, based on broad generalisations, of a lack of funding for specific purposes in some areas and he has extended his argument to indicate that all housing is being neglected. He did not provide the Senate with the details on the level of home ownership in this country as an example of how people in fact look after themselves and how housing finance generally is made available for them. For instance, he did not mention that in 1947 only 53 per cent of homes were owned by individuals in this country compared with 72 per cent today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has occurred over a period, as we all know, is an enormous growth in the wealth of individual families because of an increase in real incomes. This has enabled them to meet repayments on housing loans to the point at which they are able to look after themselves. Really, that is the core of the difference between the arguments of the Opposition and the Government on this matter. This Government stands for the extension of real benefits to the people through the free enterprise system. We do not try to compress people into public housing in the way that I believe Senator Gietzelt would like us to do, that is, by ensuring that people work in poor houses and perhaps have welfare housing thrown at them without being given a choice as to what kind of housing they would like. That is the kind of difference which exists between this Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies that this Government espouses will lead to further improvements in the percentage of people who own their own homes. Let me take that a little further because I would like to discuss the section of the Budget which was mentioned by Senator Gietzelt in the context of the total economic program to which clearly it addresses itself. We know that at present there are substantial difficulties in the money markets in this country which are having their effects in raising interest rates. Everybody acknowledges that, and in fact at Question Time today one of the Australian Democrats, I think it was Senator Mason, drew our attention to the fact that in New South Wales the State Government, by virtue of its commitment to establishing new industries in the Hunter River Valley, had in fact put pressure on interest rates and thereby was taking out of the system money which might otherwise have been available for housing. That is a clear example of the kinds of difficulties that exist at present. This Government's policy is aimed at ensuring that downward pressures on interest rates are maintained. Consequently, our aim to restrict activities that may strip money from the housing area by allowing a freer market for the price of money, that is, interest rates, will ensure funds are made available for housing. That is this Government's policy, and through that policy we will ensure that the downward pressure on interest rates is maintained in such a way as to enable the maximum number of people to obtain finance for housing when they want it and according to the style which they and their families enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the core of this Budget which we know is aimed at a very high surplus compared with the standards of the last few years. The Government has aimed at a Budget surplus of something over $1,500m which is a considerable amount of money compared with the deficits that we had become used to especially under the previous Whitlam Labor Government which of course established that disastrous trend in finance some five years ago. That surplus is aimed at taking off the money markets the pressure that is brought on by this Commonwealth Government which needs to finance its activities by either direct borrowings in the financial markets of Australia or raising taxation. If we can restrict its need to go into the money markets to borrow to finance deficits, the pressure on interest rates will be reduced. Accordingly, the philosophy and policy of this Government are to ensure that we have a big surplus this year which aims particularly at ensuring interest rates are kept at reasonable levels. That policy will enable the greatest benefits to be made available to a larger number of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the merits of private ownership versus public ownership. We have observed many times in the past from the statements of Senator Gietzelt and other spokesmen for the Labor Party that the theme, which always has been consistent, is that there should be a greater commitment to public housing. Does that proposition stand up to an analysis of the facts? We know that the Federal Government, in conjunction with the States, has endeavoured over the years to extend finance in these areas. We clearly know from the figures of the last few years that the various States have improved their situation in that regard. There has been the policy of extending the availability of homes to those in greatest need by ensuring that people who do have greater than the average level of income or in some cases very substantial incomes are in fact required to pay market rents for public housing. Those kinds of policies ensure that moneys are made available more and more for those in the greatest need. So, public housing-welfare housing if you like-is made available to the most disadvantaged in the community. This Government's policies have been aimed at extending that availability. Since 1975, through negotiations with the various States, those policies have been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> We know there has been an extension of other programs relating to Aboriginal housing and particularly veterans' housing through the Defence Service Homes Scheme. For instance, the increase in expenditure in this area, which happens to fall within my own portfolio, is of the order of $57m in this financial year. Total housing finance provided by the Federal Government has increased from $555m last year to $660m this year-an increase of $105m or nearly 19 per cent. That total amount of money that has been made available is clearly in the interests of all Australians because it is making available more homes for the average Australian. Obviously the Government is addressing itself to the real needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the roles of the States, Senator Gietzelt has made a number of points in relation to some of the comments that have been recently aired by the Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Kennett. I guess it is always very nice to see a State and a Federal Minister from the same party at loggerheads over particular issues. It is very useful for the Opposition to pounce on that kind of thing in order to generate some kind of feeling that may be the Federal Government's policies are incorrect. Unfortunately, Mr Kennett labours with some very great disadvantages insofar as he sees the position as it affects his own State. He has no total view of the housing scene in Australia which I outlined earlier. It might even pay us to have a little look at some of the expenditure by Victoria on welfare housing. For instance, I note that the average per capita contribution to the welfare housing program by Victoria is $6. I note that the national average per capita contributions-the figure of which this Government needs to take account in meeting its true responsibility for national concerns-is $16 a head. In other words there is a difference of almost 250 per cent between the Victorian figure and the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean there are not States which do better. For instance, I refer to the position in my own State of South Australia, which of course has had a very long commitment to public housing going back to the 1930s and 1940s under that great statesman and Premier, Sir Thomas Playford. The figure for South Australia is $47 a head. South Australia, that so-called poor boy State, as it is described on occasion by members from more wealthy States, in fact manages to spend on welfare housing $47 a head while Victoria can manage only $6 a head. Does that say something about the finances, or about the attitudes, of governments? I implore the Senate to address its mind to that subject because it shows quite clearly that in fact this is a question of attitude. Indeed, it is up to Mr Kennett to take himself into the Cabinet room of his own State ministry and argue more forcefully than obviously he has been able to do that more of the funds for programs under the control of the State Cabinet be directed to welfare housing. For Mr Kennett to criticise this Government and its Minister for Housing, Mr McVeigh, on the ground that inadequate finance is made available for welfare housing is simply to try to create a scapegoat for his own worries, concern and lack of ability to argue successfully for increased funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This subject is not one which I would normally involve myself in. It is a highly political matter and I suppose the Senate ought to address itself to the more general arguments. However, it is important to mention it, because the figures that I have just quoted do show a clear difference in attitude on the part of the various States to welfare housing. They show also that in fact, the Federal Government's attitude in this respect cannot be questioned. As I have demonstrated, the Government has clearly provided funds for the purpose across the board and is advocating and developing policies, particularly broader economic policies-as set out so clearly in the Budget-which are designed to make available vast sums of money for the provision of housing in the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of interest to note that in fact in 1980-81 funds lent for housing throughout Australia totalled no less than $7,500m. I point out that, consistent with this Government's policy, the private sector contribution to that total was around 95 per cent. That indicates the extent of the commitment of this Government, indeed of the Australian nation, to housing. As Australians we believe that the great majority of homes should be owned by private individuals. In contrast, the amount made available by Government authorities represented only about 5 per cent of the total. For Senator Gietzelt to argue that there has been no commitment on the part of the Government to develop public housing is to ignore the major part of the argument, which concerns the total housing picture of the nation and whether we are developing policies which are aimed at extending housing as far as possible to all who can reasonably afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, programs for disadvantaged groups are available in the community. Senator Gietzelt sought to make something of the plight of homeless persons. He mentioned a figure of 250,000 homeless persons, which he defined as including those in mobile homes or in other makeshift forms of accommodation. He ignored the point that, because Australia has a rapidly developing economy, mobile homes often conform to the chosen lifestyle of many who work and live in outback areas and near mining sites and development areas of that kind. Of course there are also others who choose a lifestyle different from that implicit in living in suburbia and consequently make their homes in different areas of Australia. That is not to say that this Government does not have a commitment to those who want better housing but find it difficult to provide that for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last financial year, a sum of $22m was earmarked for grants to the States in respect of Aboriginal housing programs. A further $10.7m was allocated under the States Grants Aboriginal Housing Program of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. A further $22.1m was provided by this Government in grants direct to the Aboriginal housing associations for the provision of rental housing. An additional $8.3m was devoted to loans to assist Aboriginals achieve home ownership. Those facts show clearly the commitment of this Government to the development of programs which are consistent with its approach to private enterprise and private home ownership, but more particularly are aimed at assisting those groups which find it most difficult to look after themselves. Consequently, over time, with the implementation of those programs, we will see an extension of home ownership in this country to the widest number of individuals possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the program in respect of Aborigines and programs in respect of other disadvantaged groups comply with the general principle of extending the greatest care to those in the greatest need. Our policies in discussions with the States have been towards that end. Over the years, we have seen an increasing interest in the States towards ensuring that those who can afford to pay for housing and currently occupy what might be described as welfare housing pay rents at market or almost market levels. Of course this ensures that funds are made available for those who really need substantial welfare housing. That is the kind of policy to which this Government is committed and which it is seeking to extend through its various policies. More than that, the real answer to the housing problems of any nation really rely greatly on the total commitment to control of the economy through monetary and fiscal policies. Since 1975 the Fraser Government has clearly demonstrated such a commitment as well as its success in achieving ends which are in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disappointing to hear the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, in speaking on a matter of public importance such as this, ignore the real and pressing need of many in the community for housing. One would imagine from his speech that there was no particular housing problem in this country; that the policies of the Government, which he claims in an extraordinary statement are having a downward effect on interest rates-at a time when interest rates for housing and every other purpose in this country are at a record level-would solve the problem and that we really need not be too concerned about it. Senator Messner talked about the philosophical differences between himself and his party and Senator Gietzelt and his party. Obviously there are philosophical differences which extend beyond that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The philosophical differences are not only between the conservative parties in this Parliament and the Australian Labor Party but also between the Liberal Party of today and the Liberal Party of yesterday, of the 1950s and 1960s, which was concerned with home ownership, particularly with maintaining a level of public housing for those who could not take part in the home ownership battle. There are also the very real philosophical differences between the Liberal Party federally and the Liberal Party in the States, and not just in relation to Mr Kennett and the Victorian Liberal Party. After the last meeting of the Commonwealth and State housing Ministers, the State Ministers got together and produced a statement complaining, firstly, about the attitude and arrogance of the Federal Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr McVeigh, and, secondly, about the attitude of the Federal Government to this very real problem and the failure of the Federal Government to maintain funds for housing in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very wrong, I would suggest, to ignore the fact that increasing numbers of people are opting out of house purchase in this country and living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. It is wrong to ignore the fact that this very real problem of homelessness is recognised by the Senate as the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare is presently inquiring into one form of homelessness-the problem of homeless youth in our community. It is wrong and stupid for Senator Messner to ignore the fact that there are very real differences between his Government and the housing industry in this country. Over the last few months the builders in this country have repeatedly made claims on the Government to increase expenditure in that area, otherwise the consequences will be disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there are two main problems with housing now. They have always been there but one is much more emphasised now than it has been in the past. There is the old problem, which is increasing, of the plight of those people who cannot move into the market to buy their own homes and who cannot find public rental housing. These people remain in our community precariously housed in a declining rental market with the insecurities of costs and tenure that this implies. One of the most distressing problems for any member of parliament in this country, State or Federal, is to deal with the people who arrive, frequently at the end of the week, without adequate housing, only to find that there is no public and very little private rental accommodation available to them. The member of parliament is frequently placed in very difficult situation and in a situation of helplessness. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem is a new one and is increasing. It would be unwise of the Government to ignore it. It has been here before but it has not been seen in any great size since the Depression of the 1930s. The problem concerns the endangered group of buyers who cannot afford to keep up their mortgages. If the Government chooses to ignore the reports in recent months-reports which will obviously increase after this Budget-of large numbers of people having to opt out of their mortgages and having to sell their houses, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, I believe it does so at its peril. It also does so at the great expense of the people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently, a person who had saved and paid the deposit on a house, plus all the legal costs of the purchase of that house, may have been short of money but usually, with care, he could survive the first year or so and then be relatively secure. The main advantage in the past was that in the early years those mortgage payments were stable or would move only marginally. People could budget for repayments and watch rising housing costs and inflation increase their equity and lower their repayments as a proportion of their income. Whatever one may feel of this process, it has been part of the Australian tradition of home ownership. It has allowed more than 70 per cent of Australian households to feel that they have a firm stake in the community. It is clear that this is changing. Senator Messner spoke of 72 per cent home ownership in this country. One notices that in a similar debate in another place even members on his own side of the Parliament admitted that this had dropped to 70 per cent, or just below, in very recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Rising interest rates are providing a threat to new home owners. The weekly amount that such people could manage to pay with careful budgeting in the past is rising out of their reach because of the sharp rises in interest rates. If a purchaser bought a house with a loan of $30,000 at an interest rate of 11 per cent over a period of 30 years the total repayments would have been $88,210. The yearly repayments would have been about $3,538. The rise in interest rates to 12 1/2 per cent has sent payments up by nearly $8 a week and the total has risen by nearly $10,000. Another rise which is expected by everyone in the community and which was predicted in the Budget will add perhaps $5 a week to this bill and bring the total to be paid on such a loan up to just over $100,000. The result of this is that more people are opting out of mortgages and more people are going into public housing. It is this problem which worries Mr Kennett and his colleagues in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have the responsibility of providing public housing in the community, a responsibility which they carry out, and have traditionally carried out, with funds from the Federal Government. Escalating land prices, high building costs, high interest rates, the introduction of new sales taxes on building materials, and the redirection of funds into resources development and away from housing on the one hand, and pressure on real wages and increasing direct and indirect taxes on the other have made the dream of home ownership more remote and will continue to do so. At a time when fewer people can bridge the deposit gap, fewer people can afford repayments and a disturbing number of people have to give up the houses which they are purchasing, there has in fact been a decrease in funds to the States in real terms, making it extremely difficult for those States to keep up with the need for welfare housing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the unfortunate results of this has been the unseemly row taking place between the Federal and State housing Ministers in public and in the Parliament. The most vehement critic has been Mr Kennett. He has, quite justifiably, expressed concern at the fact that the public resources for public housing have been decreased by more than 50 per cent in real terms in five years. The response of the Federal Minister has been a continuous campaign of abuse against Mr Kennett in particular and the other housing Ministers to cover his own and his Government's inadequacies. Mr McVeigh called Mr Kennett 'arrogant' and 'ignorant'. Mr McVeigh then proceeded deliberately to mislead the Parliament, as Senator Messner has done today, by including in the housing funds the talks about funds for veterans' housing and aged persons' accommodation which have traditionally come from other departments. Traditionally these funds have been excluded from the sorts of housing figures that Mr Kennett and others have quoted in the past. He has done this to prop up the figures for his own Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely typical of the remarks of Mr McVeigh. The remark is absolutely unworthy of someone like the Minister who just interjected. Of course they are needy people. The expenditure of the Minister's Department on defence service houses has increased over the years just in line with inflation. The expenditure on aged persons' accommodation has decreased in real terms over the years. To pluck out these figures suddenly and add them to the budget of Mr McVeigh's Department, which has decreased more than 50 per cent in real terms in recent years, and then to claim that not to include them was to ignore the Opposition's concern or the Government's concern for veterans and aged people is unworthy of the Minister and this Parliament. It is one of the problems that we are facing in trying to get rational debate in this discussion. Mr Kennett is not blameless. As the Minister pointed out, Mr Kennett's Government has given welfare housing a low priority. Mr Kennett's Government has been responsible in the past for the building of some of the most inhumane high-rise residences in this country. But that does not mean that Mr Kennett has not got an argument and that the other housing Ministers have not got an argument. The expenditure which we are talking about has dropped from $700m in 1975 to $200m in the same dollar terms. There has been a decrease from 4 per cent to one per cent in the percentage of Budget outlays to this area. These facts were admitted in debate in the other place. The effects of this decrease in expenditure will be exacerbated by other parts of the present Budget, such as an increase in the sales tax on building materials, which will lead to an increase in building costs and an increase in interest rates which will inevitably follow the monetarist policies of the Government. Other factors which obviously will occur have not been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increase in the supplementary rent allowance and the restriction of that allowance to only those people in private rental accommodation will have two effects. First of all, it will affect the State housing commissions which will have either to up the rents or increase the rent subsidies out of their own housing budgets for pensioners and other people who are in public rental housing. The inevitable effect of the increase in the supplementary rent allowance in a tight housing market will be an increase in rents. It will increase rents for low rental accommodation in which people on low incomes have been living. To do those two things and at the same time to decrease the available funds for housing in this community particularly for public rental housing, inevitably will lead to people being forced into accommodation they cannot afford and into unsatisfactory accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that Senator Messner should view with equanimity the fact that estimates from the Minister's own Department and others sources point out that 250,000 people in this country are living in caravans and other forms of mobile homes. Senator Messner's reply is that these people are doing that because they prefer to or they are doing it because they are working in places such as mining areas where people traditionally live in that sort of housing. I suggest that Senator Messner go to Gladstone in Queeensland to see if the extraordinary number of people living in caravans there are doing so by choice. They are doing so because there is no other accommodation, because there is no social infrastructure built into that area. I suggest he go to the Latrobe Valley where an extraordinary number of people are living in mobile homes or unsatisfactory accommodation, again because there is insufficient housing built into the industrial developments in that area. They are not doing so by choice; they are doing so from necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that this Government, despite the words of Senator Messner, through its actions in the Budget both in increasing the costs and increasing the difficulties which people will have to face to own their own homes and by decreasing the amount of money available for public housing expenditure, is exacerbating a severe and difficult situation. We need better answers than the sophistry we get from Mr McVeigh in another place; we need better answers than the mouthing of monetarist theories in this place. Therefore, I urge the Government to think again and reconsider the matter very seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the matter of public importance, the subject matter of which is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continual failure of the Government to provide adequate funding to the States for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps it would be best if I started by reading my speech from last year. This matter seems to be Senator Gietzelt's hardy perennial. Every year since I have been here I think we have debated the same matter. He produces the same arguments and we produce the same answers. Apparently, he still has not really caught up with all the information and points of view. A similar matter was raised in the House of Representatives early this week. At that time the details that could normally be used to lay to rest this sort of fallacy that the Opposition has put before us were provided. I will try to avoid providing that information again and will rely on a few other tacks wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether members of the Opposition are social democrats or democratic socialists, they still want to make more and more people dependent upon the state. If a government can own the roofs over peoples' heads, it is an excellent start towards total control. I have raised this matter before during the last five years. It is one of the arguments I will try to avoid wherever possible. However, one can be assured that the Dedman edict is still alive and well. The two points we do not seem to have resolved in the past are, firstly, that this Liberal Party and this Government believe in home ownership. At present, about 72 per cent of Australians are in their own homes. That figure has almost reached what can be called a reasonably practical optimum, because of all the circumstances that go to balance the situation. Secondly, although Senator Grimes put the record straight today, the Government believes that housing is primarily a State function. All the rules and regulations come from the States. All sorts of arguments are different between the States. The States have different overall priorities but I have found, in touring around the various housing departments and speaking to the Ministers in the States, that none of them want Federal intervention. All they want is our money and a chance to have someone else to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The States alone have responsibility to determine their priorities for expenditure. They are able to use their money however they feel inclined. I have no objection to that but I believe it is just another area in which the Federal Goverment, probably quite wrongly, decided to interfere in State functions and provide funds for specific purposes. I believe we would be much better off if the Government provided the money to the States on an untied basis and let them use it however they decided. I do not think that would make any difference to the proportion of money spent by the States on housing. They would still give housing the same priority that is has now. States such as South Australia see their priorities, and they provide money. States like Victoria do not give the same priority to housing and do not provide the money. It is funny that the noisiest States seem to spend the least of their funds on housing. At the same time, they would like to spend much more of the Federal Government's money. What do they do with the $500m in untied grants that go to them each year? Do they put that into housing? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA> What do the States do with their own money? Some people believe we should spend unlimited amounts of money on anything, and this is where the Opposition excels. Members of the Opposition always prefer the Government to spend the people's money, instead of letting the people spend it on their own. Where is the evidence that government has greater wisdom than the people on how money is spent? I admit that at least the Opposition's view that the Federal Government should spend multi-millions of dollars on housing is consistent with the Opposition's approach. With debate on the Budget only a couple of weeks old and with only a few speeches having been made, I was amazed to find that it is not only housing on which the Australian Labor Party is proposing enormous increases in Government expenditure but also other areas have been suggested. I refer to some of the remarks that have been passed already in various places. Senator Button castigated the Goverment in the early stages of the debate because tax has been increased. That means he wants to cut tax again. He said sales tax should not have been included. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is tax. He also referred to the cost of $10 a week to every person in Australia in respect of health insurance. He referred to the fact that the outlay on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has been increased by 100 per cent. I suppose we should not have done that. He said the Government had saved $212m by short changing somebody else, and he mentioned also a figure of $240m. I presume this means that the Labor Party would spend that $212m and $240m to which he refers. The attitude of the alternative government is quite clear from Hansard, and I notice that it is the same in the other chamber. Mr Les Johnson suggested that there is $280m that should be paid to the States. He accused the Government of increasing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 45c to $3.20, which indicates another area that he would use for this purpose. He lists all the postal charges as being in this category. Money comes from somewhere, and it comes only from the productive sector. The more we want to spend, the more we have to raise. The Opposition is talking about eliminating billions of dollars from petrol, and hundreds of millions less in sales tax. Besides that, we have propositions before the Senate about large interest subsidies. We are even talking about paying Tasmania millions of dollars to keep it poor, not utilising its natural resources. These proposals will take an enormous amount of money, and money is something that is raised from taxation. Before we start to take these proposals really seriously, we should ask the Opposition to quantify the money it is talking about. What constitutes adequate funding? Is it $20m, $50m, $200m, $1,000m? I ask members of the Opposition to tell me. The whole fallacy of their argument is that they do not have any idea how much money they are talking about, and that is absolutely typical of their policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People in Australia are paying adequate tax at the moment, and I think that most people in Australia believe that they are paying adequate tax. According to a table produced by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) which appeared in the House of Representatives Hansard last week, Australia is paying 28.81 per cent in taxation. Japan, Spain and Portugal are the only countries which pay less tax in relation to gross domestic product than Australia. In this chamber Senator Button quoted the excellence of some of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and specifically mentioned the virtues of Austria, Norway and Sweden. It is interesting to note that Austria pays 41.43 per cent of GDP, Norway 46.94 per cent, and Sweden 53.5 per cent. If that is the sort of attainment we are looking for, I do not think I will be the one who will try to convince the Australian taxpayer to pay 75 per cent more so that he can enjoy the same degree of grey mediocrity that those countries enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1970s there were some quite dramatic changes in the housing situation in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the Government now owns less than 5 per cent of all houses. This has come about for the simple reason that the private sector has generated more funds, and people's increasing affluence has allowed them to move into home ownership more than ever before. What does not seem to have got across to the Opposition is that the need for the Government to intervene in the private sector is so much less now than it was 20 years ago. In 1980-81, the total lending for housing was $7,500m, and the Government lent 5 per cent of that. The intervention of the Government in the total housing picture is minute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the other things that happened in the 1970s was that a far greater proportion of aged persons homes was taken over by the private sector. Various changes to the legislation were made so that this could be done. The changes that have been made to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement have done a lot more to help the disadvantaged. Generally speaking, however, the States have not taken up the intentions of the Act simply because housing does not rank high enough in their level of priorities. The Government believes that the vast proportion of housing money has to go to people with the greatest need. The market rental concept hurts no one in poverty. Their rents will not rise, and ample provision is made to ensure that that is the case. What it will do is remove the bonuses from people who no longer need welfare, but who still get them at a cost of millions of dollars a year to the people who really need it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States have authority to use the funds in a variety of ways, including interest subsidy, I believe that currently that is the major use to which housing funds can be put. I urge that the States should use these funds in a proper way. I believe that they have not expended enough effort to sell off some of their vast areas of raw land and convert the money into housing. An interesting situation arose in Tasmania last week when the Government announced that it would provide $1m on an interest subsidy basis. What really interested me was that this money would be available to prospective applicants who, in cases where both the husband and wife were working, had a combined income which must not exceed $450 per week. I do not really classify that as being welfare housing, and I think it is a misuse of funds at a time when so many other things are needed. I believe that insufficient effort has been made by the States to sell houses to occupants at the market price and get the money working again. I have said these things over and over again in this place, but I have not seen any evidence from the States that they have made any effort in this regard. Housing is primarily a State function. The Commonwealth provides funds for welfare, and not enough of the money provided by the Commonwealth to the States is going to welfare--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance because it is in the area of housing that the Australian Democrats believe an important opportunity has been lost by the Government in framing the current Budget. In our alternative Budget we advocated doubling the total amount of money available for housing, that is, doubling it over last year's figure. This would have meant an additional expenditure of about $400m in total in various areas. We singled out the home building industry as an area for stimulation in the economy for some very pertinent reasons. Firstly, there is no doubt that a great need exists for additional expenditure on housing, and at a later stage in my speech I will quote figures in support of that claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the housing industry, if encouraged to expand, and expand rapidly, would take up the slack in the economy. We are under-utilising our resources by nearly 10 per cent, and I am talking about our human resources. That 10 per cent is made up of the unemployed and those people who would work if employment were available. I repeat that we have a 10 per cent under-utilisation of our human resources. It seems to the Democrats that the home building industry is the area which should be focussed on to take up that very serious slack in the industry. Firstly, the building industry is labour intensive. Secondly, it is almost entirely Australian owned. Thirdly, no less an authority than the A. V. Jennings organisation claims that Australia's home building industry is one of the most efficient in the world on the basis of man-hours per home unit size. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we have a labour intensive, Australian-owned and very efficient industry in need of great and urgent attention. It seems inconceivable that the Government did not take these very pertinent facts into account when framing the Budget. The Government must be concerned about unemployment. It must be concerned about the rapid decline in home ownership in this country. It must be very much aware of the great Australian dream. A very large percentage of Australian capital is invested in home ownership. That is the way the Australian people want it. People have come to this country from over-crowded areas in Europe and elsewhere and they have developed it because it has open spaces and because the possibility of a person owning his own home and plot of land is real. Why should Government strategy pull the shutters down on that great Australian dream, the vision of what this country is about? I will cite the figures on home ownership. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get on to that in a moment. I think that in considering public housing we have to look at the home building industry in total and the fact that there is a very real need for public housing. The level of home ownership was sliding down even before the increases in interest rates. In August 1980, 71.9 per cent of homes were owner-occupied. This compared with 73.4 per cent in November 1978. This was a drop of almost 70,000 householders who were not owning or buying the home they lived in. It will undoubtedly get worse because every one per cent increase in interest rates adds $238m to the annual interest bill of Australian borrowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to a survey carried out recently by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Victoria. It found that in Victoria 100,000 families were eligible for public housing compared with a stock of around 40,000 dwellings. That figure is supported by a recent survey by the Australian Housing Industry Association which showed a shortfall of 280,000 dwellings in this category on a national basis. This trend inevitably leads to great pressure within families and causes increased social dislocation throughout the country and greater demand for emergency and institutional housing. This area requires very urgent attention. I think we are all aware of the precarious position of women's and young people's refuges and hostels for wards of the state and probationers. This is becoming more critical day by day. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard two reasons why we cannot put more emphasis on public housing and housing in general. The first is that we have to conserve our capital so that sufficient money is available to finance mining developments. The second is that high interest rates will dampen the economy sufficiently to contain the wages explosion. I will talk about the first of those reasons. It seems to me to raise questions of priority. Do we want a mining boom or do we want houses for people to live in? The second argument about high interest rates dampening the wage explosion does not seem to me to make any sense at all. High interest rates diminish people's ability to buy food, clothing and other necessities and increase the wage earner's needs and, therefore, his agitation to increase his wages. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by reiterating that the home building industry is one area which, unfortunately, has not received the attention it deserves. There has been a drop of 25 per cent in the allocation to the States in the public housing area. This is very serious. As the figures show, it will greatly increase the hardship on the wage earner in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a matter of public importance proposed for discussion by the Opposition, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continual failure of the Government to provide adequate funding to the States for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA>I think what this debate boils down to is a matter of political philosophy. The question is whether we support the idea that people own their own houses and provide an atmosphere in which they can do that or whether we support the idea that the Government provides as much housing as possible so that people live in the servile situation of paying rent for the rest of their lives. We, on the Government benches, support the idea that as many people as possible should be assisted to provide their own houses. I think that has been overlooked by those honourable senators who quote figures as to the amounts of money that go into public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been indicated previously by honourable senators, home ownership in Australia is running at around 72 per cent. That is one of the highest percentages for member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and it is something Australia can be proud of. I think all honourable senators would recognise that it is the desire of most people in Australia to own their own homes. I found it rather amazing listening to the previous speaker, Senator Siddons-who, in his private life, one could say was a doyen of private enterprise-to hear him supporting the proposal that we should be pouring millions more dollars into public housing. I know that the members of the Australian Democrats are having problems in coming to grips with the role in which they see themselves in the Senate and in determining whether they are to be the official Opposition, part of the Opposition or whatever. Nonetheless, it seems to me that at this stage they are trying to out-socialise the socialists, which I find a rather strange role for them to see themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that we on this side of the chamber want to see as much done as possible for people to own their own housing and for that to be done through the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Federal Government in housing is pretty limited. It is basically a State function. We are told that quite often by the States and, indeed, we accept that it is their role. All the laws and little nuances associated with housing are connected with the States and their functions. We want to have as little to do with it as possible. We do provide money. Over a fair period, we have provided a large amount of money, some in tied grants, some in untied grants and some in repayable loans. It is interesting to note that in the last 10 years the amount provided by the Government has gone up and down. It is misleading to look at that and say that one government in one year gave a larger amount of money. As I have intimated, some may have been in the form of repayable loans and some in straight out grants. The amount provided in the Federal Budget from 1971-72 to 1981-82 has risen by in excess of 500 per cent. So the Federal Government is doing its bit, but within the philosophy of providing the conditions whereby as many people as is possible can own their own homes. Of course, with such things as rising interest rates and costs going up the ability to repay loans is always a cause of concern for us, for the home owner and for young people in particular who are buying their own homes and more often than not their first homes. The repayments on a $30,000 loan have increased by about $15 a week since 1978. But at the same time the average weekly earnings have increased by approximately $80 a week. I think those figures should be considered when we are looking at repayments. To put it into percentage terms, house repayments, as a percentage of average weekly earnings, have fallen from 27.2 per cent in December 1978 to an estimated 25 per cent in August 1981. While recognising the fact that increases in interest rates do create a problem, one must consider the overall picture and look at the salaries now being paid and the ability to repay and to meet those increased costs. I think the figures show that the position is not as bad as some people would like to make out. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech Senator Grimes mentioned Gladstone. Australian Labor Party senators seem to have a fixation with Gladstone. I think the fixation also seems to be on the part of southern Labor senators. I do not blame them for that at this time of the year. Senator Button mentioned Gladstone in previous speeches. He comes from Melbourne and Senator Grimes comes from Tasmania. I know where I would rather live at this time of the year; and it is certainly not Melbourne or Tasmania. Gladstone, with all the problems of a growing town, is a great place in which to live. As I have said, the residents are sick and tired of southern media and southern politicians using their city as an example of the worst place in which to live. It is quite a desirable place in which to reside. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made of the caravans. Of course there are caravan parks in Gladstone, as there are at Middlemount, Moranbah, Dysart and Blackwater. Every developing town has a caravan park. There is almost a caravan culture. Many of these people would not want to live in any other manner. They rather like the idea of living in caravans. It is certainly not my ideal as I am a pretty stable sort of guy when it comes to housing. But a lot of people do like living in caravans and they will move from one developing area to another. So the existence of caravan parks is no great hassle. Even for those who do want housing, at least they are living as a family unit in the developing towns, close to the work force. I think that is far better than men living in single barracks with their families living hundreds of miles away. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said from the start, it is our basic philosophy that everybody who wants to should own his or her own home. But, at the same time, we recognise that there is a need and this need is covered in many and varied ways in the Budget. There are the lower socio-economic groups which cannot afford their own homes at this stage even with all the Government does to help them. There is welfare housing, low rental housing. We assist pensioners in paying their rent. So we recognise that there is a problem and a need. I also think that the States have to play a role in providing welfare housing. Their attitude is altering now after a fair bit of reminding from the Federal Government that quite often people who live in welfare housing no longer need to be there. At last we are seeing the States starting to put a market rental value on those houses. I think that is how it should be. I have heard some of my colleagues speak of driving around welfare housing areas and seeing two cars parked outside a house with a boat in the front yard. That is not what welfare housing is all about. It is there to provide housing for those in need and, when those peoples' incomes are such that they can pay market rental values, they should do so or move. I do not think it is the taxpayers role to fund that situation. We provide the conditions whereby more people can own their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates have been mentioned. There is no need for me to go into any economic detail, for two reasons: Firstly, it has been done before; and, secondly, I am not an economist and I do not really understand the intricacies of it anyhow. Suffice it to say that the deficit that any government runs has a marked effect on the money market. The interest paid only reflects the value of the money of the day. If we look at the Budget figures for the last 10 years, it is interesting to note that in 1971-72 there was a deficit of $134m whereas there is an estimated deficit of $146m for 1981-82. But in between time we have seen that deficit blow out three times to in excess of $3 billion. That places tremendous pressures on the money market. It has the effect of driving up interest rates. What this Government is all about, as has been said time and time again, is implementing policies to ease those pressures, to balance our budget and to run a good economy. The figures going on the board are showing that our policies are having an effect. By doing that, the pressures of the Government on the money market are diminishing. As a result, we should relieve the pressures on interest rates. It is no use dealing with the symptons in one area. If we do that we will only get a distortion of the situation. Measures to assist people who are paying interest rates on housing loans would have no effect on the business community, the rural community or people who are borrowing for whatever reasons. The best way to handle a situation like this is not to look to doing a band-aid job on the symptoms but to get right to the cause of the problem. One of the causes is the pressure that the Government puts on the money market. </PARA>
<PARA> Entrepreneurs start to build different types of homes when the cost of housing goes up. Within the last two weeks, I and colleagues from both sides of both Houses have looked at a manufactured house which is based on modular construction. It is a method whereby very comfortable housing can be provided at far less cost. Such entrepreneurs are always around when there are increased pressures and costs or increased interest rates. As a matter of fact, this sort of thing gives a needle to entrepreneurs to get out and do something better. This is happening all the time. They are constructing good, comfortable housing of a size which young couples might want to buy. This type of housing can be provided some thousands of dollars cheaper than existing house designs. Rising costs can even have a beneficial effect. I reject this matter of public importance. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper is a report of Telecom Australia entitled 'Australian Telecommunications Commission-Service and Business Outlook for 1981-82'. The report is dated August 1981. It is a very important document because a lot of questions have been asked in the Senate, particularly by one issue experts such as Senator Townley, about telephone charges and things of that kind. There is currently a community debate about charges for the telephone services, new telephone services, the extension of the Telecom network and so on. All these matter are matters of public concern and interest. It is in that context that a reading of the report before the Senate should be commended to all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> This report vindicates the concern which the Australian Labour Party has expressed for some time about the Fraser Government's attitude and policies towards Australia's great public enterprises generally. One of the signs of bad management in a business or in a government is a perspective which focuses on the short term at the expense of the long term. Businesses, like any enterprises, have to be concerned with long term planning-something which is remote from the considerations of the present Government. A clear sign of short-sightedness in any business is the squeezing of the capital investment capacity of that business. The Fraser Government's record on this score is abysmal in relation to Australian public enterprises. Capital investment generally throughout the economy has been cut by 56 per cent in real terms since 1975-76. Nowhere is such a policy shown up more clearly than in relation to Australia's great public enterprises-the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Australia Post, the public transport commissions and, particularly, Telecom. The telecommunications industry is one of the most capital intensive industries in Australia, as it is anywhere else in the world. It is most important that the capital requirements of Telecom be considered in the context of that international situation. Because the telecommunications industry is a capital intensive industry, the Fraser Government commissioned a report to be prepared by independent consultants-the McKinsey company-on the capital requirements of Telecom. That report was made available to the Fraser Government in June of last year. I have asked Senator Baume on, I think, three occasions whether the Government will table the McKinsey report on the capital requirements of Telecom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'When indeed', says Senator Baume. The rhetorical question I ask again is: When indeed will we get an answer to that question about the McKinsey report on the capital requirements of Telecom? The answer is that this Government, which brings into this place wishy-washy freedom of information legislation and so on, and which contains people such as Senator Lewis who in Ballarat last week boasted about Telecom's great record under this Government, does not want that report published because the McKinsey organisation, when it investigated the capital requirements of Telecom, came out with a report saying that the Government's policy in relation to this matter was wrong, that a telecommunications organisation such as Telecom, which as I said before is capital intensive in its very nature, had a much greater requirement for capital investment for its long term needs and, increasingly it has been said, to fulfil its short term needs. Our national telecommunications networks are vital parts of the economic infrastructure of this country. That is presumably why the Government commissioned an independent organisation to report on Telecom's efficiency and capital requirements. That report, which was given to the Government 15 months ago, has never been published because it is critical of the Government. Our society is legitimately concerned about the vast investment in an organisation such as Telecom, about the size of that organisation, and about its future development. For a debate to take place in this Senate and in this country about Telecom without the publication of that information is nothing short of scandalous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has created a situation in which Telecom's capital investment which ought to be growing, according to the McKinsey report-Capital and Policy Requirements for the 1980s-and, in all humility, to me, has in fact been cut by 16 per cent in real terms since 1975-76. Not only has the Government squeezed Telecom's capital investment but also it has raised the interest paid by Telecom on existing loans. The results of this are becoming apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> Waiting lists for telephone installations have been growing for some time. Some months ago in answers to questions on notice it was revealed that in just 12 months the number of applications for phone installations which had been deferred for over three months had grown by 300 per cent in some areas. When I asked the Minister for Communications whether he could assure the Parliament that waiting lists in the worst areas would improve, he gave me a candidly frank answer. 'No. Waiting lists will not improve', said the Minister. The McKinsey report asked why and stated that it was because the capital requirements of Telecom were not being met. That is the short answer. We are in the business of short answers with Mr Sinclair because his answer was no. The McKinsey report answer was that the requirements of the organisation were not being met because of the unavailability of capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The McKinsey report makes it quite clear that waiting lists will not diminish but will grow. The report that we are now considering on business outlook makes it clear that waiting lists for phones will grow. Many honourable senators will know of the places where the greatest backlogs in phone installations have occurred. For example, the waiting lists in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, areas like the Gold Coast in Queensland and country rural towns in Victoria are growing rapidly. Despite a fall in demand for new telephone services because of the penetration of the availability of telephones throughout Australia there will be over 112,000 Australians waiting for phones at the end of this financial year, according to the report now before the Senate. This is 15,000 more people waiting for phones than were waiting at the end of the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr May, the Acting Chairman of Telecom Australia, someone who is conscious that the former chairman was sacked and never replaced, uses the following sort of diplomatic language to make the problem quite clear when laying the responsibility with the Federal Government:</PARA>
<PARA> It must be realised that with a limited capital program improvements in the network will not be as great as desirable and there will undoubtedly be some increase in the waiting times for service, particularly in high growth areas, such as the coastal regions of northern New South Wales and Queensland. In short it will not be practicable to make all of the improvements in service which some users would expect nor as quickly as they would desire. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the figures in this report show that in 1980-81 Telecom was able to satisfy 82 per cent of demand for new phone installations. According to the report now before us, in 1981-82 it will satisfy only 79 per cent of demand. Telecom has demonstrated not a perfect performance but a fairly high degree of efficiency. With restrictions on its finance, staffing and activities it has nevertheless targeted for a business growth of 13 per cent and a productivity gain of 7 per cent. Comparatively that is not a bad sort of record when we look at the general performance of business organisations in Australia. Telecom has also resisted to some extent this Government's attempts to run down its capital program. I will quote again from the report which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> With the restriction on borrowings, and the higher interest to be paid on past advances by the Commonwealth, the work of developing the telecommunications network in Australia to meet current and future demands could not proceed without this generation of substantial resources from within the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, Telecom's capital needs have been met insofar as they can be met by generation of capital resources from within the organisation, that is, from profits. This year we have seen the first round of increased charges by Telecom. I remind the Senate again that Telecom is one of the few organisations in Australia-I would think the only one-that between 1975 and 1981 did not increase its charges. Hands up any honourable senator who can think of any private enterprise organisation whether it be the lolly shop on the corner or the Myer emporium that has not increased charges in the period 1975 to 1981. All honourable senators remain mute and fixed in their places. There are no hands going up because there are not any other organisations in that situation. The fact of the matter is that charges have gone up in 1981. Telephone charges have increased and delays have developed in the provision of new services by Telecom because of the Fraser Government's policies. Let there be no doubt about that because that is the evidence of the Telecom report now before the Senate and it is the evidence of the independent inquiry which the Government set up and which it refuses to publish. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has not only failed the people of Australia in terms of telephone charges and the provision of new telephone services but also it has been grossly cowardly in facing public debate as to why those things have occurred. It is not prepared to have a frank debate on the documented evidence in relation to this issue. It hides behind the cowardly veil of ministerial privilege, or whatever it might be called; not the Laurie Oakes syndrome as it is called but another veil of ministerial privilege. That is why in a sense this Parliament becomes an absolute farce if the Government will not front, in terms of debating the issues on the evidence available, but hides behind alleged confidentiality in relation to a report about Australia's largest employer-an enormous organisation in terms of capital investment. I assert quite strongly-this is supported by the two documents I have mentioned-that higher telephone charges and the unavailability of new telephone services are the direct responsibility of this Government towards Telecom. The statement in the report strongly implies that price increases could have been averted. Mr May, the Acting Chairman of Telecom, a man in limbo as it were after the unhappy fate of his predecessor, said that. He said that higher prices could have been averted had the Government adopted a more liberal attitude towards Telecom borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other disturbing aspects of this Government's downgrading of Telecom. Telecom directs about $250m a year towards the maintenance of unprofitable country services in Australia in the development of the country network. That figure is growing by about $40m a year. Already schemes for automation of exchanges in the country have been cut back because Telecom cannot continue to finance at the same level that unprofitable area of its activities. But this Government's restrictions on Telecom revenue and capital raising and its proposed hiving off of profitable activities to private enterprise pose much greater threats to country people than the possibility of restrictions on automation. This will lead, in the long term, to a dramatic downgrading of telecommunication services. This will lead to Mr Fraser's user pays principle in the country. Country people should be warned that when the users pay for telephone services in the country they will pay through the nose. They will pay roof top prices if they have to be susceptible to the user pays principle in relation to telephone or Australia Post services in the country. Already people are paying significantly higher telephone rentals in some areas. Some telephone rentals are in the order of $500 a year now. If the user pays principle came into country areas, country people would pay on average about $200 a year more for their telephone rentals than they do now. If the user pays principle really came into country areas some people would pay $15,000 and more for the installation of a telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one or two other remarks about Victoria. The State of Victoria is sad, very sad, when one looks at it from any point of view. It is a sad State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is worse than South Australia. It leads all States in the downward spiral of Government performance. In dealing with the State of Victoria, let me briefly turn to our absent colleague, Senator Lewis, who, if I might say so, typifies everything that is wrong with my State. Senator Lewis was in Ballarat last week and he explained to the worthy burghers of Ballarat through the columns of the Ballarat Courier that Telecom had a brilliant record over the past five years. It is the only organisation, he said, which has not put up prices since 1975, a fact which he seemed to attribute to the policies of the present Government. Senator Lewis went on to say that Telecom should not have a greater borrowing capacity. I am sorry he was not present for the tabling of the report in this chamber but I just commend to him a thorough reading of it because I hope the next time he goes to Ballarat-he describes himself as the Government's representative in Ballarat; I would have thought anyone who said that would need to wear dark glasses-he will tell the people what is happening to them in terms of Telecom's charges and in respect of the installation of new telephones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In June 1975 there were no deferred applications for the installation of new phones in Ballarat. As at April 1981 there had been an increase of 337 per cent in the number of deferred applications for the installation of new telephones in Ballarat. The time taken to complete the installation of phones has increased by 74 per cent. Those figures are available on a town by town basis in answers to questions which have been put in this Parliament. Those figures for Ballarat are repeated across the country in regional towns. I hope, as I have said, that when people like Senator Lewis receive complaints about this sort of thing they tell the truth about Government policies and tell the truths which are revealed in the report now before this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in relation to demand for new services, which is dealt with at page 6 of the report called 'Service and Business Outlook for 1981-82', all States have remained static except Queensland where demand has increased. Queensland senators are to be congratulated no doubt on their efforts in stimulating that additional demand. Only in Victoria has demand for new telephone services declined. The decline in demand for these services in Victoria reflects the general economic malaise in that State and the great sadness which has fallen upon us down there. The State was once the brightest jewel in the crown of liberalism, as I recall the single eloquent phrase of Sir Henry Bolte during his long career. That situation of course has all changed and when people like Senator Lewis talk about Telecom to the people of Ballarat they should put some of these figures to them and should consult this sort of report which is now before the Senate. People such as Senator Baume should be more diligent in persuading the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) that any real debate about Telecom has to take place on the basis of honest assessment of the facts and independent evidence which have not been made available to this Parliament but which ought to be made available. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual reports of companies, departments and commissions such as the Repatriation Commission sometimes make fascinating reading and sometimes do not. One of the problems is that in this place we always get them just before we are due to speak and therefore our reading of them is usually fairly cursory. What one can say about this report is that it is certainly well printed; it has a nice cover. On page 2 there is a photograph of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Honourable Tony Messner, officially opening a new ward at Lady Davidson Repatriation Hospital in Turramurra, New South Wales. I can commend the senator because at least he did not achieve what was achieved a couple of years ago in a report from the Department of Foreign Affairs in which the Minister managed to get his photograph in no fewer than nine times. At least this is the only photograph of Senator Messner in this report. One would have perhaps liked a couple of photographs of Senator Messner talking to the people at the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Western Australia about the wards that were in fact closed there or to the staff of the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney where wards have been closed and where there is a critical shortage of staff in the paramedical field. One must remember that reports like this are aimed at putting a fairly glossy finish on the activities of a department or commission. But there are some things in the fairly sketchy report which I think we should look at and ask the Minister to comment on at some time. </PARA>
<PARA> That section of the report headed 'Introduction and highlights' concentrates heavily on the increased work load associated with repatriation functions. The interesting comment for those who take an interest in the matter is that the report says again that all indications point to no significant change in the work load of the Repatriation Commission for many years despite the time that has elapsed since the last big war. It says that new initiatives have been added, and this contributes to the work load. It says that another factor in the work load is the drastically increased time taken to process claims and appeals because of the new administrative changes which were introduced last year and the year before and which were not accompanied by increased staff or improved methods to cope with those administrative processes. The Commission in fact reports that it is aware of the present unsatisfactory position in relation to times taken to process claims and appeals and it is doing all it can to overcome the problem. However, it is likely to be some time, says the Commission, before the position will be satisfactory. I am sure that every member of this Parliament will realise how unsatisfactory the present situation is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs in relation to appeals and the processing of claims. It certainly is not satisfactory to the ex-service organisations of this country or to those of us who, repeatedly, receive letters on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> As the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I receive many complaints about the inordinate delays that have been occurring, although many of the changes to the legislation were meant to overcome such delays. Certainly, the vast majority of the representations made to me in my capacity as shadow Minister concern delays. Some cases go back for years. Some of the veterans who are involved are not even alive by the time their cases are finally heard. This is not a satisfactory state of affairs and it is becoming worse. As the Commission makes clear, that situation will continue. It is an example not only of justice not being done but also of justice not being seen to be done. For instance, in 1980 some 7,053 entitlement claims were outstanding but, at 30 June 1981, some 9,483 were outstanding. In 1980 3,122 applications for increased disability allowance were outstanding. As of 30 June 1981, some 4,099 were outstanding. At the end of 1980, some 2,260 appeals to the Repatriation Commission were outstanding. As at the end of June 1981, some 2,999 were outstanding. Thus, the picture, as far as appeals and administrative functions of the Department are concerned, is not good. That fact has been noted on many occasions by veterans and their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time, the report contains a section-it is two pages in length-which is devoted to the health of Vietnam veterans, a subject which did not even make the report last year. One hopes that it is an indication that the Government at last realises that specific and special problems are suffered by those who fought in Vietnam, but there is a long way to go. That is why some honourable senators are interested in the Senate's taking over the role that the Government should be fulfilling in the matter and instituting its own inquiry. Certainly, an epidemiological study has been instituted but to date the pilot study involves only 600 veterans of the 40,000 who served in Vietnam. Doubt has been cast on the methodology employed and the difficulties which will be created by trying to undertake a survey of that type. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes that recent initiatives include the establishment of a special unit within the Department to monitor Australian and overseas studies of exposure to toxic chemicals such as herbicides. I am certainly glad to see this happening and to find that at last the Minister admits that something is going on. Earlier this year, I tabled the so-called Fleming report in the Senate. That report deals with overseas and Australian literature on problems attendant upon the use of herbicides. It originated in the Minister's Department and deals specifically with these matters, but the Minister spent most of his time arguing that the document was not a report and resisted strongly any suggestion that it should be made public. At least the Department admits now that there is a problem and that it has a special unit to report on such documents, no matter what the Minister may call them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other initiative listed in the report is a counselling service. That is welcomed but is essentially a capital city type of setup. I believe it has been ineffective in counselling Vietnam veterans, many of whom, it seems, contemplate committing, or have succeeded in committing, suicide because of the remoteness or ineffectiveness of the Department in handling their problems. I believe that this hastily established service will encounter difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, like all such reports, suffers from having been prepared prior to the presentation of the Budget and immediately thereafter becoming out of date in respect of benefits and allowances. There have been changes in benefits and allowances and we will be able to discuss these when the Government finally brings down the legislation for their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> One chapter is entitled 'The International Year of Disabled Persons'. It provides a very good example for those who are interested of the way in which a department will write a chapter to fill a few pages in a report but not take much notice of what it is doing. The chapter begins:</PARA>
<PARA> During the International Year of Disabled Persons, public attention has focused on the problems and needs of the disabled. This concern should not fade as the year ends, but rather, 1981 should be the beginning of new solutions, new awareness and a new understanding. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the standard introduction to any document written on the International Year of Disabled Persons. The chapter then goes on rather surprisingly to point out that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has actually been dealing with disabled persons since 1920, and gives two examples-its treatment of strokes and its treatment of amputees, but upon being read it is seen as obviously a fill-in chapter-something thrown together to help fill the report.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that some 200 medical papers are presented. Many are of obvious value to repatriation patients, but one or two I would be fascinated to read in order to ascertain their association with the Repatriation Commission. One is entitled 'The Menstrual Cycle, Personality and Academic Performance'. Another is called 'A Very Unusual Worm', and yet another 'A Funny Yoke-Tale of an Unscrewed Pin'. But I can find no papers relating specifically to the problems of Vietnam veterans. There are no papers on the effects of toxic chemicals, nor are there any on the so-called post-traumatic stress syndrome, which the Minister would have us believe explains all of the symptoms associated with Vietnam veterans-symptoms which some veterans believe may be related to their exposure to herbicides. The closest that we come to the problems of Vietnam veterans in the papers presented under the auspices of the Commission is one entitled, 'The Role of Life Events in Depressive Illness. Is there a substantial causal relation?' I daresay there may be some reference in that paper to the Vietnam veterans but it would seem that most of the papers presented deal not at all with the problems of this very important, young and neglected section of our ex-service community. During the Estimates committee hearings my colleagues and I will pursue many of the matters raised in the report. I hope that the Minister will be able to fill in many of the gaps that it leaves unfilled. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the annual report of the Institute of Family Studies and I commend the Institute upon it. According to my criteria, it is an attractive yet sensible document. The Institute has resisted the temptation to misallocate funds for the production of a grandiose report. In clear and simple terms, it outlines the background to the establishment of the Institute, its aims and methods, and to some extent its rationale during its first year or part-year of operation. I commend the Institute for its multi-faceted approach to the work which it has undertaken in a number of areas, particularly research. We all know that research in this field has been most sorely needed. It is one of the areas in which we have spent nowhere near enough of our resources over the past few years. In fact, at the present time virtually no Australian studies are being carried out. Honourable senators will appreciate the problems and, one might even say the dangers, of using overseas material and attempting to apply it to Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend also the Institute's approach to research, which has been presented on a broad front. I will not take up the time of the Senate to go through it at this stage, but I suggest that honourable senators read the report regarding this area at least, study the seven-year plan and notice the wide consultation that went into the preparation of that plan. The second area on which I wish to comment is that of public contact through the Institute's family impact seminars and workshops. It has attempted-successfully, I believe-to involve what one might call the raw material of family studies in the total process of setting up workshops, research material and so on. Institutional liaison has taken place both in Australia and overseas-in Autralia with organisations such as the Family Court of Australia, the Family Law Council and the Australian Law Reform Commission, and overseas with American and European institutions. I wish to read a brief comment from the report in relation to the Family Information Centre, which I believe is one of the most important aspects of the work being conducted by the Institute. Page 35 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> As a government research agency the Institute of Family Studies has a major role to play in the collection and publication of information on Australian families. To facilitate and co-ordinate these Information activities, the Institute established the Family Information Centre (FIC). The Centre has three main information programs:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 publications</PARA>
<PARA> 2 library collection</PARA>
<PARA> 3 data base development. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will know of the publications program and appreciate its high standard. I make these publications available to groups within my electorate. No doubt many honourable senators do the same. The brief history contained towards the end of the document makes very interesting reading. I notice that in September 1964 the genesis of the idea for the Institute came from the National Marriage Guidance Council. In September 1970 an approach was made to the Federal Government for funding. I should perhaps refer to the document itself to inform the Senate of what happened from then on. In September 1970 Mrs Marie Breen approached the Minister for Social Services, the Honourable W. C. Wentworth, regarding Commonwealth funding. On 10 March, five months later, Mrs Breen reported that Sir Robert Menzies had been 'most interested and impressed by the academic support but had suggested that the current economic climate was not appropriate and that towards the end of the year there might be a more favourable political and economic climate'. I move ahead to 3 May 1972, where the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA> Letter to Mr Wentworth from Mr Malcolm Fraser (Minister for Education and Science)-</PARA>
<PARA>Who now has other responsibilities in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>commending the significance of the proposal but unable to offer funds from the Education grant. Other sources of funding proved unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA>We had to wait until May 1975 when Senator Murphy's Family Law Bill provided for the Institute. Again, with the change of government, we had to wait until 1979 before the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) actually announced the appointment of the Director and to February 1980 before Dr Edgar commenced his activities. The present Government does not come out of this situation with a great deal of commendation, if one might put it that way. On the matter of funding, the report had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> To achieve what it was set up to do, the Institute has been given a level of staffing and a budgetary allocation. The extent of both has been limited by the government's policy of restraining expenditure and restricting the size of public sector employment. </PARA>
<PARA>If we read through the document it becomes clear, if we do not see the implications in that brief statement, that there is inadequate funding both for resources and for staffing, particularly for the latter. I do make a plea to the Government not to pauperise the Institute and to make sufficient funds available to it to enable it to recruit the staff to do the vital job it has to do. Many of the social problems which exist in Australia at present and which are being looked at by this organisation, are a direct result of Government activity. The problems include the level of unemployment, the shortage of housing, the higher cost of living and the lower standard of living. There is a shortage of staff in a vitally important area. Of course, staff is not short only in this Institute. If we look back to the support services that are supposed to be giving assistance to families we see that there is a shortage of staff there too. There is an inadequate funding of the so-called voluntary agencies, just to name a few of the problems created by the present Government. All those problems have created a situation in which the family is not able to give all its members the support they need. I ask the Government to pay more than lip service to its support for the Institute and to give adequate funds to enable this outstanding work not only to continue but also to expand. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I join Senator Robertson in making a comment on the annual report of the Institute of Family Studies. I must confess that I have seen the report only very briefly and have not studied it with any thoroughness at this stage, but I certainly intend to do that in the next few days. In general, I support what Senator Robertson has said but I think his strictures of the Government insofar as the organisation and setting up of the Institute of Family Studies were a little unfair. I agree that it has been slow in getting off the ground, but one has to realise that there were defects in the provisions of the Family Law Act of 1975. Although the Institute was an initiative of the Labor Government and although that initiative received a lot of support from members on both sides of the Parliament, ultimately defects were found in the provisions of the structure which was being set up. Consequently, although attempts were made to appoint a director at an early stage, we had to amend the legislation before the Institute could come into existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would agree that it is a great pity that this Institute was not in existence at the early stages. The Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, whose report is yet to be implemented in this Parliament, found itself very weakened by the lack of information which it might have had had the Institute been in existence. The Institute would have been picking up the very considerable number of problems which arose and would have helped the Committee by placing statistics before it. There have been, I think, over 200,000 divorces since the Act came into operation. I am sure that the various studies which are outlined in this report will be very revealing and very helpful not only to the Family Court of Australia but also to the Family Law Council in making recommendations for any changes in the law or regulations that apply in this important area. I join Senator Robertson in hoping that generous provision will be made for funds so that the work that is being done may continue and we may be able to make up for lost time. The court has been operating for several years and there is a lot of work to be done in getting the original statistics, carrying out research and then getting on to dealing with other factors which would contribute in a practical way to establishing where the real danger points are so far as marriage is concerned and in trying to ensure that people can be helped long before the time that they find themselves in a family court facing divorce proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, therefore, that it is necessary for governments to be generous in the provision of moneys for an institute such as this. I believe the Institute of Family Studies has an excellent Director and staff. It employs people with enthusiasm and the necessity to show that they are able to provide the necessary wherewithal to enable the Institute to be effective in achieving its purposes. I welcome the report and hope not only that members of the Senate will study it carefully but also that members of the community will study it and contribute in turn to the Institute with information that will help it in the work which it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA>I commend the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation on its report. I note that it is operating in some 23 countries, and has approximately 70 projects in those countries as well as 54 projects in Australia. I had a quick look through the report hoping to see whether the Corporation had employed an environmentalist. I would like to see more study done on the social and economic impact of some of the projects that the Corporation takes on. However, that is entirely a political criticism and in no way detracts from the engineering abilities of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. I would like to draw to the Senate's attention the last paragraph of the director's report, remembering of course that the Corporation does a terrific amount of consulting work. The last paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The consulting industry is a key unit in the development of Australia's internal resources and export earnings overseas. It is hoped that the Government will effectively support the maximum use of Australian consultants during the exciting future program of resources projects in Australia, to better equip these consultants for work in their own country and in the pursuit of work overseas. The Corporation looks forward to being given the continued opportunity to use its experience and skills to support the efforts of the consulting industry, both in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>I daresay there is a bit of a message in that paragraph. I cannot in any way see the Government not assisting the Corporation. As I have said, I would like to have seen the Corporation make a deeper study into the social and economic impact of the projects it takes on. Both my colleague, Senator Primmer, and I have been critical of some of the projects but I make it quite clear that that does not in any way detract from the engineering abilities of the Corporation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Committee of Review on Migrant Assessment is a moderately lengthy one and, of course, we have not had the opportunity to read it in great detail. It is a report of a committee which was appointed six months ago, on 6 March, with Dr Charles Price of the Australian National University as chairman. It was set up to review the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System and our immigration policy. Some issues which arise out of the report should be looked at carefully. The Committee pointed out that there is strong support in the community for some form of selection based on factors known or believed to determine settlement success, and that family reunion is one of the strongest components in the success of settling migrants. There has been a strong demand from the ethnic communities to take this factor into account. It has been of major emphasis in the Australian Labor Party policy, which has stated also that in an immigration policy at a level consistent with national interest and humanitarian obligations, family reunion must have a high priority. We persist with that view and we are glad that the Committee report subscribes to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also found a knowledge of the English language was desirable but that there is a strong feeling in the migrant community that the present emphasis within NUMAS requirements for English language capability is unfairly discriminatory. It certainly is discriminatory and will become even more discriminatory if a good knowledge of English before the migrant comes here is a major determinant in an immigration policy. However, because some facility with the English language is considered in this report, and of course by everybody, to be a major determinant of settlement success in this country, the Committee has raised the very important issue of the need for more resources to be put into post-arrival services and social security. If one is to achieve settlement success, one needs to do everything one can in this country to ensure that success. It is necessary to provide assistance so that people can increase their facility with English and also it is necessary to provide social security assistance when they first come here. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, there has been a decline in post-arrival services for migrants under this Government. For instance, in order to match the allocation for migrant education under Labor's last year in government, this Government would have to spend an additional $37m this year. The Department of Social Security has reduced its migrant services section and its interpreter services section, and is now told to contract out to the private profit sector its translation services. All these factors will affect to some extent the post-arrival settlement of migrants and will make things difficult for them and therefore difficult for the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the expensive W. D. Scott report on the Information Needs of Migrants has been totally ignored by the Government, the most recent example being the refusal by the Government to use television and radio, as recommended by that report, to inform migrant workers of their rights under the new health care arrangements. This refusal to use the most effective media-it is well known to be the most effective-will make life difficult for those in the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health who are trying to get some success of what is a very difficult and almost impossible health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In the administration of NUMAS, the highest points are given to professional and trade qualifications, the demand for prearranged employment, and transferrable assets. In considering personal and settlement factors, the criteria are very much more subjective. Marks are awarded for preparedness to settle, responsiveness, initiative, presentation and adaptability, whatever all those things mean to various people. Family unity and sponsorship earn far fewer credit points. The Committee's task included an appraisal of the consistency of these subjective criteria in the application of NUMAS. In general, the Committee found that there is a high degree of consistency in the scores at different immigration posts overseas. However, there is an interesting point in that the ability to issue what are called catch-up points to candidates who do not score an immigration approval on the NUMAS points score was used fairly restrictively. In the survey, 95 per cent of cases from Athens, 78 per cent of cases from Rome, and 76 per cent of cases from Belgrade had relatives or friends here, but insufficient use was made of the catch-up scheme for people of low score, despite an official policy of relaxation of the NUMAS guidelines in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sought participation with contacted organisations in Australia through the ethnic communities director and the ethnic media, but both these organisations, with the publication from the ethnic media, were casualties of the razor gang. As we pointed out at the time, this was a pathetic penny-pinching exercise. One could even describe it as censorship. It prevents ethnic groups knowing how other ethnic groups view Government policies in relation to attitudes to and experiences of NUMAS. Exchanges between various communities, and exchange of information in particular, are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, in the cross-section of views which were presented to the Committee there were totally contradictory bases of belief. For instance, some people believed that migration should be restricted to white Christians, others that migration should be completely non-discriminatory. Some said that migration disrupts employment, others said that migration generates unemployment. There was that sort of generalisation all the way through. It is important that, although a majority of submissions in all categories stated that NUMAS was not working satisfactorily, the Committee disagreed and found that the policies were consistently applied. I believe that, on the basis of this report, it is not likely that the Government will drastically review its policies. The Opposition, through its spokesman, Mr Young, was prepared to take a bipartisan approach on this matter, but we certainly echo the reservations of the ethnic communities, who have continually expressed concern about the restrictive nature of and the Anglo-Saxon emphasis on migrant recruitment and particularly on migrant approvals. </PARA>
<PARA> We also endorse the findings of the Committee that the maintenance guarantee system at present in operation should be discontinued, firstly because it does not work satisfactorily; secondly, because it is not administered satisfactorily; and thirdly, because it causes considerable distress amongst migrant groups, as any senator or member who deals with the migrant community would know. Any immigration policy should encourage people who need and want to migrate to Australia and can be seen as contributing to our national interest. Because many sections of our community now are not Anglo-Saxon, consideration should be given to weighing not only the points system outside the country but also the support systems which are here for migrants and to which governments can contribute. If we are to develop a proper migration policy we must not do what we have done in recent years, that is, neglect the post-settlement services to migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, we must make sure that the debate amongst both the ethnic communities and in this Parliament is an informed and sensible one. I point out that a Public Service committee has recently produced a special report entitled 'The Commonwealth as an Employer of Migrants'. It is a report on a subject which is of great interest to us in this Parliament and to the community. If anyone should be showing a good example in the employment of migrants it is the Government, and it is important that we are able to see what is being done and how successful it is. However, the Government has decided that, although this report is not secret, journalists may have a copy of it only if they do not quote from it. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Commonwealth Public Service Board, 21 recommendations were listed in this special report and these have been brought to the notice of every Federal Minister. The Board states that the recommendations are aimed at achieving equal employment opportunities for anyone of ethnic background, either currently employed or seeking employment in the Federal Public Service. That is a noble aim. However, it states that journalists will not be given a copy of the special report if they intend to quote from it. It says that the report is not secret, but it will be given to journalists only on condition that it is not quoted from and is used only as background. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs says that the report is simply a working document which could easily be taken out of context if anyone thought that it had official Government approval. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this sort of attitude by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, other departments and the Government which I find very difficult to understand. What they are saying is that they have reports that they consider and from which they make policy. They are not secret reports, they can be taken away and read. They can be used somehow as background briefing, but they must not be quoted from because the general public is not bright enough to understand that these are background reports and that if they are quoted from directly the general public may be misled in some strange way. I see no reason at all why members of this Parliament or members of the public in general cannot see the reports, see the results of Government decisions made as a result of those reports, and make a rational judgment themselves. The best way to make something seem mysterious or sinister in this community is to put 'confidential' or 'secret' on it or put ridiculous restrictions on it such as that. Quite obviously, most journalists will not accept the report under those conditions. They will do what I intend to do, that is, acquire a copy of the report in some other way and then quote from it as freely as I like. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is absolutely nonsensical, if we are to have informed debate in this community and in this Parliament and if we are to judge properly the validity of the decisions made by the Government, that we receive information such as this so that we can weigh up the facts, weigh up the various opinions, and make our own decisions. I am sure that the general public can do that. We are a democracy. We allegedly have freedom of information of some sort in this country. Presumably we are sufficiently educated and have sufficient judgment to make up our own minds, and for the Government to impose silly restrictions-and I suggest that those restrictions have been imposed at the behest of the Public Service Board or someone in the bureaucracy-on reports such as this merely clouds the issue, makes sinister those things that are not sinister, confuses those things that are not confusing, and merely demonstrates, I believe, the lack of confidence the Government has in its own decisions and the information on which it makes those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that everyone reads the report and considers it carefully. I am sure that it will be looked at with great interest in the ethnic communities. I believe I am to be followed by my colleague Senator Mulvihill, so I will leave it to him to continue the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be virtually a postscript to the very apt comments of Senator Grimes. I think that on reflection the Senate will recall that the Opposition did canvass the idea of a Senate select committee looking at all aspects of migration or that this be part of the ongoing operations of Estimates Committee D. Just as Senator Grimes has referred to the Estimates committee of which he is a member receiving further answers in the field of repatriation and the plight of Vietnam campaign veterans, I hope that when Estimates Committee D meets we will get a fleshing out of the ministerial response to this document. After all, it applies to aims and issues. It does not make recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We never fully achieve the complete mix between the components of family reunion, job categories and refugees. That is a very difficult and important aim. Perhaps a Senate commitee could have played a more effective role. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) is beginning to have doubts about some of the groups of people who purport to be genuine political refugees. I say that with some feeling. Over the last three or four weekends it has been my job on behalf of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party to attend a national conference of people from Uruguay and Peru. Those people have gone through great political suppression. I hope that the next program will have more relativity regarding the various continents in which political suppression is the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I make is that one of the issues refers to representations from some State and Territory governments for special concessions for migrants prepared to settle in those parts of Australia where population growth is most desirable. I strike a note of warning. There was a success story in the early post-war years when a contingent of Polish ex-servicemen who served under General Anders created the Butlers Gorge project. In our modern day work force of the 1980s we would be courting considerable industrial difficulties if we pinned down people to labour contracts of two years. If we create an elite force these people will be in an industrial crossfire. The trade union role to fight for such things as climatic allowances and adequate housing is part of that work force. Unwittingly trade unions could find themselves in a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I say that I hope it will not be too long before the Minister replies to these semi-findings. I know that many people in ethnic communities believe like me, that we ought to have strict percentage quotas so that there is a greater equalitarian concept of the whole situation. I repeat that the refugee percentages are grossly distorted. By all means in cases where people have served on a losing army and may finish up before a firing squad there are some humanitarian obligations. It is a different ball-game when other people who might have done well out of a war want to get out without paying their taxes. That position has to be related, I repeat, to the relatives of the many Latin Americans in Australia who come from countries where the order of the day is blatant political dictatorship. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the amendments to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act forecast in the statement the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) made to the Parliament on 14 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It may assist honourable senators in their understanding of the problems that are to be resolved if I were to briefly explain the essential background. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years, contributions and retirement benefits payable under the Defence Force scheme have been calculated by reference to the rate of salary payable in respect of the substantive rank held by members. Additional salary paid on the basis of a higher acting or temporary rank has been disregarded for defence force retirement benefits and defence force retirement and death benefits purposes mainly because of the transitory nature of the acting and temporary rank arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1980, the Federal Court of Australia decided, however, that the intended link between 'rank' as defined in the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act and the annual rates of pay regulations made under that Act had not been properly established. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, as the legislation now stands, acting and temporary rank rates of pay are to be taken into account for both contributions and benefits purposes in respect of all service rendered since the commencement of the scheme on 1 October 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, a relatively small number of pensioners, estimated to be of the order of 550, are entitled to higher retirement benefits; and a very large number of both pensioners and serving members are required to pay additional contributions without any corresponding increase in benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now, to the practical effects of the Bill before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it restores to the scheme, with effect from 14 May 1981, the original intention that members contributions and retirement benefits be calculated on the basis of the annual rate of pay applicable to substantive rank held by the member during service. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, it makes special provision for all those persons who during the currency of the present scheme have held acting or temporary rank, in the way I go on to explain. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners entitled to additional pension benefits will be paid these benefits in full, including any available commutation amounts, from the date of their retirement. As from 14 May 1981 however, their pensions will be adjusted by reverting to what they would have been if calculated according to the substantive rank held on retirement and taking account of any additional commutation lump sums received. </PARA>
<PARA> The pensioners to whom I have just referred, that is those in receipt of or entitled to an additional benefit, will be required to pay additional contributions based on their acting or temporary rank rate of pay but only in respect of that period of acting or temporary rank service that immediately preceded their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> All additional contributions that would otherwise be payable in respect of acting or temporary rank are waived. In other words, only persons who retired or died while holding acting or temporary rank and qualify for higher levels of pension benefits are liable to pay additional contributions to the limited extent that I have indicated, and currently serving members will not be disadvantaged by having to pay higher contributions in future because of their temporary higher rank status. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments for which the opportunity has been taken to include in the Bill, involve the rationalisation of the provisions relating to pensioners who re-enter the Defence Force. They are designed principally to cut down the high costs of additional pension and commutation benefits that so frequently become payable to pensioners who re-enter the scheme for relatively brief periods. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, they provide that only pensioners who re-enter on an appointment or engagement for a period of not less than one year shall again become contributors to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> On their second or subsequent retirement they will be entitled to appropriate pension increments for their additional service but be excluded from further access to the commutation provisions. They will no longer be required, however, to repay portion of their commutation proceeds during their period of additional service. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners who re-enter for brief periods of less than one year will not again become contributing members: Nor will their retirement pensions be cancelled on re-entry as is currently the case. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can only really understand these Bills in the overall context of the Budget. It is a contention of the Australian Labour Party that the Budget will do little to restore prosperity in Australia. Of course, we are not the only critics of the Budget. The Bank of New South Wales, which has been no friend of the Labor Party over the years has said that the Federal Government's Budget strategy is based on an economic gamble. It goes on to say that the Budget will prove to be inflationary instead of bearing down on inflation and the money supply will have to grow faster than the Government has budgeted. The Bank of New South Wales goes on to say that the Budget is a catalogue of economic paradoxes which calls for wage restraint yet relies on inflationary growth of average weekly earnings to bring down a sizable Budget surplus. It is bad enough if that sort of conservative institution does not like the Budget, but let us have a look at the views of a former Liberal Party Treasurer and Prime Minister, Sir William McMahon. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The underlying assumption in the Budget was the need to take fiscal and monetary steps to dampen down expansion and enthusiasm. This policy no longer sits easily with the necessity for economic growth. Nor is it consistent with the economic and financial facts that are now becoming public. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there are many features of the Budget that we on this side of the Senate would disagree with but it is probably more appropriate today to concentrate on a few of them. Our most obvious objection, of course, is to sales tax. The Labor Party opposes the sales tax increases contained in this Budget. We concede that indirect taxation is inevitable in our present society but see little reason why it should be increased now or in the future. It is a regressive form of taxation. If one is a low income earner, one pays exactly the same amount of sales tax as someone on a high income. If one wants to buy a new car, the sales tax for someone on $10,000 a year is exactly the same as for someone on $30,000 or $40,000 a year. There is absolutely no equity in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sometimes argued by Government members that in fact the consumer has a choice whether to buy. This would be more appropriate if the items being taxed were merely luxury goods, but of course, as we all know, it covers such a wide spectrum of goods that the consumer has no choice but to actually purchase products and pay sales tax. No family can avoid buying shoes or buying clothes and the prices of these will go up. Indeed, whilst it is claimed that food is exempt, the price of food will go up merely because nearly all food is packaged and there is sales tax on packaging. I suppose the consumer could at least decide not to buy any dog soap, which will now be 17 1/2 per cent dearer. We will probably have a lot of dirty dogs running around the country, if not running the country. One of the most iniquitous areas of sales tax will be the tax on knowledge-a tax on books and newspapers. I believe Lord Willis adequately summed it up when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is one of the most scandalous things I have ever heard of. </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe now only the private schools will be able to afford books and I hope that does not please any of those opposite. It is a rather strange Government that six months ago could claim that it was not going to introduce more indirect taxation, and this at a time when the value added tax and various retail taxes were being considered, and then indicate that it would not be an appropriate thing to do. We now have a situation where a few months later the Government is introducing sales tax on a range of goods never before covered and increasing the actual level of sales tax on many other goods. In May, consultation was promised with the Confederation of Australian Industry before any such changes were to be made in this area. The way in which the Government has introduced these taxes is causing great dislocation in industry. We now seem to have a situation where the Government seems to be trying to fight inflation by lifting prices. There is no doubt that the sales tax increases will be passed on to the consumers as manufacturers have said they simply cannot absorb the costs. As a result, the consumer price index will increase and any chance of reducing interest rates in the immediate future will go by the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is therefore going to oppose the sales tax Bills when they come into the Senate. We have asked for support from others and, of course, it has not been forthcoming. The argument that if the Senate rejected the sales tax proposals it would be creating a 1975 situation is ludicrous. We are talking about 1.25 per cent of revenue: The domestic surplus is about three times this level. We are not talking about catastrophically interfering with the Budget. The proposal by the Australian Democrats to add a meaningless amendment to the Budget will probably get a good laugh in the House of Representatives, especially as the Democrats have already indicated that they will pass the Budget, unamended, a second time. Such cream puff grandstanding fails to come to terms with the real issues of sales tax. I further find it rather difficult to understand how a credible political party can take eight days to determine what their principles are. Certainly we in the Labor Party do not have to consult a lawyer to establish what our principles are. Probably the West Australian Democrat President, Mr Geoff Taylor, was quite correct in what he said about the Democrats' attitude to sales tax-and I am glad that shallow thinking has not prevailed and he has not been removed from office. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators want evidence that this Government is incapable of handling the Australian economy, they need look no further than the sorry story of interest rates. Skyrocketing rates of interest have made it impossible for four out of every five Australians seeking savings bank loans for their first homes. Since the beginning of the 1980-81 financial year, over $1,000m has been loaded on to the cost of home purchases. This has cruelly eaten into the spending capacity of many Australian families. The money tied up on loan and mortgage commitments has been denied to the consumer market place. It is ironic that this Government, which has from time to time claimed to represent small business and the farmer, has done more than anyone to depress the money market. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Hayden has identified Australia as possessing the dubious distinction of having the second highest real rate of interest in the world-just marginally behind the United States of America. Yet, tragically, this Government has budgeted for a domestic surplus of over $1.5 billion. This simple failure to spend in a productive way what the Government intends to take in through the highest taxes in Australia's history is, I believe, a bitter indictment of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. They have run up a massive trade deficit and the Budget implies the only solution is an uncontrolled flood of foreign capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The current account deficit of $6,700m is estimated, in the Budget's figures, to be covered by a $7,000m capital inflow over 1981-82. Relying on this level of foreign intervention in our national economy may be not only unwise but also irresponsible. At any rate, where does this money go? In large part, the experience is that this money is invested in stock exchange speculation, real estate speculation and in the buying up of profitable commercial and industrial operations. This Government is quite content to see continued pressure on short term interest rates to rise. It has done nothing to lower long term interest rates. We may well question the accuracy of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) when he predicted a growth in the money supply for 1981-82 of 10 to 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's sanctimonious calls for wage restraint sit uneasily with the conservatives' dependence on growth in weekly earnings to boost tax receipts. At the lauded wages summit, Australian Council of Trade Unions President, Cliff Dolan, expressed the common-sense approach of Australian wage and salary earners: There can be no promise of wage restraint unless relief is given in the areas of interest rates and taxation. Since then, home loan interest rates have gone up by one per cent and there have been no alterations to the tax scales. In addition, wide increases in indirect taxation, the most regressive form, have been announced. How can restraint possibly be justified?</PARA>
<PARA> The average Australian is losing the interest battle. For many people the last increase was the last straw. If families do not sell up, the pressure will be on the mortgage holders to do so. The budgets of many Australians are tightly fixed to the whole repayment syndrome, especially on homes. For many, the emotional and material needs of life have been subjected to trying to keep up with the interest spiral. This problem hits Australians regardless of their social position. In fact, its impact, if anything, is greater on those assuming middle class expectations and life styles. Local families have been forced voluntarily to surrender their homes because they just cannot keep up any more, something unheard of in good Liberal voting suburbs 10 years ago. Perhaps now the traditional supporters of the Government are beginning to see with their own eyes the dead end of conservative policies. The upwardly socially mobile are beginning on the long road down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made room for the speculators and the quick profit merchants by consciously and deliberately undermining the spending power and the community security of Australians. The result will be, as it has been since the Fraser Government took office, the lowering of living standards. Members of the Financial Counsellors Association of Australia have testified to the incredible financial, social and psychological pressures imposed on families by rising interest rates. One counsellor in the outer-eastern Melbourne suburb of Dandenong has told how three of every four families dealt with have credit of over $20,000 excluding the home. Only 18 months ago the figure was around $10,000. I wonder whether there is any honourable senator opposite who would be prepared to swap places with one of those families? Forty years ago, Menzies founded the Liberal Party on his appeal to the so-called 'forgotten people'-the Australian middle class. Key to it was the legendary importance in Australian life of owning one's own home. Today the Liberals have betrayed their heritage. If Menzies were alive today, I am sure he would be amazed to find that his party no longer shares his understanding of the Australian dream of home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> High interest rates have slashed lending for home construction. This Budget will further increase home costs. I have a horrible feeling that this Government, sheltered in the cloisters of Canberra and easy prey to ideological cranks, just does not know what impact the interest rate explosion is having on the community. The mirage of a resource-led economic boom has blinded it to the impossible situation of Australians locked into credit repayments. The Federal Government's sabotaging of the housing industry does not end just with rising interest rates and sales tax on building materials. The Housing Industry Association has attacked the Federal Government over the Budget. One of its representatives, Mr Bill Kirkby Jones, has said that the housing sector is being asked to bear an unfair share of monetary restraint. He goes on to say that the Government refuses to heed industry advice and is unwilling to restore home ownership opportunities. The Victorian Minister for Local Government, Mr Lieberman, has joined the critics of the Commonwealth Government. He says the Commonwealth can easily afford to offer assistance to young families-that it would not break the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet by far the most dramatic criticism has come from the Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Kennett. This has come as quite a shock to those who follow Victorian politics as Mr Kennett has always been regarded as one of the troglodytes of the Victorian Liberal Party; an arch conservative who has shown very little compassion over the years for the underprivileged. Quite clearly, being given the portfolio of Housing and actually having to see what welfare housing is all about has sparked some sort of sense of social conscience in this rebel Liberal. I refer this explanation for his conversion and discount those rather unkind people who say that he is just trying to save a discredited State Government. Mr Kennett has pointed out that it is an absolute disgace that the Federal Government has cut Budget allocations for housing from $285m in 1980-81 to $250m this financial year. He has further pointed out that, as far as Victoria is concerned, there is a $7m loss. Whilst we might be getting $58m, at the same time we are repaying the Commonwealth Government $65m for previous housing loans. In other words, the Commonwealth is making $7m in excess of what it is paying out this year. This led to the situation in which Mr Kennett made the following rather startling statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, instead of investing in homes that provide security and satisfactory living conditions, are more willing to let families be destroyed and then pay the cost. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that bears repeating. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, instead of investing in homes that provide security and satisfactory living conditions, are more willing to let families be destroyed and then pay the cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kennett telexed Senator Harradine and the Australian Democrats asking for the Senate to do something about the situation. Honourable senators will note that he has not telexed the Labor Party, as he quite rightly assumes that the Labor Party is concerned about housing and that its policies naturally are for increased expenditure in this area. He has not wasted the cost of a telex on us as he is so certain of our support. Mr Kennett finds it hard to understand the Government's inhumane attitude to housing. I would, of course, suggest to Mr Kennett that the Government should reduce the amount of stamp duty on home purchases in his own State. He might also combine with the Federal Government, as I earlier indicated, to do something about the interest payments that many people in Melbourne's suburbs are finding very difficult to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole housing area raises one of the greatest dilemmas in Australian politics today, and that is the constant buck-passing between Federal and State governments. The Federal Government says, quite often, that this is a State matter, whilst at the same time not supplying enough money for the States to pay for this area. In turn, the States continually bleat about the Commonwealth not providing enough money and not accepting responsibilities in these sorts of areas. This constant buck-passing between Federal and State governments is quite often a cynical political exercise in which one or the other can drum up some political support. We had the situation where the Premier of Victoria, who was previously Treasurer, last year sent out Christmas cards complaining about the inequity of Victoria's share of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one can come to only one of two conclusions about this matter. Either the Federal Government, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and the Treasurer are completely mean individuals, totally unfair to Victoria and secretly supporters of the State Labor Party or the Victorian representatives who come to Premiers Conferences are simply poor negotiators; people who cannot get a fair share for Victoria. I really do wonder what the community is going to think in the next State election, when the Federal Liberals come down to campaign for their State colleagues. After all the aggro, after all the criticism of the Federal Government from the State Government, no doubt they will join ranks just for a pitiful five or six weeks and then go back to their normal buck-passing exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that has seen Federal-State antagonism has been the matter of health. Australia has lurched into its fifth new health scheme like some punch drunk fighter. Since Medibank was introduced by Labor several years ago, every counter move in this field by the Liberal-National Country Party Government has been directed towards the lowering of community health standards. Since the conservatives grabbed power in 1975, Commonwealth health outlays have decreased by over 20 per cent in real terms. In fact, in this Budget, Commonwealth health funding itself has dropped by over 20 per cent. Certainly, allocation has been made for payments to the States, and overall there has been a 10 per cent increase in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has presented an unjustifiable bonus to private insurance funds. It has forced medical and hospital benefits into the ideological strait-jacket of the 'user pays' philosophy. It has failed to meet the responsibilities of a government in the twentieth century. The facts are as follows: Most families are being compelled to pay from $9 to $11 a week as the result of the health insurance changes; State governments have been forced to impose the means test on their public hospital services; charges have been increased for standard ward accommodation; and charges have been introduced for medical services and outpatients. In contrast, the Australian Labor Party is proud of its commitment to a universal health insurance scheme. Under the Liberals, basic medical and hospital cover is hitting the average family for $10 a week-$500 a year. When Labor introduced the original Medibank, this basic insurance was provided for the entire community as a right in a civilised country. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the latest Gallup Poll in the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial of 2 September 56 per cent of Victorians oppose the health insurance changes introduced by this Government. Forty-two per cent believed that the private funds did not provide value for money. Yet the Liberals are forcing families to pay a new tax to the tune of $1,200m a year not to the Government but direct to the private insurance funds. A quarter of the community previously covered by public health is now dipping into its pocket to build up private insurance empires. There is no thought given to the relative capacity of each family or individual to pay. Taking consideration of that capacity is the central plank of Labor's health platform. Health services financed through taxation or Medibank contributions are graded on overall capacity to pay. Health insurance hits everyone the same. In other words, those most in need are hit hardest. This is not the Labor Party's concept of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Pious claims of small government do not work when we are talking about the health of the community. Even with 20 per cent of the people entitled to health care cards through their disadvantaged or pensioner status, the bureaucracy just does not work. On the first day of the new scheme, almost one million Victorians were without proper health care. There are 200,000 Victorian families eligible for free health care but only 6,000 cards, covering 25,000 people, had been issued prior to the operation of the new scheme. Tens of thousands of Victorians are still ignorant of their free health status or are unable because of their situation, to handle the bureaucracy and prove their rights. We are back to square one, perhaps even worse than the pre-Medibank arrangements, when less than a third of those entitled to government assistance actually got what was their right. Just as bad is the arbitrary definition of the 'disadvantaged'. The Government has refused to implement any sort of progressive scale; it prefers the hard and fast cut off point, regardless of the injustices that it inevitably involves. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more we are leaning towards the American health system, if only for the satisfaction of the Government's libertarian pretensions. Yet no one could argue that the United States is a desirable model in the health field when 9.5 per cent of the American gross domestic product is spent on health, largely through the sort of funds that we are seeing emerge in Australia. This compares with 6 per cent of the British national product devoted to its national health scheme. It is impossible to believe, presuming that one is rational, that the average American is 50 per cent better off in health services. Even if one has to queue under a national health service, one gets efficient treatment when it is needed. There is no incentive, as there will be with fee for service insurance, for unnecessary or excessive treatment or surgery. Because doctors are in a position to boost health services to their own advantage, the cost of health care will rise and keep on rising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Health Minister, Mr MacKellar, has said that people who found it hard to pay health insurance should give up smoking and going to the TAB. The only joy left to these poor souls will come every three years when they trudge off to the polling booth and vote against the MacKellars of this world. No Government has treated its own enterprises with such contempt as this one. To destroy an efficient government organisation to satisfy some nebulous political philosophy will be to the disadvantage of all Australians. The belief that people in the Public Service are non-productive and that prosperity will only be generated by private enterprise is totally false. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of the Coburg Clothing Factory and the Bendigo Ordnance Factory at bargain prices to ideological cronies will do nothing for the Australian economy. One of the most blatant examples of the Government's mistreatment of its own enterprises is that of Australia Post. We all know that the Australia Post Courier Service ceased operating on 30 June 1981. Here we had an efficient service, profitably run, by no means a monopoly, providing fair competition for private firms. Apparently, the Government does not want to impinge on the profits of its supporters. We will see over the next few years the running down of Australia Post and Telecom; the most profitable areas will be sold off and the non-profitable ones retained. No private firm would want to undertake mail deliveries to remote areas. Australia Post will therefore have to be subsidised from Consolidated Revenue, or differential rates applied to country areas. I hope the National Country Party realises the implication of the Governments destruction of our postal services. It is proposed, in a time of high unemployment, to use private contractors as much as possible, expecially in the area of mail cartage. Some 1,100 jobs could be lost in the Australia Post area. Of course, no one would be sacked, just redeployed to areas that they do find suitable and in due course, it is hoped that they would resign. The reduction in staff and increased mail volume implies a productivity increase in the order of 7 per cent to 10 per cent in one year. The staff ceiling of 31,064 people is totally unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is considering the following steps if current services are to be maintained: firstly, greater use of part time and casual staff; secondly, the closure of post offices for lunch just when the rest of working people want to use them; thirdly, a rationalisation of postmen's delivery rounds, whatever that means; fourthly, amalgamation of Telegram delivery services; and finally, withdrawal of lightly used street posting boxes. These are all under consideration by the Postal Commission at the moment. The more the Government runs down postal services the more the general public will complain and the more easily the Government will be able to sell off the more profitable areas in Australia Post. The treatment of Australia Post is just one example of the way the Government treats its own enterprises. Similar measures will occur with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Trans Australia Airlines and other vital Government instrumentalities. The Government should recognise that we are a mixed economy, that there is no private enterprise Camelot and that vital community services cannot be measured by profitability alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The clearest example of the Australian Government's abrogation of responsibility to the States is in the field of education. It is in this particular area that State Budgets really feel the strain, with well over 40 per cent of their expenditure going to education. We have at the moment a situation where it appears that the deliberate policy of the Government is to favour non-government schools. When one looks at the figures for 1982, the general recurrent expenditure on government schools stays fixed at $269m whereas capital expenditure is reduced from $131.1m to $124.7m. Now to have a cut in capital of 5 per cent is bad enough. When it is taken over a period since 1976 it can be seen there has been a 36 per cent cut in the capital program for government schools. For non-government schools in this particular year, the general recurrent grants have increased by 11 per cent. Next year, 1982, will be the first year that the non-government school program will absorb more funds than the government school program. </PARA>
<PARA> Having taught in the government school system, and having visited many schools, it becomes apparent that education in government schools is being adversely affected by the lack of funds. Many of Victoria's high schools are of what is called light temporary construction, built 15, 20 or 30 years ago. Most of them were only supposed to last from between 15 and 25 years. The expenditure by the Victorian Government on cyclical maintenance has been reduced over the years not only in money terms but also real terms. If one tours throughout rural Victoria, or in metropolitan areas, one finds that schools are physically falling apart. Many of the schools are forced to use their school council funds on long term maintenance-something that was never meant to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has always taken the attitude that education funding should be on the basis of need. The Government directs funds to non-government schools, whether they need the money or not. It is my contention that a government must look after its own schools, must raise them to a standard where no one would necessarily want to send their child to a private school. It is all very well to argue for freedom of choice in education but if the Commonwealth Government is going to reduce government schools to the level of slums, naturally people will take their children away to private schools. One must congratulate the Government on the occasion of this Budget insofar as it was not leaked in advance. What does trouble me is the degree of objectivity used in framing the Budget. Has this particular Government responded to the interests of its own supporters when framing it? On 27 August 1981, the following excerpt from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald clearly exposed the point I am trying to make. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, has been warned by major manufacturing interests who are vital Liberal Party donors that their funds will be withdrawn if the Federal Government cuts tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> One Liberal Party source told the Herald that the interests involved were six figure donors to the Party and come from the backbone of the Party's financial base. </PARA>
<PARA>A simple solution to any Government's being blackmailed by its financial backers-I am not suggesting this one is-would be to introduce public funding. There is no provision in this Budget for public funding. I have heard Government members argue that public funding is a waste of taxpayers' money and could be spent better in other areas. This Budget contains many areas that would serve as examples of waste of the taxpayer's money. None more so than the $342,000 being allocated to de-register the Builders Labourers Federation. Since I first pondered on this matter the allocation has grown to $670,000. But even worse is the $5.4m devoted to the Industrial Relations Bureau-a total waste of money on a white elephant that just has not worked. If we are to have honesty in politics I think it is essential that some form of public funding of political parties takes place. In the last election the Liberal and National Country Parties outspent their opponents at a rate of about four to one. The unequal disposition of resources contributed to an unprincipled advertising campaign aimed at deceiving and duping the electorate. Public funding would stop all political parties from being involved in illegal activities as far as fund raising goes. There is not a political party in Australia which at some stage has not been involved in an illegal event in raising money be it a raffle or anything else. It would no longer be necessary for a New South Wales Liberal leader to have to raise money through illegal gambling nights with the equipment supplied by, let us say, undesirable elements. I think that public funding of elections will come, in spite of opposition from the Government. I think it is inevitable. Mr President, you have allowed me a rather free range on the Australian Capital Territory Acts. In conclusion I would like to congratulate you on your assuming office and on behalf of the new honourable senators thank you for the courtesy and help you have given us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take advantage of this first reading debate on the Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Amendment Bill 1981, which is a money Bill, to make a number of points on matters which concern me. But before doing so, I extend my congratulations to all those honourable senators on both sides of the House who have made their first contribution in this place. I think all senators concerned did well in the thoughtful contribution they made. Clearly the Senate will be a much better place in view of the calibre of those honourable senators who have made their maiden speeches in this place over the last 24 hours. I congratulate every one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters I want to refer to fairly briefly are matters on which I consider there has been considerable neglect on the part of the Government in its obligation to respond to questions that are raised in this place from time to time. It is not often that I speak on a money Bill. But I am aware of the fact that on numerous occasions honourable senators on both sides, and particularly on the Opposition side, have raised in first reading debates on money Bills matters which they consider to be of some consequence or importance and which do require, I believe, a response from the government of the day. Otherwise it seems to me there is no point in senators utilising the opportunity that is available in a first reading debate on a money Bill to raise matters which in their opinion are of some importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to three instances over which I believe the Government has been neglectful and has in fact demonstrated a degree of contempt for the contributions that have been made by senators. Initially I refer to a contribution which has been the subject of some debate in the Senate, that is, the contribution that was made by Senator Primmer on 7 March 1978. Whilst it is true that the Government has taken certain steps now to set in train a royal commission to inquire into this matter, the fact is that it has taken the Government three and a half years to act. It will be four and a half years since the matter was first raised before we will be in a position to act on the statements which were made by Senator Primmer. Detailed as they were and general as they were as well, they did point the finger at what clearly was a very irresponsible attitude in the meat export industry. After all, Senator Primmer did say that over a period a number of meat works, some of which have Commonwealth registration to slaughter for export and others which do not have this registration, had been processing meat for export which had not been inspected by Commonwealth meat inspectors. He also referred to an official complaint that had been made the preceding year in 1976-77 by the Romanian Government which was purchasing beef from us. Senator Primmer also referred to a number of companies which he believed may have been involved in this illegal practice. He at least cast sufficient doubt about this matter to warrant investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it incomprehensible that the Commonwealth Police, the then Minister for Primary Industry or responsible Ministers in this House failed to seek to have any explanation from or discussions with Senator Primmer. The consequences have been very grave for the meat export industry of Australia. There were no follow ups. There were no attempts to establish whether any evidence was available from Senator Primmer, whether the evidence that he had could be made available or whether there should be an investigation. His contribution was completely and utterly ignored. Therefore, I think the Government has to accept some censure because of the fact that it failed to respond to what has now been proved to have been fair warning-several years' warning-of the magnitude of the problem. It obviously will have severe repercussions not only in respect of our exports to the United States but also in respect of our exports to Japan and other European countries. Australia's trading reputation has been seriously damaged by the failure of the Government to respond to the allegations. I think it is an indefensible position that the Government did not see fit to delegate any officer from the Department of Primary Industry, the Commonwealth Police, the Department of Administrative Services or the responsible Ministers concerned in this place to establish the veracity or otherwise of the statements that Senator Primmer had made. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that during the debate on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation similar allegations were made by honourable senators about a number of incidents which they considered to have been breaches of proper conduct by members of ASIO. Again neither the then Attorney-General nor any other member of the Government sought to confirm or deny the allegations. They were just passed over and no action flowed from the Government. I just want to remind the Senate of a third instance in which I believe the Government has been neglectful. On 11 June 1981 I raised in this place a number of serious allegations that had been made to me in respect of a ballot conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office in respect of a trade union election. I made the assertion that in one particular post office 380 ballot papers precisely were stolen and in the presence of one or two candidates those ballot papers were then opened and filled in by the candidates themselves. The persons responsible for the conduct of the ballot, the persons to whom the ballot papers should have been delivered, did not receive them. They were not aware of the fact that there was even to be a ballot. As a consequence, as I indicated in my speech, that interference was sufficient to decide the ballot at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I also drew the attention of the Senate to other irregularities that had taken place in respect of postal ballots involving that union. Again, nobody from the Commonwealth Electoral Office, the Commonwealth Police, the Department of Administrative Services or the Attorney-General's Department sought to have any discussions with me about these matters. I have now been informed that in respect of that ballot other irregularities have been discovered. It is true that they are allegations, but I just wonder what is the use of honourable senators consciously drawing the attention of the Senate to these matters if in fact no action follows. We are treated in a way which I find is very unsatisfactory. It is disdainful that we should be put in a position in which, having raised these matters, we have to tell our constituents who ask what has happened about the points that have been made that the Government does not care because the Government has not responded in any shape or form. I think I am entitled to bring these matters to the attention of Ministers. I suggest, when senators do take advantage of opportunities on first readings to raise matters which they consider to be of importance, the matters should at least proceed past the point of just putting them on the Senate record. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to draw to the attention of the Senate is the dispute that is taking place at the moment in the Australian Taxation Office and the apparent failure of the Government and the section of the Treasury that is responsible for the Taxation Office to resolve the current dispute. I think it is a matter of some importance to the Government. It certainly is a matter of considerable importance to taxpayers. Certainly it is a matter of some importance to the employees-they are members of the Federated Clerks Union-who work in the section of the office involved in the dispute and who have seen fit, because of the cutbacks arising from the decision of the razor gang to reduce staff in this section which collects revenue and dissects taxpayers returns, to agree to a go slow resolution, to the placing of an overtime ban and to a work to regulations campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not seen fit to resolve this matter to the satisfaction of the employees and certainly not, I am sure, to the satisfaction of the Parliament itself. This industrial action is unprecedented and has been taken by the union only as a last resort. It concerns a loss of jobs in the Australian Taxation Office. I do not want to canvass the matter of the razor gang cuts that have been made across the board by the Government. The views of the Opposition on that score have been clearly expressed. We disagree philosophically with the Government's policy in that regard. But surely the Government should consider the consequences of its action in this area of activity-the collection of taxation revenue and its dispersal over a wide range throughout the Commonwealth, to the State Governments and so on. The unions state that the Government's action will affect drastically the collection of tax and will affect equally drastically the professed decision of the Government to stamp out tax evasion. This dispute should not remain unresolved. The Government's decision to cut back on the Public Service should not apply to this section of it, which surely ought not to suffer any reduction in staff whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> The union officials concerned met the Treasurer (Mr Howard) back in July to discuss the matter, so the dispute has gone on now for a little more than 2 1/2 months. The unions protested the staff reductions and presented the Treasurer with a petition signed by all of the staff, but it took him five weeks even to respond to it. I do not wish to be too critical of him in that regard because I assume that at the time he was heavily involved in the preparation of the Budget, but I point out that one of the important aspects of the Budget is the collection of revenue. That delay occurred and even when the Treasurer did respond the union considered his answer to be unsatisfactory. Absolutely no positive assurances were given concerning the question of staff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The point made to the Treasurer by the union representatives-people who are our employees, who are charged with guarding our interests and collecting revenue for the Commonwealth-was that the staff cuts would result in the loss of many millions of dollars in tax revenue. Naturally, as ordinary wage and salary earners, they felt that the failure to overcome tax evasion, which is such a characteristic of the tax system of this country would mean that ultimately they would be called upon to pay a higher rate of taxation. In short they believe that the shortage of staff will prevent the enforcement of the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The union is not one that normally resorts to industrial action. It puts into effect what has often been said to be the policy of this Government. A postal ballot of the members of the section was held and decided overwhelmingly to take industrial action because of their opposition to staff cuts in the Australian Taxation Office which pose a threat to their future job security. They will have less staff available to do the work. I believe that is important because the payment of refunds to millions of taxpayers will be affected by the go-slow and other industrial action that is taking place in the Taxation Office. The morale of union members is at a low ebb because, as a result of these staff shortages, they are unable properly to carry out their job. As the president of the union, Mr Paul Tregillis, said: 'You really have to question how serious the present Government is about enforcing the taxation laws'. Although the Treasurer claims to be cracking down on tax avoidance, he is reducing the very staff which deals with outright tax evasion. Mr Tregillis makes the comment that it is a little like a Government claiming that it intends to get tough on law and order and then, as a first step, reducing the numbers of the police force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In May 1980, my colleague Senator Chaney, who was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, described the Bill that we are debating today-the Western Australian Aboriginals (Right to Electoral Enrolment) Bill-as 'a totally unsatisfactory approach to the very serious problem which I agree exists, namely, ensuring that Aboriginals freely and fairly exercise their right to vote.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I endorse the remarks of my colleague. The Bill is still a totally unsatisfactory approach to a serious problem. The Fraser Government is concerned to ensure that Aboriginals can exercise freely their right to vote. We are concerned that no Australian should be disadvantaged in getting his name on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party and this Liberal Party Government believe in free, fair and regularly held elections. We believe that all who are entitled to vote, all who are entitled to enrol, should be able so to do. The Government administers an Electoral Act that embodies those principles. The ideal of enrolment which is espoused in this Bill is one with which we agree. We have made an election commitment to change the voluntary electoral enrolment for Aboriginals under the Commonwealth Electoral Act and to make it compulsory. We have done so after consulting, and obtaining the agreement of, the National Aboriginal Conference; so, in terms of the ideal espoused, I do not think there is much argument. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is the issue on which this Bill is based? Western Australian legislation currently requires that enrolment cards for new voters be witnessed by either an electoral officer, a justice of the peace, a Clerk of the Court or a police officer. I believe that is the crux of the problem. I do not deny that this requirement may be somewhat restrictive and therefore inconvenient, but it is also inconvenient to electors generally in remote areas. It is not an inconvenience which is limited to Aboriginals. I do not deny that Aboriginal people, particularly those in remote areas, may be reluctant to approach, or may be intimidated by, persons eligible to witness enrolment cards. I am aware that these categories of witness may not easily readily be available in remote areas, yet the remedies proposed are for Aboriginals only, not for all who might potentially be disadvantaged by the conditions set out by Senator Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that is before us is no solution to the difficulties that I have mentioned. The Bill is ill-considered. It is fraught with constitutional and practical difficulties. What is more, its operation is likely to result in inconsistencies and anomalies, many of which will bring confusion and hardship to the very Aboriginals it is designed to protect. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I deal with these problems in detail I question the urgency which Senator Walsh says attaches to this matter. The Bill deals only with Western Australia but no elections are due in that State for another two years. Senator Walsh said that he hoped the Bill would become an Act by the end of this year and he has chosen to bring this matter on for debate now when many other matters, including Budget legislation, are before the Parliament. One might ask: What is the urgency? Why is there a need to press such an ill-considered Bill now? I observed that more than a year ago-in fact, in May of last year-my colleague Senator Chaney informed the Senate that he had received not a single complaint that any Aboriginal had been unable to obtain enrolment in Western Australia. That was after the last Western Australian election. That was after Senator Chaney had drawn attention in the media to the fact that he would be keen to hear whether any Aboriginal had been disadvantaged by not getting access to an appropriate witness. </PARA>
<PARA> I have yet to receive one representation from or on behalf of Aboriginal people in Western Australia giving details of anyone who has been unable to get enrolled. There has not been one example, not one complaint, not one instance of a disability which requires relief. There is, as yet, no issue. No disadvantage has accrued to anyone. No one has been deprived of his or her right to vote. There is no issue. There is only a set of rules in relation to witnessing with which Senator Walsh does not agree and which many people may choose to criticise. I understand that these rules and the Act in Western Australia were introduced after an appropriate judicial inquiry. To justify intervention there should be at the very least a real, an immediate, a burning or an important issue. Here there is none. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole host of undesirable elements of the Bill which is before the Senate today, not the least of which is the way it goes against the nature of our Federal system, a system based upon a Constitution with a sharing of responsibilities. Western Australia is only one State among six. The Government believes we should encourage each of the States to do those things which are theirs to do under the Constitution. Commonwealth intervention before there is an issue-that is the centralists' paradigm-should be a last resort. It should be done only in special circumstances. Interference certainly should not be resorted to, as it is being proposed here, when we have as yet no evidence of disadvantage to a single Aboriginal Western Australian. I find it both totally unnecessary and highly undesirable that we should attempt to confer a Commonwealth franchise on Western Australians for State electoral purposes irrespective of that State's franchise requirements, both present and future, and especially where we cannot say that there has been for any Aboriginal a complaint that he or she has not been able to enrol where he or she wishes so to do. I also find it undesirable that the Bill should seek to impose Commonwealth duties on State electoral officials. This is not something which the Commonwealth does and it is not something which the Commonwealth has done unless it has been with the consent of the State concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious administrative difficulties are associated with this Bill. They give rise to doubts as to whether the Bill could be put into effect. They give rise to doubts as to whether the Bill could really be of any assistance to Aboriginals. There are many provisions which would confuse rather than assist Aboriginals in Western Australia. I give some examples: Firstly, the definition of 'Aboriginal' in clause 3 of the Bill does not in express terms include Torres Strait Islanders. What an oversight. Surely Senator Walsh knows that quite a few islander people live in his own State. Perhaps that is just an example of sloppy drafting. Secondly, there are differences in the definition of 'Aboriginal' in the Bill and the State Electoral Act, which might mean that the benefit sought to be conferred by the Bill--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hello! We have someone sitting in someone else's seat in the Senate. The benefits sought to be conferred by the Bill may not extend to all who are Aboriginals within the meaning of the State Electoral Act. This could lead to confusion in the minds of persons who have always regarded themselves as Aboriginals under the State Act and who may suddenly find that they do not have rights under the Commonwealth Bill. One would have thought that the definitions could have been brought into line, one with the other. Thirdly, a person seeking to take advantage of the Bill would need to establish that he satisfied the requirements of the definition of 'Aboriginal'. A simple assertion of fact that he was an Aboriginal would not be sufficient. He or she may be required to bring expert evidence to establish his or her rights in terms of the definition which has been put down in this Bill by Senator Walsh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fourthly, the present Commonwealth and State eligibility laws are basically the same, so far as they are relevant. There is one exception-that is, that the State law has a requirement of three months continuous residence in the State, which is not a prerequisite for Commonwealth enrolment. The enactment of a Commonwealth law would mean that an Aboriginal could secure State enrolment without satisfying additional State residence requirements. That would be conferring an additional right upon Aboriginals which is not a necessary part of overcoming the problem to which Senator Walsh has referred. Fifthly-this last example could often work against Aboriginals-if Western Australia were to change the voting qualifications in some way, for example, to lower the voting age to under 18 years, the Bill as it is proposed would not have effect on Aboriginals because those Aboriginals under 18 years who might otherwise qualify under a West Australian law would not be able to go on the roll because they would not qualify under Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further difficulties. In addition to proving that someone comes within the definition of Aboriginal within clause 3 of the Bill, there is also the need to establish that the person concerned was on the Commonwealth roll. This in itself may not be as simple as it sounds. In some cases where difficulties arise the proof required may not be readily available to Aboriginals with literacy problems, those in remote areas-the very people whom this Bill seeks to protect-those who are itinerant or those whose names may be spelt in different ways. If we can have no assurance that these problems will be overcome, then really the Bill requires more work done. Further problems would exist if an Aboriginal's name appears on the printed electoral roll but not on what is called the official roll. </PARA>
<PARA> I find clause 7 of the Bill particularly unsatisfactory. Clause 7 prevents the State from checking or verifying the accuracy or the validity of Commonwealth enrolments. Yet Commonwealth enrolments are to be used as a critical factor in allowing people to go on the State roll. Whereas Commonwealth enrolment can be challenged under and in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act if it is not accurate, this Bill would leave no scope for such challenge when it comes to conferring a Commonwealth franchise for State purposes. So we could challenge a person in relation to his right to vote in a Commonwealth election but we could not challenge that same person on his right to vote in a State election. This is as unfair as it is unnecessary. There is no guarantee that it would work to the advantage of Aboriginals; it could work to their disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> These are but a few of the practical difficulties associated with the Bill. They demonstrate that the benefits of the Bill may be totally illusory. But of as great, or even greater, significance is the doubt as to whether the Commonwealth is competent to pass such legislation. It appears that there are major obstacles in the way of Commonwealth legislation giving Aboriginals voting entitlements in any State elections. The only relevant Commonwealth constitutional head of power under which it may legislate on the matter is section 51 (xxvi). This section empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be no other head of power which is relevant to what is being sought in this Bill. I put it to honourable senators and especially to my friends in the Australian Democrats, who have told us that they will listen to the debate before making up their minds, that this is a very significant matter. The only head of power is the Aboriginal head of power. So, this legislation could well be challenged as being properly characterised as a law in respect of State electoral requirements rather than a law in respect of 'any race for whom it is deemed to be necessary to make special laws'. If this were the case, the law would then be considered as beyond the competence of the Commonwealth and, accordingly, invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the very real possibility that the validity of any such Act might be challenged on the ground that it would be a law telling a State instrumentality what to do. It is directed against a State instrumentality; it seeks to alter provisions relating to elections for the Parliament of the State of Western Australia. To draw an analogy, in the past a Commonwealth law conditionally forbidding private banks conducting business for a State government was held to be invalid, for the same reason I have set out. It attempted to tell a State instrumentality what to do. It was held to be invalid even though the Commonwealth had power under another placitum, of section 51 of the Constitution, to make laws in respect of banking. So, there is some doubt about the constitutionality of this Bill. These are matters which would almost certainly lead to legal disputation in which plausible arguments could be advanced, denying the Commonwealth legislative competence on this matter. Where would that leave the Aboriginal and Islander people of Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Government is concerned that no Australian should be disadvantaged in getting his or her name on the electoral roll. We are equally concerned to ensure that Aboriginals freely and fairly exercise their right to vote. In June 1979 the Government initiated the Aboriginal Electoral Education Program, under the auspices of the Australian Electoral Office. This program is directed at Aboriginals in remote and rural areas of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, in the belief that this kind of educational program will assist Aboriginals to understand and to use their rights to enrol and vote. Our commitments, including our election commitments, are quite clear and our concern that Aboriginals should not be disadvantaged in terms of their right to vote is quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than providing solutions, we believe this Bill opens up a whole host of difficulties. We believe it is unsatisfactory. Should circumstances arise with specific examples of disadvantage, specific examples of where Aboriginals have been denied the right to vote-I emphasise specific examples-we believe Western Australia would want to re-examine its legislation. Of course, we would be interested in specific examples. We, too, might then want to look at the matter again. But, at this point there has been no complaint. No one can claim that he or she has been disadvantaged. On that basis, we will not support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the private member's Bill introduced by my colleague, Senator Walsh from Western Australia, to provide State electoral roll enrolment rights for Western Australian Aboriginal people. I remind the Senate at the outset that the purpose of the Western Australian Aboriginals (Right to Electoral Enrolment) Bill is drafted to create a situation where citizens of Western Australia who are Aboriginals are not impeded in enrolling on the State electoral roll. The situation at present is that many Western Australians are so impeded. All States except Western Australia and Queensland have a common electoral roll; so we are specifically concerned with the impediments to enrolment placed in the way of Aboriginal citizens in Western Australia. The Bill does no more than guarantee that Aboriginals in Western Australia, when enrolling for State elections, will receive the same treatment under State electoral law as under Commonwealth law. It allows the State to continue to have its own electoral rolls and does not seek to interfere in the manner in which the State organises its own elections, other than to the extent noted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), in the plethora of spurious reasons he gave for finding himself unable to support this Bill, emphasised the fact that he had received no complaints from Aboriginal citizens of Western Australia regarding their ability to enrol on the State roll, and he pointed out that his predecessor, Senator Chaney, claimed he also had received no complaints. I find that a totally unconvincing reason for refusing to accept Senator Walsh's Bill. Are we to have in Australia government by neglect? Is negligence simply to take the place of proper action to ensure human rights? Surely it would occur to the Minister that if an Aboriginal person is impeded in enrolling on the State roll because of distance or because of not having the opportunity to find a justice of the peace or a policeman to witness the enrolment form, then that person might also be, for the same sorts of geographic and social reasons, impeded in the making of a complaint. If a person does not feel brave enough to face a Western Australian policeman to assert his or her right to enrol, surely the Minister will agree that it is highly likely that that person might also feel rather nervous about entering a complaint to an unsympathetic Federal Minister about his denial of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me rather distressing that a government which has, in only the last session of Parliament, established machinery for a Human Rights Commission in order to take some steps towards complying with its obligations under various international human rights treaties, should now say 'Well, we cannot interfere; if something is a matter for a State government then human rights are no longer relevant'. That is what I understood the Minister to be implying when he said that until he receives a complaint there is no case for Federal interference. What will this Human Rights Commission do if any complaint tgthat a person might have is to be dismissed on the grounds that it is something to do with being a citizen of a State rather than a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia? I would assume that being a citizen of any part of Australia should confer equal human rights on that citizen, and if we are to have human rights machinery which is to be taken seriously at all then that human rights machinery should not stop at the boundaries of any particular State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also attempted to hide behind a number of rather pedantic quarrels with the drafting of the legislation. In particular, he mentioned that the definition at one point did not include Torres Strait Islanders. It was perfectly open to the Minister and to his predecessor, Senator Chaney, to suggest drafting amendments to Senator Walsh. I am assured by Senator Walsh-I think he is on the record as saying this-that he approached Senator Chaney, sent him a draft of the Bill and said he was open to any drafting amendments of that kind that could be made. As honourable senators, particularly those representing the Australian Democrats, will know, private non-governing senators or members face enormous difficulties in the drawing up of private members' Bills. We do not have the legislative resources that are available to the Government. So, if some minor drafting errors which could easily have been corrected by suggestions by Senator Baume or his predecessor are the sum total of the Minister's objections to the Bill, he has put forward a pretty pathetic case. </PARA>
<PARA> I must comment also on some of the other objections the Minister has put forward. He seems to think that by providing automatic enrolment on State rolls, by virtue of a person being a Commonwealth enrollee, we are creating a situation which would somehow in the future restrict the rights of people to get on the State roll. This is the exact reverse of the intention of the Bill, and the exact reverse of the letter of the Bill. We are not saying that a right to Commonwealth enrolment shall be something that is less than a right to State enrolment; we are saying that by virtue of Commonwealth enrolment one's rights can be extended to State enrolment, so it is an extensive right that is being conferred and not a restrictive right. The Minister seems to have interpreted that provision in a quite contrary way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also suggested that there are grave doubts-at least, some doubts; I cannot really imagine that they are grave-about the constitutional powers of the Federal Government to act in the way that the Bill provides. I want to point out to honourable senators that some doubt about constitutional powers is, in itself, no excuse for inaction when an important issue of human rights is at stake. It has often been the case in the constitutional and legal history of this country that doubts about constitutional validity have not stopped Federal governments from acting, and those doubts have been resolved in the High Court of Australia. We have the High Court to resolve questions of doubt about the constitutional powers of Federal governments. The former Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, has said on a number of occasions that the existence of a doubt about constitutional powers is not a reason not to act, that the High Court is the proper place to resolve such doubts. I point out that the Whitlam Government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 was passed by the Senate at a time when the coalition parties had a majority in the Senate, and they did not challenge that Act. That Act uses Commonwealth powers in precisely the same way as Senator Walsh's Bill would use them, so this sudden nervousness about constitutional doubt seems to have been introduced and invented for the purpose of obstructing this very sensible piece of legislation which Senator Walsh has presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the Court Government in Western Australia passed amendments to the Western Australian Electoral Act in 1979 which require all enrolment cards to be signed before an electoral officer, a justice of the peace, a clerk of the court, or a policeman. Previously, an enrolment application could be witnessed by an elector, as is the case with the Commonwealth Act, as is the case throughout the rest of Australia. The amendments also make it an offence to persuade a person to apply for a postal vote. The Minister in his opening remarks did admit that these provisions could provide difficulties. He did not deny that difficulties had been so created. Indeed, with regard to the amendment making it an offence to persuade a person to apply for a postal vote, this provision has already been used against community workers who allegedly assisted in obtaining postal votes for the Western Australian State election in February 1980. However, the case, which was against Steven Hawke and four others, was dismissed, with costs awarded against the Western Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1979 amendments have worked. In the last year the gap between Federal and State enrolments has grown rapidly. At 31 March this year there were 42,117 more electors on the Commonwealth roll than on the State roll. That, it seems to me, is a rather large number of potential complainants for the Minister to dismiss in the way he attempted to do. Of those 42,000-odd people, there is little doubt that a large number of them would be Aboriginals. Indeed, some of them might be migrants and other people whose rights also have to be addressed in this matter. However, at this stage we are specifically concerned with Aboriginal voters. I do not think that that gap of over 42,000 electors is something that the Minister should attempt to dismiss. It is a significant number of people who must in some way be affected by the discriminatory provisions of the Western Australian Electoral Act, and I think that those 42,117 people are entitled to the protection that Senator Walsh's Bill will give them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are attempting to remove these impediments and to ensure that there is universal franchise in Western Australia for State and Commonwealth elections. We expect the support of the entire Senate in this matter. I remind honourable senators that on 6 June 1979 the following urgency motion was moved in the Senate, supported by the Government, and carried without dissent:</PARA>
<PARA> That Aborigines should have the same opportunities to enrol and vote in State elections as in Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA>That motion was passed by the Senate in 1979 without dissent. I think it is a matter of shame for the Senate that the Federal Government has failed to act on this motion of the Senate, hence Senator Walsh's private member's Bill. It is unacceptable that a government which has special constitutional responsibility for its Aboriginal citizens and which is a party to the ratification of the United Nations Convention on all forms of racial discrimination should tolerate discriminatory State laws. Unfortunately, this is yet another area where the Fraser Government's failure to act stems not from inadequate constitutional or legal powers, not from lack of a mandate, but simply from its concern to avoid any conflict with its State governing coalition partners in Western Australia. I assert that the Liberal Government in Western Australia has implemented this blatant attempt to keep Aboriginal people off the State roll because it knows that its policies are unacceptable to Aboriginal people, to its Aboriginal citizens, and it is not prepared to pay the political price of those unacceptable policies. The Australian Labor Party and, I trust, the Australian Democrats want to see the enfranchisement of Aboriginal people in Western Australia because we believe that it is only through the ballot box that Aboriginal citizens of Western Australia will be able to change those policies which are unacceptable to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Western Australian Government to ensure justice for Aboriginal people is a matter of record. I refer to the report to the Parliament in 1980 by Mr Grassby, the Commissioner for Community Relations. This report documented discrimination against Aboriginal people through the legal system, by police, in employment, housing, hotel services, the media, health services and education. An entire chapter of the report was devoted to the discriminatory practices of the Western Australian and Queensland governments. Further documentation of the sorts of policies that Aboriginal people have to put up with when they are disenfranchised appears in the report of the World Council of Churches. I have that report here and I have a number of examples marked, but out of respect to other honourable senators who wish to contribute to this debate I will not read them at this time. Suffice it to say that there is documentary evidence-evidence which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, has not attempted to deny, to give credit where it is due-that in the State of Western Australia a number of discriminatory policies are implemented by the Western Australian Government, which policies Aboriginal people have no chance of changing if they are not on the roll and cannot vote. It is as basic as that. </PARA>
<PARA> My own investigations into the Kimberley area of Western Australia left me in no doubt that policies with regard to employment, provision of essential services such as sealed airstrips, roads, and health services, and of State laws to protect Aboriginal land and sacred sites from the depredations of mining companies are totally inadequate. I expect that my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Ruth Coleman, will be saying more on that point. There is no doubt in my mind that the policies of the Western Australian Government in regard to Aboriginals, as I saw them in train in the Kimberley region, are totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the specific purpose of this Bill is to ensure that those on the Commonwealth roll can also vote in State elections, we are not complacent, I must point out, about access to the Commonwealth roll by Western Australian Aboriginals, particularly those living in remote areas. The Federal Government, in particular the two relevant Ministers, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, and his colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, and the Commonwealth Electoral Office have been totally unco-operative with my attempts and the attempts of my Western Australian colleagues to ensure that Aboriginal citizens can in reality exercise their constitutional right to enrol on the Commonwealth roll. I have urged the Government to ensure that Commonwealth electoral enrolment forms and electoral information be provided at polling booths during the forthcoming election for the National Aboriginal Conference. Over $700,000 will be spent next month to ensure that all adult Australian Aboriginals have access to a Commonwealth electoral office polling booth for the National Aboriginal Conference election. For almost no extra cost, voting enrolment forms could be provided, but the Government has chosen to say that providing enrolment forms would constitute a violation of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That claim, of course, is rubbish, and at this point I wish to quote an opinion to that effect from the law and government research section of the Parliament. The opinion states:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the words of section 158 (aa), the supplying of enrolment forms and electoral information per se, would not amount to threatening, offering or suggesting violence, injury, punishment, damage, loss or disadvantage in order to induce an enrolment or a promise of enrolment, or a refraining from enrolment. </PARA>
<PARA> The view that providing electoral information and forms would interfere with an Aborigine's right to choose whether or not to enrol can be contrasted with the view expressed by Isaacs J. quoted above. </PARA>
<PARA>The view expressed by Mr Justice Isaacs states:</PARA>
<PARA> Without limiting the effect of the general words in the preceding section, 'undue influence' includes every interference or attempted interference with the free exercise of the franchise of any voter or with the free exercise by an Aboriginal native of Australia of his choice whether or not to enrol as an elector . . . </PARA>
<PARA> One part of having a choice to do something necessarily would entail the opportunity to do that thing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the point I have made to the Minister, but the Minister chooses to be impervious to it. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If a person is uninformed, unaware and has information actively concealed from him or her, then it may result that the person forms a political judgement different than that which she or he would have formed. To take the matter to its logical conclusion, complete lack of information . . . would result in a choice not being able to be made at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Depending on the nature of the information, which is a question of fact, the supplying of information would not usually constitute an 'interference' or attempted interference of an Aborigine's free exercise of choice whether or not to enrol as an elector. A Court may also have difficulty in finding the supply of electoral forms is such an interference. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it would. I have also approached the Western Australian State Electoral Office asking it to provide the opportunity for Aboriginals to enrol on the Western Australian State roll for the National Aboriginal Conference elections. Of course, the Electoral Officer has refused. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I say this: The purpose of the Bill is simple and clear. It is to ensure that there are no discriminatory impediments to the enrolment by Aboriginal citizens on the Western Australian State roll. The purpose of this Bill has already been endorsed by the Senate. Our international obligations under various binding treaties require that this discrimination be removed. The only possible reason the Government could bring forward for rejecting the Bill is a shameful one. It is its reluctance to come into conflict with the Government of Western Australia. That reason is not good enough. I hope the Government will not try to sustain this reason. I urge all honourable senators to support Senator Walsh's Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Naturally I support the Western Australian Aboriginals (Right to Electoral Enrolment) Bill 1981 introduced by my colleague Senator Walsh some weeks ago. I say immediately that the only intention of this Bill is to ensure that Aborigines have the same right as all other Australians who reside in Western Australia. Senator Ryan, in speaking on this Bill, made the point that already we have found a discrepancy between the State and the Federal electoral rolls of something like 42,117 people. Some of those people would be Aboriginals. I am disturbed to find that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has not received any complaints-nor, apparently, did his predecessor-about people who wanted to exercise their right to vote at the 1977 and 1980 elections not being able so to do because their names were not on the roll.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Their names were removed from the roll by the State Government in a number of nefarious ways. Inspectors were sent to various camp sites where it was known that the community was not in residence at the time. Finding the people not in residence, the inspectors left their little printed cards saying 'Your name will be removed from the electoral roll' which, to many people, meant very little. Their names were, in fact, removed from the electoral roll. We now find a situation in Western Australia in which directives by Ministers are disadvantaging Aboriginals. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs says in this place that he has no evidence of any disadvantaging of any Aboriginal in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the Minister a number of examples. One incident of which the Minister should have been aware occurred during his recent visit to the Kimberley region undertaken in, I think, early June. The Minister and I had the opportunity of seeing a disadvantaged group of Aboriginal people living under a directive from the Western Australian Government. I took the opportunity to see those people. The Minister did not. I refer to those Aboriginal people who left the Nicholson Downs station because of maltreatment by the white owner-manager and who were camped on the edge of Halls Creek with one canvas fly between 35 and 40 people, no fresh water except that which was provided in a 44-gallon drum each day by the shire and no other form of shelter. I chose to go and see them. I chose to take some action on the matter. I found it extremely difficult to do so because of a directive issued by the Western Australian State Minister for Community Welfare which said that there were to be no dealings between the Department and those communities represented by the Kimberley Land Council. It was a shameful act on the part of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs not to see those people and not to take some action to ensure that facilities were made available so that their health standards did not fall. That was just an indication of the disadvantaging of the Aboriginal people who reside in Western Australia. The Western Australian Government has shown its contempt for all voters' rights with the gerrymandered system which operates in that State. It has also amply demonstrated its contempt for the Aboriginal people by virtue of the various directives which have been undertaken by its Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to accept that some of the 42,117 people-the figure cited by Senator Ryan a short time ago-are, in actual fact, Aboriginals. We have to accept that some of them live in fairly remote areas. We have to accept that some of them do not, for three or 12 consecutive months of the year, reside under the same tree, in the same tent or in the same humpy. We have to accept that that is the lifestyle of the Aboriginals and they are entitled to that lifestyle. But we have to accept also that if they want to exercise their vote they have a right and a responsibility so to do. The Minister said a little while ago that the Federal Government is now moving from voluntary to compulsory voting for Aboriginals. That will be a great step forward. It will be part and parcel of the integration of white and black. It will be part of an acceptance by the Commonwealth Government that Aboriginal people have a right and a responsibility to vote and the majority of them want to accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also spoke of illiterates. I do not believe we can ever accept the premise that because a person is illiterate or under educated he has no right to an opinion or, in actual fact, has no opinion. He may not be able to read and write but that does not mean that he cannot think. A larger number of Aboriginal people in Australia-and it is a very shameful thing to admit-are under educated and illiterate. It is not their fault that they are illiterate. It is the fault of many governments, both State and Federal, that there are such large numbers of illiterates. Being illiterate does not mean that they are incapable of thinking. It does not mean they are incapable of voting. It should not be an impediement to their ability to cast a vote. We have already been through an exercise in--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister did not make it quite clear enough. I hope that I have now clarified the situation not only for the Hansard record but also for the Minister and the people who may be interested in what I have had to say about this matter. I have said that the Western Australian Government is particularly unconcerned about the democratic rights of Aboriginal people, particularly when it comes to their exercising the right to vote. The Government's most recent demonstration of that fact lies in the amendments to the Electoral Act which have now made it virtually impossible for people who are not accustomed to bureaucracy to be able to get their application forms witnessed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some three or four years ago I spoke in this chamber about a situation which was occurring in the town of Fitzroy Crossing. I do not intend to go over that situation again. However, I intend to raise the point that Aboriginal people in that township were subjected to a certain amount of harassment and cruelty by a member of the police force. I could not imagine any Aboriginal amongst the nine communities resident at Fitzroy Crossing being prepared to go to a police officer to get him to witness his application form just so that he could exercise his right to vote. I think the Minister would have to agree that that is the bureaucratic wall which I am talking about and which will be seen by a large number of Aboriginal people. They will now not be able to vote and will not be able to have their name placed on the Western Australian State roll because they cannot bring themselves to approach this wall of bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The criterion for registration is to have the form authorised or witnessed by one of four people, one of whom I have mentioned-a police officer. Another person is a justice of the peace. We do not have justices of the peace living on the corner of every street in every small town in Western Australia. The Minister would be aware of that. He would know that there are very few justices of the peace in the Kimberley region, for instance. Similarly, how often would an Aboriginal come into contact with a clerk of the courts unless he perhaps appeared before the clerk of the courts? If he did, would the Minister anticipate that at a later stage that person would have enough confidence in that same clerk of the courts to go back to that court and ask the clerk to witness his signature so that he could, in actual fact, have his name placed on the electoral roll? I cannot see that happening and I think the Minister would have to agree that it would not. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the boundaries in a number of the seats in Western Australia are a further indication of the West Australian State Government's absolute contempt for the Aboriginal people. It has done this under special legislation and changed the boundaries to ensure that the one Aboriginal person who represents all the Aboriginal people in the West Australian Legislative Assembly will remain there. It has made his seat so secure that Mr Ernie Bridge will remain a member of the Legislative Assembly for the Kimberleys for the rest of his life. The West Australian Government has broadened the area to such an extent that almost every Aboriginal community in the Kimberleys is now contained in his seat. At the same time it has concentrated the surrounding seats, which are incidentially held by members of the Liberal Party, into small areas on the assumption that it has made them safe for the Liberal Party. Where it has got this information from, I do not know; but, if there is a small number of voters, one has to disenfranchise or disenchant only a few of those voters to lose one's seat. Perhaps the Liberal Government in Western Australia will find at the next election that it has created a situation where the member for the seat below the Kimberley region will lose his seat because there are so few electors who are prepared to put up with the absolute contempt that is being demonstrated by the legislation being introduced by the Western Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Walsh has already made it quite clear in this place that the West Australian Act about which we are concerned, the Electoral Amendment Act, imposes conditions for enrolment designed to intimidate Aboriginals. I hope that proceeded to demonstrate to the Senate, that these Aboriginal people who live in a tribal situation in a community area, who are isolated from the mainstream of the communities, are already feeling intimidated. They have little contact with that wall of bureaucracy and they are not going to go out and actively search for it in an endeavour to get their names on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 an inquiry, headed by Mr Justice Kay, was held in Western Australia. His report pointed out what we already know about electoral enrolments, that is, that very few white people understand the electoral system. It is therefore more difficult for Aboriginal people to understand it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the duty of the authorized witnesses to ensure that the claimant knows what he or she is doing. Authorized witnesses should, therefore, be persons who have a reasonable knowledge of the provisions of the Act which relate to enrolment and voting. </PARA>
<PARA>If everybody understood the Electoral Act and if everybody understood how to vote, there would not be the need to see every single political party so strongly represented outside polling booths handing out how-to-vote cards on election day to ensure that the majority of votes were valid ones. But we all do it because we are aware that we already have a complicated electoral system which is very difficult for even educated people to understand. It makes it very much more difficult for those people the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and I have referred to, that is, those illiterate and under-educated people in our community. No other group in Western Australia is so clearly discriminated against by paternal government legislation which not only makes it particularly difficult for Aborigines to enrol, but also, I think it is fair to say, makes it virtually impossible for them to enrol. This paternal attitude towards the Aborigines that 'we really do not want you to have the right to vote because you may then become a political force' is an attitude which has been adopted many times. It is not a good attitude to adopt towards any disadvantaged group in our community. We tend to think of the majority of Aborigines as being illiterate people, but both I and the Minister know a large number of Aboriginal people who are highly educated but who still do not understand our electoral process. The passage of this Bill will not mean that every Aborigine is going to exercise the right to vote. It will simply mean that we are providing them with the opportunity to exercise that right if they so wish. The Minister said earlier that we would be departing from normal procedure; but Western Australia and Queensland are the only States that do not already have dual rolls. I cannot understand why the Government is obviously not going to support this Bill and why, at the same time as the Minister is professing concern for the Aboriginal people, he is not going out of his way to ensure that those people who are at present being impeded from casting their votes or who are being precluded from registering on the State electoral roll, receive the support of the Liberal Party in this chamber. I hope that there will be a number of free thinking people on the Government side who will see this Bill as being absolutely essential to ensure that no discrimination exists against any people living in the State of Western Australia. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be speaking while you are in the chair, Madam Acting Deputy President. Your presence certainly adds dignity to this chamber. The Bill that we are discussing-the Western Australian Aboriginals (Right to Electoral Enrolment) Bill 1981-is a private member's Bill introduced by Senator Walsh. It is a Bill for an Act to ensure that Aboriginal electors of the Commonwealth in Western Australia are not prevented from enrolling for an election for the Western Australian Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his reply to the second reading speech, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) did not cavil at the principle that Aboriginal voters should be encouraged as much as possible to enrol, not only on Commonwealth rolls but also on State rolls. I believe there is a unanimity of view, at least in relation to the principle, but that the methods by which it can be obtained are being disputed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to look at the legislation and not to discuss so much that principle that we all agree upon. It is aimed at giving the Aboriginal voters the same right to enrol on State electoral rolls as they have to enrol on Commonwealth rolls in Western Australia. I believe that that principle would also be generally accepted in this chamber. Western Australia's 33,000 Aboriginals do not have to be on the rolls but, under the State Electoral Act, if they are, they must vote. I believe that the circumstances leading up to the drafting of this Bill are fairly broadly understood. It is possible for the Australian Democrats to say, without appearing biased, that the particular amendments introduced into Western Australia were deliberately designed to lower the Australian Labor Party vote in the north of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> If one has knowledge of the Kimberley area I think it is probably fair to say that amongst Aboriginal voters there is probably a greater tendency to vote for the Australian Labor Party than for the Liberal Party or for the National Country Party. That suggests that the Liberal Government of Sir Charles Court sees the changes that it introduced as political changes aimed directly at the black vote. In saying that, I believe that we should be very clear that since foundation we have had manipulation of electoral rolls, manipulation of electoral boundaries and manipulation of weighted electoral boundaries in Australia. We are now heading towards our second century and still in this country we have blatant examples of the manipulation of the democratic process. It will probably not be until a referendum which enshrines basic democratic principles is carried in this country that we will not continue to see-and see well into the future-attempts by State and Federal governments to manipulate boundaries or to use other means to gain political advantage for themselves. However, I believe that the Minister does not support that principle. Having had many discussions with him and having listened to his various speeches here and elsewhere, I do not believe that he does support any manipulation which has occurred by Sir Charles Court. Nevertheless, I believe that his defence of the Government's action in not supporting this Bill is based on a number of grounds which are not strong ones. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a point about this Bill which I think is extremely important. Although this point has been brought up by other speakers, I think it should be reiterated. The Electoral Act of Western Australia provides that where a claimant's name does not appear on any roll the enrolment card shall be signed by:</PARA>
<PARA> (I) an Electoral Officer;</PARA>
<PARA> (II) a Justice of the Peace</PARA>
<PARA> (III) a clerk of courts; or</PARA>
<PARA> (IV) a Police officer; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in any other case, an elector, or a person qualified to be enrolled as an elector, of the Commonwealth Parliament or of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this provision is aimed specifically at those people not on the electoral rolls. If we ask ourselves about that it becomes fairly obvious that to draw a distinction between those who are not on electoral rolls and those who are is probably in the case of Western Australia and every other State of Australia to be biased against Aboriginal voters as they are not obliged to have their names recorded on any rolls. Consequently, one would assume that a higher percentage of Aboriginal voters would fall into category A than category B. I believe that at no time was that differentiation promoted, established or argued for in the debates that took place in the Western Australian Parliament. If there is a differentiation, I believe that we need to put a very strong argument for any differentiation between those two categories of voters. If there is not, I believe it is fair for us to look for one. I believe that that, given the events which led to these changes in the Western Australian Electoral Act, must disadvantage the black voter in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all very much aware-apart from Western Australian senators, as a Queensland senator I am probably more aware than most-that Aboriginals have an extremely uneasy relationship both with the courts and with the police. It is unlikely that they would be willing to approach them either to have an enrolment card witnessed or to gain access to something which is relatively uncomplicated. That that is a fact says nothing necessarily about Aboriginal voters as distinct from white voters, except that when we look at the statistics in relation to convictions in Western Australia we can see very clearly the predominance of the law bearing down so much more vigorously on Aboriginals than it does on whites. The fact that that uneasy relationship exists is a cultural element, but it is also an element of the way in which justice is administered in that State. This being the case, I believe we need to look further at what types of irregularities might occur by putting those two categories into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important elements which has not been raised so far in this debate is that of the normal laundering operations that go on in electoral offices. If one dwells on that one will again notice how in Western Australia and indeed in Queensland white Australians are advantaged over black Australians. For example, white Australians are much more likely to receive and to reply to the normal letters which are sent out if they fail to vote in referendums, elections or whatever. Aboriginals who live in remote areas are less likely to receive such notices for reasons which were raised by Senator Coleman. If they do receive the notices they are less likely to return them. Another factor arises from the voluntary nature of enrolment. A white voter is compelled to ensure that his name in on the rolls. Established procedures exist to ensure that the names of white voters who are not on the rolls are picked up and returned to the rolls if indeed they should be there. On the other hand, Aboriginal voters are not compelled to be on the rolls and if their names are removed there are no procedures to have them reinstated. Therefore, the onus rests solely on the Aboriginal to check and constantly check that his name is on the rolls. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said that in fact no cases of discrimination had occurred to date. That is impossible to tell. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be the case that an Aboriginal voter's name has been removed from the rolls and that that Aboriginal voter is unaware that his name has been removed from the rolls. There is no procedure to ensure that the Aboriginal's name is reinstated on the rolls. Unless an Aboriginal voter wishes to check, and check constantly, whether his name is on the rolls, when he comes to cast his vote against or for the Government at the next election he will suddenly discover that he is not enrolled. As we heard before, he will probably then remain unenrolled for the reason that to have his name reinstated he would need to go back before a justice of the peace, a clerk of the courts or a police officer. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that some of the other points raised by the Minister have substance. However, I do not think they bear crucially on this Bill. The first point relates to the definition of 'Aboriginal' in the Bill itself. The Bill defines 'Aboriginal' as a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia. The interpretation in section 5 of the Western Australian Act, which would be the crucial one in a dispute raised by the Minister, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The principal Act is amended-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) as to section 4-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) by inserting immediately before the interpretation 'absent voter' an interpretation as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 'Aboriginal' means a person who is an Aboriginal within the meaning of that expression as defined by section four of the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Act, 1972;</PARA>
<PARA>Section 4 of the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act of 1972 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise-</PARA>
<PARA> 'Aboriginal' means pertaining to the original inhabitants of Australia and to their descendants. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that both of these definitions could be fair game for lawyers. Nevertheless, I doubt whether any court in fact would find that there was a difference between 'Aboriginal' meaning a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia and 'Aboriginal' meaning pertaining to the original inhabitants of Australia and to their descendants. So I do not believe that would cause very much concern. </PARA>
<PARA> An issue which causes the Australian Democrats some concern is the issue of State rights. We believe very strongly that there is a useful element within our federation in respect of the tension that exists between State and Federal governments. We believe that that tension is a creative tension within our federation and should not be done away with or harmed in any way unless such action is absolutely necessary. However, I believe in this regard that perhaps the Minister speaks for himself and not necessarily for the Government. We have already had in the last couple of weeks of the Budget session some very interesting examples in this place of the Government having very few scruples in directing State governments to do or perform certain activities in areas which are their constitutional responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I refer to one area-education. Fairly obviously in this area the Federal Government has had representations from every State Government, not only privately to the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), but also publicly in the media to the effect that they do not wish their role in relation to the spending of education funds to be at the whim of the Federal Minister for Education. They do not wish to be bound to certain policy judgments that the Federal Government may make in that regard, in which case I believe that while the Government has shown no scruples, the Minister-he may very well have shown scruples in relation to the States-may be speaking for himself and not the Government. While we accept in substance the principle of the objection of the Minister to the Bill, we do not believe it bears on the Western Australian Aboriginals (Right to Electoral Enrolment) Bill because we believe there is a good and proper reason for interfering in the operations of the State Government of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major argument that the Minister brought forward I believe is an important one and pertains to Federal powers. Senator Ryan raised a number of issues in this regard. Basically, I believe the points she suggested are correct. I believe that we should ask ourselves in regard to every piece of legislation that comes into this chamber: 'Is it constitutional?' That is a proper type of question to be asked. Therefore, I believe the Minister is quite correct in raising that matter in debate. I believe it is a point to which we should give due consideration. However, I think that we can do no more in this regard than pay attention to the changes the people of Australia have made in recent times in handing quite deliberately to the Commonwealth powers in relation to Aboriginal people. Having regard to that referendum and to those very strongly held propositions of the people of Australia, I think that the Commonwealth Government ought to involve itself heavily in the affairs of the Aboriginal people and their welfare. This Bill does no more than attach itself to that popular democratic voice. </PARA>
<PARA> In the flux of time we may discover that the High Court in its wisdom, or otherwise, has decided that this is not constitutional. Indeed, its judgments from time to time have seemed rather odd to laymen. Those judgments as to the constitutionality of this proposed Act or any other Act are for the High Court alone to determine within its powers under the Constitution. I believe that Parliament can do no more than act in good faith so that the Bills it passes are within its powers to legislate on. If this is the stance of the Parliament I believe that Parliament has acted rightly and correctly and can do no more. I do not believe there is an obligation on this Parliament-certainly not on this chamber-to stay away from any Bills which may offend the Constitution. If that were the case, most of the path finding legislation that has passed through this House in the 80 years since Federation would never have been attempted. Such legislation was attempted, often in the face of great rivalry and conflicting legal opinion. I believe in this regard there is nothing more that the Senate can do other than to say it believes this Bill is constitutional and therefore ought to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will support this Bill in its passage through the House and we hope it will be presented to the House of Representatives as soon as it passes through this chamber. I hope that Liberal and National Country party senators, who we know have, as do the Australian Democrats, freedom to exercise a conscience vote on all these issues will accept and grasp that nettle. There are at least some honourable senators who will exercise that right. I believe some honourable senators who have exercised that conscience vote will be voting for this Bill. If that is the case, the Bill will go forward to the House of Representatives and I hope there it will be received with respect as the judgment of this chamber and given weighty consideration. </PARA>

It may have been possible to bring it on for debate in another way but I prefer that it be done in the way it has been done. I also thank the honourable senators who have spoken and the Australian Democrats for their indication of support for the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that Senator Baume presented a quite unconvincing apologia for what has become the typical Fraser Government refusal to take action in matters pertaining to Aborigines against reactionary governments in Western Australia and Queensland. Senator Baume cited Senator Chaney as having said in May 1980 that the Bill was unsatisfactory. That was a broad comment in respect to any technical defects which the Bill may have; we do not believe the Bill has any serious technical defects. Prior to the Bill being introduced in November 1979, I contacted Senator Chaney and invited him or his Department to submit any criticisms of a technical nature about the Bill or the way in which it was drafted either to me or to other members of the Australian Labor Party involved with it. I said we would be eager and anxious to discuss appropriate changes. No such approach was made by Senator Chaney. However, Senator Baume claims-like Senator Chaney earlier-that the Bill is unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. I will go through those reasons seriatim. Firstly, he criticised the definition of 'Aboriginal' under clause 3 of the Bill which states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Aboriginal' means a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>He said that was unsatisfactory. Actually, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 uses exactly the same description. If the clause is unsatisfactory, it is obviously something that was not apparent to Senator Baume and those other Liberal and National Country Party senators still here who voted for that Act in 1975. Nor, obviously, was it apparent to Government Ministers and their advisers when the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1966 was introduced and enacted by this Government and which contained exactly the same definition of 'Aboriginal'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also criticised the Bill on the ground that it excludes Islanders. There may be some validity in that point but I suggest that really is nitpicking. There are very few Torres Strait Islanders in Western Australia. Senator Baume conceded that the impediments to enrolment of Aboriginals under existing Western Australian law exist and incidentally, exist in no State but Western Australia, and the effect of those impediments is not limited to Aboriginals. That is true. However, we took the view that only in matters pertaining to Aborigines did the Commonwealth have the power to insist that the Government of Western Australia effectively cease to apply those impediments to the enrolment of Aborigines. However, if the Government is anxious to extend the purpose of this Bill so that it covers all Western Australians who might be disadvantaged by this impediment, I think I could guarantee, even at this early stage, that it would have the full support of the Australian Labor Party. One way to do that would be to hold a referendum for constitutional amendment to impose the Commonwealth roll as the roll for all of the States instead of just four of the States-as it is now-as the minimum entitlement for enrolment on a State roll. The Minister said that no complaints had been received about the impediments which he admitted were imposed by the Western Australian law. That opens up a number of possibilities. One possibility raises the question of why any Aborigine who had monitored the record of this Government with respect to Aboriginal rights in standing up to the State governments of Queensland and Western Australia would bother to complain to this Government? Another point made by Senator Ryan is that the people who are disadvantaged are unlikely to be the sort of people complaining to Federal Ministers anyway. I do know of one case in Wiluna prior to the last State election in which there was wholesale rejection on technical grounds of applications for enrolment. But most importantly of all, at the time the present State Electoral Act became operative at the end of 1979 the gap in Western Australia between the aggregate enrolment on the Commonwealth roll and the State roll was, in round numbers, 5,000 as it had been for several years previously. By March 1981-15 months later-that gap had grown to 40,000. So it is quite obvious that a great number of people in Western Australia have been deterred from being admitted to the State roll by this provision and a very high proportion of those people would be Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume said that the Bill is not urgent. I want to make two comments. The first is that it has been on the Senate Notice Paper for almost two years-ever since November 1979. It was introduced in my absence by Senator McIntosh. The second point is that Senator Baume says the Bill is not urgent because there will not be an election in Western Australia for 18 months. That is probably true. An election is not due in Western Australia for 18 months, but assuming the Government changes its mind as indicated by Senator Baume and allows this Bill to pass, we would also be concerned about the effective application of the legislation. I am advised that the most expedient way in which this Bill, if it became an Act, could be effectively applied would be for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to seek a court order to enforce Commonwealth law in Western Australia. I think, with the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack), that is highly unlikely. The alternative, more difficult and slower way would be for individual Aborigines to seek a court injunction requiring the State electoral officer of Western Australia to place on the roll as a matter of right any Aboriginal who was already on the Commonwealth roll. So although it is probably 18 months to an election, considerable time would be required for the effective application of this Bill should it become an Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume complained that with respect to clauses 6 and 7 there would be difficulty in determining who is on the Commonwealth roll for the purpose of establishing a right to be on the State roll of Western Australia if the Bill were passed. That may be so, but I observe that the problem is obviously not insurmountable since that is precisely the system which already applies in four States. Those four States-Western Australia and Queensland are excluded-use the Commonwealth roll as the basis for compiling the State roll. He also set up the man of straw with a superhypothetical suggestion that the Western Australian Act might be amended so that persons under 18 would be entitled to vote in Western Australia. The enrolment right established in this Bill in no way restricts the right of enrolment of the State Electoral Act to those who are enrolled on the Commonwealth roll. What it does is establish for Aborigines a right to demand that they be placed on the State roll irrespective of whether they have complied with the formal enrolment provisions. It does nothing to prevent any other person who may be entitled to be on the roll in the future in Western Australia from being so enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8, which Senator Baume criticised, is deliberately designed to prevent the Western Australian Government subsequently subverting this Bill should it become an Act, as the Western Australian Government would be quite capable of doing. He said that the Bill might be challenged in the courts on the grounds that it had more application to the Electoral Act of Western Australia than it did to Aborigines. That, of course, is possible. I note, however, that this Bill is derived from the same assumed head of power as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act of 1975. It uses precisely the same head of power that was enacted by this Parliament. It was supported by the then Opposition, Senator Baume included. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make just a couple of other comments. I was very pleased to note that Senator Macklin accurately identified the purpose of this Bill and also the purpose behind the amendments to the Western Australian Electoral Act of 1975. I thank the Australian Democrats for their support. I am very disappointed that the Government as a whole is not willing to vote for this Bill. The Democrats have indicated that they will vote for it. I sincerely hope that Senator Harradine will, and at the very least I hope Senator Bonner will see fit to place his allegiance to his race before his disciplinary obligations to the Liberal Party. If the Senate does not pass the Bill, that will constitute yet again failure to use Commonwealth power over recalcitrant States and further tarnish Australia's international reputation on race matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the Senate is of the opinion that 1981, being the International Year of Disabled Persons, would be an appropriate occasion for the Federal Government to monitor very carefully the way in which its $1,000 million contribution to Australian hospitals is expended in the care and treatment of disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the Senate notes that in 1979 a twenty three month old Down's Syndrome boy was admitted to a ''recognised hospital'' under Schedule B2 of the then Commonwealth-Western Australia hospital cost sharing agreement and that he died the following day in circumstances in which his parents and many other people believe that insufficient effort was made to preserve the child's life. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That the Senate is of the opinion that disabled persons who suffer from physical and mental handicaps and incur some additional form of illness require particular assistance and attention; and to this end the Senate recommends that the Minister for Health investigate existing practices in hospitals which are partially funded by the Commonwealth through the States and report to the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion which I have just moved is slightly different from the motion which was placed on the Notice Paper on 25 November 1980. The reasons for the slight amendments are as follows: The boy's age was 23 months and not three years. Secondly, I have placed the word 'then' before the words 'Commonwealth-Western Australia hospital cost sharing agreement' because the agreement was in existence when that incident occurred and was current when I placed the motion on the Notice Paper, but the agreement was replaced from 1 July of this year. Thirdly, the hospitals in the States still benefit from the Commonwealth funds but in all States except my own State of Tasmania and South Australia the funds are channelled through the States in the form of general purpose grants identified for health. Fourthly, I have deleted the reference to 'recognised hospitals' in paragraph (3) of the motion because, if I had left it in, it would have referred only to Tasmanian and South Australian hospitals, not those in all States which receive their funds through general purpose grants. The amended motion is really just to tidy up what has happened since it was put down in November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1980 a person who had previously raised this matter in the Federal Parliament-Senator Martyr-was not a member of the Senate. In November 1979, I think, he raised this matter in the House of Representatives. The matter concerns the death of a 23-month-old Down's syndrome child in the Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth. It is a story of tragedy. It is one which goes to the heart of the consciousness and conscience of the people of Australia. I refer to an appendage to the coroner's inquiry which was detailed in Perth on 13 November 1979. I refer to a letter from the foster mother of the baby, Christopher Derkacz. It was written the day after Christopher Derkacz died, which was 22 January 1979. I refer to this documentation because I feel the facts speak for themselves. I will rely not on any rhetoric that I can drum up but on hard factual information. This letter was written to the hospital on 23 January 1979, as I say, by the foster mother of Christopher Derkacz, the Down's syndrome child:</PARA>
<PARA> As you requested, I am writing this letter to confirm the phone conversation we had this afternoon regarding the events leading to the death of our fostered son, Christopher Derkacz. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly we would like to say that Christopher was a healthy child with no abnormalities except that he was a Downes Syndrome child. On Sunday the 21st of January Christopher was cutting an eye tooth and was rather grizzly. At around 7.00 p.m. Christopher started gasping for air. We rang the Emergency Service and a doctor arranged for him to be immediately admitted to hospital. The doctor thought he would be alright in the car and wouldn't require an ambulance. On the way to the hospital Christopher's breathing was laboured but he was not gasping. </PARA>
<PARA> On arrival at Princess Margaret Hospital the casualty doctor quickly examined Christopher and we took him straight to the intensive care unit where he was put in a steam tent. The casualty doctor called an anaesthetist and they discussed Christopher's treatment. The doctor came into the passage way with us and told us that Christopher had croup-which confirmed the emergency doctors diagnosis. He said that they would give Christopher an anaesthetic and examine his throat to see if it as epiglottitis or an inflammation of the tubes. He explained these two types of croup and told us that while they had Christopher under the anaesthetic they would insert tubes to help him breathe. He said that once the tubes were inserted the gasping for air would cease and Christopher's breathing would be eased. We were asked to wait in the waiting area and much later the casualty doctor came and spoke to us and told us that Christopher was in the safest place. He had to go back to casualty and a woman doctor was looking after Christopher. We could still hear Christopher gasping even though we were at least 25 metres from the intensive care unit. Later we couldn't hear him and the woman doctor told us that he was still breathing heavily but his condition had improved and he was sleeping. She told us that there was nothing we could do so we might as well go home. We asked the woman doctor whether the tubes had been inserted and she said ''no, we don't think it is necessary at this time''. We took this as a good sign and his breathing was still laboured but his colour was good. </PARA>
<PARA> We went to see Christopher before leaving and he seemed much better. They were monitoring his heartbeat and he had an intravenous drip in his arm. The sister told us that this was to give him fluids without waking him in the night. She said that what he needed mostly was plenty of rest and as we were leaving she said ''don't worry-he'll be alright''. My husband asked her how long they usually stay in intensive care and she answered that Christopher would probably be much better in the morning as these things usually clear up quickly once they were in the steam tent. She said that Christopher would probably go into the ward in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that in other evidence the foster mother stated that she and her husband arrived home some time after midnight, after having looked at their child. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> At 6.00 a.m. on Monday morning I rang intensive care and enquired about Christopher and was told that he was much the same as he had been the previous night. I said I'd ring back in a couple of hours. About 8.15 a.m. Dr ... rang and asked if I was Christopher's foster mother and had taken Christopher to hospital. I said yes and asked if Christopher was alright and he answered ''no he's not, he died''. My young son rang his father who came straight home. My twenty year old son David came home from work and we went to the hospital on the way picking up our daughter Jan. We saw Christopher in the chapel in the morgue in the company of two sisters from intensive care. The sisters took us back to a room and made us a cup of tea and I started crying and blaming myself for Christopher. One of the sisters went out to get some tranquilizers for me. The other sister said ''How do you think we feel having had to stand by and do nothing''. I said ''Why couldn't you do something to help him?'' and she replied ''because we were ordered by the doctor not to''. I asked her ''Who ordered you not to do anything to help Christopher? and she replied that Doctor had. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the name is here in full-</PARA>
<PARA>I asked her if she could have done something anyway and she said that they had done more than they were supposed to by turning him over to stimulate his breathing. She also said that ''we couldn't understand why we weren't allowed to help him-it was against everything we had been taught. They had tried to get other doctors to help him but they didn't want to get involved in Doctor W's case and the nurses said that they could only stand by and pat his hands and stroke his head and watch him die. She said ''Why did they bring him to us in the intensive care unit if they didn't intend to do the utmost to help him?'' I kept asking her why Christopher was allowed to die, was it because he was a Downes Syndrome baby and she said that that could have been the only reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The sister said ''Dr W's definitely not my favourite doctor-not by any means''. The sister didn't think that Christopher should have died. The other sister came back and heard a lot of this conversation. She didn't contribute much but she didn't deny anything. In fact she seemed to be backing up what the other sister said. </PARA>
<PARA> My husband, my daughter and myself called in at our doctor's surgery. He said that he would ring Dr G to complain about Christopher's treatment and he advised us to write a letter of complaint to Dr G. </PARA>
<PARA> Barbara, Christopher's real mother rang at about 5.00 p.m. and said that she had been told of Christopher's death. She asked if we would go with her to see Christopher. After she had seen him we went to casualty inquiring if the casualty doctor that we had seen on Sunday night was there but he had left an hour ago. The sister-in-charge saw how upset we were and took us to a room and got Doctor Byrne to speak to us. We told him the story and how we felt of Dr W's treatment of Christopher. He contacted the Deputy Director of the hospital, Dr Spence and they arranged a meeting at 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday with Dr W, Dr G and Dr Spence. As we thought, Doctor W did not turn up and we only saw Dr G. The meeting consisted of Christopher's mother, my husband and myself and Doctor G. The first thing he said was ''I believe you were told by staff that Chris had not been given full intensive treatment''. Doctor G said that he had spoken to the night staff and they denied having said anything to us. I told him that it was the day staff who had told us. He took notes and said that he would question them. </PARA>
<PARA>Other pieces of conversation then follow. The next relevant point states:</PARA>
<PARA> Doctor G kept harping on the fact that funds were limited for handicapped people and in his opinion things could only get worse as people weren't having large families and that there was an aging population. He said he could see that in about ten or fifteen years there would be too few young people in the world and to many old and handicapped and that he community wouldn't be able to afford to keep all these people. Dr G said that Christopher and others like him could be just a drain on the taxpayer, costing more to keep than a person on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to state that I am quite happy to table all of these documents so that honourable senators are able to see them. They are parts of the coroner's report. I now come to the finding of the coroner who investigated this case. He investigated the matter over a long period in 1979 and came down with a statement on 13 November 1979. The statement is only one page long, but I think it is of great significance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Upon inquiry I find that Christopher Derkacz died on 22 January at Princess Margaret Hospital Subiaco from acute necrotising laryngitis associated with bronchiolitis, cardiac failure, early pneomonia of right upper lobe of the lung. </PARA>
<PARA> At approximately 7 p.m. on 21 January 1979 the deceased aged 23 months experienced respiratory trouble and his foster mother caused a locum doctor to attend the child at her home and he recommended he be admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital and his foster mother did this. </PARA>
<PARA> The child also suffered from Downs Syndrome. On arrival at the hospital at approximately 9 p.m. the doctor at Casualty examined him and he was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and placed in a croupette. A drip inserted and he was placed on a monitor. The doctor caused the resident anaesthetist to attend and he in turn called the consultant anaesthetist who examined him. He remained in Intensive Care Unit. The mother stayed in the hospital until a little after 11 p.m. and when she left Dr Curnow was attending the child who was still in Intensive Care Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> At that stage there appeared little room for criticism of the child's treatment. However after that time other than the hospital records there is little evidence of his progression, treatment or what medical attention he required or received. It is however noted that Dr Curnow attended him again at 4.15 a.m. but the notes indicate she was not called again until death. The hospital records do contain however an alarming note:</PARA>
<PARA> ''No resus.''</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Martyr" NAMEID="WJ7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ7">Senator Martyr</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is 'no resuscitation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Martyr says, that stands for 'no resuscitation'. The finding continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>''(no E.C.M. no intubation)'' The child passed away at 8.05 a.m. 22 January 1979. The evidence suggests the child could have died quite suddenly. </PARA>
<PARA> Due principally to this lack of evidence I am unable to give a proper finding relating to the full circumstances of his death and therefore leave the finding open. </PARA>
<PARA>The finding is signed 'W. G. Wickens, S.M., City Coroner, 13 November 1979'. The coroner states that there was a lack of evidence. The reason for that alack of evidence is very simple. At the inquiry, two doctors and five nurses gave only their names, addresses and occupations and then stated:'I elect not to give any further evidence'. This event occurred in a recognised hospital for the purpose of funding under the then Schedule B2 of the Commonwealth-Western Australian hospital cost-sharing agreement. Furthermore, the coroner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The hospital records do contain, however an alarming note:</PARA>
<PARA> 'No resus. (no E.C.M. no intubation)'</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from the evidence that was adduced at the hearing that had there been intubation it would have prevented the death of the child from laryngo-tracheo bronchitis. For confirmation of that statement I turn to page 31 of the evidence. Dr Anthony William Frederick Stroud, when giving evidence, stated quite flatly:</PARA>
<PARA> I was in court when the cause of death was given of laryngo tracheo bronchitis. I think intubation would have prevented the death from that cause.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer also to the evidence given by the anaesthetist registrar at the Princess Margaret Hospital, which appears at page 33, in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I see this card on Christopher Derkacz 21.1.79. I do not recognise the hand writing of the bottom paragraph on this card. I assume it was done by the nurses in I.C.U. </PARA>
<PARA>However, as has been stated, there were two doctors and five nurses who refused to give evidence other than their names and addresses. The mother had stated that the child was a normally healthy child, apart from the Down's syndrome, of course. The mother in her evidence had indicated that she was quite happy to accept responsibility for the child and to look after the child throughout the whole of its life. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the question as to what really is the life span of a Down's syndrome child. A lot of interest has been generated in the community over the last week in relation to Down's syndrome children. Only last Monday night, I think, there was a program on Four Corners on the question of Down's syndrome children, and a daily program, the Mike Walsh Show, had a similar program today which showed the love and attention that is poured out by the parents, and mothers in particular, on these Down's syndrome children. It is necessary, however, for the whole of the community to be aware of the difficulties that people experience and the need not only to give support to the families of handicapped children but also to give special support in the health areas for which Commonwealth moneys, taxpayers' moneys, are specified. Evidence was given at the inquiry by Dr John Millar Napier Hilton, a forensic pathologist, on the life span of the Down's syndrome children. At page 8 of the evidence he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I have performed post mortem examinations on Down's syndrome patients who survive in an institution to the age of 56, and I would not pretend that is the oldest Down's syndrome patient. </PARA>
<PARA>So many of these people, citizens of Australia, do live to adulthood. Some of them, of course, do not. As to the question of croup, Dr John Millar Napier Hilton, the forensic pathologist, was asked at page 6:</PARA>
<PARA> Croup is not normally life threatening?</PARA>
<PARA>The doctor said:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be, the majority of normal children in this age can survive croup particularly if admitted to hospital and put in a croupette. </PARA>
<PARA>Continuing with the doctor's evidence, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Godfrey's report says that the last attack of fatal croup at P.M.H. was six years ago. You do not dispute that fact?</PARA>
<PARA>The doctor said. </PARA>
<PARA> No. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 11 he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Had intubation been performed, is it likely or even possible that this would have given essential time for antibiotics or other medications to take effect on the deceased?</PARA>
<PARA>The doctor said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible, yes. </PARA>
<PARA>The questioner asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you agree that had the deceased managed to survive this particular outbreak of croup and be discharged in apparent good health he may well have lived months or even years, notwithstanding the other abnormalities that were noted?</PARA>
<PARA>The doctor said:</PARA>
<PARA> He may have survived, days, weeks, months, perhaps years. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have a situation in which a 23-months old boy had croup. He was admitted to a hospital which was funded by the Commonwealth. It appears from the records that there was no resuscitation, no ECM, no intubation. From the evidence it would appear that had that occurred the boy's life could have been saved. It appears that a number of people need to answer a number of questions. However, my purpose in raising this matter tonight is not to put people on the spot but to see that the Commonwealth and this Parliament ensure that money which we appropriate now to go through the States to hospitals is used to save the lives of the patients. Patients must not be allowed to die just because some people consider that they are social problems, and I say that advisedly. One of the most frightening aspects of this matter is the hospital note, which says of Christopher Derkacz, the patient:</PARA>
<PARA> Downs' syndrome: Social</PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? Why would a person have put that word 'social' on the official hospital record? That is the question we must all ask ourselves. Of course, it is something that only the person who wrote it down knows. Only that person knows, but presumably that person will not tell. Is it because there is some opinion abroad that handicapped people are social problems and therefore do not deserve the treatment that is available to everyone else, let alone the special treatment that should be given to such people? I will quote from page 25 which concerns the notes on the hospital records. Dr George Clothier, the Pediatric Registrar at the Princess Margaret Hospital states:</PARA>
<PARA> As we have already heard in the court some of these children have a short life expectation and have problems which are associated with their conditions and makes their life not a normal one. And so the child is allowed to pass away. </PARA>
<PARA>I will table this evidence. I ask in fairness that those honourable senators who are obviously interested in this issue look right through the evidence and note the very telling words of the city coroner when he talked about the alarming note on the hospital record. Have we reached a situation where we allow persons who are social problems to die? Who will decide who is a social problem and who is not? I seem to recall that the national socialists were among those in Germany in the 1930s and the 1940s who had a similar point of view. It is not limited only to this case. Sir William Liley, the world famous New Zealand doctor who is a pioneer in the techniques of surgery upon the baby in the womb, drew attention to a New Zealand case in 1974 involving a Down's syndrome baby who had bowel obstruction. This could have been overcome by simple surgery but because the child was also mentally handicapped the child was allowed to starve to death as he could not be fed if the obstruction were not removed. On that occasion dying took 13 days. A registered nurse and mid-wife in Wananui, Anne Wham also commented:</PARA>
<PARA> I have personal knowledge of cases where infants have been put into cold rooms, given chloral (a sedative) and left. To preserve appearances the doctors may give instructions that the child be fed 'on demand' . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What demands can a handicapped infant make after a dose or two of chloral? In conclusion I will quote from a speech made by Professor Victor Rosenblum at the International Conference on Infanticide and the Handicapped Newborn held in Chicago in December 1980. Before I do I remind the Senate that we have a responsibility to ensure that the funds we distribute to hospitals throughout the States on taxpayers behalf are used for the purpose for which they were designed, and that is the preservation of life. We do have now a Human Rights Commission. I think the public should be aware that incidents such as that which occurred in the Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth on the night of 21 January 1979 and the morning of 22 January 1979 are of a type which could be referred to that Human Rights Commission. In conclusion I will quote Professor Rosenblum's words. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the defective newborn is left to die, something vital dies within us all-our sense of justice, our self-respect, our mission as human beings. When that child is left to die, we become idolators of the plastic, the cosmetic, the illusory and the elitist. When, on the other hand, we help that child to life, we affirm our capacity to love, our respect for human difference, our dedication to the democratic values of heterogeneity as instruments of creative achievement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always with a deep sense of sadness that I speak about this matter. Already I have asked one question on this matter since I have been in the Senate. When I was in the other place I spoke about this matter several times. It always produces in me a deep sense of sadness. I have to ask myself and I think the citizens of this country have to ask themselves why these things go on. They have not happened just by accident. In this country possibly for the last 12 or 15 years there has been growing what I call a cult of death. It seems that the medical profession-and I do not say all the medical profession but a sector of it-has become so profoundly insulated from pain, suffering and death that it sees no other way of solving, except by killing, the difficult problems of this life which abound. Tonight I begin my remarks on this matter in support of Senator Harradine by saying what I said in the House of Representatives on 15 November 1979. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned because I know that the massive abortion rate in this country has conditioned the Australian people to accept this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA>This sort of thing was just described by Senator Harradine. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether it is not true that Hitler has finally won, that he may have lost the war but won the philosophical battle. </PARA>
<PARA>We should remember that wars are fought not just for territory. They are fought for philosophical principles also. I would hate to think that this country would have this or any other similar sort of horror going on. I hope that the Government will do something about it. It is very difficult for the Federal Government to act in all of these circumstances. That is why it is so appropriate for Senator Harradine to mention these matters tonight. Now the Federal Government is in a position to monitor just where the taxpayers money is going, to see that the money is spent properly and carefully, to see that everybody who is admitted to a public hospital in receipt of Commonwealth funding is given the maximum care and attention and to make sure that doctors do not make decisions about life and death. Those of us who are believers state quite unequivocally that it is God who calls, it is God who creates life and it is God who takes us. The role of the doctor has changed almost magically in these last few years. I fear that some doctors have reached the stage of believing that, in fact, they are gods on earth. I think that some of the attitudes displayed in the case Senator Harradine has mentioned will give some truth to what I have said. </PARA>
<PARA> The doctor in charge of this case-I think he is now retired-at the Princess Margaret Hospital had to admit under oath that there was no evidence of any firm diagnosis of epilepsy, although on the boy's Princess Margaret Hospital record card he was described as having epileptic fits. During the inquest, counsel for Mrs Stresnik tried to get Dr Godfrey to admit that he had told Mrs Stresnik, the foster mother, that the boy was better off dead, that it was best that they did not give him treatment, et cetera. The doctor insisted that he did not recall the details of the long interview he had with the foster parents after the boy's death. However, he did think it possible that he had tried to comfort them by pointing out the problems the boy had had and would have had. He had found that that approach often helped other bereaved parents of Down's syndrome and handicapped children. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear indication of what I am talking about. Here are doctors dealing with a case that is not extreme, as I think all the evidence that Senator Harradine gave us tonight and the same evidence that I gave a year or so ago in the House of Representatives shows. All of that evidence indicates that this child was not an extremist or about to die. He was, in fact, left to die. My money and that of other senators deserves a better result than that because not only does our money keep these hospitals going but also it educates these doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> I am wondering about the sort of philosophy that abounds in medical schools these days. I have had one or two experiences of that philosophy. I have been invited to address medical schools and give them my particular view about the high rate of abortion and the dreadful scourge which it is in this society in which we live. The attitudes of mirth and disdain that I have encountered in medical schools that our taxes are paying for, I find utterly appalling. I do not mind being laughed at. It is not the first time it has happened and it will not be the last. I probably laugh more at myself than anybody else does. When we are invited to speak with some medical students about serious matters, they find themselves quite incapable of being serious because they appear to have no concept of the importance of the vocation that they have-the vocation of healing. Tonight, as Senator Harradine had pointed out, we have a clear case of what is going on in the medical profession. Ever since physicians began talking of the quality of life or of the desire to live as a criterion to determine who should live, they have been losing the confidence of their patients. Hints of euthanasia have introduced the element of doubt that the great first physician, Hippocrates, tried so hard to dispel. </PARA>
<PARA> I have enormous respect for most of the doctors I know, but there are some I have no respect for whatsoever because they are the ones I describe as the merchants of death. They will solve every single problem, whether it is the problem of Down's syndrome, which Senator Harradine spoke about tonight, whether it is the problem of extreme old age, or of course, whether it is that massive problem that causes me occasional sleepless nights, the enormous rate of abortion, which is accepted by apparently all of us in this country as not being a very great problem at all. I am sure that this enormously high rate of abortion, this contemplation of death that is so rampant in the community, must have an effect on the people whose jobs are basically to heal and to give us a concept of the importance of human life. This is why incidents like the death of young Christopher Derkacz occur; this death syndrome in this community has become so strong. I have never been a Jeremiah and I hope that I never will be, but we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of our civilisation in Australia. This sort of thing cannot go on and it certainly cannot go on without action by governments to stop it. I hope that everyone in the Senate realises that we are funding these things that are going on. We are actually paying people to kill their young. How long does a society last when this sort of thing is going on?</PARA>
<PARA> What are honourable senators prepared to do about it? The first thing I hope honourable senators will do is to support what Senator Harradine has done, but we have to go a long way to get ourselves straightened out. What sort of country worries about a bit of sales tax on pet meat and at least 60,000 to 80,000 abortions a year are carried out, and we are funding them. That just seems absurd to me-absolutely absurd. I have said before that the greatest problem that this country has at the moment is this problem right at the heart of our civilisation. We have to do something about it. But tonight I did not want to speak specifically on abortion. I felt compelled, as one who had originally raised this matter so long ago in the House of Representatives, that I had to support Senator Harradine, and I hope that the Senate also will support him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One cannot help but be concerned when one hears of the case which Senator Harradine brought up in the Senate tonight. From long experience, I would be very cautious of making firm judgments and too firm conclusions from what I have heard. I will certainly look at the evidence and the coroner's report which Senator Harradine has tabled tonight, so that I can judge the whole issue in detail. Let me say first of all that I firmly subscribe to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, which reads in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Disabled persons, whatever the origin, nature and seriousness of their handicaps and disabilities have the same fundamental rights as their fellow citizens of the same age, which implies first and foremost the right to enjoy a decent life as normal and full as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me secondly say that as a human being, as a doctor and, I suppose, as a socialist, the concept that any person should receive discriminatory treatment in a hospital or elsewhere, or that any person should be allowed to die because of his or her disablement or social status, is absolutely abhorrent to me. I believe that Senator Martyr-understandably, because of his deep and passionate feelings about this, to which I have no objection-has overstated his generalised criticism of doctors in the community by calling them merchants of death on the strength of one case which has been brought to our attention from one hospital in Western Australia. To say that that case, if it is as bad as it would seem to be from Senator Harradine's remarks, is indicative of the general practice of doctors in this community-and, let us face it, I am as critical of doctors as most people are in this place: In fact, my colleague Senator Walters, who is not here, is always criticising me for doctor bashing although sometimes they need defending-and that these sorts of things are going on in hospitals all over Australia all the time, which one could fairly imply from the remarks of Senator Martyr, is wrong, unfair and unjust. </PARA>
<PARA> I am as disturbed as anyone at the reported remarks of one doctor in this case, who is obviously allowing his philosophical, or even his political, views to interfere with his treatment of patients, as I was disurbed the other day to read of the gynaecologist in South Australia who, because of her disapproval of unmarried mothers or mothers who were separated from their husbands, felt that she could ignore her responsibilities as a doctor and not treat them. There are always exceptions in our community. There have always been, through the history of medicine, times when people have made bad judgments and allowed people to die under certain circumstances. There are, indeed, other situations in which sometimes it is best not to proceed rigorously unnecessarily and sometimes against the wish of the patient, which certainly did not apply in this case, with treatment to prolong life for a day, a week or some other period. It is not always black and white. There are sometimes grey areas. </PARA>
<PARA> When I saw the terms of the motion, not knowing the details of the case, I really wondered what we would achieve by passing it because there are certain things and certain questions which have not been answered by Senator Harradine and, particularly, Senator Martyr, who I understand has had a long interest in this case. It seems to me that the law of Western Australia, and I would have said before Senator Harradine gave us the evidence that the law of Western Australia is the law in most of the States, should be sufficient to cover such situations and to protect the rights of this boy and certainly the rights of his foster parents in any such decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I am at a bit of a loss to understand how people can refuse to give evidence at an inquest and how a coroner can bring down such a disturbing decision without some inquiry, some government action or some legal action following the outcry which obviously must have arisen in such circumstances. I say to Senator Harradine that I cannot imagine such a situation arising in our State of Tasmania. Therefore, I merely ask the question: Are there other facts and factors that we do not know about? It is inexplicable to me that a coroner can say: 'I cannot make a proper finding because people have elected not to give evidence', and nothing happens. It seems to me that at the very least the law in Western Australia-I would be interested to ascertain whether it applies in other States-is deficient in this regard. I believe that this Parliament or the Western Australian Parliament would be taking much more effective action if it could take some steps to make sure that in the event of this sort of occurrence people do not just walk away from an inquest by saying that they elect not to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only one concern about Senator Harradine's amended motion, and that is the part at the end of the motion that the Senate recommends that the Minister for Health investigate existing practices in hospitals which are partially funded by the Commonwealth through the States and report to the Federal Parliament. This is a very broad request. I assume that it refers to circumstances in respect of the treatment of disabled and handicapped people such as this unfortunate child who suffered from Down's syndrome. I assume that it refers to the rights of parents and foster parents in circumstances such as this. I assume also that it refers to the rights of doctors to make judgment of the type that seem to have been made in this case. Even if it refers only to that area, it involves a massive investigation. It involves not only an investigation but also a long term monitoring of the situation in hospitals. It also involves a situation in which the Commonwealth Government would be going in and making an investigation of this sort in hospitals which under law, I believe, are in fact regulated by State regulations and State laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly have no objection to the motion down to the word 'attention'. I do not suppose that I would worry much about the rest of the motion, except that I wonder about the practicality of it. I wonder about what we are going to achieve by doing this. Is the Minister for Health to send a team of workers on a long term continued investigation of what is going on in this area or is he just to send a few officers around to ask a few people in each hospital a few questions and get the same sort of answers that the coroner got and end up in the situation in which the coroner found himself when he really could not come to a reasonable decision? If this is what will happen we will have achieved nothing. Would it not be better to look at the state of the law which protects the patients and the parents? Would it not be better to spend the money that would be involved in an investigation of the sort suggested by Senator Harradine on developing skills and ensuring that in fact the positive aspects of hospital treatment were being carried out? Would it not be better to do this than to have an inquiry which would report to this Parliament in, I suggest, an inadequate way? I would be interested to hear what the representatives of the Government have to say about that. I will be interested to hear what Senator Harradine has to say in reply. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that the case that Senator Harradine has raised certainly disturbs me. That people, on the face of it, could take such action in such a case equally disturbs me. That there is even a suggestion that any patient in any hospital in this country is classified as socially less desirable or at a lower social level than anyone else and therefore receives treatment such as has been outlined certainly disturbs me. That a coroner at an inquest in this country can bring down a report in which he says: 'I cannot make a proper finding because I have not got enough evidence and the reason I have not got enough evidence is that people will not answer my questions' certainly should disturb everyone in this place. But what is absolutely inexplicable to me is that all of those circumstances can occur and yet apparently the case stops there. No action is taken after the coroner's critical decision. I understand from my colleague Senator Giles that there was considerable public outcry in Western Australia after that decision was given. I do not understand the position. I would like an explanation. I would like to think that we could do something more positive about the law in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is clearly motivated by a very deep concern on Senator Harradine's part about the continuing debate within the community concerning children born with recognised handicaps, their prognosis and the level of intervention undertaken by health professionals in providing care for them. I think we have all been very reflective in the Senate this evening about what has been said by the honourable senators who have spoken. I share with everyone who has listened intently to this discussion the feeling that that very precious quality of life was placed under some question by the incident that has been recalled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case referred to by Senator Harradine in his motion relates to the death in January 1979 in the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, of a 23-month-old child, Christopher Derkacz, who suffered from a respiratory complaint. The case aroused a considerable amount of public controversy and received widespread coverage in the media due to allegations that Christopher, who was a Down's syndrome child, had not been given full medical attention at the time. The incident was the subject of a number of representations to Government members and, as the matter was primarily one of concern for the Government of Western Australia, the Commonwealth had no authority to intrude into an issue of this nature. As we have heard, a coronial inquiry subsequently reported an open finding due to lack of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the comments of Senator Grimes and others with regard to that matter. It is recognised that such situations clearly have a tremendous impact on the parents of the child and on the health professionals involved and they raise deep moral issues for many people not directly affected by the particular case. The reaction of a parent to a situation in which a child might be seen to be needing health services and the response of the health professions in providing those services are issues which, if necessary, should be handled by law rather than through the administration of individual institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems of possible conflict between the rights of childen and parents and the uncertainty of medical practitioners and other health professionals as to their legal position in providing or withdrawing services in certain situations prompted recent examination of the questions by the National Health and Medical Research Council at its Eighty-Eighth meeting in October 1979. That Council recommended that the Australian Law Reform Commission be requested to review the existing legislation throughout Australia concerning all aspects of the provision of medical services to minors, with the view to recommending uniform legislation setting out circumstances in which such services may be supplied by medical and other health professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this touches on a point raised by Senator Grimes in that we would have to ask how the state of affairs described could exist in the treatment or lack of treatment that may be required by patients in hospitals or other institutions. Following referral initially to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, it was agreed that the Western Australian Law Reform Commission be nominated to examine the matter-that is, this matter the subject of our consideration tonight. I understand that liaison between the latter group and the National Health and Medical Research Council has been established and investigations into the several issues are proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that a particular action takes place in a recognised hospital as opposed to any other type of hospital is not really relevant to the appropriateness or otherwise of the care provided in a particular instance. However, the implication of the motion is that in a situation where the Commonwealth Government is cost sharing hospital services-I remind the Senate that this now only applies to the States of South Australia and Tasmania-as a provider of funds to the States the Commonwealth should accept responsibility in relation to the specific services provided within each of the States' health services. Without in any way seeking to detract from what might be behind Senator Harradine's motion, this would seem an unrealistic expectation. I share with Senator Grimes the concern that he expressed with regard to the very broad request that is involved in the motion before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes also touched on the constitutional position of the Commonwealth Government in regard to the hospitals which have the provision of State law for their administration. In fact, I really ought to say there is no basis upon which the Commonwealth could launch an investigation into professional medical practices in a State-run health service such as a public hospital. The States' historical and constitutional role in this area is clearly defined. Of course, the Commonwealth is concerned to see that the highest standards of professional responsibility are observed; the Commonwealth is concerned also to see areas of doubt and confusion over legal issues minimised. As I said, such matters were discussed by the Attorneys-General earlier following this case. However, I do not believe that a specific Commonwealth investigation into the internal administration of a State health service would now be appropriate. This is quite apart from the more basic issue of the Government's concern not to interfere with the day to day running of health services to which it contributes through general revenue grants. The purpose of moving to general purpose grants was to ensure that health service priorities and operations were fully accepted as the responsibility of the States; with the exception of those two States which are still being funded under the old arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has great sympathy for the motion moved by Senator Harradine. Because of the constitutional difficulties involved in it, I suggest an amendment to the motion. If Senator Harradine and the Senate wish to look at the amendment the Government would be happy to support we may, if Senator Harradine wishes to have a right of reply, deal with that amendment this evening. Judging by what Senator Grimes said on behalf of the Opposition, I feel he also may feel the Opposition would support this amendment. Perhaps the amendment can be circulated amongst honourable senators. If the Senate will bear with me, I will read the amendment. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Notes that in 1979 a twenty-three month old Down's Syndrome boy was admitted to a 'recognised hospital' under Schedule B2 of the then Commonwealth-Western Australia Hospital costs sharing agreement and that he died the following day in circumstances in which his parents and many other people believe that insufficient effort was made to preserve the child's life.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is of the opinion that-(A) being the international year of disabled persons it would be particularly appropriate for special attention to be devoted to the care and treatment of disabled persons; (B) disabled persons who suffer from physical and mental handicaps and incur some additional form of illness require particular assistance and attention. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that what is encompassed in the amendment is that we comprehend the concern of the Senate for the particular case and have noted the particular case brought forward. We have stressed that it would be particularly appropriate for special attention to be devoted to the care and treatment of disabled persons and that we believe that people who have physical and mental handicaps and who incur some additional form of illness require particular assistance and attention. I feel that is a very positive way in which to express the view of the Senate, not only in noting this particular instance but also in showing our opinion of the care and attention that is required. </PARA>
<PARA> I have moved the amendment in this form simply to overcome what would be very real difficulties in the constitutional position of the State hospital system for the Commonwealth to conduct the type of inquiry that may have been envisaged in the original motion. We have great sympathy for the motion. The way it has been debated in the Senate I think has provided a good opportunity for the expression of the kind of ideas in the amendment. I commend that amendment to the Senate and seek from Senator Harradine his reaction to the support of the Senate for an amendment of this nature. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) That a Select Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and report upon all aspects of the civil defence programme against nuclear attack, with particular reference to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Location and numbers of underground nuclear attack shelters; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) identification of and planning for areas in peripheral regions of major Australian cities in which inexpensive civil defence activity might greatly assist in the saving of life in the event of nuclear attack. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent Resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion from a sense of deep conviction that this is a subject about which we are not doing enough. We are beholden as members of this Parliament to look at the matter and consider again perhaps things we have looked at before and considered in certain light and which may have altered with the passing of the years with the altering of circumstances in the world, particularly in relation to weaponry. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year world-wide military expenditure amounted to more than $1m for every minute of every day. This year, especially with the emphasis placed by President Reagan on nuclear superiority over the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, military spending and in particular spending on nuclear weaponry will reach unprecedented heights. In spite of this the Government, on the evidence we have had and the utterances we have heard so far, has elected, as a conscious policy, to turn a blind eye to the civil defence of our population. To me this seems to be an abdication of responsibility of a degree which is almost mind-shattering, although I am not, because of this neglect, unduly critical of the Government because I think it, for one reason or other, has seen the problem either as too huge or one which various people in the community have induced it not to look at at all. In fact, I think it is short-sighted and rather blind, but there might well be good reasons for its being that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Our major cities-all of them are close to the coast-are surely among the most vulnerable in the world to nuclear attack. Oddly enough, as many of us must reflect, for a society with strongly rural traditions we have one of the highest rates of urban concentration in the world. Something like three-quarters of our total population lives in these exposed cities near the sea, and probably 90 per cent of our heavy industry is there. Much of our defence capability is centred on these main cities, although at least in this area there is now beginning to be some effort at decentralisation, which the Australian Democrats applaud. In passing I would like to mention that the location of the major naval base at Garden Island in the centre of the main city area of Sydney seems a most curious and dangerous anomaly in this day and age and it is something which ought to be looked at from a proper point of view. Indeed, that is an area which could attract attack from perhaps even a quite small force to take out what appears to be an important base. At the same time this could destroy large areas of the biggest and most populous city in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an axiom of modern war that if enough missiles with nuclear warheads are dispatched some must find their mark, and this would apply even when there are powerful defence mechanisms. Because we are too small a community to afford such defence mechanisms, our position is all the more naked and exposed. Let us face the fact that our cities are sitting ducks. If an enemy wished to attack them, even with a quite small force, that attack would succed. Do we have defence associations which make us more susceptible to attack in the event of war? I suggest that in recent months there has been a growing awareness in the community that indeed we have. Having faced up to that I think we also have to face up to its implications. The Pine Gap base has been described in the United States magazine Aviation Week Space Technology as part of the United States vital western Pacific radar fence. The Tranet satellite tracking station at Smithfield on the outskirts of Adelaide is one of the 22 stations which make up the world-wide United States Navstar system-the navigational system which provides United States nuclear missiles with their pinpoint accuracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The head of the United States Strategic Air Command has told the United States Congress of plans to use B52 aircraft operating from bases outside the United States of America armed with tactical weapons to attack Soviet forces in the Middle East. A Darwin-based B52 would have the range to reach most areas of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics without refuelling. It would be naive of us-surely we would be hiding our heads in the sand unduly-to imagine or have fond hopes that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not aware of this. Of course it is aware of it. In fact, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics may well be far more aware of what goes on in the bases on Australian soil than we are. Our cities then could be attacked. Would they be attacked with impunity? Granted a situation in which our major allies were occupied, even extended, elsewhere, the answer of course is yes. We have no means of defence, no means of striking back. Our appalling lack of civil defence, I suggest, makes us, in the cold logic of modern military planning, a more attractive target. Looked at with the cold eye of attack strategy, it is obviously more profitable to hit an enemy who is unprepared and against whom an attack will have the maximum effect than one who is prepared. I think it devolves on us to face these hard truths. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further factor the Australian Democrats believe we ought to take into account. Because of the remoteness, especially of our larger cities on the eastern seaboard from centres of population in any other nation, an enemy would not be deterred by the fear of nuclear fall-out on a third and possibly friendly power as he would be in Europe as a result of attack. This then adds to the probability of an attack on Australian cities in the event of war. It has been theorised regularly that one step short of major war may well be the 'taking out' of small allies on both sides. Australia must present itself attractively in this role, and the closer our defence association with a major zonal power the greater that likelihood must become. This growing risk has been admitted by a number of our leaders and some defence officials. According to an article in the Australian on 30 July 1980 a Department of Defence official had conceded that Australia could be the target of a nuclear attack if war broke out between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Department's first assistant secretary of strategic international policy, Mr Bob Hamilton, told a two-day seminar at Laverton Royal Australian Air Force base that there was little Australia could do if such a nuclear attack were launched. In February 1981, Mr Robert Malthans, who until 1979 was a senior officer of the Joint Intelligence Organisation, gave evidence to a parliamentary sub-committee on foreign affairs and defence, in his expert opinion, in the case of war between the super-powers, North West Cape would be a prime nuclear target and Pine Gap and Nurrungar would also be likely nuclear targets. In July this year Professor Butlin of the Australian national university said the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could be tempted to a deterrent 'demonstration' strike as tensions mounted and whilst several countries might offer themselves as suitable targets, Australia certainly would because of the United States installations. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised this matter myself on 27 February last year in a series of questions to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick. I raised it at that time because not a single word was mentioned about civil defence in the three closely typed pages in the overall defence statement on Afghanistan put down in February by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Nevertheless the Prime Minister himself at that time conceded that Australia was coming into greater risk of being involved in war. His comment to me, a supremely ironic one, was 'as the risk increases, it is prudent to increase insurance'. Is there any hint that there might be an increased risk? When I asked Senator Carrick whether a single submarine, armed with nuclear weapons, could cause extensive casualties and what preparations had been made for civil defence in Australia, he answered:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government, through the Prime Minister, has been attempting to restore conditions in this world to a balance of nuclear power so that we have peace, however unhappily, on the basis of mutual terror. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick agreed that any city could be wiped out from such a submarine as I mentioned, and said he was not aware of the precise progress made in the area of civil defence around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 March 1981 the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) issued a 35-page statement. Again there was no mention at all of civil defence, as if this area of defence was something of no importance at all in our community. The Government's attitude seems to us plain enough. It represents a simple, appalled throwing-up of the hands, a policy of complete and, to me, dangerous irresponsibility for the safety of the Australian people if deterrence fails as a policy, and surely that could happen at any time. Surely this is a contingency which all of us know and live with from year to year, from decade to decade. When this is associated with plain statements from our own Prime Minister that indeed war may be close and deterrence may indeed fail, I believe the situation calls for urgent re-examination. Is the picture indeed so gloomy and hopeless within Australia as to justify the Government's view, which seems to me to be inspired by the view that if there is a nuclear attack on this country we will all be destroyed and nothing will survive? If I could believe that, I could perhaps understand the Government's point of view, but is that view based on a certain carelessness, a certain laziness, a certain failure to look coldly and with perception at the likely scenarios?</PARA>
<PARA> At the twenty-sixth session of the Western European Union in Paris in June 1980 the Union underlined as a major cause of concern the impelling need for civil defence shelters in its own countries of France, West Germany, Britain, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland. All of us who know anything about the continent of Europe understand that the closeness of population and civilisation there-the intenseness and tightness of the cities with their huge population areas-makes these underground shelters an absolute necessity if any of the people are to survive in the event of a nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian cities are altogether different. Although they are vulnerable enough to attack, they are different in character from most European cities. They tend to sprawl over much larger total areas and they are further removed from other smaller areas of population to which people could be evacuated and which would probably be immune from any damage in the case of an attack. The existence of this greater extent of space in our country seems to be a vitally important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming submarine-based attacks which might be launched, I think feasibly, from only two submarines on a basis of one missile per city, it is generally accepted that the major Australian cities would not be completely destroyed. One submarine-based conventional nuclear war missile, depending on wind speed and direction, might destroy perhaps half of the buildings and kill perhaps half of the population from the initial firestorm, blast and high level radiation. These ideas have been developed on a number of occasions by commentators. In fact, it has been estimated that one conventional nuclear missile with a one-megaton warhead would kill at least 30,000 people in the first minute after impact and at least half a million people within 12 months from radiation sickness brought on by radioactive fallout. I draw the attention of honourable senators, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the contrast between those two figures-30,000 who would be killed immediately and half a million who would fall victims of radiation sickness over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The scenario of an attack with the enhanced radiation warhead, the so-called neutron bomb, would show a similar effect although not so devastating, perhaps. This warhead is designed to minimise the output of blast and heat and maximise the output of prompt radiation in the form of neutrons and gamma rays. The accepted lethal dose of radiation would be inflicted on individuals within a radius of about one kilometre from the projected point of impact. If the device were exploded at approximately 900 metres above the ground virtually no blast would reach the ground at all. In addition to destroying living cells, the radiation from this warhead has also been demonstrated to knock out radar systems in the vicinity. Most of the irradiated area then could be re-entered one or two hours after exposure. Granted efficient and organised, although minimally expensive, civil defence procedures, the peripheral regions of our cities could be evacuated and probably the lives of millions of people saved. </PARA>
<PARA> Without such procedures most of these people would die. Furthermore-I am talking about women and children-their deaths would not be easy ones, but painful and protracted, caused by minor injuries, mild radiation sickness, consequent infection and exposure and starvation, which would be associated with attempts to escape, without help and without organisation on an individual basis. The scenario is surely horrifying enough. Even more horrifying is the thought that we are not regarding it with a degree of responsibility we should do as members of this Parliament. These are the key considerations which I believe need further examination and which should in form our overall policy. They are far beyond my ability to comprehend or analyse or that of the Australian Democrats. That is why I believe a select committee of the Senate ought to have that responsibility, and soon. </PARA>
<PARA> Would attacks on our cities be made by only one missile or would there be a blanket attack of, say, 10 missiles a city, which would effectively destroy the environs as well? My own belief is that, for a variety of reasons, the most probable scenario would be a single weapon attack. Limited nuclear exchange, if such a thing were possible, probably would not involve attack on the Australian cities, except perhaps Adelaide which would be involved with the base, although this might depend a good deal on the zone of the major operation-whether it was close to us, say in South East Asia, or remote, as in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> However, even in a zone of operation close to us, a limited war would probably involve attack only on such facilities as Pine Gap, the North West Cape, Omega in Gippsland and the Tranet tracking station outside Adelaide. The threat of strategic strikes at the Australian cities could come in circumstances where our allies would be least likely to be able to provide us with any support-a nuclear exchange which closely approached or actually was all-out zonal war. Granted a major conflict between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, it seems likely that attacks would be made by missile-bearing submarines on allies of the major protagonists. Indeed, one finds this now in every military text book on nuclear war. Indeed, some analysts assert that such cities are already included in the computerised target lists of nuclear submarines. I have no doubt that our cities are on those lists and that only a push of a button would be necessary to launch the missiles against them. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for this appears to be, strategically, that, if the major zonal powers were severely weakened by the consequences of nuclear attack, it would be dangerous to allow an ally of the other side to remain untouched. In such a case, former middle powers might emerge in a dominant position and even represent a threat to the erstwhile major powers. From the point of view of a major power that seems, if a diabolical, at least a respectable point of view. There is, of course, no problem about launching the weapons. There are many more submarines and weapons than would be necessary due to the overkill nature of nuclear weapons on both sides. A comment on the extent of overkill was made in August1980 by the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Dr Sigvard Eklund, when he remarked that some 50,000 nuclear bombs in existence now had a combined explosive power equal to over a million times the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an attack on middle power type allies would probably be in the form of a single strike, launched without warning, and could be over in a matter of minutes, or at most, hours. Its objective would be to weaken the morale and fighting effectiveness of the middle power by striking at its major centres of population, government and industry. No intent ultimately to occupy or conquer the middle range power would be involved. The intent would merely be to cripple. This scenerio naturally spells major destruction when applied to the crowded industrial cities of northern Europe. Australia's case, because of the existence of large country towns far from these major points of attack, the amount of spacing between settled areas and the dispersed nature of the major cities themselves, the effects would be altogether different in this type of attack. </PARA>
<PARA> These implications should be studied closely. The Australian Democrats believe in a policy to develop the rescue of as much of the metropolitan populations as possible. We believe, in view of its tremendous importance, that this can be done at reasonably low cost. It seems relevant, for instance, that there are fertile areas, including hinterland cities, near our largest cities, near our metropolises, which should emerge intact from a nuclear attack on the metropolis itself. I think of such places in New South Wales as Bathurst-Orange to which there is a highly efficient train line and good quality roads. Almost 10 million Australians live in the State capitals and other major coastal cities, including Geelong, Newcastle and Wollongong. </PARA>
<PARA> A single submarine-based nuclear weapon strike on each of these major cities would destroy the central areas and the suburbs for between three miles and six miles from the point of impact. It should be mentioned again how much wind speed and direction must influence other effects. A strong westerly would, for instance, carry fall-out over Sydney safely out to sea and would leave much of the western suburbs of Sydney relatively unscathed. The summer afternoon north-easters would extend a pattern of fall-out across a major additional region of population, namely, the south-western suburbs. More than 4 million Australians live on farms and in country cities and towns. These people would, with minimal precautions against eventual fall-out, survive the kind of attack which would affect almost the whole national population of, say, the Netherlands or Belgium. A first long term requirement of Australian civil defence should surely be to make our inland regional cities as autonomous as possible, with some adequate means, locally, of producing at least motor spirit and electric power. This is an important reason--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is a good point. In other words, we would have to have a basis of industry there as well. There are the sorts of matters which would emerge, I suggest, in an inquiry by a select committee. Obviously we have to have something there that can get industry together again. This is an important reason for the long held Australian Democrats policy favouring regional distilleries, for instance, producing fuel ethanol from crops as an alternative motor spirit even if for some years such ethanol production is at higher cost than imported oil. Highly intensive, localised, all-eggs-in-one-basket projects, such as the unfortunate Rundle shale efforts, which we heard so much about last year but about which I suspect we will not hear so much in the future, and the Gippsland project to produce oil from coal do not, and never could, meet this strategic requirement, quite apart from any other consideration. They could be knocked out very quickly and easily with a single bomb. Where would we be then? I sometimes think that foreign defence planners must think we are a curiously naive society when they see the direction in which we are developing our industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are arguments that small, localised hydro-electric or solar electricity facilities are not cost effective, although with the latest research promising plastic, mass-produced photo-electric material on plastic or metal substrates, power will be produced at 50c per peak watt. I believe the Government ought to be keeping a close eye on regional plants which would eventually use such methods and which should also use wind generators where possible. There facilities could feed power into a national grid and could provide minimal but reliable power resources if major power houses or reticulation lines were destroyed. Batteries of wind generators in suitable areas ought also to be considered. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening I was referring to the necessity for the decentralisation of facilities in our regional cities which conceivably-I hope this is not the case-will be at some stage the beginning again of civilisation such as we have in this country. I think they should be regarded in that light as a precious asset which we have and which is almost unique in the world. Very few countries of our size have that kind of social and geographic organisation. These regional cities are strategically important because they would be the obvious evacuation areas in which those from the outer environs of the major coastal cities could be accommodated and treated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These people could be assumed to be suffering mostly from exhaustion and mild radiation sickness. Hence large supplies of blood plasma would need to be held in these evacuation centres as blood transfusion is a key factor in the treatment of persons suffering from mild to moderate radiation sickness. Indeed, blood transfusion can influence a person's very life or death in many cases. I think that if that were put properly to the Australian people there would be no difficulty in obtaining those stocks of blood plasma. Certainly in the event of a nuclear attack of the type I have postulated many hundreds of thousands of people would need organised, systematic help, which would include that kind of blood transfusion, to save their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be reasonable to suppose that the survivors of such an attack-not necessarily the injured or sick, but the survivors-could amount to half the population of our major cities; that is, a total of five million people. Of those people, perhaps one million or two million might be in urgent need of medical attention. What about the other half? Can precautions be taken on their behalf? The answer is that such precautions could be taken, including mainly the construction of huge numbers of properly built and equipped underground shelters. However, as other countries have found, the cost of the diversion of the national effort to such a program would be enormous. For instance, Switzerland is carrying out such a comprehensive civil defence program at an initial cost of $A2.4 billion. Such shelters would also be very many years in the building stage even after a decision had been taken to go ahead. The Australian Democrats believe that they would be inappropriate and that we should look at how we can cut our losses most easily. The proposal I am now advancing would be much more sensible and certainly much more modest in cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed by those now struggling on in the civil defence area that, in their opinion, much could be done with a budget of perhaps $10m a year initially, provided it was spent in an organised and professional fashion. This could be based on a fully researched and detailed program to use existing means of transport, especially trains on lines, to get people to key country cities where emergency accommodation and first aid could be provided following an initial simple program of decontamination and clothing replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> Decontamination, in the case of mild exposure to radiation, is in theory simple-transport out of the contaminated area, shedding of contaminated clothing, cleansing the skin with soap and water in a shower stall, and providing clean clothing. Used or discarded clothing could be recycled or organised for this purpose and held in stores. Portable shower stalls in groups, perhaps of a knock-down design which could be carried in trucks and erected on any site where there is a clean water supply, would meet the first need of decontamination. There is no need for us to try to design those from scratch; they are already provided in other countries and have existed for many years. It would not be too difficult for us to do the same thing. Work on evolving and making such facilities has been done as a part of civil defence planning in many places. </PARA>
<PARA> Efficient use of existing transport facilities at any time at short notice would seem to be dependent upon constant monitoring and holding on computer programs of the movement of trains actually in the system at all times. These could then be commandeered and used in an organised way to provide a shuttle evacuation service from points in the outer areas of the cities. Existing railway stations could be used as pickup points. Buses and even convoys of private cars could be organised in a similar way and controlled so that roads could carry maximum traffic in one direction without becoming jammed and hence useless. Consider what the situation would be without this organisation on the roads outside our major cities if there were a nuclear attack. Any honourable senator who cannot imagine the horrors of that situation cannot have very much imagination. This, then, could be easily changed by a little forethought. </PARA>
<PARA> None of these objectives is beyond a simple, fairly expensive but professional and efficient organisation which is maintained and funded adequately and provided with sufficiently good technical staff. It seems painfully obvious to me that evacuation procedures would need to be controlled. This is not something that could be done effectively at short notice: it is not something that we will be able to do when the bombs have started falling. It has to be planned in advance and there has to be a state of readiness 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. I mention the unpleasant things I have referred to with some distaste. I am sure honourable senators must hear them with distaste. Yet I think they must be considered and faced up to because they would quite inevitably be the result of lack of action now on the part of the Government and the community. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in other countries? I have mentioned the Swiss effort, the intensity of which is interesting, since most important decisions are taken in Switzerland as a result of consultation with the community as a whole. I have also mentioned the urgency with which a number of other European countries view this problem. Norway already has shelters to house 70 per cent of its population. Denmark has shelters for 60 per cent of its population. In the United States, the civil defence program is administered by the Defence Civil Preparedness Agency-the DCPA. About 7,000 people are already directly employed in civil defence programs. the 1978 budget was $98m but many people actually involved in civil defence planning consider this sum inadequate. The United States plan is based on relocation of the population from high risk areas such as metropolitan centres, the vicinity of military bases and industrial areas to low risk regions and on sheltering the population from fallout in specially built centres. However, the program has not as yet really begun to achieve its objectives, that is, 125,000,000 adequately stocked shelter spaces and the training of 2 1/2 million people in radiological monitoring, shelter management and other related skills. I stress to honourable senators the importance of radiological monitoring and I point out that a group of people has been in touch with me and is only too ready to organise that as a voluntary organisation in this country if the Government would only ask it. </PARA>
<PARA> The DCPA in America is concerned about the program which it says has been hampered by a lack of funds and public apathy. This question of public apathy has arisen in Australia. But I suggest that it is reasonable that members of the public should feel apathetic about this matter. They have to live their lives. It is not something that they should be worrying about. It is not something about which they should have to make decisions. It is something that we should be making decisions about on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> For information about what is happening in the Soviet Union, the researcher is entirely dependent on information from Soviet official sources and observations made by Soviet migrants. According to these sources, the civil defence program of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is under the management of General A. Altunin, Deputy Minister of Defence and a full member of the Soviet Central Committee. Each Soviet republic has a general in command of its own civil defence program. Expenditure in the USSR on civil defence has been estimated at the lowest at $A1.8 billion per year. The four major elements of the program are: Protection of the population; protection of the economy; post-strike rescue and recovery; training of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> The protection of the population includes the following: The urban population can be relocated in a rural area within 72 hours. There is even speculation that plans are so detailed that each rural family knows the name of the urban family to be billeted with it. It is planned to equip every citizen with a gas mask, protective clothing and a first aid kit. Blast shelters have been built and are designed to accommodate 300 people each. The Moscow subway, which is equipped with blast-proof doors, can accommodate one million people as a shelter. Fallout shelters are being built in suburban and rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Protection of the economy includes the following: Dispersal and hardening of industry-that is, bomb resistant construction, low building density and protection of fire departments, pumping stations and power systems; urban planning, including making each region self-supporting; agricultural protection including protective masks for critical livestock, fallout-proof barns and storage facilities and training of agricultural workers in the decontamination of crops and livestock; stockpiling of enough food and grain to sustain the population for one year at subsistence levels and also of coal, oil, iron ore, steel, cement and cotton. </PARA>
<PARA> Rescue and recovery operations include 100,000 members of the armed forces in civil defence units; industrial personnel and farmers are also being organised into units and trained in the following areas: Clearing and decontamination of access routes and work areas; communications; medical and paramedical skills; monitoring of levels of radiation and chemical contamination; rescue of population from strike area. Again, this is a major priority always. The rescue and recovery operations also include fire fighting, repair of broken water and gas mains and power lines. It is planned to train at least 30 million citizens in civil defence skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Civil defence training in the USSR is compulsory. Courses are taught in school grades two, five and nine, youth organisations, universities, factories, training villages and at a four-year course for officers at the civil defence academy in Moscow. I think it is obvious-I have detailed these things for honourable senators-that in other parts of the world this problem is being taken very seriously indeed. I suggest that surely we are not so clever here that we feel we have any kind of immunity, that the problems that these people are going to so much trouble to cope with are not going to be visited on us. I think we would be naive and foolish to take that view. Australia must consider this matter seriously. This country needs a viable program of civil defence and needs it now. I have said previously, and I say it again, that I am by no means an expert in this area, although I have tried to find out some facts on it. It is an area that needs a concentrated opinion brought to it by responsible and informed members of the society. Those people exist, and many of them have been in touch with me since I first raised this matter. I think the ideal way in which this should be done would be by a select committee of the Senate. The task, I believe, is an urgent one. If we let it slide and we do nothing about it, the day might come when every one of us in this chamber might regret it bitterly. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should think not. In moving that the Senate take note of the statement by the National Health and Medical Research Council on the herbicide 2,4,5-T presented to the Senate on 29 March 1979-a rather elderly report-I would like to discuss some of the more recent developments which have occurred in the matter of the safety of the herbicide 2,4,5-T.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators will know, it is the toxic trace contaminant TCDD, commonly known as dioxin, which is implicated as the cause of the statistical link between the use of 2,4,5-T and cancer, birth defects and other abnormalities in those who come into contact with the herbicide. TCDD is formed unavoidably during the production of 2,4,5-T and it is not possible to eliminate it from the herbicide completely. We have read recently of dumped dioxin, concentrated and extremely dangerous, which is still lying buried in public, earth-filled dumps in the Sydney area. Honourable senators may remember that in February of last year I raised the question of what was to be done with this waste dioxin and how the New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission proposed to deal with future dumping of this poison. I have still not received a satisfactory answer and I still consider those drums of dioxin are a time bomb, ticking away towards some future contamination. Used properly, with all precautions taken, 2,4,5-T may be relatively harmless. But is it always used properly? Is it used responsibly even most of the time? I suggest that that is probably not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Residents in the area around Bright, in northern Victoria, recently forced their Forests Commission of Victoria to postpone the spraying of pine plantations with 2,4,5-T by threatening to seek a Supreme Court injunction on the grounds that the use of the herbicide constituted a health risk to residents. These people became concerned when they heard that a helicopter would be used to spray the plantations. Pregnant women were, of course, particularly concerned and many felt that they would have to stay elsewhere while the spraying was in progress and until the spray settled properly. A Victorian State instrumentality planned to spray this suspect herbicide from aircraft whilst a Victorian Government financed study on the link between soft tissue cancer and exposure to 2,4,5-T, announced three months earlier, is in progress. This leads me sometimes to despair about the processes of government. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the actual level of TCDD found in the 2,4,5-T used in Australia. The acceptable level in this country-if indeed any level is acceptable-is 0.1 parts per million. This sounds like, and indeed is, an extremely small amount. But it should be kept in mind that one medicine drop of pure dioxin has been estimated to be able to kill 1,200 people if dispersed in water or in some like way. Earlier this year Dr Peter Hall and Dr Ben Selinger of the Australian National University published a paper demonstrating that a firm statistical link existed between the hundreds of tonnes of agent orange imported into Australia in the early 1970s and the highly significant increase in Australian neonatal mortality in the mid-1970s from certain types of congenital abnormalities. </PARA>
<PARA> Agent orange, of course, is a mixture of 2,4,5,-T and another herbicide, 2,4-D. It contains, and this is the important point, very high levels of dioxin-somewhere between 180 and 260 times the acceptable level of dioxin in Australia now. The Australian Democrats would like to know where all this imported agent orange went to. Apparently it was sold somewhere in this country as acceptable 2,4,5-T, either in its original form or mixed with herbicide which was manufactured here. That happened in spite of its enormously high dioxin level. Some of it is probably still around now. It may be being sprayed and used even this week as we sit in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> That was an appalling state of affairs, but it did happen 10 years ago. Surely nothing like it could occur again? Or could it? This month the West Australian Government recalled 4,000 litres of 2,4,5-T because it contained four times the acceptable level of dioxin. There is no doubt that 2,4,5-T can be dangerous. But how dangerous is it? Can it be used safely if strict rules for use are drawn up and strigently enforced? Should we draw up these rules? Should we look at matters such as spraying it into waterways or on to the roofs of houses from which the water is collected and drunk by the people who live there? Can we continue a situation in which there is only very small printing on cans and containers and people perhaps using more herbicide in the belief that more is better, as is often the way when people are using insecticides and substances of that kind?</PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have been in the Senate I have asked four times-I believe I am a patient man; I am getting more patient as time goes on-for a public inquiry into the effects of 2,4,5-T. I feel that the study of the effects of agent orange is finally getting somewhere, and this must be applauaded. However, agent orange did have a much higher TCDD content than commercially used 2,4,5-T, and it is recognised that its effects must be different. This must be considered in any kind of inquiry. We must study the effects of commercially used 2,4,5-T on both the human system and the environment in the long term. There are prospects that we may do this soon. The Australian Democrats welcome and applaud that, and we believe that the Australian society will do so as well. </PARA>

For some reason there is a lack of interest in the items before us. Even when interest is shown, especially in an item of this sort, we find that participation is by way of a written statement which is read out, and the Senate suffers as a consequence. On the Opposition side we have several shadow Ministers who match the Ministers on the other side. Now we have another four or five shadow Ministers because everyone in the Australian Democrats is a shadow Minister. Each one who participates in the debate reads his or her speech.

Of the 30 people on the Opposition side, at least 12 people are entitled to read their speeches and, as a result, the debate deteriorates.

In the suburb in which I live in Brisbane, despite a protest, we still have to put up with shire council vehicles indiscriminately spraying footpaths and, on windy days, spraying the whole neighbourhood. No matter what protest a person may make, this spraying persists. It happened recently. I would have thought that there would be some way in which we could convince the local authorities that indiscriminate spraying of this sort was just not on and that there are dangers. It could also be an invasion of privacy for the individual who finds himself subjected to spraying of this type. I consider the matter to be important and to be worthy of further debate.

The text of the motion is that we express our concern at the victimisation of the single unemployed in relation to the compilation of various social security payments. It is not the practice of the Australian Labor Party to make a broad statement and not back it up with factual material. I simply say that the Government is unable to escape criticism of this nature. To understand why, we have to go back a long way into the corridors of time to the action of the Liberal-National Country Party Government in the 1950s when it jettisoned the concept of a social security levy which was originated by the Chifley Government. We might argue about various ideas of social security structure, but whatever the type of government in Europe-apart from the United Kingdom-the idea of providing, in a levy concept, for a rainy day was always accepted. People ask what the Australian Labor Party Government of 1972 did. In relation to Medibank payments it attempted to provide for the people under the same levy system, which this Senate rejected. We hear that the single unemployed are different from others. The fact is that people on this earth, particularly in Australia, do not always find themselves with the backstop of a viable family. Secondly, it is obvious that in a country the size of Australia people in search of work have to indulge in a fair amount of travel across the continent. Finally, it is quite obvious one does not purchase commodities or pay rent according to whether rebates apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say that we put this matter on the Notice Paper because we think that the Government should face up to the fact that Australia should have a broad and stable social security system which provides constant reimbursement. I remind the Senate of the opportunities that have been lost. The Menzies Government in 1939 instituted a massive inquiry into insurance. Even in Germany in the time of Bismarck, this whole idea of national insurance was accepted and was followed by other countries. A national insurance system was established in Britain. In Australia, a succession of governments from, I suppose, 1910 onwards accepted the idea that such a system should be paid for by a slice out of revenue. However, other factors intrude on the Budget structure and such expenditure must be whittled back. In 1939, a massive inquiry into the national insurance system was undertaken. This inquiry envisaged a contribution of one shilling and three pence from the employee, one shilling and three pence from the employer and one shilling and three pence from the State. Of course, when the war clouds gathered, the Menzies Government decided that this research was to be wasted, and nothing happened. </PARA>
<PARA> In the post-war years when work neglected during the war was being undertaken, Australia had a substantial high wage income work force. This was the time when a massive amount of money could have been set aside in a Budget for the purpose of a national insurance scheme. Of course, the Chifley Government was in office during 1948-49. In the early 1950s, Fadden was Treasurer. Although he is regarded as a master Treasurer, I would call him a man of little faith. Instead of showing some foresight he simply scratched and wiped off this welfare fund concept. That is an attitude that, having inherited, we have enshrined ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> I, in common with some other senators, during the last non-sitting week met some people at big Community Youth Support Scheme demonstrations. I talked to people at those demonstrations. I said to one boy: 'Look, maybe there is a heavy concentration of unemployment in the western suburbs of Sydney. Why don't you go out into certain areas where there is seasonal work?' The plain fact is that such a person would go to a strange town where he was unknown. He would have to get accommodation. I can assure honourable senators that such a single person would find that he would pay more for board and lodgings than he would at his home in metropolitan Sydney or metropolitan Melbourne. I do not know what the Government had in mind in relation to compliance with the wishes of the Treasury in relation to the Budget. I suppose the redoubtable Mr Stone of the Treasury is like Fouche during the French Revolution, the sinister influence behind the scenes. Of course, everyone cannot be like Mr Stone who early in his life gained a lucrative Commonwealth Government job. </PARA>
<PARA> We can talk about the militancy of the unemployed. This action is one situation in which the Government puts the economic boot in and draws distinctions. Our idea in using this parliamentary device was to put on record our belief that the Government's policies simply compound the misfortune and the destitution of many Australians under 25 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about manuals which deal with job attributes, about applicants looking well groomed and all the rest of it. The Government complains about people fronting up for a job interview wearing thongs and so on. I put it to the Senate that, if the Government is to cut back an unemployment person's income, the money that that person has will be spent on food and board, and clothing will come a bad third. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in all the inquiries it has had on social security, has never faced up to or admitted the mistakes that were made by the then member for Darling Downs, Fadden, in the 1950s who used a simple device to achieve a balanced or nearly balanced Budget. He turned the tap off, as it were, in respect of building up reserves for a national welfare fund. There is nothing revolutionary about such a fund. It is not a question about which party happened to be in power in Canberra but surely in the boom years funds for this concept could have been accumulated. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with some feeling on this matter. It is regrettable that Australia does not have such a fund. I know that John Wheeldon, who was a very fine Minister in this chamber, tried to establish a national compensation scheme. Unfortunately, a number of little minded Australians were against it. I am fairly broad in my criticism of those who objected to the scheme. We struck objections from some sections of the Labor movement which were fearful of the scheme. Insurance companies and other professional groups also objected. I know that I am diverting a little from the subject of the victimisation of the unemployed. However, I draw the attention of the Senate to a series of articles in the Sydney Morning Herald about the pitfalls or obstacles in our compensation law. How much better off we would be if we had a national system such as that which operates in New Zealand?</PARA>
<PARA> The motion before the Senate was put on the Notice Paper some time ago. All the fears that we had were manifested in the last few weeks in the capital cities when we mingled with and spoke to teenage demonstrators who were rightly concerned about what was happening. On top of this, Neil Brown, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, today bravely said that in his eyes the CYSS scheme is overboard-that is it. I have made a plea tonight about victimisation. However, somewhere tucked away in Neil Brown's latest statement is a small paragraph which relates to the questions I asked Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. The Minister told me about the alternative youth training schemes. She said that counsellors will go out and have a look at a person to see whether he can fit into such a scheme. But we argue that there will not be an all-embracing absorption of these people into training schemes. What is going to happen to the thousands of people who will not make it, who will not be absorbed into the schemes? My motion condemns the Government for making a distinction between single and married people. The Government is urging single people to go to other States where it claims there will be greater employment opportunities. There may be industrial trends but the Government is certainly not making it easier for these people. In deference to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have kept my speech strictly within the confines of Standing Order 407 and I hope my eloquence gets a response from the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Committee on Occupational Safety and Health in Australian Government employment met on 14th November 1979, and 9th December 1980. It had not met during 1981-82 and the Review of Commonwealth Functions' decision announced 30th April 1981 abolished the Committee. Since September 1974 when the Government adopted the Code of General Principles it was the Committee's practice to meet annually to consider submissions from its working party and any other business. The working party comprised members of the main Committee, representatives of other departments and statutory authorities and the Standards Association of Australia. The working party met six times during 1979-80 and four times during 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Working papers produced were agenda and progress reports from the working party, together with codes of practice for approval and recommendation to the Minister for his endorsement, publication and distribution. In addition reports were tabled on the future work program of the working party, procedures for consultation and preparation of joint occupational safety and health codes of practice, information papers on accidents statistics, Standards Association codes, departmental publications and updated occupational health guides from the National Health and Medical Research Council. At working party meetings the papers produced related to draft codes of practice in various stages of preparation, together with suggested amendments (reflecting comments from users) to those codes of practice already approved and distributed with the Minister's approval.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Thirty seven codes of practice have been established and approved by the Minister-titles as per the attached list. A further four are awaiting Ministerial approval pending the outcome of the RCF review.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Other matters considered by the Committee included reports on legislation/regulations by the representative of the State Departments of Labour and Industry, discussions of the results of a questionnaire concerning the implementation of the Code of General Principles and whether there should be mandatory observation of the codes of practice. Consideration was also given to present and future procedures to secure wider implementation of the Codes, overseas trends in occupational safety and health legislation, the attitudes of management and unions to safety matters, causes of accidents, accident costs and loss control and risk management. Members of the Committee and the working party also reported on progess within individual departments and statutory authorities on particular safety measures and occupational health developments.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Subject to the outcome of the review to scale down the function of the Industrial (Physical) Working Environment Division (RCF decision 30th April 1981) any residual activities will be transferred to the Department of Industrial Relations.

<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Transport has caused to be consolidated the Navigation (Life Saving Appliances) Regulations into some 50 pages in one volume and that these regulations incorporate all amendments by legislation to 30 November 1980? Is he aware also that these regulations require the use of inches, feet, yards, square feet, cubic feet, fathoms fractions such as 3-2/5 and 2 1/4, the fahrenheit scale , ounces, pounds weight, and tons as opposed to tonnes, that they incorporate a cubic capacity formula for lifeboat capacity involving feet and fractions and a requirement that certain life jackets be clearly marked for persons under or over 70 lbs in weight, and that the 7th Schedule details buoyant apparatus mixing feet, inches, fathoms and millimetres? Will he tell us what would happen to a person who complied with these regulations, say, by marking his life jackets 'to carry over 70 lbs'? Will the Government undertake to lodge a nolle prosequi against any prosecutions launched against any such person by the Metric Conversion Board for breach of the Metric Conversion Act?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has assisted in providing the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation (Life Saving Appliances) Regulations are currently under consideration for repeal and will be superseded by Marine Orders to be issued under the Navigation (Orders) Regulations. The Navigation (Life Saving Appliances) Regulations were introduced in 1968 and although subsequent amendments were made in terms of metric units of measurement the metrication of the principal regulations was deferred in view of the proposal to have it repealed and superseded by the Marine Orders.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some cases, the documents referred to in the honourable senator's questions have not been described in sufficient detail to permit precise identification. Nevertheless, extensive and time-consuming research has been undertaken to find documents which seem likely to relate to the subjects mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) None of the documents has been published.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information on the following documents has already been made publicly available:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) No. 1-Number and subject of 'D' notices issued: I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2293 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (House of Representatives Hansard, page 2990), which state that information on the 'D' notice system had been made publicly available on 11 December 1973, including the facts that the number of 'D' Notices had been reduced from seven to four, that they had been declassified, and that a booklet containing the texts of the current Notices had subsequently been given wide distribution among the media.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) No. 57-Review of civilian substitution in armed services: I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2296 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (House of Representatives Hansard, page 2290). For the senator's information, a report of a Committee of Inquiry into Civilian Integration in the Australian Army, produced in December 1974 and known as the Robertson report, may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) No. 59-Details of medical tests applied to army recruits: I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2298 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (House of Representatives Hansard, page 2991). The current Joint Services Manual of Recruit Medical Examination Procedures, (JSSP (AS)701(A)), may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) No. 88-Report on integration of armed forces medical services: I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2302 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (House of Representatives Hansard, page 2991) which stated that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Integration of the Medical Services of the Armed Forces had been tabled by the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives on 25 July 1974 (Hansard, page 638).</PARA>
<PARA> (k) No. 89-Report on defence legal services (Professor Whitmore): I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2303 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (Hansard, page 2991) which stated that the Report had been tabled by the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives on 7 November 1973 (Hansard, pages 2887-8).</PARA>
<PARA> (n) No. 92-The Moreshead Committee Report: I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2306 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (Hansard, page 2992) which stated that the Report had been tabled by the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives on 30 May 1973 (Hansard, page 2873).</PARA>
<PARA> (p) No. 94-Various committee reports on the proposed Tri-Service Academy: I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Defence to Question No. 2308 by Mr Ruddock on 28 May 1975 (Hansard, page 2992) which stated that on 25 July 1974, the Minister for Defence had presented to Parliament the Report by the Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee (House of Representatives Hansard, 638).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Of the other documents referred to in the honourable senator's question, the following have been examined and can, subject to any qualifications indicated below, now be made available:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No. 27-Defence Standards Laboratories (now Material Research Laboratories) consumer products tests: Disclosure of such documents would rest on a case by case examination. Some such reports contain information provided in confidence by commercial firms.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No. 28-Defence Standards Laboratories automotive products tests: As for (b) No. 27 above.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No. 56-Advice and analysis on reintroduction of conscription 1964: Those Defence documents which have been identified in response to the honourable senator's question may be made available, apart from Cabinet documents and other documents containing Cabinet deliberations or decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) No. 58-W. D. Scott and Co. report on community attitudes to service careers: The report may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) No. 87-Report on the role of Australian medical team in Vietnam: The report dated March 1969 by Professor Sir Sydney Sutherland may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (l) No. 90-Report on the Defence Services flying training program: Three reports i.e. a report on flying training for fixed wing aircraft, a supplementary report to that report and a report on flying training for rotary wing aircraft may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (m) No. 91-Hassett Committee report on Army reorganisation: The report may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (o) No. 93-Interdepartmental study of the housing problems of servicemen: A report dated 22 October 1971 entitled 'Interdepartmental Committee on Service Housing-First Progress Report' may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (q) No. 95-Departmental submissions and analyses of proposed Army base in Western Australia: It appears that this question relates to studies in the 1960s on the feasibility of locating a task force in Western Australia. Relevant departmental documents may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (r) No. 96-Administrative directive on the responsibilities of the Department of Defence: The directive may be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (s) No. 97-Report on Judge Rapke's inquiry into incidents at HMAS Leeuwin: In his answer to Parliamentary Question No. 2311 by Mr Ruddock, the Minister for Defence stated that the Judge's findings had been made public but that the report itself remained confidential in line with most juvenile courts procedures when dealing with youthful offenders or suspects whereby the accused and witnesses are protected from publicity. (House of Representatives Hansard of 28 May 1975, page 2993). Following a re-examination of the report I have concluded that it should not be released publicly. Its release would involve the unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of the persons whose conduct came under examination or who were interviewed by Judge Rapke. Further, disclosure of some information in a way which permits the identification of individuals would constitute a breach of confidence. A copy of the report with non-releasable portions deleted could be made available. The full text of the report on incidents at HMAS Leeuwin could be made available on an 'in confidence' basis to members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (t) No. 98-Report of Court of Inquiry on RAAF Laverton. A Court of Inquiry was established following allegations of improper treatment of apprentices at RAAF School of Radio, Laverton in January 1972. The Proceedings of the Court of Inquiry comprise several documents, including transcripts of evidence and the statement, findings and recommendations of the Court. Following a re-examination of the Proceedings, I have concluded that their public release would involve the unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of the apprentices and other persons whose conduct came under investigation or who gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry. A copy of the Proceedings, other than the transcripts of evidence, could, with non-releasable portions deleted, be made publicly available. To delete such material from the transcripts would make them largely unintelligible. The full proceedings of the inquiry at RAAF Laverton could be made available on an 'in confidence' basis to members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) With regard to part 1 (h) of the question (Departmental reports on suspected breaches of the National Service Act), disclosure of such reports would be the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. I am advised, however, that his Department has not been able to identify any specific documents from the description given.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) Document No. 10-CSIRO research on commodity yields, farm costs and returns. No document with exactly the above title can be identified from within CSIRO records. However, it appears that the citation could refer to a paper which was prepared by Dr B. R. Davidson while a member of the CSIRO Division of Land Research and Regional Survey. The paper was unacceptable for publication because the conclusions were based on assumptions which were open to question. Moreover, economic analyses concerned with the Ord River development were then the responsibility of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) and WA authorities. The paper was, however, provided by CSIRO for the information of the BAE and WA authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Document No. 30-The Commonwealth Paint Committee's test of household paints is unknown. The Government Paint Committee prepares specifications as to the quality of paints required by the members of the Committee, i.e. Commonwealth, State and Territory Departments and Statutory Authorities. The Committee itself has no test facilities. Products are tested by manufacturers and/or laboratories of the member organisations for compliance with GPC specifications.

<PARA> Manufacturers provide test information in confidence to their clients (the Committee members). The future supply of such information may be jeopardised by public release.</PARA>

Does he further recall that following that case, on 27 November 1979, over 18 months ago, he or a spokesman from his office said that there would be a review of the legislation under which the doctor had been charged? In light of the current controversy surrounding the Canberra doctor, William Vincent Russell, who has chosen to go to gaol for six days as an alternative to paying $27,800 in fines, does he agree that the penalties for Medibank fraud are still grossly inadequate? Can he explain the extraordinary delay on the Government doing something about it?</PARA>
<PARA> In reply I stated that in the case of Dr Russell there were charges made under other legislation as well as under the Crimes Act. However I undertook to ascertain what progress was being made in the review of penalties under the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to this question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation is currently being prepared to bring up to date the pecuniary penalties in the Crimes Act. I hope that the legislation will be introduced during the current session.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 June 1981, (Hansard, page 3019) Senator Chipp asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the advertising of cigarettes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> There appear to be two surveys bearing on whether cigarette brand names containing terms such as 'mild' and 'extra mild' lead people to believe they are smoking low-tar cigarettes. In a complaint last year to the Trade Practices Commission the Movement Opposed to the Promotion of Unhealthy Products (MOP UP) referred to a survey of 100 shoppers which indicated that 60 per cent of respondents believed that the word 'mild', used in reference to cigarettes, meant 'low tar and/or nicotine'. MOP UP also claimed to hold copies of letters in which one manufacturer claimed to be aiming promotions specifically at the low-tar buying market. However, as the survey methods and results do not appear to have been published, and the letters referred to have not been produced, no great weight can be attached to MOP UP's claims.</PARA>
<PARA> The second survey was a public-opinion poll, commissioned by the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, in which the brands smoked by smokers who believed they had changed to low-tar brands were investigated. Eighty-two per cent of these smokers were found to be smoking brands with tar yields of 11mg or more.</PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the findings demonstrate that many smokers who believe they are smoking low tar cigarettes are not doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted that smoking at any level is harmful to health. The findings of the Anti-Cancer Council's opinion poll provide further justification for the Government's announced response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare: 'Drug Problems in Australia-an Intoxicated Society?', and strengthen the case for smokers to be able to make an informed choice, based on medical assessment that smoking lower-yielding brands is not as harmful as smoking higher-yielding brands.</PARA>
<PARA> Consultations with the tobacco industry are proceeding concerning implementation of plans for the printing of tar and nicotine yields on cigarette packets, the establishment of upper limits for tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes, and their progressive reduction over time.</PARA>
<PARA> These consultations with industry, involving detailed consideration of a number of complex issues, are necessarily lengthy. Proposals for implementation will be submitted to me for consideration as soon as possible following completion of the consultations.</PARA>
