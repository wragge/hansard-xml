<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Finance. Before the Government's decision to place a 2 1/2 per cent tax on knowledge, as it has sometimes been called, books were tax exempt. Because they were tax exempt as finished products, they were also exempt from the normal 15 per cent tax on typesetting and a 15 per cent tax on printing. Will the Minister reveal whether the latest move by the Government will in fact involve a further tax on books and newspapers by removing their exemption from other taxes, such as the kind to which I have referred?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to age pensions and to the Minister's article in the Australian newspaper on Monday entitled 'The Swelling Pension Burden'. I ask about statistical claims in that article. It is claimed that the number of people aged 65 years and over as a proportion of the total Australian population is expected to increase from 9.8 per cent this year to 12.2 per cent by the end of the century. However, the Year Book of Australia, published this month, indicates a much smaller increase of only 10.4 per cent. This figure represents only one quarter of the increase claimed in the article. Even the source cited in the article-that is, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Review of Demographic Trends-estimates the proportion of people aged 65 years and over to be about 10.4 per cent, not the 12.2 per cent claimed. How can it be that the Minister has exaggerated four-fold the expected increase in age pensioner numbers? Does this exaggeration suit the purpose of the policy thrust of that article? How can that bias actually be justified with reference to published facts? Finally, will the Minister immediately withdraw the figures and correct the misleading information that has been published?</PARA></TALK.START>

Quite frankly, without notice I would merely have been able to say that I had sought and obtained the figures from my Department and had asked its officers to ensure that they were carefully checked before I decided to publish them. In fact, the projections which I have used are those prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the Department of Finance and are used by the Department in preparing its forward estimates of expenditure. The projections also have been included in the ABS publication Social Indicators 1980 at page 8.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal difference between the projections I have used and the other projections contained in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Review of Demographic Trends and in the Year Book referred to by the honourable senator is that in those I used mortality rates are projected to decline for the rest of the century. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs projections quoted by the honourable senator assume constant mortality to that time and the assumption of constant mortality is not consistent with trends during the 1970s. Of course, in all of this we are dealing with prediction. Estimates are made on the basis of the best information available at the time and there is, of course, room for differences. The paper to which the honourable senator referred in his question makes note of the point that I have just made. A footnote at page 24 of the paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems likely that mortality will in fact decline throughout the projection period, thus adding to the estimates of both the total population, and more significantly, the number of aged persons. This would accentuate trends in the ageing of the population.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, in the text of the publication elsewhere, as opposed to the diagrams which are in the same publication, the Department refers to population projections in which the numbers of aged persons will increase by about two-thirds over the next 20 years. That reference is contained at page 3 and it relates to the projections that I have used which are based on the assumptions of improvements in mortality. For the information of the honourable senator-I hope it is of interest to the Senate generally-the projections of the population in the next 20 years are as follows: The numbers of persons aged 65 or more will increase from 1.45 million to 2.37 million-that is, by about two-thirds-while those aged 75 or more will increase in number from about 0.5 million to more than one million-that is, the numbers will double. I observe that in terms of the future welfare and health responsibilities of Commonwealth and State governments the latter figure relating to the growth in the number of older persons in the community is probably particularly significant. I also refer the Senate to a report prepared by Professor Myers for the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat which is entitled 'Population and Public Welfare Policy in Australia'. Professor Myers, in his conclusion, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . strange indeed is the fact that many experts in Australia still cling to the notion that the A-C Series (constant mortality assumptions) should be viewed as the preferred projections.</PARA>
<PARA>In light of the fact that declining mortality rates are likely to exert significant pressures on the health and welfare services provided by both the Commonwealth and the States I think it is important that there be debate on and consideration of the projections. I acknowledge that differences of opinion can exist because questions on not only mortality rates but also birth and immigration rates have to be taken into account. A series of factors do require estimating.</PARA>
<PARA> One consistent feature of the material which I have seen since I have held this portfolio is that the further one goes along the track with respect to population projections the more it appears that earlier but relatively recent projections have been conservative with respect to the number of aged Australians. There appears to be a lengthening or an enhancement of the age to which one is likely to live. I suppose that most of us, since we seem to be ageing very rapidly in this place, can welcome the fact that we seem to have increased chances of mortality. I can assure the Senate that the figures from which I have quoted were very carefully examined to try to ensure that they presented the most accurate picture possible in the light of current information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Department recognises, as it must and as I must, the prescribed period of 28 days for the supply of the statement and associated documents pursuant to the requirements of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The Department is doing its utmost to meet the requirement. Honourable senators will be aware that the appeal procedures are relatively new. They were announced last year. Since 9 September 1980, when the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was extended to include applications relating to medical matters, many more applications have been received than were originally anticipated. Delays have resulted in supplying section 37 statements and documents. New positions have been created within my Department to meet the additional workload, and action is being taken to fill the positions. The situation is constantly under review. I have had a number of questions in this place from Senator Grimes, from some Government senators and from Senator Colston about delays in different parts of the appeal system and as recently as last week, I think, I approved an increase in the number of appeal tribunals in New South Wales to meet some of the difficulties in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is perhaps worth noting that the 28 day period to which the honourable senator referred is not a mandatory requirement. It is a directory one.

We certainly accept that we should try to meet that time limit and currently efforts are being made to ensure that we can do so.

While the allocation to the water resources assessment program for the coming year has remained at the 1980-81 level, will the Minister confirm that allocations to both the Adelaide water treatment scheme and the Murray Valley salinity and drainage program have been reduced?

This time the South Australian Government asked that in fact there be some reduction in the Adelaide water treatment scheme and the salinity and drainage program in favour of Commonwealth assistance in other new initiatives from the State. These new initiatives are now under consideration and if they are approved they will result in an increased allocation to South Australia. But I remind Senator Hill that to understand the figures released yesterday one should look not only at the figures in South Australia but also at the figures in New South Wales where $1.96m has been made available for salinity and drainage in the Murray Valley, $2m for South Australia and $1.75m for Victoria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the recent article published in Choice. The honourable senator in his own reading of the article will have noted that the National Health and Medical Research Council has already developed a standard for milk, including microbiological standards. It has recommended that these be adopted by States and the Territories. The standard applies to milk as it leaves the processing factory and milk at the wholesale level. It is more difficult to develop a standard to apply at retail levels. Indeed, the standard which has been presently developed does not so apply. It applies at the processing and wholesale levels. The reason it does not apply at the retail level is that there is a scarcity of microbiological data. Because of that, people do not know what the proper standard should be. The NHMRC has undertaken to gather appropriate data on the microbiology of milk at retail level. I understand that it has collected data on both cow and goat milk recently. This will form the basis of the development of a microbiological standard in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not reasonable to compare milk taken at the retail level with microbiological standards based on data obtained at the processing factory level. It is not possible to make such a comparison. I believe such a comparison was made in the Choice article. Choice may need to look at the methodology it used. The microbiological standards recommended by the NHMRC are, indeed, realistic standards if they are applied correctly. I am advised that the NHMRC recommended that unpasteurised milk not be sold for direct human consumption. Indeed, as a doctor I endorse that view. Unpasteurised milk, particularly goat milk, is a cause for concern. However, there is no danger to national health from pasteurised milks provided proper methods of handling and distribution are employed. Consumers should be discouraged from consuming unpasteurised milk. The NHMRC is already developing microbiological standards to apply to milk at the point of retail sale. In addition, it is also formulating a standard for goat milk.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as the honourable senator has indicated in his question, that the income test free area for invalid pensioners is at the level he has indicated-$20. It is some years since that level has been adjusted. The honourable senator concluded his question with words asking in effect: How, therefore, can we justify saying that we should be helping those who need assistance? I direct the Senate's attention to the fact that the operation of the income test is specifically an instrument designed to ensure that available resources are directed to those who have least. In other words, people who are without income receive the full pension and people with some levels of private or other income still continue to receive the full pension but after certain limits-in the case of the single person the $20 limit with respect to the invalid or age pension-there is a withdrawal of pension at the rate of 50c for each dollar of non-pension income. Although it is true that that income limit has not changed it is also true that each time the pension is adjusted, which is, of course, twice a year under the automatic indexation provisions introduced by this Government, the range of income over which a part pension is received does expand. In other words, if the pension rises by $3, as it will in November, the position is that there will be an additional $6 income range over which part of the pension will be payable. To that extent there is a widening of the range of incomes over which a part pension will be payable to an invalid pensioner or to an age pensioner to whom the same income test applies. I am aware of the concern felt among pensioners, invalid and otherwise, that the limits have not been changed. That is a matter which, of course, is considered annually in a Budget context.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's question relates to the export complementation program which was introduced by the Government to encourage manufacturing in Australia and to encourage the export of manufactured material from Australia with the exporter gaining the right to import offset material and thereby producing a more efficient manufacturing arrangement. The scheme, which has been operating for some years, leaves the manufacturers free to determine which products they see as being commercially viable for export and which products they would wish to source from overseas while still meeting their local content obligation; so they are matters which have been left primarily to the commercial judgment of companies. I think it is well known to many honourable senators, as manufacturers have been making representations in this building over the past month on the area Senator Watson has raised, that some manufacturers are concerned that the present scheme enables people to manufacture components which have a relatively low level of technological input, a relatively low labour content and so on and to import the more sophisticated manufactured items that go into the motor cars. That is a matter which has been put before the Government. I will refer the honourable senator's question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for his consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is true that the Reserve Bank of Australia has varied the guidance given to trading banks about the rate of growth in their advances outstanding and that each bank is now requested to limit the growth on advances for the time being to a rate of 12 per cent. This contrasts with the previous figure of 10 per cent per annum. It is probably fair to say it is not a relaxation of monetary policy which continues to be to restrain the growth of the availability of money and credit. Indications are that the growth in this coming year of the liquidity base for the financial sector generally will be less than in 1980-81. Against this background rather less need is seen for quantitative restraints on bank lending. I am sure that the effect of the guidance variation of the Reserve Bank will flow through to the trading banks and that a variety of funds will be available for a number of sources.

Will the Minister set up a board of suitable college and university personnel with some industry representation not financially associated with the computer industry to administer grants to some Australian computer companies to enable them to increase their research and development with obvious benefits to the country both in peace and war time?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Attorney-General, relates to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which was signed on behalf of the Australian Government at Copenhagen in July 1980 on the occasion of the Mid-Decade for Women Conference. I understand that earlier this year a meeting of all State Ministers responsible for human rights was held to discuss ratification of the Convention. At the time it was implied that there appeared to be no serious impediment to ratification. I ask: Are any of the States totally opposed to ratification and, if so, upon what grounds? Is there any danger of parts of the Convention being qualified so that a consensus may be reached with all States? Is there any possibility of the Government using its treaty powers to ratify the Convention in its original form?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the ratification by Australia of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was referred to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General because a great many of its provisions concern State laws. We followed the precedent established in dealing with the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the honourable senator says, the Convention was signed in July of last year at the meeting in Copenhagen. Shortly thereafter the question of ratification was referred to the Standing Committee, whose officers have been working on it assiduously ever since. At the last meeting of the Standing Committee in Cairns at the end of July of this year a considerable report on the subject was made to the Committee of Attorneys-General. They were meeting as a committee of Ministers responsible for human rights rather than strictly as Attorneys-General. Certainly, a good deal of progress has been made towards the final consideration of the matter by the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily at all. We are anxious, as far as is possible, to reach a consensus on this matter because, as I have said, it involves State laws as well as Commonwealth laws. Unlike members of the Opposition, we are not prepared to impose upon the States the full rigours of what some constitutional lawyers believe to be the external affairs power. That is why we are engaged in this exercise. Senator Evans knows that perfectly well. I am sorry that I have been diverted by him from answering the honourable senator's question. The honourable senator asked whether any States are totally opposed to ratification. I am not aware that any States are. They have engaged in this exercise with genuine goodwill and in an effort to reach a consensus as far as that is possible. The honourable senator asks whether it is likely that any qualifications would be imposed on the Convention, that is, whether Australia would be likely to have any reservations. I think it is a bit early yet to answer that question. Obviously, whether there should be some reservation in respect of certain aspects of the Convention, particularly in relation to the question of the federal system, is one of the matters that has to be considered. It is too early yet to say whether there would be any qualification of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the end, however-the States recognise this-it is solely the decision of the Commonwealth Government whether it ratifies and on what terms it ratifies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Transport to media reports indicating that Australia is losing air traffic controllers faster than the ability of the Department of Transport to recruit with the result that some airports-for example, Brisbane Airport-are being forced to close during night hours due to lack of staff. It has been reported that controllers have rejected a Public Service Board proposal for a more flexible rostering system and increased penalty rates. With these reports in mind, can the Minister advise whether the standard of air safety in Australia is deteriorating and what effect the shortage of controllers will have on general efficiency in the airline industry, including international flights and outback aircraft operators? Also, what action has been taken to endeavour to remedy the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has given me considerable information on this matter but I am not sure I can give Senator Kilgariff all the information he seeks in relation to outback areas and so on. I will seek that information from the Minister for the honourable senator. The Minister can assure Senator Kilgariff that the shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia does not affect standards of air safety, although obviously it causes some inconvenience. It is true there is a shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia, as there is generally throughout the world. The shortage in Australia is expected to be of the order of 110 controllers by the end of this year. The Minister has pointed out that the Department of Transport now has more air traffic controllers than it had in previous years. Also, the Department's training school is operating to its fullest capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because there have been 18 unscheduled retirements or long term illnesses among controllers in Queensland over the past year, as compared with a normal annual attrition rate of four, the effect of the shortage has been felt more in that State than in any other. Most of the air traffic controller losses in Queensland have been from the senior terminal area control position. It will take some months before 17 permanent and 7 temporary controllers transferred to Brisbane provide sufficient trained controllers in the senior positions to return that airport to normal operations. The effect of the closure of Brisbane Airport on airline operations will be alleviated when daylight saving starts in southern States in approximately five weeks time. Discussions are still taking place with airlines as to the requirements for additional flights in the period leading up to Christmas so that coverage for them can be provided. Furthermore, the three hour closure of Brisbane Airport affects one Qantas flight northbound to Tokyo. Qantas is arranging to ferry the passengers to Sydney for that flight.</PARA>

Honourable senators would understand that the administration of my Department is substantially decentralised through State and regional offices and it is possible for differences in practice, which we try to avoid, of course, to creep in but given the large number of people and offices that can occur. Speaking from memory, I think there were some variations from State to State but the uniform practice has now been established around Australia in the terms set out in that letter, namely, that an invalid pensioner who has had the pension removed on the basis that he is no longer 85 per cent incapacitated will continue to receive the pension until the appeal is determined, notwithstanding that may be longer than three months after the decision is taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The work already undertaken by the Fraser Government in the Eyre Peninsula region is a practical example of the Government's commitment to improving communications and television services for people in non-metropolitan Australia. I welcome the honourable senator's acknowledgment that the program to which he referred has been in progress since 1979. I understand his concern, as a South Australian senator, that the program should be completed in the shortest possible time. The honourable senator asked about the lead time. I am able to advise him that the lead time for the supply of equipment for a television service is at least 12 months for the provision of capital equipment, at least 18 months for the provision of program input equipment when a microwave bearer is involved and at least two years when land purchases are involved because of the processes which have to be undertaken. Such lead times commence when Telecom is instructed to proceed with a project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked whether there had been contact with the South Australian office of Telecom. The Department of Communications does not deal directly with the State offices of Telecom in matters concerning the planning and provision of new television services. The details required to enable Telecom to proceed with an installation are provided to Telecom's head office following Government approval for a project and the provision of funds in the Budget context. There are two stages in the development of any major broadcasting project: The preliminary planning stage, which involves field surveys, and the implementation stage, which is dependent upon financial approval and which includes such things as forward ordering authorisation and, of course, the provision of funds in the Budget.</PARA>

When preliminary planning is complete and full details of the project are available, the project will be considered again in the Budget context against the priorities of competing proposals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government is concerned about all the matters raised by the honourable senator which affect the interest rates and the possibility of home ownership in this country. Indeed, the Budget that is before the Parliament at present is cast in such a way that the Government will do whatever is possible to restrain the public sector borrowing requirement as it affects interest rates. It needs to be said again that the general level of interests rates is ultimately determined by market conditions. These in turn are influenced by the demand for funds in the economy, the market expectations and overseas developments at any particular time. There certainly have been substantial increases in interest rates over the last 12 months or so. I think, as has been said by the Treasurer and certainly by me, no one would wish to see interest rates at a level that makes it difficult for people to own their own homes or for the building industry to be able to be in a healthy state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, given the importance that we have placed on achieving the appropriate restraint in the growth of monetary aggregates as a prerequisite to reducing the rate of inflation, the Government has had no choice but to respond to these market realities and to allow the rates on Government securities to increase. The Budget that is before us makes a very limited public sector demand on the finances that would be affected by interest rates and I think what has been done by the Government in this Budget is to try to assist those who are in the market for home loans by restraining the demands that the Government makes on financial requirements.</PARA>

But as I have been accused of evading the question by the author of this book in a paper I saw today, I have refreshed my mind further by reference to the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission. I quote from the terms of reference, in amplification of the answer I gave Senator Ryan yesterday. She may be interested in it, but apparently she is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will quote the terms of reference. The Commissioner has been asked to inquire into a number of matters and I will refer only to those terms which are relevant. They state:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to correct some serious misunderstandings relating to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. I refer to pages 1 to 12 of the Hansard record of the House of Representatives Estimates Committee A proceedings for 8 September 1981. When the Estimates for the Parliament were being considered Mr Chris Hurford was valiantly attempting to gain the support of House Estimates Committee A for the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee and moved a motion to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, seemingly also eager to assist, then moved an amendment to Mr Hurford's motion which was agreed to and which called for a 'separate single-line Appropriation Bill' and noted the support of my Select Committee for such a procedure. As Sir Billy was one of the star witnesses, I am delighted to have his support, but unfortunately the Committee did not recommend that which the Speaker suggested. The Select Committee in its deliberations realised that, if the Parliament had its own separate Appropriation Bill, a single line appropriation would be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also another star in this saga, in the form of the Leader of the House, Mr Sinclair. In his efforts to assist, he claimed that the Government would be opposed to a separate parliamentary service. Mr Sinclair may be delighted to learn that that also was not a recommendation of the Select Committee. The recommendation was basically in accordance with the submission of the Public Service Board, except where the Board wanted to make it mandatory that the Presiding Officers consult with it. The Select Committee, quite properly, rejected that intrusion into Parliament's autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee's report is one of the most important documents ever to be presented to the Parliament with regard to overdue reform, and I aim to do everything I can to have its recommendations implemented. But I would ask that the report be supported or opposed on the basis of what it says, not what it is thought to say. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this matter of public importance today because I and the Australian Labor Party find the situation faced by Aboriginal and Islander people in this country intolerable. We find that that situation grows increasingly more intolerable. We find that there is a deteriorating situation with regard to Aboriginal health, housing, employment, their rights under the law and many other basic areas. What is most inexcusable in this whole situation is the inaction of the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is simply not good enough at this stage, when not only the eyes of Australia but also the eyes of the world via the World Council of Churches report have been turned towards the extraordinary disadvantage and oppression of Aboriginal and Islander people in this country, for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to say that he has nothing to be ashamed of, that he has nothing to be embarrassed about. After he has gone to enormous lengths to prevent the whole issue of Aboriginal Australia being mentioned during the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne, he is now saying that, if the matter is raised, he will be quite happy about it and he is unembarrassed about the situation that his Government is reponsible for. He may be unembarrassed. He may have no difficulty defending the present situation. But the Opposition is embarrassed. The Opposition finds the present situation intolerable and indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> All we can conclude is that at this stage we have a very weak government when it comes to Aboriginal matters. We have a very weak Prime Minister in the form of Malcolm Fraser. We have a very weak Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume. If all they can say is that enough is being done to solve the problems and that, in any case, most of these matters are matters for State governments, that is a weak response to an urgent and critical situation. It is a response from which we on the Opposition side resile completely. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Prime Minister so weak when it comes to dealing with Aboriginal matters? Why is it that he allows the likes of the Premier of Queensland to go about the country saying that the matter of Aboriginal citizens of Queensland is a matter for the sovereign Government of Queensland? That statement is constitutionally wrong. It is not a matter for the sovereign State of Queensland. It is a matter for the Federal Government and it has been a matter for the Commonwealth Government of Australia since the 1967 referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, and his Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, remain silent when the Premier of Queensland makes these outrageous claims? They know that the constitutional responsibility rests with the Federal Government. Why do they allow his assertion that it is simply a matter for Queensland to go unchallenged? They do so because they are weak and because they are not prepared to face any unfavourable political consequences that might arise if they were to challenge the Premier of Queensland and carry out their Federal Government responsibilities in opposition to what the Premier of Queensland wants. </PARA>
<PARA> How long are we to go on allowing this to happen in this country? How long are Aboriginal and Islander people in this country to put up with the Fraser Government's weakness in the face of the likes of the Premier of Queensland and, I must say, the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court? How long is their situation to remain unaddressed because the Fraser Government is too weak and too politically embroiled in the wrong way to take the steps that must be taken? I think it is timely to remind Government senators of their constitutional responsibilities as a result of the 1967 referendum. It is timely to remind them that the purpose of the referendum was:</PARA>
<PARA>to remove any ground for the belief that the Constitution discriminates in some ways against people of the Aboriginal race, and, at the same time, to make it possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to make special laws for the people of the Aboriginal race, wherever they may live, if the Commonwealth Parliament considers this desirable or necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are taken from the official pamphlet entitled Referendums which was published by the Government at the time of the constitutional referendum in 1967 and which set out the case for Yes. A case for a No vote on that referendum was, I am pleased to say, not presented. The pamphlet, referring to the proposed constitutional changes, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the House of Representatives and the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>have yet to learn of any opposition being voiced to them from any quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>If that referendum were put today, I imagine that a great deal of opposition would be voiced and we know from which quarter it would come-the Premier of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation proposing the constitutional amendments was adopted unanimously in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The constitutional amendments were not opposed by the States. The Aboriginal referendum was the first and, I understand, the only reference in Australian history to be carried in every constituency in the House of Representatives. Its majority was the most massive in Federal history. Why was the referendum held? Why was there a need for constitutional change? For a long period leading up to the 1967 referendum, criticism of the way State governments treated their Aboriginal citizens was met with complaints by the States that they did not have the money for adequate Aboriginal programs. The Commonwealth Government claimed that it did not have the constitutional power to assist. The States welcomed the decision in the 1967 referendum which allowed for Federal financial input and shifted the responsibility for Aboriginals on to the Commonwealth. The massive Yes vote in the 1967 referendum left the States, the general public and, particularly, the Aboriginal people looking expectantly towards the Federal Government. They were bitterly disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators of how long these issues have been going on. In an editorial entitled 'What Aboriginal policies?' the Australian Financial Review of 2 June 1967 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The people have stood up and been counted . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Now the testing time has come for the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been given an overwhelming mandate from the electorate to improve the lot of the first Australian settlers. If it does not act and act quickly it would be failing that mandate which was implicit in the referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1967. The Age of 15 June 1967 in an article written by John Jost entitled 'Taking the Responsibility' stated:</PARA>
<PARA> When more than 4 million Australians voted at last month's referendum to give the Federal Government power to legislate for Aborigines, most thought the Government had legislation in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> But at the present time the only plans the Government has for Aborigines is to count them in the next census. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the Government has been given the most overwhelming mandate yet given in Australia it already is apparent that the present division of Aboriginal responsibility which exists between the Commonwealth and the States will be perpetuated. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, they were prescient words written in 1967 as it is still the case that this unfortunate division, so deleterious to the welfare of Aboriginal and Islander people, between State and Commonwealth governments has been maintained by coalition governments. The Liberal-National Country party Federal Government between 1967 and 1972 failed to take the necessary steps to improve the living standards of and bring justice to Aboriginal and Islander Australians. That Government made promises to the Aboriginal people which it did not keep. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from an article appearing in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 14 November 1970 written by Wallace Brown which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>At that time, Mr Gorton-</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday pledged that all State discriminatory legislation against Aboriginals would be repealed in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA> He also indicated the Commonwealth was likely to take a hard line on this against Queensland, if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> He said: 'I promised in my policy speech last year that this would be done in the lifetime of this Federal Parliament and I see no reason why this will not happen'. </PARA>
<PARA>John Gorton said that in 1970. We know that it did not happen. We still have State discriminatory laws. In fact, just last week the Senate failed to eradicate one of them with regard to voting rights for Aboriginals in Western Australia. So it did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> For the huge infusion of funds, the development of a comprehensive policy on Aboriginal affairs and the upsurge in Federal activity to assist Aboriginals, we had to wait for the election of a Labor government in 1972. During the Whitlam years, Aboriginal affairs ceased to be peripheral to the affairs of state, a thorn in the side of a government that it would rather forget, and became an important area of Federal Government concern and activity. It was during this period of the Whitlam Administration that the majority of Aboriginal affairs programs, which the present Prime Minister has recently upheld as being demonstrative of Australia's concern and of the progress that is being made, were conceived and started. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the election of the Fraser Government, the area of Aboriginal affairs has been down- graded in terms of importance and financially. In real terms the allocation for Aboriginal affairs has dropped $213m under the current Government despite an election pledge that the level of funding would be maintained. I remind honourable senators that the allocation in this year's Budget was only $147m. There are plenty of figures with which we could contrast that pitiful sum. The one which is perhaps pertinent at this stage is the figure of $20m which has already been allocated to the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. At least $20m will be expended on a meeting which will last a week. For 200,000 Aboriginal Australians, $147m has been allocated for a year. The Prime Minister, in the face of this, says that he has nothing to be ashamed of. If so, why has he been so desperate to keep the issue of Aboriginal Australians off the conference agenda of the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting?</PARA>
<PARA> The current Government has failed Aboriginal people in two major ways: It has failed to protect the human rights of Aboriginal and Islander citizens, particularly against racist State governments, and it has failed to redress the gross disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians. Both areas were highlighted in the recent report of the World Council of Churches entitled 'Justice for Aboriginal Australians'. What I have seen, particularly in Queensland, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and in parts of the Northern Territory, confirms the findings of that report. The living standards and, particularly, the health of Aboriginal people are becoming notorious world wide as one of the most blatant examples of discrimination and deprivation in any free, democratic and affluent Western nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I need hardly remind the Senate of statistics which show a drastically reduced life expectancy for Aboriginal Australians. In some States the average life expectancy for Aboriginals is 20 years less than that of the non-Aboriginal population. Infant mortality rates for Aboriginals were, in 1978, three times as high as those for non-Aboriginals and perinatal mortality rates are worsening in many areas. Aboriginal children are 10 times more likely to have ear diseases than non-Aboriginal children and a much higher percentage of Aboriginal children suffer some degree of hearing loss. Trachoma, which in Aboriginal people often leads to blindness, is 15 times greater for Aboriginals than for non-Aboriginals, and in parts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia 77 per cent of the Aboriginal people are affected. Aboriginal people in northern Australia suffer one of the highest strike rates of leprosy in the world. Syphilis has increased amongst Aboriginals to 27 cases in every 1,000 and is increasing. Yet the Prime Minister tells us that he has nothing to be concerned about and nothing to be ashamed of in these circumstances. Surveys over a number of years in parts of the Kimberleys-for example, the Fitzroy Crossing school-have shown that the health of Aboriginals in those areas is deteriorating. This will continue to be the case while unhealthy living conditions, poor nutrition and poverty prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that when I visited the Kimberleys in April of this year I saw living standards in Aboriginal communities that were worse than the conditions prevailing in refugee camps on the borders of Thailand and Kampuchea, which I visited some 18 months ago. That sort of situation ought to be intolerable to all fair-minded Australians. Even in places where the Aboriginals had secured their own pastoral leases, such as Lake Gregory, Billiluna or Noonkanbah, the degree of material deprivation was severe. The Aboriginals from--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume interjects in a most inappropriate way. Because he will have the opportunity to defend the indefensible when I have finished speaking, I will continue with my remarks. The material deprivation of people living in places such as Lake Gregory, Billiluna or Noonkanbah was not as bad as that of the people in the community which had been expelled from Gordon Downs, whom I met while they were living in a shack on the outskirts of Halls Creek. Many of the old people of this community were blind or ill. The ears, eyes and noses of the children ran and the eyes of many of the adults were obviously diseased. They had their few possessions loaded on the back of a truck and they could not go out to the piece of land they had been allocated at Ringers Soak until they could somehow find enough money to buy provisions. These are circumstances that I have seen. These are circumstances that I could not believe existed in this affluent, modern country, until I saw them with my own eyes. Yet I presume the Minister, carrying out the task of his master, the Prime Minister, will be prepared to defend them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When faced with the desperation and hopelessness of such people, one cannot help but realise that the Federal Government has the power to prevent such occurrences. What can the Federal Government do? I remind the Senate that the Federal Government can secure land for Aboriginal people. This is the first and foremost obligation that it has, because it has become clearer and clearer to all of us interested in the Aboriginals and islander people that the secure possession of land is basic to any consequent improvements in their living standards. The Federal Government has inarguably the power to do that. In my view, and in the view of my party-the Australian Labor Party-the Federal Goverment inarguably has the moral responsibility to do it. If the Federal Government acts to do it, it will have the wholehearted support of the Federal Opposition and, I believe, the Australian Democrats in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Federal Government can act to prevent discrimination against Aboriginals by State governments. It can support, rather than impede, its Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr Al Grassby, in his attempts to enforce the Racial Discrimination Act. The Federal Government can restore funding for Aboriginal advancement programs to 1975 levels and, wherever possible, it can channel funds directly to Aboriginal organisations in line with its stated policy of self-management. However, the Fraser Government has, in the main, failed to do these things. If it believes that, by spending $147m out of a Budget of $41 billion on Aboriginal advancement programs, its responsibility to Aboriginals is discharged it is mistaken. This expenditure will still leave many Aboriginals in blinding poverty; victims of unemployment, homelessness, disease and neglect. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I refer the Senate to information provided to me by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in answer to a question on notice of 4 March 1981. The Minister confirmed that on Napperby Station in the Northern Territory 300 Aboriginal people live in four multi-room shelters. Five more are to be erected this year. This year's expenditure will, therefore, mean that the 300 Aboriginal people on Napperby Station will have nine shelters to live in. There is no water reticulation system and the water is carried from Napperby Creek. The Minister informed me that the Northern Territory Government is studying the feasibility of a proposal to build a dam. In reply to my inquiry as to whether Aboriginals at Napperby are paid award wages, I was told that six Aboriginal pensioners are employed as part time domestics at Napperby and that there is no award for domestics in the Northern Territory. A similar iniquitous situation exists on some Queensland reserves where Aboriginals are permanently classified as trainees and paid half the award wage. On a visit to Palm Island on Monday of this week I was told that the so-called trainee baker had just retired. He had worked in the bakery for 35 years and for the last 15 years had been in charge, yet he was still classed as a trainee and paid less than award wages. The violation of human rights on Queensland reserves is widespread and well documented in books such as Beyond the Act by Malezer, Foley and Richards, which I urge honourable senators to read. </PARA>
<PARA> The time allotted to me for raising this matter of public importance in the Senate has almost expired. I urge the Federal Government to acknowledge that it has a very special constitutional responsibility in this matter. It is not good enough and it is not plausible or acceptable to say: 'Let us wait and see what the State governments are going to do. Let us leave it to the Northern Territory Government'. It is not constitutionally proper for the Government to say that and it is impractical because of the vast array of documentation, increasing daily, about the disadvantaged situation of Aboriginal people when left to the mercies of State and territorial governments. In my concluding words, I urge the Fraser Government and its Minister in this place, Senator Peter Baume, to acknowledge their constitutional responsibilities, to stop being conned and frightened by the cries of people such as the Premier of Queensland, to act on their responsibilities and to remove the disadvantage and discrimination that exists against Aboriginal and islander people in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition in this period prior to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I believe that the case put by Senator Ryan was factually wrong and exaggerated and that she presented only part of what is a complex picture. One must wonder whether the article which appeared in yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser put stars in her eyes. This is the third Administration of the Fraser Government, each of which has had a commitment to Aboriginal advancement and each of which has pursued administratively the policies designed to improve and advance the welfare of Aboriginal Australians. In each of our policy speeches we have set out what we intend to do. We have pursued those responsibilities with vigour and determination. We are not complacent about the situation in which Aboriginals find themselves. We know how much needs to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the World Council of Churches report came out I acknowledged how much needed to be done. I indicated that the situation described in that report was an example of why we needed a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, why we needed a Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs and why we needed the amount of activity that is going on at present. But it takes more than a few years to reverse the trends of nearly 200 years, especially when they have been 200 years as sorry as those we have seen in Australia. We should do everything we can to improve the conditions of Aboriginal Australians. I only wish the Opposition would be co-operative with our efforts rather than resorting to slogans, quickie nostrums and confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance calls on us to work to ensure fair and just conditions. The honourable senator who advanced this matter says that the Government has a constitutional responsibility to ensure fair and just conditions for Aboriginal Australians. Irrespective of any constitutional lessons the honourable senator wants to teach us, I have already said that this Government acknowledges what has to be done, and we are involved in trying to do that now. Any fair-minded Australian would support our efforts. But what does the honourable senator mean when she talks so glibly about fair and just conditions? Let us look at what the law and the Constitution now guarantee to every Aboriginal citizen of Australia, indeed, to every one of us. It guarantees voting rights. Voting is compulsory for Aboriginals who enrol. We are committed to making the enrolment of Aboriginal people compulsory as it already is for all other people. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The individual's rights under the common law are the same across Australia. I note the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition. He might reflect on conditions in Africa and note that some people are aspiring to those sorts of things. Aboriginals in this country have access to the whole range of social security benefits. They have access to pensions, the unemployment benefit, the family allowance, the supporting parents benefit and so on. They have a right to award or minimum wages according to the law. We recognise, of course, that Aboriginal people face difficulties in access to these rights and privleges. We do not run away from those facts. We are doing what we can to face up to them, to acknowledge them and to overcome them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The World Council of Churches report-inaccurate perhaps at the margins-was nevertheless a reasonable catalogue of some of the difficulties in this field. But we have done a lot about those situations, and we are going to do more. I am sad that I have to keep reminding the Senate of what has been achieved in so short a time because these facts were so notably lacking in Senator Ryan's biased presentation. When will Senator Ryan get the message? Perhaps she does not want to. When will she be prepared to balance our achievements against the blemishes which we readily admit are still with us and which need to be addressed? Perhaps she does not want to acknowledge the achievements. Perhaps to do so is politically inconvenient. </PARA>
<PARA> I will repeat what we are already doing and point out just a few of the advances that our critics conveniently ignore. We have developed initiatives across a whole range of activities. We took up the thrust towards land rights. We introduced land rights legislation. We passed the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act through the Parliament in 1976. We have made that legislation work. My predecessor and I have accepted the findings of the Land Commissioner and we have granted land to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. As a result, large areas of land in the Northern Territory are now in Aboriginal ownership forever. Aboriginals who represent one per cent of the population already hold 10 per cent of the land area of Australia, more than half of it in perpetual freehold. The process still goes on; it is still continuing. We are looking at ways to improve the present legislation. I am engaged now in examining the possibility of getting extra capacity for land tenure in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at self-management, a subject conveniently ignored by Senator Ryan. Nothing epitomises the Government's commitment to real and steady progress in Aboriginal affairs better than our firm policy of self-management. We established the National Aboriginal Conference. Successive Liberal Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs have developed strong ties with the NAC. I personally meet frequently with members of this body. This week already I have had at least one meeting and several communications with the Chairman of the NAC. We meet with members of the Conference formally and informally. The Liberal Government set up the Aboriginal Development Commission in the last couple of years. If one listened to Senator Ryan one would think that we did nothing and did not care. This Commission is the most exciting initiative in practical Aboriginal self-management in recent years. Does Senator Ryan deny that? Of course she does not. She cannot deny it. The Commission, which is attracting considerable international interest, is run by Aboriginals. It is Aboriginalised in terms of its staffing. This financial year the ADC has taken over new and expanded functions on behalf of Aboriginal people. The Commission now holds property worth over $300m. This property is being held by an Aboriginal commission for Aboriginal people. It administers an annual budget now running at more than $50m. Why did Senator Ryan not think that was worth mentioning? It is one of those inconvenient facts that she chooses to leave out. That is real self-management; real Aboriginal progress. We set this initiative in motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely I do not need to remind the Senate of our continuing support for Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, another all-Aboriginal body which again is a most successful Aboriginal-run enterprise. The staffing of this body is 93 per cent Aboriginal. It operates 2,500 hostel beds across Australia. Senator Neville Bonner is one of the directors of Aboriginal Hostels, and has been since the inception of this most successful Aboriginal enterprise. Perhaps that is not worth mentioning either. This year we are supporting Aboriginal Hostels to the extent of $8m. </PARA>
<PARA> We have another good record in the fields of health and social welfare generally. More than 11,500 houses have been provided for Aboriginals since 1968. As I have said, Aboriginal Hostels has a capacity of more than 2,500 beds. Over 240 independent Aboriginal housing associations are now operating. Over 15,000 Aboriginal children are now in secondary school and receiving support. Last year 138 Aboriginals were utilising Aboriginal study grants at universities, 184 were undertaking teacher training, 681 were undertaking other kinds of tertiary studies and 229 were undertaking technical studies. Charles Perkins, who entered Sydney University soon after I left, was the first Aboriginal to enter and complete tertiary studies. This happened a mere 15 years ago. More Aboriginals are graduating from tertiary institutions. This year my Department has allocated almost $11m by way of grants through the States or grants-in-aid to educational processes. The Government supports 19 independent Aboriginal medical services. New services are being supported this year and the extent of support is increasing. Why did Senator Ryan not mention this? She did not because it was inconvenient to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We fund 40 Aboriginal alcohol rehabilitation programs. We are committed to providing $50m over the next five years to improving Aboriginal public health to overcome the very kind of problems to which the honourable senator referred. Our health funding is increasing. Infant mortality is dropping among Aboriginals and health figures are improving. But this was not mentioned by Senator Ryan. It was not convenient for her to do so. Eleven independent Aboriginal legal services operating from 46 locations around Australia handled more than 75,000 cases last year. My Department has allocated $6.5m on legal aid for this year. We have increased the allocation for legal aid by approximately 20 per cent this financial year. We have allocated about $11m directly for employment purposes this year. And so the list continues. In the remote areas of Australia we have introduced community development employment program schemes-CDEP schemes-which have provided work for about 1,300 people in the past year at a cost of about $7m. This was not mentioned by the honourable senator. It was not acknowledged because it is not convenient to do so, because a balanced view is the last thing she is going to present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government this financial year has provided more than $228m for Aboriginal advancement. Some $147m was provided directly through my Department, another $82m through the Department of Housing and Construction, the Department of Education and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and smaller amounts through departments such as the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Our record of achievement is real. It is something of which we can be, and are, proud. The evidence shows steady and continuing progress. The last decade has been one of improvement and of achievement. We do not propose to look back. We propose to look ahead to what we can continue to do. We accept that more can be done. However, here we part company to some extent with the Opposition. It seeks dramatic actions rather than steady progress. It seeks centralist controls. It seeks immediate and massive Federal intervention regardless of whether that is in the long term interests of Aboriginal people. The Opposition is always telling the Government to intervene, to confront, to emphasise disagreement rather than to build on consensus. It wants us to act in ways it thinks, in its innocence and inexperience in government, are decisive. We need only remember where that kind of thing led Australia between the period 1972 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of constitutional responsibility, I must again go over old ground. I will try to explain to honourable senators opposite what the Constitution says the Parliament can do in Aboriginal affairs. I shall try again to explain why confrontation may well be self-defeating. The Opposition would like us to think that the Constitution gives the Commonwealth wide and certain powers to do anything at all in the whole field of governmental activity relating to Aboriginal people. To imply that this Parliament has all-encompassing and unlimited powers is both misleading to the Aboriginal people and a misstatement of their legitimate expectations. Those honourable senators opposite who are qualified in law will know that placitum (xxvi) of section 51 has never been tested in the courts. Let us consider the situation prior to the 1967 referendum. The Parliament had power to make laws for the people of any race other than the Aboriginal people in any State for whom it was deemed necessary to make special laws. In introducing the Bill to amend the Constitution-Senator Ryan referred to that debate-the then Prime Minister, who was a Liberal Party Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Harold Holt, explained the position as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> An effect of omitting these words will be the removal of the existing restriction on the power of the Commonwealth to make special laws for the people of the Aboriginal race in any State if the Parliament considers it necessary. As the Constitution stands at present, the Commonwealth has no power, except in the Territories, to legislate with respect to people of the Aboriginal race as such. If the words-</PARA>
<PARA>He identified them-</PARA>
<PARA>Were deleted . . . the result would be that the Commonwealth Parliament would have vested in it-</PARA>
<PARA>I draw the following words to the attention of honourable senators-</PARA>
<PARA> A concurrent legislative power with respect to Aboriginals as such, they being the people of a race, provided the Parliament deemed it necessary to make special laws for them. It is the view of the Government that the National Parliament should have this power. </PARA>
<PARA>That refers to a concurrent power. The people approved that amendment and the restriction was removed. It does not follow automatically that the States lost any powers to legislate on this subject of Aboriginal Australians. The Commonwealth has, at best, concurrent powers with the States. Commonwealth law can override State law but only to the extent that it is a law with respect to Aboriginal people. Just how far that power goes remains a matter largely untested. The gamble is one in which the benefit of the Aboriginal people is at stake. The potential losers of any court challenge are the Aboriginal people-not the Australian Labor Party. They stand to lose if a court makes an adverse decision. They are likely to lose if a course which the courts do not support is taken. The people of the Torres Strait Islands, who are anxious to hold the land that they have held for thousands of years, will be the ones to lose if the Constitution is challenged and found wanting. I ask the Senate to consider that point seriously, but no matter the extent of the constitutional power, we know that the States retain some power and that our power is concurrent with theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Opposition that we live and must work in a federation. The Government believes in seeking co-operation with the States rather than confrontation as a first step. Even if one stretches the Commonwealth power to the limit there are things that States and local governments must do if Aboriginal people are to enjoy the full range of government services. Provocation and confrontation are not in the best interests of Aboriginal people-which is what I am concerning myself with today rather than the leadership aspirations of Senator Ryan or the interests of the Australian Labor Party. The Aboriginal people, as a minority in Australia, could well become the victims in any confrontation with the States. If the honourable senator's idea of constitutional responsibility is to create a situation in which the losers could be Aboriginal Australians, that is not the Government's view of proper responsibility or proper administration. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole matter of public importance has been raised at this time for the least reputable of political motives. Why was today of all days chosen? I will tell the Senate the reason. The debate is merely a curtain raiser to what Senator Ryan would like to think of as her grand strategy of embarrassment of the Government. It is not a strategy which has anything to do with the advancement of the true interests and well-being of Aboriginal Australians, which is what she should be worrying about. Who does she think she will embarrass? She will not embarrass the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), whose record of achievement in the view of the distinguished international visitors who will soon be in Australia stands in the highest esteem. She embarrasses only herself and the Opposition by putting up such a shortsighted, naive, misinformed and mischievous case. I believe that I have answered her case, and I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment: The use of phenoxy chemicals and chemicals containing dioxin, with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) their ecological effects; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) their effects on human and animal health</PARA>
<PARA>In June 1978 the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment tabled the progress report on the continuing scrutiny of the problems of pollution entitled 'Herbicides, Pesticides and Human Health'. At that time, the Committee was concerned by allegations of a connection between the use of certain agricultural chemicals and the possible deleterious effects on human health. Of particular concern were the phenoxy herbicides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. As a result of that concern, the Committee held informal discussions with representatives of Commonwealth government departments and agricultural chemical manufacturers. Several reports available at that time were also examined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted in this report that some State governments had instituted inquiries into the use of pesticides. As a consequence, the Committee deferred recommending a formal Senate inquiry until such investigations were completed. However, as the situation in relation to the use of pesticides and other chemicals has not been systematically examined and as concern at the possible relationship between such chemicals and ill health is still being expressed, the Committee believes that a formal Senate inquiry is now warranted. The Committee will examine the use of herbicides such as 2,4,5,-T and 2,4-D, defoliants used in Vietnam and other phenoxy chemicals and chemicals containing dioxin which are used throughout the community. As this matter is one of immediate concern to many Australians, particularly veterans who served in Vietnam, the Committee intends to report to the Senate by 30 June 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move an amendment to the motion moved by Senator Jessop. Copies of it have been circulated to honourable senators. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That after 'health', insert ', and that in considering this matter the Committee deal first with the possible effects on Vietnam veterans of exposure to herbicides and report to the Senate within eight weeks after this day on the desirability of an independent judicial inquiry into that problem'. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Jessop said in referring to a previous report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, there is considerable concern in the community about the possible effects on members of the community and on animal life of these chemicals which were used in Vietnam as a defoliant to destroy crops and clear jungle to make warfare easier. Senator Jessop, in speaking to his motion, said that this is an urgent matter and is of great concern. It is of great concern in particular to the veterans who fought in Vietnam. I believe it was in February last year that I moved on behalf of the Opposition in this place, a motion stating that this was a matter of increasing concern and that in fact there should be an independent inquiry into the effects on Vietnam veterans and their dependants of the use of these chemicals in Vietnam. Since then-in fact, even before then-there has been considerable agitation in the community particularly amongst Vietnam veterans and amongst returned servicemen's organisations in general, including the Returned Services League and, since a few weeks ago, the combined conference of veterans' organisations. Throughout all this time it has been claimed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) that there was no need for any inquiry at all; all that was needed was an epidemiological study which is being proceeded with by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> After all this time we believe that it is no good the Senate Standing Committee looking at this matter and then have us wait for another 12 months before we get any sort of report on this important matter affecting the Vietnam veterans. It seems to us that everybody in the community, with the exception of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Government, believes that there should be at least an independent judicial inquiry. As a fallback, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats were willing to look at establishing a Senate select committee to examine the specific problems of Vietnam veterans and their dependants and the possible effects of exposure to herbicides. We believe that partly as a means of avoiding this Senate select committee inquiry that the desire to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has cropped up. </PARA>
<PARA> We accept the fact that if the Senate Standing Committee is to look at the problems of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, then it would be a duplication and unnecessary burden on honourable senators to have a Senate select committee look at the matter as well. Equally, we believe that the problem of the Vietnam veterans is a special one and therefore that the Committee should look at this problem first. In particular, it should look at the overwhelming wealth of evidence to see whether, in fact, we should not have an independent inquiry into the veterans' specific problem. We believe that any investigation of this matter will conclude that in fact an independent inquiry is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, the problem facing Vietnam veterans is that of the sheer uncertainty of what is happening to them and their dependants. The problem relates to uncertainty about what effect on veterans exposure to chemicals in Vietnam will have. While we in this Parliament and people in the community continue arguing not on a basis of scientific fact or the evidence which has been produced overseas and in this place but on the basis of who is to be responsible for the payment of veterans' treatment, veterans will not receive justice. We believe they should receive justice. It is for this reason, in order to overcome this uncertainty and to clarify the situation, that we believe there should be a judicial inquiry. As the Government will not accept the establishment of a judicial inquiry, we have to accept initially, as second best, the fact that a Senate inquiry is to look into the matter. If a Senate inquiry is to look at the problem, it should first of all examine the specific problems of the Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that we have moved the amendment in order to get the Committee to do that promptly. I realise that the Minister wishes to discuss this matter with various people and that he intends to move the adjournment of this debate today. We will accept that adjournment today so that in the next few days we can discuss this matter and quickly get the reference to the Senate Standing Committee. We urge the Government to look at the matter seriously and to stop backing away from this very real problem which faces the Vietnam veterans. Only this week the Returned Services League at its national conference moved that this course of action be taken. In the past the League has been unwilling to take this action, but it now has. That makes the League unanimously on the side of the Vietnam veterans' organisations and on the side of political organisations in this country-with the exception of the Government and the Minister for Veterans Affairs-which say that this should be done. We urge the Minister to reconsider. For that reason I have moved the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted with interest the amendment moved by Senator Grimes. I will need a little more time to consider its implications. I am rather upset at the suggestion by Senator Grimes that it is only as a second best to a judicial inquiry that he would entrust the matter to my Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. The history of judicial inquiries is quite interesting. They take a long time and cost a lot of money. If one compares the reports presented by Senate standing committees-having regard to the fact that every parliamentary party is represented so that the committees present reports reflecting the community interest in a constructive manner for government consideration-with, for example, some reports of judicial inquiries that I have examined since being in this place, I think one will agree that the reports we present here, with the resources available to us, will be seen to be quite extraordinary and extremely good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate what Senator Grimes said about the need to come to grips with the problems of people who served in Vietnam. I think Senator Grimes would agree that they are very complex matters. It is difficult to make a quick decision on matters related to the effects of these herbicides not only on the servicemen themselves but also, in an even more complex way, on the effects that they may have on their progeny. I can assure the Senate that my Committee is very concerned about the matter not only in respect of Vietnam veterans but also the possible implications of the use of these chemicals in Australia in their effects on the health of humans in the community at large. I remind Senator Grimes that we have a capacity to enlist the support and advice of experts in genetic and biological matters relating to the use of these pesticides, and that is the sort of action that I as Chairman of the Committee would take and would recommend to ensure that we satisfy the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981 the Senate has heard only the speech of the senator who introduced the Bill, Senator Ryan. I understand that the intention today is to allow time for one contribution from the Government and one from the Australian Democrats so that the first three speeches on this Bill will then be before the Senate. It is my further understanding that the debate will be continued at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government welcomes the Senate's long standing interest in Aboriginal matters and welcomes the desire to examine and debate these matters. I welcome the chance today to add to the response which I gave to Senator Bonner in this place in Question Time on 19 August when he asked me about the Government's position in relation to the Queensland Acts. Of course, being a Queensland senator, he has a particular interest in this matter. It is unfortunate-and I said this earlier this afternoon-if the remarks made in this debate should be seen in some kind of an adversary situation because, I repeat, that what is of concern to us in the Government is that the interests of the Aboriginal and islander communities in Queensland should be protected and should be advanced. I will be sorry if the speed at which the Opposition wishes to pursue this matter leads us into some adversary position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the belief of the Government that the Bill is poorly timed, to say the least. Firstly, we believe the timing has been dictated by a number of partisan and political motives and not really with the best interests of Aboriginals and islanders in mind. Our view is that this not a felicitous time for the Bill to come in. We believe too that the Bill, in the form in which it was introduced, was inadequately justified to the Senate by its proposer. We believe, thirdly, that the Bill is poorly drafted. It contains even proof-reading errors. I refer Senator Ryan to clause 37 (3) of her Bill where there are several references to a 'Land Trust' but then the Bill lapses into talking about a 'Land Council'. Members of the Opposition have not bothered even to proof-read their Bill properly. Further, we believe the Bill is based on an inadequate understanding of Queensland legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to develop those arguments in a calm way, emphasising again that our concern is the interests of the Aboriginal and islander communities in Queensland. Let me start with the timing of the Bill. Senator Ryan put forward two reasons for the introduction of the Bill in its present form at the present time. Indeed, the argument that the Bill should be introduced now is a central part of her argument. Senator Ryan-I think I quote correctly-said:</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland Aboriginals living on reserves are facing a crisis, a crisis which is likely to be resolved against their interests by the Government of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>She further said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the threatened degazettal of the reserves is now imminent. </PARA>
<PARA>What crisis? I repeat: What crisis? The long-term prospect that reserves would go was foreshadowed by the 1978 report on Aboriginal and islander communities. That report envisaged only residential leases for what were then called older residents. That was in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the election commitment of the National Party in Queensland in November 1980 to make possible the repeal of the Queensland Acts the Premier and his Ministers have been reassuring Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders-reassuring them-that reserve lands are not threatened. I refer the Senate to public statements by the Premier, by the Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs, Mr Tomkins, by the Acting Minister, Mr Wharton, when Mr Tomkins is away. They have all gone to some lengths to reassure the Aboriginal and islander communities. They have said that some form of tenure allowing Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander control of reserve land will become available. They do not have that available now. The Premier himself has proposed 50-year leases for the communities. Mr Tomkins, the Minister in Queensland, has talked of perpetual leases. All of them have indicated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander participation in community management will be increased. All of this is a considerable advance both on the propositions of 1978 and on the November 1980 election propositions as we heard them. Any crisis has been manufactured by those seeking confrontation between the Commonwealth and the States for their own political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not true to suggest that this is some kind of last chance to win recognition of land rights in Queensland. It is silly; it ignores the history of the last 20 years during which Queensland has been moving progressively, even if very slowly, in changing its legislation and its administration of Aboriginal affairs, largely, I acknowledge, in response to Commonwealth pressure. Queensland has not announced any firm proposals for the land tenure or self-management which it hopes to see with respect to Queensland reserves. It has not as a government announced what those firm proposals are. Further, it is unlikely that any such proposals will be known until the end of October, the middle of October, perhaps earlier-I cannot say when. Indeed, at one stage the Premier spoke of referring the matter to a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate does not help by giving in to hysteria, to claims of urgency, when those concerned in Queensland have not even announced what it is they intend to do. It is very hard to condemn what has not been proposed. The Senate is likely to sit for some time yet, so what is the urgency? Senator Ryan claimed outside this place-in fact on a radio program on 1 September-that the Government would like to delay the matter and that if we delay we will be the ones to pay the political price. Surely by now she understands that it is the Aboriginal and islander communities who will have to pay the price. They will be the ones to pay the price if hasty, ill-considered Bills are rushed through. I urge her to stop thinking like a Federal politician and to start thinking of the constituents and the clients. Their interests should be dominant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is quite happy to discuss the matter. What discussion of the matter will reveal is that the Bill is ill conceived, poorly drafted and poorly timed. Perhaps Senator Ryan gives the clue in her second reading speech when she says that one reason for the urgency is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the imminence of an important international event to be held in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>And that is the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>

CHOGM has been meeting in different countries for a long time. It is not concerned with the domestic issues of member countries; it has never been concerned with the domestic issues of member countries. Senator Ryan's motive is to discredit the Government's standing and Australia's standing internationally for temporary political advantage. It is not a move which will work to the advantage or the advancement of Aboriginals or Islanders. What Senator Ryan in effect is saying is that this matter is urgent because the Australian Labor Party wants to make a big splash in relation to CHOGM. That is mischievous and indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the Commonwealth Government's position? On 19 August I told the Senate that four principles require to be encompassed in any settlement of the future of Queensland reserves. It is worth reminding the Senate of those principles. They were: That the integrity of the present reserve boundaries should be maintained; that there should be secure tenure for the occupants and preservation of their usufructuary rights, their rights to use the land; that local communities should play a significant role in the management of the reserves; and that there should be full consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people before any decisions are made. That sets out the Government's position. It is a very defensible position. It is a position which proposes a set of conditions which are to the advantage of Aboriginal and Islander communities. We are watching the situation closely in the light of those principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I am continuing to consult and to keep in touch with Queensland Government figures. I believe that they understand our position. Various ideas have been aired by Queensland Government spokesmen but nothing has been decided, nothing has been announced, in Queensland. How can it be urgent for Senator Ryan to override what has not yet been proposed in any firm form? The Aboriginal and Islander people are consulting each other now. They are consulting the Queensland Government. We are concerned to ensure that they have every opportunity to do so without distraction. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn now to pick up some of the semantics which tend to confuse the debate. The term 'land rights' is capable of many interpretations. Land rights do not have the same relevance to a situation in which there is a tribal structure or in which attachment to the land in question can be demonstrated as they have perhaps to the situation in Queensland in which in many areas there is less tribal structure and in which attachment to the land could not be demonstrated. Let me be quite clear about that: If the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act applied in Queensland many of the communities there would not be able to claim and would not be able to succeed in a claim for land. The Northern Territory land rights model is inappropriate for Queensland. It is a different model in a different situation. The conditions of that model do not apply to much of Queensland. We need a different model for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are seeking is adequate land tenure, secure tenure, and rights to self-management. Maybe that is what we should be talking about. Maybe we should be talking about the outcomes of tenure, security and management. Maybe they are the things that matter. The words 'land rights' have been confusing the debate and confusing the argument more than they have been helping it. Rights to land can be of an enormous range and variety. What is important is that a security of tenure is vested in the Aboriginal people in such a way that the land remains under the control of the community-it cannot be sold off-and Aboriginals can have self-management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept my colleague's comment that it cannot be alienated. The essential element is security of land tenure. Of course, there is a whole variety of ways in which that can be achieved and in which we should approach the matter. At this moment the reserves in Queensland are not secure. The Aboriginals and the islanders do not have secure tenure today. They can be de-gazetted overnight. They were de-gazetted overnight a couple of years ago in one notorious example. Therefore, any form of tenure in the hands of Aboriginals themselves is likely to provide a better situation than that which we have now. It would be an advancement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is: What is best for the long term interests of the Aboriginal people? Surely the Senate needs to see more of what is intended before we can really answer that question. We need to know what legal arrangements are proposed, just what legislation is to be repealed or amended. How can Senator Ryan suggest a pre-emptive strike before that is even known? We need to know something about the proposed administrative processes. We need to know that Queensland departments or agencies will have a part to play in any future arrangements affecting reserves and their residents. But at present we are being asked to take part in a shadow boxing match. </PARA>

The announcement of the Premier of Queensland that the Acts would be repealed should really be welcomed by Senator Ryan because that would do away with those features.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bonner cautioned against it because in fact those Acts contain protection as well as disadvantage for Aboriginal people. It is very important that we know what is proposed. Nothing in Senator Ryan's outline of Queensland Aboriginal history really justifies intervention today; nothing, that is, apart from the partisan political elements of her speech. Senator Ryan listed a number of specific aspects of Queensland's Act which she said she wanted to correct. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Aboriginal reserve councils do not have control over access to reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not so. If Senator Ryan goes to section 17(2) of the Aborigines Act she will find that the councils or the Director of the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement has power to eject persons. She will find that under section 20 of that Act the councils and the Director may give permits for residence. She will find that under section 24 of that Act councils alone give permits to visit. In practice, the councils almost always determine such matters alone. She is wrong on that. She said that she wanted to correct the aspect whereby 'reserve managers retain veto powers'. That is not so. The councils have absolute powers over entry by visitors. They may also veto applications for residence. I note also that section 27 of the Act allows for appeals to a magistrate from decisions of either the council or the Director. Senator Ryan asserted that she wanted to correct the situation whereby 'residence on reserves is revocable at any time by the Minister'. That is not so. Residence permits may be revoked only by the council or the director. Again, there is provision for appeal to a magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan asserted that we had to correct the situation whereby 'Aborigines on reserves can still be required to work for token payment'. That is not so. A decision of Mr Justice Mathews on 29 May 1979 in the Queensland Industrial Court stated in effect that Aboriginals on reserves had to be paid at the award rate for work. Section 11 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975, passed in this Parliament, proscribes the employment of an Aboriginal or islander on terms less favourable than would apply if the employee were not an Aboriginal or islander. The legislative structure is there which indicates that that kind of statement of the honourable senator's is wrong. Senator Ryan said that we had to correct a situation where 'transactions entered into by Aboriginals may be varied or cancelled by the Director'. This is only partly true. It is applied only to Aboriginals who wish to have their affairs managed by the director. They can opt out of such arrangements at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan asserted that we have to correct a situation where 'court proceedings for Queensland Aborigines on reserves are conducted according to different rules'. She is correct on that. Thank goodness she is correct on one of those things. An aggrieved person, of course, may appeal to a magistrates court. It seems, therefore, that Senator Ryan is unaware of changes made to the Queensland Acts in 1979. I want everyone in the Senate to note that the Commonwealth does not support what are collectively called the offensive provisions of the Queensland Aborigines Acts. That Commonwealth position is well known to Queensland authorities. The Commonwealth's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act overrides the provisions of Queensland Acts which are incompatible with human rights conventions. The honourable senator should have known that. The Act provides a defence for any Aborigine charged under these provisions. She should have known that. In relation to the drafting of the Bill, the honourable senator, in her second reading speech, said that 'none of the principles of this Bill are radical or new'. The Bill empowers councils to make any law for conduct, discipline and the wellbeing of members without outside involvement or parliamentary scrutiny and in any manner the councils decide. This could allow extreme penalties for trivial conduct without the right of appeal. Is that not radical or new?</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill exempts councils, under clauses 10 and 14, from application of Queensland laws and inserts no Commonwealth laws to fill the void. Under clause 18 the Bill imports a new and peculiar definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owner' which is certainly inappropriate to many of the Queensland reserves. Few of the residents of the Cherbourg, Woorabinda, Palm Island and Yarrabah reserves would qualify under the honourable senator's definition, and that may leave the land without beneficial owners. Clause 28 reserves minerals to the Crown in right of Queensland but limits Queensland's access to them. Clause 28 (5) of the Bill purports to impose an obligation on a State officer to register a title granted by the Commonwealth. What the honourable senator may not know but should have known is that the High Court of Australia has previously held such provisions to be invalid. Clause 40 would preclude a State officer-for example, a policeman-who was acting in the performance of his duty from entering upon land vested in a land trust without the consent of the trust. The Bill makes no alternative provision for the preservation of law and order on land held by a trust. The honourable senator says that there is nothing radical or new. How radical can one get? The question is: Would it work anyway?</PARA>
<PARA> I need to address myself to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the Bill. I refer to the work done by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs under the chairmanship of my colleague Senator Missen. In 1978 that Committee, in talking about the Queensland situation, said that the Commonwealth response to Queensland should be flexible and that it should deal with the conditions on different Aboriginal communities as it found them-that is, that it would 'not consider that a single general statute . . . provides the best means' of achieving Aboriginal self-management of reserves. That is referred to in paragraph 77 of the Missen committee report. I believe a unanimous decision was taken on this. Labor senators were present. No doubt Senator Evans was a member of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Missen says, indeed. This Bill would set aside a principal, important and sensible finding of the Missen committee. Senator Ryan claimed that the course of action set out in the Bill was recommended by the report of the Senate Standing Committee. In fact, the Missen committee report recommended specifically against proceeding in this way. This Bill would not allow the flexibility envisaged by the Senate's own committee which examined the matter in depth only three years ago. The Bill's internal inconsistencies between the self-management provisions and the land acquisition provisions make it unworkable and anything but flexible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at clause 42. Clause 42 of the Bill provides for a reserve to cease to be a reserve if land is acquired and vested in a land trust. Hence the first part of the Bill, which provides for self-management of reserves, would cease to apply. There would be no councils, no self-management -just a vacuum. Any government determined to frustrate the Bill could do so by tying it up in litigation. Who would win out of that? Certainly not the Torres Strait Island people or the Queensland Aboriginal people. We would be leading them to a road of litigation over years and years. The Bill asks the Commonwealth Government to acquire the reserves. The honourable senator knows that the Australian Constitution requires that this be done by payment of 'just terms' to the owners. The owners in this case would be the Queensland Government. Where would the money come from? How much would be involved? What other programs would the Senate wish to sacrifice for the Australian people to make way for this? How much better it would be if we could work to a situation of agreement and concensus whereby Queensland, the Commonwealth and the Aboriginal people could decide how the objectives we set out-security of tenure, self-management, preservation of the integrity of the boundaries, maintenance of the usufructuary rights and proper consultation-were implemented. If those things could be achieved by concensus how much better it would be for everyone-except the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does not achieve its objectives. Perhaps the drafting deficiencies could be overcome in time, but that only emphasises once again the undue haste and the lack of thought that has gone into this and the need for more time to examine some of the deficiencies in the drafting of the Bill. The scheme simply will not fit together. The Bill is not urgent until the Commonwealth Government knows what Queensland's proposals are. The details of Queensland's proposals are not expected for some weeks yet. I would stress again the Commonwealth position-a position which sets out a defensible set of proposals and propositions for Aboriginal and islander people in Queensland. People know what it is the Commonwealth wants to achieve. We believe these things can be achieved by proper consultation with the Queensland Government. These principles have set down the fundamental Commonwealth position, namely, integrity of the reserve boundaries, security of tenure-the right to use the land-and self-management. These principles set down the Commonwealth's position. We wish to avoid confrontation if we can do so. We wish to act only in the best long term interests of Aboriginal and islander people. The consultations are proceeding. Let us see what comes from them. Then it will be time enough to consider the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear that the Government has grave reservations or doubts about this Bill for many reasons, not the least of which is that the Bill is premature, ill-considered, poorly drafted and based on the misapprehension that Commonwealth intervention is both necessary and desirable or that it is necessary now. However, I believe that no one can deny that we should wait and see. My colleagues Senator Missen and Senator Bonner have indicated to me-I am very grateful to them-their intention to move an amendment to the second reading stage of this Bill. I merely foreshadow the amendment. In brief the amendment which they intend to move will suggest a deferral of any vote on the second reading of the Bill until the Senate has more and better information about the intentions of the Queensland Government on this whole matter. The amendment also has the added safeguard of proposing the resumption of the debate, in any event, to the next sitting day after the end of October. It is always competent for the Senate to make other arrangements if it so wishes. I think all honourable senators should consider very carefully the advantages to Aboriginal and islander people of considering and accepting this amendment after it has been moved. It is being sponsored by the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which considered the Queensland situation and came up with specific proposals, and also by the first Aboriginal Australian ever to sit in the Federal Parliament, an honourable senator from Queensland who understands what is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the overriding concern of this place must be for the welfare, in the long term, of the Aboriginal and islander people. Therefore, when the Senate acts, it should be sure that it does so on the basis of all information. Information is not available to date; it will not be available for some time. It would be premature to move in now. It would not help consideration of the Bill and I hope that honourable senators will support the amendment when the debate is resumed in a week or so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981 which has been brought forward by Senator Ryan has the support of the Australian Democrats. The points that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has made are many and varied and will, I think, be answered as I proceed with what I have to say on this Bill. However, I take one point at the commencement of my speech. To counsel a non-partisan approach and then to make a partisan speech on an issue such as this I find not only incomprehensible but also in extremely bad taste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill that we are debating we should not be debating. Indeed, it should not have been the responsibility of a private member of the Senate to introduce such a Bill. This Bill may have a series of weaknesses and problems in its drafting. I believe we will come to those matters in due course through the normal procedures in this chamber when we discuss the Bill item by item in the Committee stage, and that is as it should be. But if the Government had provided from its resources sufficient expert backup there would not be drafting problems. Indeed, the Government ought to have introduced such a Bill. Whilst the Minister says let us wait and see, I am quite sure that the Aboriginal people of Australia can only groan yet again. Have they not been waiting and seeing for the period of occupation of this country by white people? Has it not been their lot for over 200 years to wait and see? Yet we are counselled again: 'Let us wait and see'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National Country parties, at least in the federal sphere, are by their policies committed to the principle that all Aboriginals and islanders should be as free as other Australians to determine their own varied futures. Their policy also states that they intend to respond to the basic claims by Aboriginals for self-management, land rights, additional funds and self-sufficiency. While the Minister may withdraw from his own party's commitment to land rights, the Australian Democrats hold very firmly that the notion of land rights is one from which we should not withdraw until it has been achieved. Giving all of the other points that the Minister spoke of will not give the Aboriginals what they want. They want handed back the land that was taken from them. It is as simple as that. As one Aboriginal from Palm Island said to me only a few weeks ago: 'All we want in Queensland is the little bit of land that we have left'. It is as simple as that. Surely this chamber and this Parliament can be generous to such an appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that as this Bill moves forward through all its stages, not with undue haste, not with attempts to sidetrack it or to put it away, everybody in this chamber-since every party in this chamber is committed to the principles contained in this Bill-will speak in support of its principles and that we may put aside, at least for once, our own partisan feelings on this matter. Let us all support the principles, and let us then talk about how they may be achieved. If this Bill is not good enough or sufficient enough to achieve those principles, let us amend the Bill until it becomes sufficient to achieve them. Let us do that now, and let us proceed on that course until the legislation is complete. Let us do it not only for Queensland but also for every State so that by the time we get to the bi-centenary of the white invasion of this country, the Aboriginal population will also have something to celebrate. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back some way into history because I believe that there are afoot in Australia many misconceptions in relation to Aboriginal land claims. I should like to put down basically what our position is in relation to these claims. I think there are no dissenters from the acknowledgement now that the Australian Aboriginals were Australia's first inhabitants and that they came to this country, probably over the land bridge from South East Asia, before the Ice Age, some 40,000 years ago. From that time until the white invasion there were many contacts between the Aboriginal population of Australia and other groups. Indeed, there was some fairly extensive trading between Aboriginals, particularly in the north of my own State and peoples from various South East Asian countries. What is not understoood is that when the white invasion occurred the Aboriginal population did not simply give in, as the history books read-at least that is how they read when I and probably other honourable senators went to school-but a bloody war was waged in Australia between the original inhabitants and the invaders. Unfortunately, in Queensland, most of the official histories are silent on the resistance, the battles and the massacres that took place. It is only now that the historians are starting to document some of these matters so that all people in Australia may come to understand a little better those years which were so vitally important. I refer here to works such as Harry Reynold's recent work 'The Unrecorded Battlefields in Queensland'. This and other works being written by historians will, I believe, lead the white population to a better understanding of the Aboriginal population and its place in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1897 in Queensland we had reached the stage, despite this resistance, despite the battles, despite the massacres and despite many white settlements having to be abandoned because of the surprising strength of the Aboriginal resistance, where the Minister, that is the Home Secretary, was empowered under the Act to cause every Aboriginal within any district to be removed to and kept within the limits of any reserve in such a manner as he may prescribe. Also, the Minister was able to cause any Aboriginal to be moved from one reserve to another. In other words, by that time we had virtually reached a position of slavery in this country. We might wonder how we managed to get to that position when we discover that the instructions to Governor Phillip in 1787 were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> You are to endeavour by every possible means to open an intercourse with the natives, and to conciliate their affections, enjoining all our subjects to live in amity and kindness with them. And if any of our subjects shall wantonly destroy them, or give them any unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their several occupations, it is our will and pleasure that you do cause such offenders to be brought to punishment according to the degree of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the official instructions given to Governor Phillip. Of course, they were ignored. They were ignored to such an extent that in 1834 a Select Committee of the House of Commons reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It might be presumed that the natives of any land have an incontrovertible right to their own lands; it is a plain and sacred right which appears not have been understood. Europeans have entered their borders uninvited, and when there have not only acted as if they were the undoubted lords of the soil, but have punished the natives as aggressors if they have evinced a disposition to live in their own country. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: ' . . . if they have evinced a disposition to live in their own country'. In the report of another House of Commons committee in 1837, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These people, unoffending as they were towards us, have, as might have been expected, suffered in an aggravated degree from the planting amongst them of our penal settlements. In the formation of these settlements it does not appear that the territorial rights of the natives were considered, and very little care has since been taken to protect them from the violence or the contamination of the dregs of our countrymen. </PARA>
<PARA> The land has been taken from them without the assertion of any other title than that of superior force, and by the commissions under which the Australian colonies are governed, Her Majesty's sovereignty over the whole of New Holland is asserted without reserve . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is remembered that unsettled land has been sold by the Government of New South Wales . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it was sold by other States. It was sold off as though its ownership was undisputed. Yet, the committee went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . every part of this territory was the undisputed property of the Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention those items because what we have, and what we are looking at in 1981, is not the giving of land to Aboriginals but, indeed, acceding to land rights. I think that phrase should remain in use. The situation that we have in Australia is that the complex and unique relationship built up over those 14,000 years of Aboriginal occupation of the land of Australia means that they have a relationship to that land which was theirs-a relationship which was not, as it were, owned by them but which was part of them. I would like to quote from Father Pat Dodson's description of their relationship to the land because I believe it captures something that we cannot capture even in the four points that the Government has put forward. Those four points might settle white people's consciences but they will not settle the spiritual demands of the Aboriginal people. Father Dobson said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We heard land being described as a ''piece of dirt''. That would be the same as someone who considered St. Peter's as just a barnyard to the Catholics. But for the Aboriginal people land is a dynamic notion; it is something that is creative. Land isn't just bound up with geographical limitations that are placed on it by a surveyor, who marks out a plot and says: ''This is your plot''. Land is the generation point of existence; it's the maintenance of existence; it's the spirit from which Aboriginal existence comes. It's a place; a living thing made up of sky, of clouds, of rivers, of trees, of the wind, of the sand, and of the Spirit that's created all those things; the Spirit that has planted my own spirit there, my own country. It's something and yet it's not a thing; it's a living entity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal people are not asking for security; they are asking for their land. They are not asking for usufruct; they are asking for their spirit. Let us not do what we are counselled against in our religious traditions-that is, when they ask for bread, give them stone. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the position for which the Minister for Aborginal Affairs has argued in relation to this Bill, suggesting that it is ill-considered, ill-drafted and ill-timed. I believe it may be ill-timed because it is long overdue; and it may be ill-considered because all it does is give the Aborigines the land that is left. That it is ill-drafted is something with which we can surely deal here, with good will among all honourable senators. We are dealing specifically with land in Queensland. I think it is important to look at the position of the Queensland Government in relation to lands in that State. Let us allow the Queensland Government to speak for itself, and turn to the documents of that Government. I start with a statement made in 1977 by the then Minister for Lands, Mr Tomkins, who is now the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs. It is pertinent that we should look at a Minister for Lands because, as I am sure the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs knows, Aboriginal reserves in Queensland are not held under Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Acts but rather are held under regulations of the Lands Act in Queensland. Mr Tomkins said:</PARA>
<PARA> If this programme is extended . . . it would create a 'black state' across the whole of northern Australia-surely apartheid in extreme and an introduction of the South African Bantustan policy to Australia, a situation the Queensland Government will not tolerate. It concerns me not because they are black but because this area would be allowed to become a burden on Australian generosity. </PARA>
<PARA> If Archer River was sold to whites they would have to pay for it and run it on profitable lines. We refused to approve the transfer because we saw no evidence of Aborigines doing this. In fact, it would be harmful for them to be given it. </PARA>
<PARA> They're good employees, good horsemen and musterers. It just seems to me most are on unemployment relief. It's all very well to say Aborigines own Australia because they were here first, but we think that if they want to get hold of certain lands they should do it the same way as whites-</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure whether he would actually suggest that they rob and pillage it as whites did, but he continued:</PARA>
<PARA>-work, make money, buy a block of land, and pay it off . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It was whites who developed Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, is quoted in the Canberra Times in relation to Mr Tomkins latest suggestions that perhaps perpetual leases may be introduced. The Premier said 'no way'. He is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We've made them Queenslanders-let's take them further on the way. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But no way will they be given land rights. </PARA>
<PARA>A media release issued a short while ago by the Premier stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Equality and progress for Queensland aboriginal and island people was the continuing policy of State Government, the Premier, Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, said today. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy will result in the successful integration of our indigenous peoples into the mainstream of our community . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He said the Queensland Government opposed the Commonwealth Government's ''old hat policies of the failed Whitlam era'' because they promoted separate development and isolation of our indigenous people from the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The media release continued in like vein until its conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> What the radicals want backed by the Commonwealth is a land grab or just another version of the old ''cargo cult'' mentality. If the radicals got their way the aboriginals and islanders would be thrown into some type of socialist commune with the radicals skimming the cream off the indigenous cake. There are forces abroad trying to create a nation within a nation and these must be resisted in the interests of a greater Australia and a brighter future for all Australia in a peaceful, comfortable and equal society. </PARA>
<PARA>A peaceful, comfortable and equal society for whom? After those statements of the Queensland Premier, despite the sanguine gloss placed on the Queensland Government by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I think I am not so sanguine that any position held so strongly by the Premier of Queensland will be overturned in the interests of the Aboriginal people. To put such a suggestion is to fly in the face of everything that the Queensland Government has done in relation to Aboriginal affairs. Indeed, it flies in the face of that Government's attitude to Acts passed by the Liberal-National Country Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence the Bill is seeking to do two things. It seeks to have the Commonwealth take over from Queensland approximately 2,287,000 hectares or 1.8 per cent of the total area of Queensland. It is then proposed that this land be given freehold title and be given to the Aboriginal communities to be governed by the Aboriginal communities. I suggest that whether we do that now, next year or in 10 years time there will be no end to the white problem of the Aboriginals until the Aboriginal people have that land. They must have the land and they must have control and ownership of it. I believe that then and only then will we see some start to a genuine integration of the white and black communities in Australia. It is then that they will be able to take their rightful place in Australia, we will be able to set about settling that racial hatred which has grown up for so many years in this country; and at last we will be able to settle our debts to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill asks no more than that. It asks no more than that we accede to all of those international treaties which we have signed such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the International Labour Organisation declaration concerning indigenous people and their relationship to their land. We accept all those treaties and we are currently in breach of all those treaties. The fact that the type of action envisaged in this Bill will lead to integration, I believe, is a matter not of wishful thinking but very much of hard political reality and, more importantly, economic reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast the way people react to statements of the Northern Land Council with the way they react to statements of the National Aboriginal Conference and ask: Why? It is very simple. The Northern Land Council is an economic power to be reckoned with. It has land, mineral resources and money and those things speak in white Australia. The National Aboriginal Conference has the voice of only the dispirit peoples, the original inhabitants of this country, and it speaks with a very quiet voice, certainly in the Senate. I think that is why the land, if it is given back to the Aboriginals, will provide them not only with their spiritual desires but also with their economic base upon which to integrate into a broader Australian community as a power to be reckoned with in that community in a way in which it actually means something in the forums of this land. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I ask honourable senators to think on a particular proposition-a hypothetical proposition, but one which I believe brings home, at least to white people in Australia, what Aboriginal people feel. Let us assume that during the last war the Japanese had, indeed, captured this country. I was born during that war and I am quite sure that my parents, in pointing to those people who had taken our land by invasion, would have said: 'This is your land; it is not theirs. They may be controlling it and they may be running it but it is yours'. I would say to my children, who are now growing up: 'This is your land; it is not theirs. It is yours to own'. I think I would have been devastated if they had said to me: 'That is in the past. Forget about that. That means nothing'. It does mean something. It means something to the Aboriginal people because that is the time span involved. A couple of generations is all that we are talking about. It is a couple of generations from the time when in my State people in fact went riding on a weekend to shoot Aboriginals for fun. That is the reality of this country. I have met someone whose parents were killed in that way. For us to say that that is in the past and means nothing now must be one of the most ungenerous, disgusting statements one could ever hear. </PARA>

<PARA> As a senator representing Queensland in this place, I take this opportunity to thank the electors of Queensland for the support they have given to the Australian Labor Party Senate team, to myself and to the other members of that team. Since arriving in this place, I cannot help but be affected by the manner in which the Parliament is conducted-the remoteness of the proceedings from the people of Australia. This remoteness and the added secrecy of the Government are shown clearly in the Review of Commonwealth Functions in 1981. The Budget brought down last month further removes the Government and the Parliament from the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget is a document that isolates the Government from the people. It shows that the Government has no feeling for the plight of the small man It is a Budget that widens further the division that has developed in our society between the haves and the have nots. On housing, the Government has decided that the young intending home buyer should be placed on the rental treadmill, and that he should never be able to get off. It has crushed the Australian dream. The Government has abolished the Community Youth Support Scheme. The announcement was made in the Budget. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme on October 31, 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has said to the youth of Australia: 'Because you are unemployed, we do not want to, or need to, assist you in any way-not even to find employment. We are only a government of the haves'. But what did the Government do to employed people? It increased the amount of tax payable. Sales tax increased-a value added tax by another name. Students, single parents, pensioners and war veterans-few people have been left untouched by the ruthless actions of a government that has pitted itself against the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I take some points in relation to the Budget, let me return to the booklet 'Review of Commonwealth Functions' the razor gang's bible. I turn to page 22 of this booklet under the heading 'Home Affairs and Environment', sub-heading 'Uranium'. I was totally shocked by the following entry in this infamous publication:</PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for the regulation and control of nuclear activities in Australia to be implemented as far as possible by the States and Northern Territory, with the Commonwealth maintaining a co-ordinating role. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a rather clear and concise statement under the name of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson). Responsibility for control of nuclear activities is to be implemented as far as possible by the States. Let us take a moment to reflect on who controls the States of Western Australia and Queensland-Premier Court and Premier Bjelke-Petersen. I note that Mr Bjelke-Petersen could scarcely get to his telephone quickly enough to applaud the concept. </PARA>
<PARA> But the matter is not so clear and concise. Following a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, the first point that confused me was that the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, stated that the question more primarily concerned his portfolio. Either the Minister for Home Affairs could not answer the question or there was a misprint in the booklet on the razor gang cuts, or the item referring to the control of nuclear activities being handed over to the States should have appeared under the portfolio of Senator Carrick. It would now appear that, according to Senator Carrick in answer to my question:</PARA>
<PARA> Matters that largely affect the States are health matters. </PARA>
<PARA>I would not like to entrust my health to the two Premiers mentioned. Senator Carrick stated further that a Commonwealth code had been sought from the States and was 'substantially obtained' in the code of mining as it concerns the mining and milling or uranium. If this is the case, if the States do have a code that covers mining and milling, why have accidents such as the reported spill of an overflow or radioactive material from the Queensland Mines Ltd uranium development in the Northern Territory not been reported? In a report dated 21 August 1981, the Office of the Supervising Scientist-A Federal watchdog and research body-is concerned at the implications of an alleged failure to report on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as the Minister claims, the matters that affect the States, such as health matters, have been covered, why are the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is responsible for the Kakadu National Park, and the Northern Territory Land Council also critical of the company's monitoring program? Where is the code of mining concerned with the mining and milling of uranium that should have stipulated conditions that would not allow any spill to occur? But the health hazards do not end there. What of the report of radioactive material having leaked from a stockpile of uranium ore at a mine in Queensland? The Queensland water control council is concerned at radiation levels in a creek near Charters Towers. Radiation at Ben Lomond Australia Ltd's uranium mines in North Queensland was double the acceptable health level. </PARA>
<PARA> During the wet season in February 1980, tests undertaken by the water control council of the seepage from the ore stockpile showed radiation of 120 times the acceptable level. If honourable senators were to read some of the material available on the leaks and seepage from the Ben Lomond mine they would realise that no mining should take place in this area because of the danger to the people of Charters Towers and surrounding areas. The rural Press has played down the spill dispute, despite the fact that 60 cattle properties and 6,000 head of cattle line the water course. Next we will be able to export radioactive beef to America! Water is a very contentious issue since pumps feeding the town proper broke down in January, forcing locals to rely on rain water for their water tanks. If the pumps had not broken down, what might have been the result to the people of Charters Towers, the town near the mine?</PARA>
<PARA> The company engaged in this project at Ben Lomond is Minatome (Aust) Pty. Ltd-a company 100 per cent foreign owned. This company intends to spend some $60m in developing an open cut underground mine and treatment plant. Full scale production is due to begin in 1985. The company has to produce somewhere in the vicinity of 200,000 tonnes of ore per year. This would produce 400 tonnes of uranium per year. Three thousand five hundred tonnes have already been stockpiled in what one could consider a makeshift arrangement. Because of this stockpiling the trouble began. Late last January the normal heavy rains started to fall in the Ben Lomond area. This tropical downpour is normal for Northern Queensland each year. Following 20 days of such rain a leak developed in the sealed covers over the ore allowing a build-up of water in the stockpile, then an overflow from the tanks. As well as the overflow of radioactive water, cracks appeared in the concrete wall. Leakage seeped into the perimeter drains leaving dark brown stains and yellow stains on the concrete. Grass around the area is dying and has turned black. </PARA>
<PARA> The company's report stated that this water would probably contain dissolved radom-uranium and radium-which is one of the reasons why the grass is dying around the area covered by seepage. The fact that the company's own report contains this information is quite frightening. What steps are being taken by the Federal Government or the State Government to protect the water supply of such towns as Townsville and Charters Towers? Any overflow of material from the storage area into Keel Bottom Creek could mean in the new wet that occurs in this coming January-February that the whole Burdekin River could be contaminated as a result of mining the Ben Lomond site. This fear is more profound because it has been pointed out by Frank Stacey, Professor of Applied Physics at the Queensland University, in a statement under oath in the Mining Warden's Court of Charters Towers, that uranium mining would put at risk the safety of a dam proposed to be built in the Burdekin catchment area. Surely no government would be insane enough to allow the uranium mining or the extension of uranium mining in the Ben Lomond area without first making sure that no risk was attached to the proposed mining or any further development of underground mining and enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the miners working in the mine? In a further report to the Warden's Court, Charters Towers, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Underground miners working a French-owned uranium deposit in North Queensland may have been exposed on occasions to levels of radio-active radon gas as much as 60 times the recommended level, according to documents lodged in a Queensland court. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> According to documents produced in the Charters Towers Mining Warden's Court, high levels of exposure may have occurred at intervals over a period of about 8 months from mid-1979 at the Ben Lomond mine. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose compensation will be paid to the miners if they have some problem in relation to their work. Should these matters not be settled before consideration of further mining occurs or, for that matter, before any sale of uranium takes place? I believe the Government should look closely at the operation of the company here and elsewhere in Australia. One can only ask what action has been taken, or is proposed to be taken, under the code that Senator Carrick thinks has been 'substantially obtained' about the State's concern in relation to the mining and milling of uranium. I respectfully suggest that the Senate's Science and Environment Committee seek all relevant information so that it can be given to the Government, to the Parliament and, most importantly, to the Australian people. Surely the secret methods of this Federal Government must cease. It should allow for the complete list of all safeguards-whether for the development or the sale of uranium-to be made public. All environmental reports and impact studies should be made available to all electors to peruse. People can then assess the dangers to themselves, their children or to the town in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the Budget and refer to the demise of home ownership-the destruction of the dream of young marrieds of owning their own home. Political leaders should realise that the average Australian's expectations from increased prosperity are twofold. They are increased employment opportunities and increased opportunities for home ownership. This Government will be judged on its performance in achieving these expectations. Let us look at the overall reduction by this Government in regard to funds for housing. There has been a reduction in the Federal Budget's expenditure on housing from a total Budget outlay in 1974-75 of $1,413m, or 3.9 per cent of the total Budget outlay, to $399m in 1981-82, or one per cent of the total Budget outlay. This in itself shows that the Government has not provided money for housing in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the major cities the increase in the price of houses and land has been brought about by speculation in the market, rising interest rates and the unreal and unfair increase caused by the application of the new sales tax legislation which means that commodities that were taxed are now taxed at a higher rate and those commodities that were not taxed prior to the Budget are now to be taxed. This alone will increase the cost of houses for young couples by at least $500 to $600, to say nothing of the increases in land development costs for house blocks brought about by sales tax on road building materials. In spite of growing housing needs, the public housing stock has been eroded and the building industry has now begun to stagnate. The dream of every Australian family to own their own home is rapidly becoming a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's policy of continuing interest rate hikes is turning Australia into a society of rent dwellers. I think time precludes me from going through the increases in rental rates that have occurred in the metropolitan area of Brisbane. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) should mitigate the crippling effects of this latest Budget by providing a full income tax rebate on housing loan interest for first home buyers. Cosmetic approaches to this fundamental problem are simply not good enough. A government that obliges businessmen with a 100 per cent tax rebate on borrowings to consolidate their business activities has a moral responsibility to guarantee similar security for the family-the unit that used to be regarded as the vital backbone of our society. Each time there is a rise in interest rates the Government reaps a bonanza from the interest declared on savings accounts and investments. This extra revenue could be used to offset the tax rebate to first home buyers and to generate a dramatic boost in the housing and construction and ancillary industries which employ about a quarter of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in interest rates over the last 18 months shows the cost burden carried by home purchasers. The overall effect will be to polarise Australia into a society of landlords and tenants. The Government is not only satisfied with causing this polarisation but also is creating a position where it is starting to push for a program of transportable homes to overcome a shortage of homes on a short term basis which, of course, it considers a long term basis. This means that the 'have nots' will finish up in cheap housing estates which will be erected on the outskirts of metropolitan areas where they will suffer from inadequate services and high transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened to one home buyer's dream. To understand the problems of high interest rates in our society and the problems facing young couples let me take the case of a young married couple who live in Brisbane. This couple is well known to me. The couple I will use to explain this position are Mr and Mrs Douglas Smith, who purchased a house in a close city suburb of Brisbane called Ashgrove. Mr and Mrs Smith signed a contract to buy their first home, the purchase price of which was $35,500. The Smiths were successful in receiving a loan for $30,835 over 25 years. The interest rate from the building society they borrowed from has risen from 11 per cent to 11.25 per cent, to 11.75 per cent to 12 per cent and by 1 April 1981, to 12.5 per cent. Next month it will rise to 13.5 per cent. But those facts are not the end of the story. The Government's policy of forcing up interest rates has left Mr and Mrs Smith with a house that originally cost $35,500 now costing, after 25 years, $93,500. With the extra one per cent rise in interest rates they will be left with the cost of their home moving to the astronomical sum of $101,100. I believe that Mr and Mrs Smith will not forget this Government for at least 25 years. I believe that unless the Government can reduce the burden of interest on first home buyers, Mr and Mrs Smith, and for that matter Mr and Mrs Australia, face an impossible task of paying for their $101,100 home. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me touch on another point, namely, the changes to the health policy brought about by the Government in Brisbane and throughout Australia on 1 September 1981. The changes in the health policy from 1 September have caused profound problems that this Government and, indeed, much of the community, do not yet fully realise. The ramifications of the Government's actions can be seen in the chaos at the Greenslopes Repatriation General Hospital in Brisbane. A decision has been made to introduce fees at this hospital from 1 December. The fee for inpatients was lifted to $125 a day. The fee for outpatient consultations was lifted to $15. If that is not enough, intensive care will cost anything up to $1,000 a day. The infirm at Greenslopes were notified of their sudden financial liability in a letter from the Department of Veterans' Affairs dated 21 August 1981-ten days before the new charges took effect. They had only 10 days in which to make arrangements to pay up or get out. Ten days were given these mostly elderly people, who are ill and confined to a hospital bed, to find $125 a day. For the desperately ill in intensive care 10 days were given to find $1,000 a day. This is an awe-inspiring display of compassion by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). People have deluged the medical staff with requests for clarification of the new measures. The medical staff have offered no help. They have not been notified by this Government. Doctors asked the Chief Medical Officer whether he would please notify the medical staff what the changes meant. He replied: 'What can I tell you when I don't even know.' Every day he received different directives from Canberra. The medical staff were not able to give one iota of information about the changes-nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Doctors and staff at this hospital are justifiably proud of the high standards of health care that have resulted from professional dedication and the interaction of specialist medical personnel, entitled veterans and non-entitled patients from the general community, who form the bulk of patients attending the excellent specialised units, particularly that concerned with hypertension, and a number of others that I could name. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst pensioners, disadvantaged people and entitled veterans can still obtain free treatement, the loss of a substantial number of non-entitled patients will reduce the clinical mix of patients and restrict the wide variety of clinical material available at this hospital. The specialist units will no longer be highly regarded and specialist staff will be attracted to other hospitals where their skills can be more fully utilised. An inevitable consequence of reducing the number of community patients will be the loss of accredited registrar teaching posts. If a patient were admitted with a complaint covered by a veterans' entitlement, he would receive free treatment. But if the same patient developed complications, such as cardiac arrest, and was unable to meet the new charges, he would have to be carted around in an ambulance until some hospital that would take him for free treatment, or somewhere where he could at least find the money to pay, could be found. It is yet another example of this Government's myopic approach to economic decisions without any regard for the consequences, only this time it is placing human lives in jeopardy-lives that were once offered in defence of the principles of this very Parliament, principles that this Government so wantonly lacks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is improper for the Government to give an undertaking to provide a community service-to enter into a social contract to provide a patient with free treatment-and to renege halfway through that treatment without warning. It is inhumane to permit a patient who has been anaesthetised under the impression that he is undergoing free treatment, to awaken from his operation and be presented with a bill for $125 a day for as long as it takes him to recover. No doubt this Government gives a whole new meaning to the term 'post-operative shock'. Hypertension from a kidney abnormality is not an uncommon complaint. In the last 12 months, Greenslopes has developed a technique to relieve such hypertension by opening up renal arteries without operating. The doctors introduce a catheter, attached to a balloon, into the artery. The balloon is inflated, expanding the artery to improve the flow of blood to the kidneys. All of the local free hospitals refer patients to Greenslopes for this particular treatment, which cannot be performed anywhere else in Brisbane. The endocrine clinic at the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital also is the only one of its type in Brisbane and took years to develop. Other hospitals will now have to develop this expertise and that will not be easy. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year rumours about the possible changes gathered momentum at the hospital as staff began to see the writing on the wall. Seven full-time specialists have resigned already this year and at least an additional six senior doctors have accepted appointments at other hospitals as a direct result of this Government's attitude to the health care needs of veterans in Queensland. The mass exodus of medical staff is due to a deep ethical concern that the high standards they have established at Greenslopes can only deteriorate after these severe cutbacks begin to take effect. The medical staff feels that it has been betrayed, that while it has been led to expect a modern, progressive and respected hospital, the effects of imposing fees there-alone of any hospital in Queensland-will act to the detriment of the hospital, of entitled veterans, of other patients and of the medical and nursing staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Commissioner, Mr Gray, has assured that staff that he supports everything it has said about the crisis at the hospital. The Minister must acknowledge that the position in Queensland, which has an established free hospital system, is different from that in other States. As the responsible Minister, it is his moral duty to protect the interests of veterans in this country. If he is not prepared to exercise that duty, in all conscience he must impose a moratorium on fee introduction at this hospital until the full consequences of the decision can be more closely examined and patients allowed adequate time to prepare for any financial changes. If he will not, if he considers the opinions of his Deputy Commissioner regarding the problems at this hospital to be irrelevant, he must institute an inquiry into the effects of the introduction of those fees. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the dinner break I spoke on a number of points in relation to the Budget. One other point I will deal with is that of lone parents, yet another area of family neglect in this Budget. The lone parent family is chronically ignored by this Government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures in May 1975 which indicated that at that time there were 164,800 single parent families living in cities and towns, or 9 per cent of all urban families in Australia. In 1979 the number of lone parent families rose to 272,000 or 12.8 per cent of all urban families. These are the latest figures available to date. If that rate of increase were sustained, there must now be more than 300,000 lone parents in Australia struggling to support their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This growing number of people is displaying extraordinary courage in the face of severe emotional and financial stress. Most of them are desperately trying to hold on to their jobs and care for their children at the same time. The added pressure associated with raising a family forces many of these people into part time employment. The decrease in the availability of part time employment has had a marked effect on single parent families forcing many of them on to social security pensions and placing them at a far greater risk in terms of poverty. I will quote from the ministerial statement of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) presented after the Budget. He unashamedly declared:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to enhancing the position of all families. Australian families bringing up children are perhaps the greatest beneficiaries of sound, responsible economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>That is splendid. Further on in the statement we also learn:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has been very mindful of the difficulties facing single income families. </PARA>
<PARA>A little further down the page, however, we discover just how mindful this Government really is with the sublime announcement that the income tax rebate for sole parent families would be increased by a whopping $21 a year. Mr Deputy President, $21 a year is about 40c a week; that is assuming these people have incomes. Those lone parents with three or more children will get some relief through family allowance adjustments. If we disregard the increase in the income tax rebate-it is not difficult to disregard this increase-these lone parents with some employment and one or two children will get nothing from this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant number of the 300,000 lone parent families exist below the poverty line and include some whose incomes are slightly too high to qualify for public housing. Like so many others, these people will never realise the Australian fantasy of home ownership but will be committed to rental roulette for the rest of their lives. So much for this Budget's enhancing the position of all families. The reality of the increased hardships these people must face betrays the blatant hypocrisy in the Minister's attempt to defend this brutal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of the Community Youth Support Scheme is yet another indication of the Government's disregard for the misery it is creating in its enthusiasm to adopt the recommendations of the razor gang. It is disgraceful to think that a government guilty of nurturing the conditions that have forced so many kids on to the streets now plans to remove the last avenue of hope that thousands of teenagers have of finding a meaningful place in our society-'our society', not theirs. This is a society that constantly surrounds these people yet remains at a distance, often quite beyond their grasp. What is the point in struggling towards single digit inflation, a Budget surplus, a neat balance of payments and other nebulous economic goals if the quality and very meaning of life itself vanishes in the process? It is vital to reassure the young generation, and for that matter other generations, that governments care about our future society. For these kids, that future society will be theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no valid reason to fear a book entry expansion in a Budget deficit if the money released is used to underwrite the community's confidence in its own worth. However, today there is a diminishing confidence in the direction this country is taking under the throttle of the Fraser Government. Nowhere is that confidence more eroded than in the legion of unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I join with other honourable senators in congratulating you on your election to the office of Deputy President of the Senate. If I may presume to say so, I am sure you will fulfil your duties with impartiality, competence and dignity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I deliver my maiden speech, I am mindful of the fact that Western Australia was the only State in Australia to return three Liberal senators at the last election. While I gather Senator Chipp might be inclined to take a different view, I believe the result was very much a reflection of the Western Australian voters' attitude towards the federal system of government and the continuing belief in State rights and the preservation of State governments. I venture to suggest that such a proposal put by way of a referendum to abolish States and their parliaments would be ignominiously defeated by the people of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are, I believe, fortunate to have a federal system of government and I do not agree with those who think that the forming of the Commonwealth out of six colonial governments was an unfortunate concession to the political reality of parochial loyalties and a crippling disadvantage to the unity of the nation. On the contrary, I think that the Federation has been a great advantage to Australia and a circumstance that lends itself to better government. The importance of State governments is too often underestimated and even deliberately maligned. I am well satisfied that the majority of Australians and certainly the great majority of Western Australians, are opposed to the centralising of power in Canberra. The express condition upon which Western Australia entered the Federation was on the basis of equal representation in the States' House-and this vote was only carried due to an overwhelming vote by eastern States goldminers prospecting in the Kalgoorlie goldfields. </PARA>
<PARA> Had there been no States' House with equal representation and with its present powers built into the Constitution to protect the less populous States like Western Australia and Tasmania, there would have been no Federation as we know it at that time. In fact, notwithstanding, Western Australia felt so dissatisfied with the central decision-making of the Federal government in the 1930s that it voted to secede. Because I do believe in Federation, because I do believe in the federal system, because I have been elected to the States' House and because I have the honour to represent Western Australia, I believe it is proper that I talk about what is special to Western Australia and what Western Australia has to offer the Federation of Australia. One cannot help but note that over the years those in this chamber who have spoken most forcefully on behalf of the States they represent have invariably come from the States with small populations and modest numerical representation in the House of Representatives. New South Wales and Victoria combined have the capacity in the House of Representatives to out-vote the combined members of every other State. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure there is a temptation for members in this chamber to see the Senate as a States' House in direct inverse proportion to the number of members their States have in the House of Representatives-at least on this side of the chamber. When we consider that Western Australia has 12 members in the House of Representatives out of a total of 125 members, honourable senators can see why Liberal senators from Western Australia take a special interest in matters before the chamber which affect our State. There is of course no basic incompatability between support for the principles of a party which is committed to federalism and a determination to defend the best interests of your State, when those interests are clearly threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the great State I have been elected to represent, I will just reflect upon that which has been achieved. Western Australia has come from the Cinderella State of Australia in the 1950s to a model of growth for the future. Geographically, it covers one-third of the Australian continent. Its land surface extends over 2.5 million square kilometres, making it as big as India and four times the size of Texas. Beyond our 12,500 kilometres of coastline, Western Australia reaches out to the new international off-shore limit, embracing a further 2.5 million square kilometres of economic territory. Although we have only 8.7 per cent of the nation's population, we earn 20 per cent of Australia's export income and, by 1990, we expect to have 10 per cent of Australia's population and to earn 40 per cent of the nation's export income. By the end of the decade, we will have overtaken the population of South Australia, the first time one mainland State's population has overtaken the population of another state since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Resource development over the past 20 years has expanded our work force by 300,000 people and, with their families, the number of people affected rises to 600,000. This type of development and growth in Western Australia over the past 20 years has put Western Australia in a position in which it provides: one tonne in eight of world alumina, one tonne in ten of world iron ore, one tonne in twelve of world nickel, one tonne in five of world mineral sands, one bushel in three of Australia's wheat, and one bale in four of Australia's wool. As I said earlier, our exports contribute $1 in $4 of Australia's overseas earnings. The economic performance shows up in indicators such as housing. With one in 12 of the State populations, we build more than one in eight of the nation's homes. In education, we have one in eight of the entire population undergoing post-secondary study. During the last year, Australia's employment grew by 2.6 per cent while Western Australia's grew by 4.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, there are those on the eastern side of Australia who do not seem to understand the benefits that flow to them. It should be understood that, of the 600,000 people I have just referred to, 200,000 are on the eastern side of Australia. In fact, one can extend that figure further. Taking into consideration what Western Australia as a whole purchases from the eastern States, over 500,000 people in the eastern States are employed directly due to Western Australia's purchasing power. By 1990, if our growth continues according to plan, this number will reach nearly 800,000. Or, to translate that statistic into another figure, Western Australia bought $2,300m worth of goods from the eastern States last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that the principal beneficiary of this wealth and growth is the Federal Government which in turn redistributes it throughout the Australian community. Of every $5 of taxes raised through the resource sector in the west, $1 remains in Western Australia and $4 of the $5 goes directly to Canberra. If one is to look at nationwide figures, it will be seen that the States retain 15.6 per cent of total industry taxes and the Federal Government receives 79.1 per cent. Taking a constant group of companies within a survey for the Australian Mining Industry Council, we find that sales revenue increased by 31 per cent over the previous year but income tax payable to the Commonwealth rose by 73 per cent compared with the previous year. If the question of what benefit this development has for all Australians is asked, I suggest that it is self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth that has taken place in Western Australia is not the result of good luck, chance, or manifest destiny. It is a growth geared to the development of resources. Over the last two decades, this has occurred only because leaders of industry and finance have had the courage and foresight to make courageous and long term decisions and because the elected leaders have sought to attract this investment. Whilst the growth of Western Australia and its contribution to Australia over the past two decades have been impressive, the future growth will overshadow all past investments. Within the next six years, some $13 billion worth of resource projects will take place in Western Australia and by the end of the 1980s, notwithstanding what I have heard in recent days, that will rise to somewhere between $30 billion and $40 billion. This expanded development will create for us a further 150,000 jobs. However, all this development may well be at risk if the fragility of the resource sector is not clearly understood. </PARA>
<PARA> If insensitive economic decisions are made without a clear understanding of the implications to the resource industry, much of Australia's future prosperity could be lost. Whilst a tight monetary policy may be desirable as an instrument to hold down inflation and as an incentive to place some restraint upon wage demands, it will, of course, have the effect of holding interest rates at a dangerously high level and place considerable restrictions upon the ability of the private sector and the public sector to provide services and infrastructure vital to the viability of many projects. Until the Government is prepared to grapple with the problem of two competing economies in this country, I do not believe we can look forward to Australia receiving the full benefits from the potential that our mineral wealth offers us. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been spoken of the damaging effects that the large capital inflow into this country will have upon our economy. It has been argued that unlimited infrastructure borrowings from overseas or raised domestically have the effect of crowding out and will lead to an increase in interest rates. As long as we have a tight monetary policy and a highly protected secondary industry, that is a fair proposition. It can also be properly claimed that, in itself, a high monetary inflow associated with the investment stage of the boom is likely to be followed by high monetary inflows associated with exports of the production from the boom sector. As a result there will be upward pressures on the value of the Australian dollar. There are, of course, mitigating arguments against these propositions but, in broad principle, they are a fair statement of the position. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is an elementary proposition that there are two obvious solutions to overcome the inherent difficulties that large capital inflows into this country cause. The first is to ensure that there is a compensating outflow of capital and the second is to provide a sufficient capacity within Australia to provide a greater share of available funds for these projects. The first case calls for lower tariffs and the second requires that there be less competition for funds from governments seeking money for non-productive purposes. If one wonders about the cost of tariffs in Victoria alone Australian taxpayers provide $2 billion a year to protect inefficient industries-$139m more than the Western Australian Government's total Consolidated Revenue Fund this year. Protection loads the costs in Australia by $1 in every $20 in the economy. Yet we often lavish more concern on these takers than we do on the givers. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the case of the motor industry which is currently spending a huge amount of money telling Australia that it has a right to contribute more minuses to the economy. Last year, even though real economic recovery is far from here, employment grew by 140,000 jobs-140,000 in one year-which is more than all the jobs associated with the motor industry put together. I have heard it said that, if we put all the motor workers on a pension, closed their factories, and imported all our cars, we would make a handsome profit as a nation. Now, of course, I am not against an Australian motor industry. I am in favour of an Australian motor industry-provided it goes about its business with the idea of producing a plus, not a minus. And the same goes for a great many more that are in the same boat. If it is good enough for the motor industries of the major countries to start working together on an international basis in order to be more competitive in competing for the consumer dollar, it makes sense for the Australian motor industry to get with it and stop living in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot of rhetoric about consumer protection but we do not see much practised in the big protected sector of Australian industry. The fact that there are many successful and competitive Australian industries-industries which are building up Australian export earnings-demonstrates that we can succeed without protecton if we move our industrial efforts in the right direction. Regrettably the burden of protection does not fall only on the consumer. It falls heavily on the competitive producer and especially on the cost structure of that producer. Of course again I speak of the farmers and miners who earn three-quarters of our export income in competition with the world. These are the people who prime the pump of the economy. These are the people whose plus contribution and whose multiplier impact spreads real benefits through the community. Yet we hear the clamour for more taxes-special taxes and punitive taxes-against the successful. And we hear the same wisdom urging massive support for the failures who already receive $1 out of every $20 note circulating in Australia. It is part of the cult of punishing success that we have a duty to reward failure. Yet the punishment of success surely reduces the rewards for everyone-including the failures. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning again for a moment to the problem facing us of skilled and semi-skilled labour which is vital to the commencement of these major resource projects, I point out that, if there is not a movement out of the inefficient sector of industry into the competitive sector, no tight monetary policy will begin to succeed to dampen down wage demands. I have no doubt there is going to be a blow-out of wages in certain sectors and it is inevitable that there will be flow-ons throughout the rest of the work force. This, of course, will certainly lead to rising inflation and company failures in the sectors that cannot match the wage rises. It is quite clear that economic manipulation will not control wage inflation especially as income tax is already expected to rise by 22 per cent due to the very inflation we are supposed to be controlling. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major factor retarding development in this country is the demand that is made on available money by the Federal Government to fund programs in no way related to stimulating the economy or the nation's prosperity. In fact, quite the reverse! This Government has to make up its mind whether it believes in big government or small government. Words do not take the place of deeds. There seems to be an absolute faith that if you have said it you have done it. One example this year was the razor gang. Its long labours led to a list of cuts representing about one-eightieth of the Budget. But the increase in Budget outlays was eight times the size of the alleged cuts. Worse still, whilst the Federal spending was expanding, just about the whole of the razor gang cuts involved money to be taken from the States. In fact Federal taxation, which took 24 per cent of the economy before Whitlam and 25 per cent after Whitlam, took 28 per cent after the latest Budget. As a consequence, total public sector spending, as distinct from taxation, which soared from 32 per cent to 38.2 per cent of the economy under the Whitlam influence and fell back a little after the change of government, is now back to 38.1 per cent, mainly due to central government spending programs. During the past six years, in real terms, State expenditures have fallen slightly-about 1.2 per cent-and Federal outlays have expanded enormously. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the problem in simple terms is to give priority to encouraging people to create new sectors of the economy-the people who take risks by having a go-and not to give priority to people who simply consume, who do not take risks but simply take money. In the past, the great difference between the dead economies of socialism and the live economies of capitalism and enterprise was the risk taking difference. If we go on having too little regard for those who take risks and want to bleed them to death the moment they succeed while having absolutely no pity for them if they fail, we will destroy the difference. It has been truly said that the entrepreneur, in taking risks, gives without being sure of getting and the socialist takes without being sure of giving, often not caring whether he gives. To put it bluntly, I see evidence of Liberals in government worshipping the graven images of socialist idolatry, expressing a sordid belief that sterile gods can work real miracles to save an indolent people from the horrors of working for a living. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been spoken about the resource boom, mirage or fact. In truth, if the private sector is not given encouragement and incentive it will quickly evaporate into a mirage. Given the right economic environment, it will flourish. Let us not for a moment believe that development is inevitable. Of every 1,000 possible projects, 100 are studied, 10 are drilled and only one becomes a project, at an average proving cost of more that $30m and rising. </PARA>
<PARA> Mineral earnings bear a 60 per cent tax burden and, after the last Budget, mining companies have been devastated by new depreciation provisions. Anyone who has any practical knowledge of running a business knows that the depreciation write-off has been grossly unjust for years. A company buys something for $1m and is allowed to write-off $1m. It might cost $3m to replace it, so it has been done out of $2m of depreciation write-off to replace its asset. Worse than that, it has been taxed on money that was not a real earning at all, but was needed in effect to repair the asset financially by replacing it. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation has never been equitable but it became inequitable almost to the point of destruction when Whitlam inflation struck the economy and thousands of enterprises went to the wall, along with a quarter of a million jobs. I saw one assessment done by a Melbourne share broking house during this period which demonstrated that at that time corporate Australia could well have been taxed at the rate of 120 per cent of what would eventually have been seen to be its true earnings after real depreciation multiplied by inflation. In the Budget just brought down the write-off period in the mining industry has been doubled from five to 10 years. This slashes the benefit of the write-off by one-third on a discounted cash flow basis. It now literally means that two-thirds of the investment cannot be written off in real terms, and the cost of financially repairing it by replacing it will be treated as income and taxed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the greatest threats to the immediate expansion of the resource sector is the restriction placed upon States in the borrowing for essential investment in infrastructure. This is having a domino effect right around Australia. Let me give just one example. One of the major benefits this country has over its competitors is its potential to generate relatively cheap power. The Victorian Government had intended its overseas borrowings to provide generating capacity to the Portland aluminium smelter. However, its borrowings have been significantly reduced and it has had to increase its power charges to get money from revenue for its investment program. Suddenly these charges for Portland power increased by what the Victorian Government said was 25 per cent, what Alcoa said was 33 per cent but what, when the sums were done, in fact turned out to be 40 per cent. As a result, the Portland project is back in the melting pot. </PARA>
<PARA> Half of the output of the Wagerup alumina refinery being built in Western Australia is dedicated to Portland. Any delay or deferment of Portland means a delay or deferment that could affect half the capacity of this new alumina refinery. But that is not the end of the potential domino effect. Wagerup is planned as a user of North West Shelf gas and its demand helped to reinforce the Western Australian State Energy Commission in making a base commitment to one-fifth of the Shelf's gas to help to get the project on its way in a very difficult earlier stage. The net result could be that the Western Australian Government could be put in a position of having to pay for gas which it is unable to sell, to say nothing of the enormous cost of the Dampier to Perth pipeline. Portland is not the only smelter to be affected in such a way. So far, four smelters have been deferred or shelved. </PARA>
<PARA> The ironic part of it is that there was once a fairly common agreement that Australia wanted to be something better than a quarry for the world and to get the benefit of processing and making metals of its minerals. The great tragedy for Australia is that successive governments have given the Australian people to believe that we have a divine right to wealth and prosperity; that notwithstanding the frailty of human nature there will always be an abundance of everything and affluence is a birthright. Governments have taught the modern generation to believe that government action will cure all ills and government intervention and support are the panacea to all problems. The debilitating effect has been to create the level of expectation far above that which governments can provide. The net result, given that we have three-year parliaments, is governments lurching from one poor economic decision to another in the vain hope of filling the voters' unobtainable expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> Long term economic strategy has been the casualty and the real losers are the Australian people. One of the strong arguments for extending the term of the Parliament is to provide governments with the opportunity to take tough decisions and to stick with them. This country has a unique opportunity now in the world community to grow and prosper in a way rarely available. Let us have courage and grasp it before it passes us by and competing countries take part of our future as part of theirs. I thank the Senate for its indulgence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. May I add my formal congratulations on your election. I cannot attempt to match the lacerating wit and debating skills of my predecessor from Western Australia, Senator Wheeldon. My strengths and my modus operandi are different from his, but I take reassurance from the fact that difference does not necessarily denote inferiority. That is for the electorate to judge. I am deeply conscious of my privilege and my obligation to represent the people of Western Australia to the utmost of my ability. I pay tribute to the Australian Labor Party for its enlightened approach to equality within its ranks and to better representation of its female membership in parliamentary terms. My grateful thanks go too to my friends and colleagues in the trade union movement for their guidance and encouragement. I am especially proud that the Australian Council of Trade Unions adopted last week the humane, progressive and widely accepted position on abortion proposed by its women's committee, proving conclusively that, even though the ACTU is and will be for some time a thoroughly male dominated institution, it can listen and respond to what women workers are saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In travelling the many kilometres from one side of this continent to the other I have frequently considered the effects upon Australians generally of isolation in its many forms. The scattering of a relatively small population over a very large territory obviously entails heavy costs in transport and communications and less quantifiable costs in insularity, often expressed as State rivalry and acrimony, verging lately on open warfare as Fraser federalism forces State governments into policies for which someone must be blamed. Another effect of isolation of which I have become acutely aware over the past seven years as a trade union official is the low level of expectation of the majority of Australian workers, who have no knowledge of labour standards which are considered a matter of course in most comparable industrialised societies. For example, in Australia managerial prerogative is alive and well and in many instances is still trying to impose nineteenth century solutions on twentieth century problems. Those ancient philosophies are aided and abetted by a no less anachronistic Federal Government and some State governments, especially those which can only be perpetuated by gerrymandered electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite international conventions which have been in force for decades, we in the trade union movement have been forced to mount full scale cases in which to achieve relatively minor entitlements, such as unpaid maternity leave for privately employed workers. The principle involved is that no worker should be sacked simply because of a protracted inability to work, a principle adopted by the House of Lords a century ago. This is enshrined in the labour laws of most European countries, but the notion still shocks Australians-workers and bosses alike. Job security is a myth for the majority of Australian workers employed on a weekly contract regardless of perhaps decades of loyal service. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no such thing as a permanent job, according to a spokesman for the Australian Confederation of Industry speaking at a conference on sharing out the work at the Australian National University in July 1979. There is no such thing as a decent length of contract either for most Australian workers, unlike their European counterparts. Equal remuneration for workers of equal value has, one could justifiably assume, become a fact of industrial life, but the isolationists of the Western Australian Industrial Commission have vigorously avoided such equity by persisting with a token margin of $3.60 in order to establish a Western Australian male minimum wage, which is just slightly in excess of the State female and the national adult minimum wage, thus rating for Western Australia a special, unflattering footnote in the publications of the International Labour Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Workers everywhere should have been heartened by the achievements of the super-isolated workers previously employed by the late unlamented British Phosphate Commission on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Having struggled against amazing odds to establish a union, the workers were pitted against the most entrenched colonial-style exploitative employers that it is possible to imagine. 'Repugnant' and 'outmoded' were amongst the criticisms of Commissioner Sweetland, who was appointed to investigate the phosphate industry upon which the island is utterly dependent. Totally united and intelligently led, the workers have learned to use their industrial strength and have also become aware of the force of international opinion in their altogether justifiable fight for parity with Australian wages and working conditions. Their living conditions are not so easily raised to comparable mainland mining town standard, but the struggle continues. The women who work on the island-like all the other wages workers they are Chinese or Malay-might have been expected to await passively their turn but, recognising their own worth, they have declined to be set aside and have insisted that their claims have equal priority. I admire them. I admire their courage, and tenacity, and I value their friendship. It is not necessary to maroon people on a tropical island in order to isolate them. This and previous Fraser Government Budgets have clearly shown this to be true. </PARA>
<PARA> The young seeking employment, households on low incomes, the chronically unwell, those on pensions, single parents, the handicapped and the homeless are progressively being more effectively shelved, their real choices minimised and their existence made precarious, too many of them are just one week's wage or one welfare cheque off destitution. I am eagerly awaiting the results of a current study by the Institute of Family Studies in which preliminary data indicates very tight family budgets, high use of hire purchase and personal loans and the impact of rising home interest rates. The study will give, according to the recent annual report of the Institute, a clearer picture of the economic circumstances of families as they vary across the life cycle and as they are affected by the economic climate. I believe there are some nasty shock awaiting those who believe that most Australians are comfortably situated. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that the isolation about which I am speaking-this deprivation of a sense of community-is a heartless and deliberate ploy by a Government determined to maintain privilege and wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the masses. Why else would the relatively inexpensive Community Youth Support Scheme have been axed, except that it was providing a focus for otherwise aimless and directionless young people? Let me read a letter from a young Western Australian. I dearly wish that it could be reproduced in facsimile so that it would be obvious to all that writing this letter was a prodigious effort. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I came to our local CYSS four years ago with my friends. I was an irresponsible, law-breaking youth. The group decided CYSS was somewhere we could go without too much hassle. It was the only link between us and government departments like Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> I continued my involvement with CYSS for three years. The faith and support of the project officers, when other government departments gave up on me, helped me gradually change my antisocial behaviour. They supported me when I went to court, and made me more aware of myself. I started learning to read and write again after eight years of school failed to teach me how to do either. CYSS project officers were the only government workers I could communicate with. </PARA>
<PARA> CYSS never changed me to fit society, but helped me to survive in society. They found me a job which I have had for over a year now. I am hoping to start my own business, which I could never have dreamed of doing 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no government department that can achieve what CYSS has done for me and others like me. There is real need in the community for CYSS. Can anything else replace it?</PARA>
<PARA>A young woman from the same suburb writes graphically of her feelings. She states:</PARA>
<PARA> With CYSS you have always got somewhere to go, and you are not stuck in your flat climbing the walls. CYSS is also a place that you don't have to go . . . You go because you want to go. When you are hungry cold and are short of money you can come to CYSS and sit near the fire and keep warm and the money you get for bus fares you can buy food with. The closing down of such schemes is to me and other people one of the biggest mistakes that the present Government has made. Subsequently, it seems to me that the present Government does not care about unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the people who, with Aborigines and migrants, are so easily disenfranchised and on whose behalf the Australian Labor Party sought to have a single electoral roll introduced in Western Australia. The resentment of these people is running high. The Government must be banking on all the fight being knocked out of them before the next Federal election. The Federal Government seems to be shrugging off its responsibilities at every possible opportunity, despite the fact that, like the Community Youth Support Scheme, it costs very little to provide shelter and support for those in need. Some of my colleagues seemed to be stunned recently when the cost of reasonably satisfactory accommodation, care and counselling for homeless young people was estimated at about $100 a head a week. The social cost of not providing for such needs, when they are required, is of course immeasurably greater. Some indication can be gained from the fact that institutional care in prison or hospital will certainly cost more than $100 a day, not to mention the human misery, degradation and alienation which so often accompanies the deprivation which we now see developing. The following are the words of a worker in the field:</PARA>
<PARA> The young people catered for are a very mixed lot. Their mutual meeting ground, both physically and psychologically is the CYSS house, a retreat, a starting point, or just a place for relaxation. Since the Budget announcement, I have watched these young people withdraw into tight little balls of despair. 'Where do we go now' is the overwhelming question. With backgrounds or broken homes, overbearing parents, familial alcoholism, or single rooms, just where will they go? Even the brightest of young people using CYSS appear to have experienced some form of familial or social distress. Will they now be discarded until they reach the point of emotional disablement requiring the services of yet another, more expensive government agency?</PARA>
<PARA>Women as workers and as recipients of welfare are particularly vulnerable in this present type of economic climate to exploitation on the one hand and to the lack of support for themselves and their families on the other. Women from low income households have always had to earn extra money to keep their families out of poverty. The significant change over the last decade or two has been the institutionalisation and commerciatisation of much of women's traditional work, along with the expansion of those industries which have customarily employed women. Despite the best efforts of the trade union movement it is still very easy to exploit women through blackmail-no milder term will suffice-as is happening in an ever-expanding range of caring occupations providing essential services. Family planning, family day care, child care, youth hostels, women's refuges, sexual assault counselling, Aboriginal and women's health services and domiciliary care are more and more dependent upon workers who are forced into accepting less than award wages, working overtime under stress without extra pay, and even in some cases donating back part of their wages in order to keep the facilities functioning. Of course we believe that communities should be involved in identifying their own needs and in providing solutions to those needs. But the day to day organisation of services such as those to which I have referred must be undertaken by appropriately qualified people working under proper industrial conditions. Exploitation based on the vulnerability of the client is insupportable and probably illegal in many cases and, in the sense that it is being condoned by both State and Federal governments, scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA> Health and education policies have grave implications for women. Nurses and other hospital workers all over the nation are working short-handed and under pressure, desperately trying to maintain high standards of care and cleanliness. Women teachers are insecure and are under much the same stress. The Victorian Council of Academic Staff Associations predicts a loss of 9,000 teacher training places for female school leavers in 1984, and the same picture is mirrored across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Children's services as a source of employment and as a source of family support have failed to expand to fill the needs of working parents and of house-bound mothers, adding to the vicitims of the Budget. As health and welfare services become less accessible it is wives, mothers, sisters and daughters who may have no choice but to give up their careers to subsidise society with their unpaid care of the aged and the handicapped at home, a sacrifice rarely required of husbands, fathers, brothers or sons. To add an even greater imposition upon families already struggling, legitimate industrial action, taken in the vast majority of cases in order to maintain minimum living standards, is to be punished by depriving the wives of striking workers of eligibility for unemployment benefits. The same deprivation will apply to the wives of those unemployed workers who fall foul of arbitrarily applied work tests. What a way to solve industrial and social problems, to declare guilt by association, without trial, and to impose a penalty of starvation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another effect, and cause too, of isolation, is the guilt imposed on so many people, especially women, by circumstances which are largely beyond their capacity to control. Blaming the victim is not a new way of avoiding social responsibility, but we have seen it employed with sickening regularity during the last few years. Honourable senators opposite who evince obsession with well-being from the moment of conception would be far more convincing if they aligned themselves with policies such as those of the Labor Party. We seek a society in which no woman who wishes to bear a child is prevented from doing so, or is forced into having a pregnancy terminated because of social or economic circumstances such as those pertaining to very many Australians now in what would previously have been considered their reproductive years. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the cumulative effect of the Fraser Government's economic policies is proving the greatest and most effective contraceptive of all times. How can a woman responsibly become pregnant or responsibly allow an unplanned pregnancy to proceed to term when the household income, depleted by unexpectedly high mortgage repayments, savage State charges, arbitrary health insurance, escalating income taxation and the crippling costs of keeping a vehicle on the road, is barely or less than adequate to clothe and feed the existing members of that household, and unemployment is a grim and continuing possibility. Moralising and punitive legislation are not the answers to such problems. We can try, but we cannot force women to have babies, short of unspeakable duress. Moreover, unwanted pregnancy is not a matter of class nor a respecter of persons, as some have recently argued. Why do not such people who adopt such a moralising stance throw their weight behind those who work, as we do, for more equitable distribution of this wealthy country's resources, decent and affordable housing, universal education and health care, humane and accessible social security and a nuclear free future?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to refer to an alarming discovery which I have recently made. Seeking to better inform myself as preparation for this, my fifth career, I spent some time in studying a slim volume entitled Liberal Thinking jointly authored by C. J. Puplick and R. J. Southey, published by the Macmillan Co. of Australia, and dated 1980. I was particularly concerned to try to comprehend just what approach was currently being taken by the Liberal Party to the subject of human rights, as I had been aware over the years of considerable confusion among their ranks about whether any such animal even existed. Indeed, in Western Australia, we have been continually confronted by a philosophy, if I can exalt it to such status, that rights of association, for example, are but figments of our fevered imaginations. I was not enormously surprised, in studying this slender publication to which I have referred, to discover inconsistencies and contradictions. I will not be so impolite as to expose them on this occasion. I was amazed, however, to discover at the end of a tortuous argument the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> That the only right which exists in the Liberal philosophy without qualification is to be treated like a man. </PARA>
<PARA>Which man, may I ask? Do we have a choice? Is it the man who can make quick millions, tax free, on the stock market, or is it the man who is black, homeless, hounded and jobless, without even a vote? I have a distinct impression that I am not the only Australian woman who eagerly awaits answers to these questions. Perhaps all will be revealed as my term in the Senate proceeds. Perhaps the isolation about which I have been speaking will be resolved only when all politicians and all political parties are speaking, writing, and genuinely working not for man but for humanity. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> At the end of motion add', but the Senate considers that the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 should be amended so as to exempt from the new 2 1/2 per cent tax:</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) building materials for the construction of private dwellings;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) goods which effect the cost of food; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) clothing and footwear.'. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving the amendment, I reiterate that the position of the Australian Democrats on this series of sales tax Bills remains clear. We do not support the effort of the Australian Labor Party to throw out the total package of sales tax legislation which we see as a blocking manoeuvre, if not the same at least similar and of the same ilk as those things which happened in 1974 and 1975 which caused double dissolutions of this Parliament. We do not support the Australian Labor Party in trying to prevent increases in the sales tax on luxuries. We believe that a person who can afford gold plated cutlery, diamond jewellery, fur coats and a new yacht can also afford to pay sales tax on those things. We would rather money came from those taxes on luxuries than from tax paid by Australian families. We are amazed at the simplistic view the Australian Labor Party takes of this situation. I think all sensible people know that money which government does not get one way, it gets in another. I would have thought that my colleagues on this side of the chamber in the Australian Labor Party would know that well enough. I am sure very few Australians are so naive that they do not know that. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy, adopted by secret written ballot of all Australian Democrat members throughout Australia, makes it plain that we support a general move away from indirect tax. That is a policy I commend to the members of the Australian Labor Party. They have often enough said that income tax in this country is too high. So it is. It is better that there be a move away from income tax to indirect taxation. I would have thought that even Senator Evans might appreciate the point that income tax is a compulsory tax in the sense that everybody pays it on their incomes whether they wish to or not. However, sales tax is not a compulsory tax; it is a matter of choice. It is a matter of what a person wants to spend. If Senator Evans wants to buy a fur coat, he is perfectly entitled to do so. I only hope he does not wear it in here. If he does buy such a coat, let him pay the sales tax on it. I am being serious about this. I am not urging the honourable senator to buy a fur coat but urging upon him the principle that if he elects to do that, he elects also to pay the tax, whereas a battler whose overtime payments are taxed has no choice about that. That is very much the crux of this debate. We support that general move away from indirect tax. It is part of our policy, a ballot having been taken of our members after serious consideration of a position paper and debate in our journal. It is a form of policy making which I believe no other political party in this country, and possibly the world, has. It takes into account the views of many thousands of Australians and expresses them directly. That is something we should look at and consider as being of importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Incurring sales tax should be a matter of choice for people. I emphasise that point. That is why the Australian Democrats are opposed-it is our declared and published policy to be so opposed-to the sales tax on the necessities of life, which the Government proposes to introduce from the end of this year. I grant that it is not always possible-in fact, it is very difficult-to say what are the necessities of life. People's needs vary considerably. One can look at the matter only from the point of view of saying that there are some things that every person must have, that are essential. They must have shoes and clothing for their children and roofs over their heads. The Australian Democrats would include as necessities in a civilised society books, newspapers and informational magazines-the ordinary means of culture and education. I am sure Senator Evans and members of the Labor Party would be the first to agree with me on that. If that is not the case, I have no doubt he will say so later. The sales tax on wrapping materials might also affect the cost of food and should be exempt from this tax. However, the Government is actually proposing to tax all these things. The new taxes on the necessities of life, which come into effect on 1 January next, are dangerous and iniquitous. Those are strong words but I, and the Australian Democrats, think they are well advised. They are iniquitous because a flat tax will be imposed on people regardless of their ability to pay. It will be placed on items such as the shoes their children must wear and the clothing that everybody must have on their backs. </PARA>
<PARA> This new and, as I have said, iniquitous tax may well owe its origins-I wonder about this-to the flat income tax concept originating in certain remote areas of the National Country Party. Those who remember last year's election campaign would know that this idea of a flat tax was in vogue at one stage, among some people, regardless of income. But it was not in vogue for long. I commend this country's Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), he being one of those who said it would be a very bad, unfair and iniquitous tax and that it should not come about because it would simply mean that there was such a tax on everybody regardless of ability to pay. I question the consistency of the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party because, having taken that stand, they have now brought forward this new sales tax on necessities. I think Senator Missen will agree that it is basically the same sort of principle being applied in another way. That is why there is this tremendous feeling in the community about it. That feeling-which we will all know about soon if we do not know about it already-is that these taxes should not be imposed on 1 January but the Government, in its wisdom, should consider the matter again. I do not say 'in its wisdom' cynically; I think it would be a wise and statesman-like decision for the Government to reconsider and decide that this is a new false direction for our country which we should avoid at all costs. Let us look at other areas of taxation, but please do not get involved in this dangerous principle of imposing sales taxes on people regardless of their ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that this new tax on necessities seems very small at the moment. It is a mere 2 1/2 per cent. However, business leaders have already warned that because this figure will be applied at the wholesale level, the increases at the retail level will be very much higher. Most families are extremely ill-equipped to bear this increased cost on top of all the other things which have been done to them in this society over the last year or so. I refer to rising interest rates, the fact that they are now compelled to provide themselves with medical insurance, and things of that kind. Therefore, these taxes have an added importance because they are in a very real sense the straw that might break the camel's back. This is the one thing which will add to families' costs-unnecessarily-to an enormous extent. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention briefly the most iniquitous of all these taxes-that which would apply a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax to building materials used in houses. Surely it is obvious that young families and people getting married now are having a hard enough run as it is getting a house. Their problems of getting mortgage money together are great enough; it is even more difficult to pay the enormous interest rates demanded of them. What does the Government propose? It proposes to add to that burden another $500 to $1,000 on the cost of a house. When we query members of the Government about that, they say it is only a fraction of what would have been added to the value of a house in a year because of inflation-as if in some way that justifies the belief that two wrongs make a right. Of course, two wrongs do not make a right. The fact that inflation is adding to the costs of these people should be a reason for the Government not to impose that additional burden, not a reason for it to do so. I will be interested to hear the comments of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) on that point later in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps even more dangerous and difficult is the precedent set by the introduction of this tax. This 2 1/2 per cent sales tax is very much the thin end of the wedge. The Australian Democrats suspect it is the beginning of a new tax which eventually will be introduced to milk in money as the crude oil levy disappears. As most Australians who go to petrol stations to fill up their cars would know, we are being clipped pretty hard right now on the basis that we should be paying the same amount for our petrol as we would had we needed to import it all. That is a reasonable enough proposition in a conservational sense but as time goes on and the production from our Bass Strait oil wells goes down the Government will have available less and less money, until the time comes when the Bass Strait crude has all gone and the Government will have none of that money. The Government feels, I suppose properly enough, that it has to replace that money. The Australian Democrats suggest that the Government look at reasonable economies-for instance adding to the present Parliament House rather than going on with the monster being built on Capital Hill. I note that only today there has been yet another increase in cost to nearly $400m-in spite of all the undertakings given on both sides of this House, by the Labor party and the Liberal party, that this would never happen. I confidently predict to all honourable senators, as I have done before-I did it two years ago and last year-that before that building is completed it will cost more than $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is looking for economies, this is the place to start. Why not realise that the people of this country have quite enough to put up with now. They have quite enough burdens without adding to them and spending the money in a mad rage of building all over Canberra. It is analogous to the Khmer kings who crippled their society in Cambodia with an insane urge to build monuments to themselves. The point we are trying to make is that this tax could be increased year by year-no doubt it will be if the Government is allowed to get away with it-until it destroys the very basis of family life in this country. It will allow the rich to batter, without restraint, the less well off. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> This sinister new tax-the word 'sinister' is certainly no overstatement-shows very nakedly the view of society held by the extreme right wing of the Government parties. I do not believe that it can possibly be supported by all senators and members of the House of Representatives who are members of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party. I cannot believe that all those people are sufficiently cynical and evil as to wish this tax on people. Those who do not support it have a clear duty to say so now. If those people have any sense of responsibility at all to the people who elected them and the people they represent they should say that. Certainly their constituents are saying that to them and they know that as well as I do. Of course, they will go on doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, these new taxes must be opposed by all Australians to their utmost ability. When the time comes, they must oppose them in the ballot box at a general election. I suggest that that would be the time when the Government could be taught a lesson if it goes on with this completely anti-social type of behaviour. The Prime Minister may in his wisdom and in the fullness of time elect to hold that election at any time. We do not know what will happen over the next year or so and it will be up to the Prime Minister to decide what he is going to do if he finds that certain things happen in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> This new tax on children's school shoes, on clothes, on building materials, on the books school and university students must use and on the means of free communication is what we now wish to see eliminated. We ask the Senate to support this amendment to the motion for the second reading so that this Bill will be brought back to the attention of the House of Representatives in a forcible form. The Government will understand that at least this House of the Parliament does not go along with this appalling situation which is to apply to 1 January. At a later stage in this debate, in the Committee stage, I shall be moving amendments which will spell out in detail what is pre-stated in this amendment that we are proposing to the motion for the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> That amendment will be in the form of a request by message to the House of Representatives. Why make requests? This is because the Australian Constitution does not allow the Senate to amend such money Bills. We can only request. I suggest that this is largely a matter of words, of semantics and of form. The fact remains that, whatever way it is done, the full weight of the authority of this chamber can be brought to bear on the House of Representatives and the Government combined with the very considerable pressures being exerted by the electorate over this matter. Many people in the electorate have been in touch with me about this matter. There is no doubt in my mind that they will continue these pressures for as long as it is necessary in order to remove these iniquitous taxes or until the next general election when, I suggest, the problem might solve itself if it has not been solved beforehand. If the Government refuses the requests which we put forward in this chamber and the community can draw their own conclusions and be guided in their future actions towards the Government as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to another point. It is a very vexed matter which has taken a certain amount of time during this debate on these sales tax Bills. Should the Australian Democrats eventually use their vote in the Senate to compel the Government to make these changes? It has been said that this should happen. The Australian Democrats senators are five people in this place who were elected by the people of Australia on a policy of moderation and restraint when it comes to tampering with money bills. Last year during our election campaign our senators, who have now been elected, publicly announced that they had signed the statutory declaration which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That I personally subscribe to and endorse without reservation of any kind the publicly announced policy of the Australian Democrats, as stated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, the Honourable Senator D. L. Chipp--</PARA>
<PARA>May he prosper-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Australian Democrats, if gaining a position of 'balance of power' in the Senate would not use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of supply or money bills in a manner which would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. </PARA>
<PARA>Beyond that, the declaration went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> That for all purposes and without reservation of any kind, I hereby declare that if elected to the Senate I shall not cast my vote as a Senator in a manner which would be contrary to the policy of the Australian Democrats as stated in Paragraph 3 hereof-</PARA>
<PARA>That was the previous paragraph I quoted-</PARA>
<PARA>and thus shall never during my tenure as a Senator contribute to or cause a situation which through blocking of supply or money Bills might bring down the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the hounds calling in the background. The Australian Democrats know that the Australian people do not want a repeat of the constitutional crisis of 1975 which was due to this vexed matter of the Senate blocking money Bills. Nor do the Australian people want any risk of that happening. They have made that abundantly plain to us and, I am sure, they are making it abundantly plain to the Labor Party. I think the view of the bulk of the electorate-if the Labor Party went to the trouble to go and consudt it-is that they would see any major tampering with the Budget, any major blocking of a Bill which substantially raises revenues for the Government or, indeed, a blocking of Supply or the appropriation Bills as possibly causing that constitutional crisis. This has been frequently canvassed in the newspapers in which it has been said that there is instability in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, Mr Hurford once said as part of the Labor Party's strange sort of ambivalent attitude towards these Bills that there was not really any intention at all to block the sales tax Bills. He said that what the Labor Party wanted was to persuade the business community to go to the Liberal Party and to join with the Labor Party in getting some sort of deal together whereby the Senate would not be able to vote on money Bills and would not be able to do in effect what the Labor Party is proposing to do now. I wonder how Byzantine one can get. That seems pretty Byzantine to me. However, the Labor Party knows best just what its real motivation is. At least three motivations have been suggested. I have given two of them. The third might well be that because of the way the polls are running at the moment they felt that if something happened they might have a good chance of getting back into government. They might well have done that. We will concede that. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask my friends in the Labor Party; If we had gone along with them hand in hand down the short nasty path back to November 1975, how would they have liked it if we had started meddling with their first Budget? What sort of a world would that have created for this country? What sort of political instability might it have created for the future? In other words, we feel that we have a duty to be of good faith towards the people who elected us to this place. Rightly or wrongly, we see ourselves as fulfilling that duty. I am aware that a certain discretion is possible. We have some room to move but we believe we owe it to the people to move with caution, whatever we do. If we were so rash as to exceed the mandate we have been given as a minority party we would very properly accept the rights of the people to say: 'You have exceeded the powers we gave you. You have done more than you said you would do, as we understood it, and you can take the consequences'. I am sure we would take the consequences. </PARA>

If he wants to resign he can resign but I assure the honourable senator that I have no intention of doing so. The risk would be not only a possible repeat of November 1975 but also perhaps several such repeats and possibly decades of political and economic instability, bitterness and disunity. The Australian Democrats are not prepared to subject the country to those risks. However, that does not mean that we will at no time take action on Bills which the Senate can amend in constitutional terms or fail to oppose the Government. The Government ought to take clear notice of this fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have already given notice of the issues on which we would block Government moves. This happens regularly in other countries, and is a proper part of the process of democracy and the functions of this chamber. So, if a piece of legislation comes through and is changed in this chamber the Government has no call to scream and run and say that it wants a double dissolution or that it has no mandate to govern because that would be absolute nonsense. It would merely mean that one House of this Parliament decided, as it has every right to do having been voted to this place by the people, to make some sort of change to legislation. It happens all over the world all the time. So I hope the Government will not bring forward that sort of silly statement. </PARA>

I am sorry; the interjector is not the person I thought it was talking about feathers. Some people think we will be over-cautious with tax and supply Bills but we will continue to be cautious in our approach to those things. We admit that we are a new party. We do not have great experience in this place. I think that also makes it necessary for us to say to the Australian people that we are aware of our own inadequacies which we are doing our best to overcome. Our new senators are only inexperienced. I think honourable senators will find that the honourable senators sitting behind me have all the other qualities and they will rapidly become distinguished members of the Senate. Meanwhile, we have a certain responsibility to be careful about what we do. We will go on doing that without regard to anybody else's advice to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I suggest that the Government will have a heavy responsibility when our requests reach the House of Representatives. We have kept our word, although a single act of ours to vote against the motion for the second reading of the total package of sales tax Bills might indeed well destroy the Government, and well it knows it. If the Government were to elect to seek a double dissolution in, say, three months after, in terms of the Constitution, these Bills came back before the Senate and if the people were to vote in the way the opinion polls say they would, the Government would be in difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> We have held our hand because we believe that what we are doing is right and proper and is what we have undertaken to do. We do not expect the Government to show us any sense of obligation; far from it. That is the last thing we would want from it. But we do believe that the Government has an obligation to look at the sales taxes on necessities and to think carefully again about them. We will not condone its failure to remove the sales taxes on necessities and we will continue our campaign against them for as long as is necessary, certainly up until the next election whenever that might be. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I have moved this amendment to the motion for the second reading of the sales tax Bills to make it abundantly clear at all stages of the consideration of the legislation that the Australian Democracts are opposed to the principle of sales tax on necessities. That is briefly our reason for moving the amendment at this time. I have looked at Standing Order 125, which was discussed earlier today. There is nothing in it and I think the Australian Labor Party has already realised that. I hope it will not bring forward that Standing Order as a red herring. These are not motions of which notice has been given. I think that covers the point. </PARA>

I think the failure of the Australian Labor Party to support our second reading amendment for the removal of sales tax on the necessities of life would be a clear abdication by that party of its moral principles. I cannot believe that the Australian Labor Party accepts that there should be sales taxes on such necessities. We are putting our proposal squarely in front of it for support. We will be most interested in seeing from the vote which is to come whether it is prepared to stand by its principles or whether it will shilly-shally dither and do all those other things that have been said so often in the debate on the sales tax Bills. I would have thought that the Labor Party would see itself as having a clear stake in the interests of the average Australian family, whose interests I think the Labor Party would be anxious to maintain. Those interests should be dear to it. I suggest that it can support them by voting with us on this amendment and seeing it being passed in the Senate. The Opposition has the power to do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party will not be supporting the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats, for very adequate reasons which I will attempt to state briefly, given the time constraints this evening. The first reason is that to support this amendment would be to water down the party's consistent and uncompromising opposition to all of these sales tax imposts on general economic and equity grounds. I intend to expand on that later. Secondly, this amendment is completely superfluous insofar as opportunities to achieve precisely the same objectives will arise in the Committee stage when more specific amendments are, I understand, to be moved by the Australian Democrats and will be supported by the Labor Party. During the Committee stage further amendments will be moved by the Labor Party to extend the list of goods to which the Australian Democrats are proposing that exempt status should continue. The Democrats are proposing that exempt status should continue to apply to some goods. The Labor Party will support that and, in addition, will move that that list be extended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, there will be a third opportunity to oppose the Government's intentions in a more effective way when the Committee stage of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill comes up. In that instance, this chamber can actually amend the Bills instead of simply passing on requests to the House of Representatives. It is our intention to move a number of completely effective amendments when the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill reaches the Committee stage. The amendment which has been moved to the second reading motion by the Australian Democrats is completely superfluous and simply complicates the issue. That may well be the underlying intention. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to summarise again very briefly the reasons why the Labor Party has consistently and unequivocally opposed all of the sales tax imposts which have been proposed by the Government. We oppose them all because they are inflationary, inequitable and completely unnecessary. They are inflationary because they will add 1.1 per cent to the consumer price index. The Budget Papers state a figure of 0.75 per cent, which is a misrepresentation of the truth. The figure of 0.75 per cent is an estimate for the whole of 1981-82 over the whole of 1980-81. The correct figure by which these sales tax imposts alone will inflate the consumer price index is 1.1 per cent. That is the Treasury estimate for the June 1982 on June 1981 figure. This Government, which has professed for more than six years to have, as an overriding primary objective, bearing down on inflation, proposes taxes which will directly increase the consumer price index by more than one per cent and, when the indirect effects flow through, will probably increase the consumer price index by something like 2 per cent. We oppose it because it is inflationary. No informed, rational person can deny that it will be inflationary. We oppose the sales taxes on grounds of equity. They are inequitable because, in common with indirect taxes in general, they are regressive; that is, they fall proportionately more on the lower income groups than on the higher income groups. They are also unnecessary. They have always been unnecessary because the difference, so far as the Budget outcome for 1981-82 is concerned, between accepting or rejecting all of these Bills is that the domestic budget surplus, estimated to be $1.5 billion in round figures would, if these sales tax measures were rejected entirely, be reduced to $1 billion. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am about to put these propositions to increase the domestic surplus in their contemporary economic context. It has been patently clear from the outset that this additional revenue which the Government seeks to raise this year is unnecessary insofar as its only effect on the Budget outcome would be to add to the domestic Budget surplus. In view of the disclosures or facts which have emerged since the Budget was presented, these additional imposts are not only unnecessary but also positively malevolent. The assumptions upon which the Budget was framed-that is, strong economic growth in the June quarter and a capital inflow in excess of last year's record $6.5 billion capital inflow-are now quite clearly unrealistic. On present indications, capital inflow is likely to fall far short of the Government's projected target of $7 billion and economic growth either was stalled in the June quarter or may even have become negative. The indications available so far are that the situation has not changed since the December quarter. In other words, instead of having an economy which is growing at least by the standards of the 1970s at quite a rapid rate, present evidence suggests that the economy is stalled, if not actually in reverse. Therefore the highly contractionary budget which the Government introduced one month ago is now even more inappropriate than it was at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make just a couple of other points. Firstly, the rejection of all of these sales tax Bills cannot in any reasonable way be compared to a rejection of Supply. The most obvious qualitative distinction between the two is that Supply Bills authorise the expenditure of money and that all of these Bills authorise the collection of money. So there is that important and vital qualitative difference. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true, strictly speaking, but I will not go into that because of time constraints. Secondly, if Supply Bills or Appropriation Bills are rejected the ability of a government to pay its own employees and to pay social service recipients among other things is restricted or removed. These Bills do not have that effect. I repeat that the only effect on the current year's Budget outcome, flowing from the total rejection of all of these Bills, is that the domestic surplus will be reduced from $1.5 billion to $1 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A far more appropriate analogy between these Bills and the previous experience-far more appropriate than the rejection of the Appropriation Bills in 1975-is the rejection by the Senate in 1974 of the Medibank levy Bill. In the Medibank case in 1974 and the present case a Senate rejection would have affected and will affect the magnitude of Government revenue raising. In neither case would such action affect the ability of a government to remain in office, to pay its own employees and to meet its day-to-day and essential requirements. However, the analogy is not completely appropriate insofar as the Senate, by rejecting the Medibank levy Bills, in 1974, stopped the then Labor Government from keeping an explicit electoral promise which preceded the 1974 double dissolution and upon which the Labor Government was re-elected. On the contrary, what the Labor Party seeks to do now is to force the Government to keep its pre-election promises not to introduce indirect taxation. I refer to pre- and post-election promises. In particular I refer to a post-election promise as late as 12 March 1981 in which the Treasurer (Mr Howard), in a major statement to the House of Representatives on the question of indirect taxation, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout its consideration of this issue-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the issue of indirect taxation or the broadening of the indirect tax base-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government remained firmly of the view that if a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation were to occur, it should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>We have with these Bills a proposition both to broaden and deepen the reliance upon indirect taxation accompanied not by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax but on the contrary by a massive 22 per cent increase in personal income tax from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. The Labor Party's attitude to all of these Bills, on macro-economic grounds and on equity grounds and all grounds of moral principle-what the Democrats leader used to refer to as 'keeping the Bs honest'-is that all of them should be rejected. They are inflationary, inequitable, unnecessary and/or malevolent. For all of those reasons and the fact that there will be an opportunity later in the debate on these Bills during the Committee stage more effectively to do what the Democrats seek to do, or claim they seek to do with their second reading amendment, the Labor Party will not support the second reading amendment proposed by Senator Mason. However, I want to make it perfectly clear that we will support and add to measures in the Committee stage which will have precisely the same objective but which will pursue that objective in a more effective way. </PARA>

I would like to read to the Senate the resolution of that meeting which I think was very well worded and framed and which expressed very clearly and appropriately the feeling of the people of Queensland and the people of Australia in respect of the matters that are currently before us. The resolution stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This meeting condemns the Federal Government's sales tax measures, particularly the extension of sales tax onto necessities of life such as clothing, footwear, house, building materials and its tax on educational books. Australian families are beginning to realise the impact these measures will have on their cost of living. Whilst the Federal Government deserves credit for its family allowance increases for larger families, these increases will not go to all families and do not make up for the lost purchasing power of family allowances since 1976 and will continue to be eroded by cost of living increases inflamed by the sales tax measures. We note that the Federal Government is attempting to substantially broaden the base of indirect taxation on commodities despite its promise not to do so without compensating reduction of direct taxes such as income tax. This meeting protests at the unconventional manner in which the measure to extend sales tax to previously exempted necessities of life is being forced onto the parliament by the Government. We wholeheartedly support the moves being made to prevent the Government's attempt to circumvent the legitimate powers of the Senate to review legislation in the interests of the community. We congratulate those members of Federal Parliament who are prepared to make a stand on this issue and in particular we are determined to express our views to Government members in writing and by petition so that this unjust and inflationary indirect tax to the necessities of life is finally rejected outright. </PARA>
<PARA>That meeting was organised by a wide variety of groups which included the Women's Action Group, the Women's Action Alliance, the Queensland Country Women's Association, the Taxpayers' Association of Queensland, the Queensland Confederation of Industry Ltd, the Master Builders' Association, the retail traders, Parents Without Partners, the Civilian Widows Association and the Book Publishers Association. There are no votes for me in Queensland, but I thought that it would be appropriate for me to accept that invitation because of the initiative taken by these people. I was glad that I did so. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the overwhelming response of the people present at that meeting reflected the growing response to this legislation throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I can see it in my own State of Tasmania, where this issue is becoming a very important one indeed. Of course, the question of taxation and how taxation is to be levied and collected is one of the most important issues in a democracy such as Australia. A breadwinner on average weekly earnings, having paid income tax, has only thereby paid 50 per cent of the total tax that he or she will pay in one year. The move towards greater reliance on sales tax is regressive in that it falls heaviest on low income earners. By and large, their outlay is greater than is that of the higher income group. Treasurer Howard would advance, as a reason for extending the base of commodity taxes, the problem of tax avoidance. My opinion-it ought to be his also; probably it is-is that tax avoidance ought to be met head on and measures introduced substantially to ensure that there is little or no tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us three measures. The first comprises Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9), which increases taxes on already taxed goods. The second comprises Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) which apply taxes to goods now exempted under the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The third amends that Act to do away with certain anomalies. The effect of these three measures is to increase this year the sales tax revenues of the Government by 38.6 per cent-at a time when income tax will increase by 22 per cent. The question arises: Why is the Government doing this when it clearly indicated that it would not broaden significantly the basis of commodity taxes unless it provided an offsetting relief in regard to income or direct taxes. I need not read page 18 of the Treasurer's Budget Speech on the subject. I cannot find it but I know it by heart. He stated clearly at that point that he was changing the mix in favour of the indirect area to provide the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly income taxes. However, now that we are faced with these Bills he has not told us how he will reduce direct taxes. He is asking the Parliament to buy a pig in a poke and I, for one, will not accept that situation until the position is perfectly clarified for me and for the Parliament. Therefore, I intend to oppose these measures outright. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the situation with which we are confronted. The sales tax issue has taken the Australian Parliament into the highways and byways of the Constitution. It has taken the Senate into an examination of its Standing Orders, into an examination of previous legislation, and into a consideration of ancient legal maxims in Latin. One of these, as Senator Evans has pointed out, is leges posteriores, which means that Acts which passed subsequent to previous Acts, insofar as previous Acts are inconsistent with subsequent Acts, have no effect. Is that not correct?</PARA>

Some rather unusual items including academic and legal robes are caught in the Government's dragnet. The list includes barristers' wigs, kilts and sporrans and lodge clothing such as aprons. So we have a situation where babies in nappies, barristers in wigs and Scotsmen in sporrans are all caught up in this dragnet legislation which extends the sales tax to goods previously exempt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted that, but not many honourable senators are wearing turbans. This is why every Australian who has to buy goods should understand that the Government has framed the legislation in a manner designed to prevent the Senate from exercising its powers of amendment. I will shortly deal with that subject at greater length. Whilst I have been a little flippant, let me spare a serious thought for new home buyers. I have heard it claimed by one authoritative source that the extension of sales tax to items such as timber, timber frames, bricks, lime, concrete, cement, bolts, door frames and so on will add an extra $500 to the overall construction cost of the average dwelling. It is the all-embracing applicaion of sales tax to a widespread range of essential goods that makes this issue so important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect, I believe that a lot of nonsense has been talked about constitutional crises. After all, I do not really believe that if we simply rejected these proposals out of hand, particularly the 1A to 9A group of Bills, which extend the sales tax to goods which are now exempt, such as babies' nappies, the Government would go to the people. They might on barristers' wigs, but not on babies' nappies. If they did, they might get a surprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the whole package of sales tax Bills ought to be rejected at this stage so as to provide the Treasurer with the opportunity of elaborating a little on the matters that he put down in his Budget Speech. No Treasurer worth his salt will make a generalisation in the Budget without knowing precisely what it means and what he and the Government will do at a later stage. I say to honourable senators: Do not let them keep that to themselves; let them bring the Senate and the people of Australia into their confidence. It is the uniqueness of the manner in which these Bills have been brought before the Senate that has caused a great deal of comment. Of course, I refer again to that decision taken in Brisbane where it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This meeting protests at the unconventional manner in which the measure to extend sales tax to previously exempted necessities of life is being forced on to the Parliament by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made after it was noted that the Federal Government was attempting to broaden the base of taxation substantially. I could not have put that motion into better words had I framed it myself. It is unique. Senator Guilfoyle in answer to a question of mine did admit that the manner in which these Bills have been phrased is unique-so unique in fact that it is the first time they have been framed in such a manner since the first sales tax Bill came into the Parliament in 1930. If honourable senators quibble about that, I have the Bills here in my hand. I have the first sales tax Bill which goes back to 1930. They are pretty mouldy at the present moment. Act No. 26 of 1930 is the Sales Tax Act (No. 1) on the one hand and the machinery provisions, Sales Tax Exemptions Amendment, on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that where previously the Government sought to impose a tax on already exempted items, it first introduced an amendment to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Now as the Government knows, those proposed laws are amendable. Had the Government attempted to do so on this occasion that Bill would have been amended; no risk about it. We have only to go to the Government's own explanatory notes to the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1-9) and to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill to see that what I am saying is perfectly correct. In the explanatory notes the Government stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of constitutional considerations,--</PARA>
<PARA>This is in the Explanatory Memorandum-</PARA>
<PARA>the sales tax legislation is contained in a number of separate Acts. There are nine Sales Tax Acts which specify the rates at which tax is payable and each Sales Tax Act has a complementary Sales Tax Assessment Act providing the machinery for assessment, collection and administration of the tax imposed by the related Sales Tax Act. The subjects of taxation and the various Assessment Acts and Rates Acts are set out in the following table--</PARA>
<PARA>In the explanatory notes the Acts are set out from the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) and Sales Tax Act (No. 1) to the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 2) and Sales Tax Act (No. 2) and so on down to Sales Tax Act (No. 9). Why is this so? It is because of constitutional considerations. What did the Government do on this occasion? In relation to Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) what did it do? It included in the rates Act-that is the Sales Tax Act-machinery provisions; indeed, it included amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act. In effect, it is amending the Sales Tax Assessment Act and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Mr Deputy President, I was of half a mind to call the attention of the Parliament to section 55 of the Constitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, no, Senator Colston; the situation in regard to that particular matter is that in fact we are dealing with proposed laws.

The President of the Senate has not previously ruled on the constitutionality of proposed laws coming before the Parliament or the procedures which the Senate decides ought to be used to deal with the proposed laws. I hope that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is listening because when my contingent notice of motion to split the Bills comes into operation he ought to read page 129 of Odgers's Australian Senate Practice which indicates quite clearly that the President has never ruled on the constitutionality or otherwise of a proposed law. Also, he has never ruled on the Standing Orders, as I read the situation, and on how the Senate ought to deal with those sorts of proposed laws having regard to constitutional interpretation. I hope the Attorney-General is listening. Mr Deputy President, I do not invite you so to rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, the Government is out of order bringing in these Bills in the way it has. Including other matters in laws proposing taxation is contrary to section 55 of the Constitution. My foreshadowed move is designed to unravel the knot that the Government has tied in order to thwart the proper exercise of the Senate's powers. I appreciate that a flaw in my original notice of motion has been pointed out by Senator Evans. It was not an insubstantial flaw, I must admit. However, it was a flaw. It was a bit like the subject matter which was not referred to by that hypothetical reporter who asked Mrs Lincoln outside the Ford Theatre in Washington: 'And apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?'. It was rather consequential and I appreciate his bringing my attention to it. However, that has now been overcome, the contingent notice of motion is there. I advise the Senate now that I propose to withdraw that contingent notice of motion when it comes up and I will be supporting the proposed amendment to the second reading in the belief that half a loaf is better than none. I will be opposing the tax measures. I will then be supporting the requests. I understand that amendments will be moved to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. They had been flagged in my letter to the leaders of the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. However, in short, I believe that we should grasp the nettle now, oppose the Bills outright and allow the Treasurer to explain to the people just what he proposes in offsetting reductions in direct taxes for the impost that he is now attempting to place on the people in indirect taxing measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment that has been moved by Senator Mason. I do so to underline his comments. The Australian Democrats have moved this amendment to the second reading of the sales tax Bills to draw attention to the comparative simplicity of opposing sales tax on the necessities of life. We have set those out under four headings which are: Books, newspapers and other information publications, building materials for the construction of private dwellings, goods which affect the cost of food and clothing and footwear. That is a very simple proposition. Much has been said tonight about the complexities that we will be confronted with once this sales tax legislation reaches the Committee stage. I shudder to think about the reaction of the public at large to the Parliament, particularly the Senate, which has to try to unravel the various amendments and motions relating to the passage of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sales tax Bills undoubtedly were purposely combined by the Government in a way that makes it extremely difficult to oppose certain parts of them. The complexity of segregating parts of them is the very reason why the Democrats have moved this amendment at the second reading stage. We have just heard that Senator Harradine proposes to support our amendment. We have also heard that, for some inexplicable reason, the Australian Labor Party proposes to support the Government. As I understand the situation, we will have the spectacle of the members of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine sitting on one side of the chamber and the members of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party sitting on the other side of the chamber. I listened carefully to the Labor Party's reason for not supporting this very simple amendment. I am afraid I am unconvinced. </PARA>
<PARA> We, the Democrats, have been accused of double standards, of acting in a light hearted way and of using a feather instead of a hammer because we will not oppose the sales tax legislation outright. I must draw the attention of this chamber to the fact that the new sales taxes as proposed by the Government will raise $2,913m in revenue. By no stretch of imagination could that amount of money be considered as an insubstantial revenue raising initiative by the Government. It is very substantial. It can be condemned, and we do condemn it. But it is a substantial revenue raising initiative by the Government and we, the Democrats, consider it is not our place, as a minority party and as a party that has pledged not to interfere with the economic strategies of the Government, to say that the Government cannot raise $2,913m as revenue through this sales tax legislation. That is our position quite clearly. We are opposed to the sales tax legislation. We are opposed to the magnitude of it. We deplore the fact that the Government did not foreshadow it. But it is not our place to reject the legislation outright, which is what the Labor Party continually is pressurising us to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole of the Budget is criticised by us and it has been criticised, I hope, in the clearest possible terms. The members of the public should realise by now that this Budget will take in total from every man, woman and child in the country an additional $338. That is, the extent of the additional revenue this year from every man woman and child in the country. If the revenue were to come from only the taxpayers, that figure must be multiplied by three. So the Budget is as stringent as it possibly can be. The sales tax component of it is very important. It was not foreshadowed. We believe it should not have been introduced. We have moved this amendment to give the public and this chamber the opportunity simply to draw attention to the fact that they can oppose sales tax on the necessities of life without in fact affecting the Government's basic economic strategy. That is our proposal. It is clear and simple. I commend support of that amendment to the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to trespass for more than a minute on the Senate's time because we are all anxious for this matter to proceed to a vote rather quickly. But as it appears a division will be called on the second reading amendment that has been moved by the Australian Democrats and as undoubtedly some incongruity is involved in a situation which will arise in a few minutes time with the Opposition and the Government, it appears, voting together against this amendment from the Democrats, perhaps it is as well to spend just a few seconds repeating why it is that the stance that the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party, has taken on the second reading amendment is not in fact inexplicable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In short, the reason why it is not inexplicable is this: What the Democrats are asking us, as the Australian Labor Party, to do is to support a second reading amendment which will produce a resolution in the following terms: 'That these Bills be now read a second time but that the Senate considers they should be amended in certain specified ways'. The situation is simply that the ALP believes now and it says now, as it has always believed and always said, that these Bills should not be read a second time. Therefore, it is quite impossible for us to be put in the situation of supporting an amendment which requires us to support the proposition that the Bills be read a second time. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> Our position on the detailed matters of books, newspapers, clothing and footwear will become perfectly apparent to the Senate and to the nation in about 10 minutes when we reach the Committee stage, if indeed the Bills pass the second reading stage. It is as simple as that. Clearly, for all the reasons Senator Walsh outlined, we do not want to be put in the position of supporting the second reading of these Bills under any circumstances, whether unqualified or qualified. For that reason, we will oppose the put-up job that this amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bills represents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt at all that we are debating Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) 1981, Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A)1981 and Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1981, but there does seem to be some doubt about whether we are debating money Bills. It seems to me that some honourable senators have difficulty in recognising a money Bill when they see it. I can only say that these Bills form an integral part of the Budget strategy and are essential to the implementation of the Budget. From time to time speakers in this debate have referred to the question of whether these sales tax Bills are or are not appropriation Bills. Of course they are not appropriation Bills; but they are required so that the proposals contained in the appropriation Bills may be covered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of matters were raised by honourable senators during the debate. I think some of them should receive a response at this time; perhaps others can receive a response during the Committee stage. Senator Walsh, in opening the debate for the Opposition a week or so ago, alleged that a form of trickery had been used in the Budget Papers, which referred to a three-quarters of a percentage point rise in the consumer price index attributable to proposed higher Commonwealth indirect taxes. I think the same point was raised by Senator Walsh in a question today. The Budget documentation refers to the effect of sales tax measures on the CPI in 1981-82. At two points-at page 55 and at page 60 of Statement No. 2 in Budget Paper No. 1. The following appears at page 55:</PARA>
<PARA> Stated briefly, the outlook for 1981-82 is for:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>a rise of around 10 3/4 per cent in the Consumer Price Index, of which three quarters of a percentage point would be attributable to changed health care arrangements and a similar amount to higher Commonwealth indirect taxes;</PARA>
<PARA>The following is stated at page 60:</PARA>
<PARA> The changed arrangements for health care, which come into effect on 1 September 1981, are estimated to add about three-quarters of a percentage point to the overall increase in the Consumer Price Index . . . in 1981-82. The increases in indirect taxes announced in the Budget are estimated to add another three-quarters of a percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walsh correctly noted that the three-quarters of a percentage point referred to the effect on a year to year comparison; that is, the effect on the CPI for 1981-82 as a whole compared with that for 1980-81 as a whole. He went on to suggest that there seemed to be trickery in presenting the figures in that way and that a more conventional presentation would show the increase between the June quarter of 1981 and the June quarter of 1982, which he suggested would amount to 1.1 per cent and not 0.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The presentation in the Budget Papers did not involve any trickery as it was quite clear that a year on year comparison was involved in the figures presented. Nor is it true that a June to June comparison would be the conventional presentation, with the year on year comparison being unconventional. The two types of presentation convey different information and bring out certain facts which it may be important to show for comparisons that may wish to be drawn. Both forms of presentation could be right for their particular purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the part of the documentation where three-quarters of a percentage point appeared a number of year on year comparisons were made of various aggregates, such as incomes and expenditures, and similar comparisons were made for price changes. The sales tax measures are estimated to have a direct effect of around one per cent on the consumer price index, spread primarily between the December quarter of 1981 and the March quarter of 1982. Consequently, the June on June effect would be about one per cent. Because there is no effect on the September quarter for 1981 and because the 1 January measures do not affect the December quarter, the average effect on the year as a whole and therefore the estimated year on year effect is somewhat less than one per cent and was estimated at three-quarters of a percentage point in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, in his earlier speech, also claimed that the Government had welshed on the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of 12 March 1981. I refer only briefly to that by stating that the statement by the Treasurer set out arguments in favour of a change in the tax mix. Notwithstanding the merits of the arguments, the Government decided that it was not appropriate at that time to embark on the much different course of introducing, say, a retail turnover tax or of otherwise placing significantly greater reliance on very broadly based indirect taxes. That decision did not rule out smaller adjustments being made within the present system. There is no question of the Government having welshed on the Treasurer's statement of 12 March 1981 because that statement made it clear that there is advantage in making changes to the mix of indirect and direct taxes with a view to achieving desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax, as economic and budgetary conditions permit. The changes to operate from 1 January 1982 are of the modest character; I say modest in comparison with what might have been envisaged in the discussion of direct and indirect taxes held in March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh and also Senator Jessop said that there was confusion in the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the sales tax changes announced in the Budget and that the Taxation Office had not been briefed on the Government's proposals and, therefore, was unable to deal with the public's inquiries immediately following the presentation of the Budget. I am advised that that was not the case, that all capital city offices of the Taxation Office had available to hand to the public printed material which set out the changes to come into effect from 19 August 1981. Special facilities were provided to handle the phone calls made to each of those offices. I am advised also that the officers of the Taxation Office in each State were specially briefed on Budget night in respect of the changes announced in the Budget Speech and that additional officers were specially briefed on the morning of 19 August. Those officers had copies of the Bills and explanatory memorandums available to them at that time and they maintained contact with the Commissioner's office in Canberra in relation to any problems that developed. </PARA>
<PARA> When major changes are made to a law such as the sales tax law, it is inevitable that some confusion will arise because of misinformation disseminated through the media and in other ways and by persons with particular points of view. The Government recognises that changes such as those announced will bring temporary dislocation while businesses alter systems to adjust for the changes. That is an inevitable but traditional feature of the sales tax system. However, the allegations that the officers of the Taxation Office were not briefed are emphatically denied by the Commissioner of Taxation. Because the Bills relating to the changes to occur with effect from 1 January 1982 had not been introduced into the Parliament, it was not appropriate for the Taxation Office to give advice other that in the terms of the Treasurer's announcement of those proposals. I am informed that since the Bills have been introduced the Taxation Office has been giving more specific advice to inquirers and again plans to take special measures to assist members of the taxpaying public with any difficulties they may have in comprehending the changes that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh gave three examples of what he thought illustrated the alleged confusion. The first example involved a retailer and wholesaler of motor vehicle parts, the second involved registration for sales tax of persons not previously registered and the third involved a retail butchery selling a bullock's liver. I have been given answers to the queries raised by Senator Walsh and perhaps they ought to be stated so that the record will be complete for people who have an interest in particular matters. The problems envisaged by Senator Walsh do not arise in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers to the matters raised are, firstly, that the relatively small number of retailers of motor vehicle parts who also make some wholesale sales differ from normal sales taxpayers because they carry tax paid trading stock rather than tax free trading stock, as is the case with wholesalers. When they sell goods by wholesale at 17.5 per cent they claim rebates in monthly returns of tax paid on those goods sold by wholesale. They need to know which goods have had tax paid on them at 15 per cent and which goods have had tax paid on them at 17.5 per cent to claim correctly the rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> However, at least 85 per cent of all retailer/ wholesalers of motor spare parts have a rebate system approved by the Taxation Office whereby a formula is used to calculate the amount claimed as a rebate, the figure being approved by the Taxation Office. This system avoids the necessity for the taxpayer to maintain extensive stock records to identify the tax paid on specific goods. The percentage rate fixed for a particular taxpayer is reviewed from time to time to ensure that it is supported by the facts. Because of this system it is not necessary for such taxpayers to tax stock as at 19 August 1981, although it is open for them to do so if they wish. I am advised that the Taxation Office does not require such persons to take stock, as has been alleged. I should add that the situation in question is not a common feature for taxpayers and applies only to a relatively small number of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question referred to the liability of manufacturers and wholesale merchants to register for sales tax purposes. The response to that is that the liability to register is all embracing, irrespective of whether taxable or non-taxable sales are made. The Commissioner of Taxation may dispense with registrations where only non-taxable sales are made, but that dispensation becomes ineffective if taxable sales are made. Pending the passage of the present Bills into law, the Commissioner is registering persons who apply for registration in anticipation of the Bills becoming law, but is not seeking in any way to enforce the obligation to register in respect of persons who will become liable to pay sales tax only because of these Bills. Upon the Bills becoming law, the Commissioner will take administrative steps to remind persons who have not registered of their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> As to penalties, Parliament is presumed not to legislate retrospectively in relation to penal provisions of a law unless there is a clear intention to do so. There is no such intention in these Bills. Therefore, I am advised that any possible penalty liability can arise only in relation to acts and omissions occurring after the Bills pass into law. The obligation to account for sales tax will operate from 19 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Senator Walsh's example of a butcher selling a bullock's liver. Where a retail butcher sells meat for human consumption that meat is exempt from sales tax. It is irrelevant that the customer may feed that meat or some of it to domestic pets. If, however, a retail butcher puts meat up for sale for animals kept as domestic pets then, subject to two qualifications, that meat will be subject to sales tax. Let me give the qualifications. Firstly, prepared pet food, whether fresh or otherwise, purchased by the retail butcher from the wholesaler will be liable for sales tax at the time it is sold to the butcher. That is because the tax is basically a wholesale sales tax. Secondly, where the pet food is manufactured by the butcher and the amount of sales tax which would be payable by him is not or would not be in excess of $250 per annum, then that pet food is exempt from sales tax. This is a long-standing exemption applicable to businesses with low taxable sales and is found in item 103 of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop raised a number of issues, some of which were along the same lines as those raised by Senator Walsh. Senator Jessop was concerned at the nature of the advice which was tendered to the Government. Given that Budget changes cannot be bruited abroad until they are announced on Budget night, it is not correct to say that the Government relies entirely on the bureaucracy. Advice is given from time to time to the Government from various quarters. That advice is accumulated for consideration in formulating the Budget so that inputs come from many different sources. That was the case with the sales tax changes. Many of the corrections of anomalies and inconsistencies arose out of representations from interested parties, some extending over significant periods. Those representations were weighed up in the light of other inquiries made in formulating the Budget and reflect those industry representations in many cases. Other changes reflect anomalies which have been the subject of adverse comment in the media and other places, in some cases, for years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop also raised the case of certain retailers who were refusing to pay the additional sales tax until the Bills become law. I respond by saying that while it is good business sense for a wholesaler to charge sales tax at the proposed rate of tax from 19 August 1981, it is correct that a retailer is not liable at present to pay the extra tax. The Commissioner of Taxation will not be taking any action to require payment of that extra tax until the Bills become law. Therefore, there is nothing more than a question of business prudence and good sense on the part of the wholesalers. They will become liable to pay the new rates with effect from 19 August 1981 when the Bills become law, and will thereby also have the right to recover the additional tax from their customers within the terms of the sales tax law. I think that perhaps explains the position that was raised by Senator Jessop. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters were raised by Senator Jessop on which he had received representations and which he wished to bring before the Senate. I have answers to the specific questions that he raised. Glace fruit is to be taxed at 17.5 per cent with effect from 19 August. This has always been quite clear. I do not know how it could have been thought to be taxable at 2 1/2 per cent from 1 January 1982. Another matter raised was kangaroo meat. If it is sold as food for animals kept as domestic pets it is to be taxed at 17.5 per cent. Bird seed is exempt from sales tax and will remain so. The suggestion that certain bird seed is now to be taxed at 2 1/2 per cent has no foundation . The Government well recognises the problems of certain persons who may have arranged to purchase goods which were previously exempt from tax but which are now to be taxed or goods which are to be taxed at a higher rate. This is a feature of changes in the sales tax law and also in the customs tariff. The reverse applies to persons who purchase goods immediately before the rate reductions. Whilst the Government has some sympathy for persons who find themselves in these situations, the sales tax liability question arises on the date on which the sale of goods takes place and not when the order is placed or when a deposit or part payment has been made. The question of when the goods are sold is a question of fact to be resolved in accordance with the law relating to the sale of goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter raised referred to building materials. The response to that question is as follows: The proposal to tax building materials has aroused a lot of comment as to how much the price of houses will go up because of the rate of tax. I am advised that based on the assumption that the cost of a house can be equally divided between labour costs and builders profit on the one hand and the cost of materials on the other hand, an average house costing $40,000 to build will include around $400 sales tax. It follows, of course, that more expensive houses will include a larger amount of sales tax in their cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop was also concerned that there was some retrospectivity in the legislation. Whilst I understand the point that Senator Jessop is making about retrospectivity, I must say that the Bills to come into effect on 19 August are not only in accord with the traditional practice for sales tax rates and classification changes but also comply with the procedure adopted by the Government when making amendments to the income tax law. To do otherwise would be to allow time for manipulation of stocks to avoid for some time at least announced prospective increases. Because of the much wider ramifications of the proposals which are to come into effect on 1 January the Government decided that prior notice was necessary for these matters to be understood and for the work to be done to put those into effect. A large number of firms will have to register for sales tax purposes and make appropriate accounting and other administrative changes. The Taxation Office also needs time to prepare for a significantly increased flow of sales tax work arising from these changes. Another matter raised by Senator Jessop related to the case of a pharmaceutical supplier in South Australia. Senator Jessop advised the Senate that he had taken up this matter with the Treasurer. The Treasurer's response to Senator Jessop on that matter was incorporated in Hansard. I think I need not add anything further to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans, in the course of his speech, stated that the packaging of foodstuffs is now to be taxed. I am advised by the Commissioner of Taxation that this is not so. Packaging for use in marketing exempt goods, which includes foodstuffs, remains exempt under items 91 to 93 of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. This means that the inner and outer packaging for foodstuffs will remain exempt from tax, but courtesy or security wrappings by retail stores will become taxable. If I might illustrate this with an example. The waxed paper liner and the cardboard carton for a packet of cornflakes will remain exempt from tax, but the brown paper bag into which that package is placed in the retail store will be taxable at 2 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans referred to the matter of freight charges incurred by wholesale merchants in country areas. This is admittedly a vexed problem which has been considered many times over the years. The Asprey Taxation Review Committee considered the problem but decided not to recommend any change. The problem arises equally where goods are sold between capital cities as it does where goods are sold between a capital city and rural areas. If freight charges were simply removed out of the price for which the goods were sold at the last wholesale price, decentralised industries would then be put at a disadvantage because their freight costs are found in the cost of their raw materials rather than the sale of the finished products in the country areas. If one were to consider alternatives, the first point to note is that total exclusion seems administratively impracticable for businesses. Raw materials go through several stages of processing. The amount of freight incurred each time the goods changed hands would not be known to the final wholesaler who pays the tax unless invoicing became very complex. Every freight charge would need to be recorded from the ground up and shown in all documents relating to subsequent stages of processing and manufacture and later dissected between taxable and non-taxable goods. Businesses could hardly be expected to accept the burden of recording, even in a computer age. If something along those lines were attempted, there would be considerable additional costs in keeping the necessary records, and when these were allowed to flow on to selling prices, any savings in sales tax from the move would be somewhat more limited than expected. It is not at all clear that such a scheme would in fact benefit rural dwellers and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point raised by Senator Evans was that there has been no attempt to confine the impact of the measures to luxuries and to keep them off necessities. Sales tax has never been confined to luxuries, but already extends to a range of other goods. In broadening its base, it is obviously essential to cover an even wider range of non-luxury goods. There is a strong case to broaden the base of indirect taxes to a significant extent. That will leave the potential for further income tax reductions in future as economic and budgetary conditions permit. It will also help to reduce the weight of indirect taxes which a handful of commodities have to bear. The excisable goods and sales tax on motor vehicles have accounted for three-quarters of the Commonwealth's indirect tax revenue for some years. In order to meet these objectives, it is necessary for the broadening of the base of indirect taxes to be large enough to have a substantial revenue effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans and Senator Walsh and I think others, have said that the sales tax measures are inflationary. In preparing the Budget the Government in fact gave priority to containing and reducing inflation. It is misreading the situation to suggest that if the sales tax component of the increase in the consumer price index were removed, inflation would be just that much less. The Budget surplus or deficit would be worsened and that could have its own inflationary consequences. There are much larger things than the indirect tax component of the CPI giving rise to the inflation problem. By far the largest influence on the CPI will be the mounting wage pressures. The relatively small effects of the sales tax measure should not be allowed to distract attention from that fact and other economic facts. The immediate effects of the sales tax measures on the CPI will be offset over the longer term by the beneficial effects on inflation of reductions in the size of the Budget deficit and the easing of pressures on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of questions were raised which related to books, magazines and newspapers. Perhaps two points ought to be made fairly briefly. The first is that it is common in European countries to impose a value added tax on books and magazines, and for the information of honourable senators I cite some examples of the VAT imposed by various countries. In Austria it is 8 per cent at a reduced rate and in Belgium it is 6 per cent. In Denmark, newspapers and periodicals are exempt but without credits for the tax that is charged on supplies that go into their making. Books are taxed at 22 per cent. In France it is 7 per cent, in West Germany it is 6.5 per cent, in Ireland it is 10 per cent and in the Netherlands it is 4 per cent. In Sweden, newspapers and periodicals are exempt with credits for inputs, but books are taxed at 19 per cent. Norway and the United Kingdom do not impose VAT and allow credits for inputs. There is therefore no basis for the claim that Australia is the only country in the Western world to impose a tax on books, magazines and newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point that I ought to make, I think, is that Senator Ryan claimed that the Government was acting contrary to a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation agreement. I understand that she was referring to the Florence agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials. Australia is not a signatory to that agreement but the Government has stated previously that it subscribes to its principles. The present proposal to tax books, magazines and newspapers is not in conflict with that agreement. Article I of the agreement makes it clear that a contracting State undertakes not to impose Customs duties or other charges on or in connection with the importation of books and publications. The agreement expressly provides that the prohibition against charges on importation does not prevent a contracting state from imposing internal taxes at the time of importation where such taxes also apply to like domestic products. Australia taxed imported newspapers at the general rate of tax between 1930 and 1967 and I am advised that the present proposal does not offend that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some speeches made this evening. In one of them Senator Mason moved the amendment with regard to his party's attitude. With regard to that I would have to say of course that we do not accept the amendment that has been put forward by the Australian Democrats. There is a need to broaden the base of the sales tax to reduce the weight of indirect taxes on a handful of commodities. To achieve that, the broadening of the base needs to be large enough to have a substantial revenue effect. That was what was attempted in this particular proposal in the Budget, and if special pleading had led the Government to keep the sales tax off the new categories of goods, the effect would have been negligible or else it would have meant very great increases on existing commodities which are taxed. The proposals that have been put forward in this Budget to raise sales tax on the variety of goods that have been shown were ones that were carefully considered and ones which are, as I said earlier, an integral part of the Budget. Senator Harradine has made comments with regard to his own attitude on this matter. Perhaps I ought to say that some of the matters that were referred to by him as constitutional requirements could have a brief comment along the lines that the constitutional requirements are that the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Income Tax (Rates) Act be separate, not the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The other thing that ought to be said too, with regard--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of Bills before the Senate. There are other indirect taxes, too, which already apply in this country in fairly large terms and they are just as great. Perhaps if we were to try to analyse the way in which we collect the revenue that is required we would see that traditional excises and the crude oil levy are estimated to increase much less than sales tax in 1981-82, and the Budget estimate of the combined increase in those three areas, that is sales tax, the excises and the crude oil levy, is for a 15.5 per cent increase this year compared with a 16.2 per cent increase last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been said on many different occasions the purpose of this Budget was to make as low a demand from the public sector on the loan market, on the borrowing requirements of Australia, and many of the measures that are contained in the Budget are designed to do just that. One of those measures is, of course, to raise the revenue from the sources that we have from personal tax and from the indirect taxes, to achieve what we have as the outcome of this Budget. Senator Siddons seemed to be in no doubt as to whether these are money Bills or Bills that raise revenue for the Government. I noted the comments he made when seconding the motion moved by Senator Mason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Harradine moving the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate declares that any decision by the Senate to make request to the House of Representatives for amendment of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 does not indicate that the Senate considers that all of the provisions of those Bills are properly included in Bills imposing taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>I move for the suspension of Standing Orders so as to enable me to move that motion. It is difficult for me to advance reasons for the suspension of Standing Orders without canvassing the proposition which I will seek to move following Standing Orders having been suspended. In my view it is necessary for this motion to be accepted by the Senate so as not to allow people to run away with the idea that in moving requests at the second reading stage of consideration of these Bills, as has been indicated, we thereby regard that set of Bills as being properly drawn. The position is set out quite clearly in section 53 of the Constitution which provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, you will recall that I have outlined to the Senate and to the people of Australia the viewpoint that is held by, I think, everyone on this side of the House and admitted by the Government, and that is that Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 are drafted in a most unique fashion; indeed, so unique that they come before us in a manner in which they have not come before the Senate since 1930-that is to say, in the past 51 years. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in her reply to the second reading debate admitted, in fact, that amendments to assessment Acts should not be included in Bills imposing taxation. If one has a look at the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) there is an amendment in effect to the Sales Tax Assessment Act. Therefore, it is reasonable for this Senate to suspend Standing Orders so as to debate the proposition that agreeing with the requests, as we are likely to do, does not indicate that the Senate considers that all of the provisions of those Bills are properly included in Bills imposing taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be claimed by the Government that in so doing it is considered by me or some other people who may vote for that proposition that we do not regard such a Bill as a Bill properly drafted in accordance with section 53 of the Constitution. The Government may then say that under section 53 those Bills-that is, Bills imposing taxation, et cetera-are the ones concerning which there can be requests made to the House of Representatives. That would be an adequate statement so far as it went. The a fortiori argument is that if we can send requests to the House of Representatives about Bills imposing taxation we can send requests to the House of Representatives about any Bills whatsoever. In fact, one finds that this is implied in section 57 of the Constitution which deals with disagreement between the Houses. That section reads:</PARA>
<PARA> If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the House of Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the proposed law with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is talking about any law whatsoever-not just laws imposing taxation but any laws whatsoever. It is stated in this section that suggestions can be made to those laws. It may be claimed by the Government that a suggestion is not a request within the meaning of the Constitution. In my view, of course, a suggestion is a request. What is to happen with the suggestions that are made? Are they to remain in an atmosphere of suspended animation? Are we going to set up a suggestion box in the middle of Kings Hall into which these suggestions will be popped and cleared out, for example, by the Secretary to the Joint House Department and we will be given a bonus every now and again? Of course not. Suggestions are in fact requests. If the argument advanced by the Government is that the suggestions, as envisaged, are not requests, it falls to the ground. For all those reasons, I think it is essential for the Senate to suspend Standing Orders and clear the decks, as it were, for me and for other senators to vote honourably for requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators will be aware that on 1 September this year new health funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States came into force. Under these arrangements annual grants are paid to each state pursuant to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 for the provision of health services by the States. The grants include an amount towards the cost to the hospitals of supplying pharmaceuticals to all patients. The amount is related to the expenditure by States for pharmaceuticals under the previous hospital cost sharing agreements, which in most States expired on 30 June this year, with continuation of the arrangements, without formal agreements until 31 August to synchronise with the new health insurance which came into effect on 1 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States are being funded for pharmaceuticals under the new arrangements to the extent that can be justified by past experience. Within the National Health Act there is an alternative provision whereby hospital authorities could be reimbursed for their expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits. Section 94 authorises the approval of hospital authorities to supply pharmaceutical benefits, and those authorities are entitled to a reimbursement at a level determined by the Minister under section 99. This arrangement operated until the commencement of the Commonwealth-State cost sharing agreements in 1975. Under those agreements, States had agreed not to claim under secton 99. In States where those agreements are no longer in force it is now open to those hospitals which have been approved again to claim reimbursement. This is inconsistent with the Government's policy and, if taken advantage of, in the Governments view would represent a duplication of funding as regards pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Act was originally drafted no provision was made for such an eventuality, and approvals of hospitals to dispense pharmaceutical benefits cannot be revoked in such circumstances. In order to avoid any excess payment by the Commonwealth, the Government intends to amend the National Health Act at the earliest opportunity to empower the Minister to revoke the approvals. The amendment will allow revocation from today. The purpose of this statement is to make it clear to all concerned that existing approvals of recognised public hospitals under section 94 of the National Health Act will be revoked from today. </PARA>

<PARA>I have no intention of keeping the Senate for long. The statement by Senator Baume raises a technical matter which occurs because of the new health arrangements and the manner in which they were introduced into this Parliament. The new health arrangements were conceived in haste and were prepared without proper consideration by the Government. As a result, the Government finds itself in the difficult situation of having hospitals being able to provide their own pharmaceuticals and, therefore, claim payment from the Government under section 94 of the National Health Act. When changes are made to a scheme such as our national health scheme one would expect that the changes would be developed with care. One would have expected that the Government would have thought through all the likely results of such legislation and the drafting of such legislation. </PARA>

For example, I do not have the name of the contractor and I am not certain whether there was any inflammable freight in the van. I understand that a road mail contractor van, which was not an Australia Post van, was on a run last night from Adelaide to Mount Gambier. The van left Adelaide last night and about 13 miles from Meningie the driver smelled burning in the van. The driver detected a small fire in the rear of the engine and used his extinguisher. However fire got out of control and the van was destroyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The van was carrying 96 bags of mail copies of the Adelaide News paper and other articles. I cannot give the honourable senator details of what the other articles were but I will try to obtain that information. All the contents were destroyed with the exception of about 300 letters. Those letters will be delivered, I am advised, within the next couple of days-perhaps slightly charred. Australia Post has investigators on the scene. I am advised that it is satisfied that the van met all Australia Post safety requirements. I understand that that does not answer all the honourable senator's questions. I will refer the unanswered parts to my colleague and attempt to obtain more information for the honourable senator as soon as I can do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator McClelland's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 24 of the Roads Grants Act 1981 requires that only national roads construction work be put to tender. It is the Government's policy to obtain the best value from the money it spends on roads. We believe that only by fostering a competitive environment can the Government be satisfied that the best value for money is being achieved. As national highways are eligible for 100 per cent Commonwealth funding, it is the responsibility of the Government to obtain the best value for taxpayers' money spent on such roads.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) The arrangements for any redeployment of staff and plant resulting from the requirement that national highway construction works be put to tender are a matter for individual councils. The claim that hundreds of local council workers will be thrown into unemployment and millions of dollars worth of heavy machinery will be idle is pure speculation, especially when it is realised that councils are free to tender for national road construction projects and there is the possibility to redeploy staff and heavy machinery from national highway construction to maintenance work and projects on arterial and local roads.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The study report recommended a number of measures designed to increase the level of cost recovery for general aviation as a whole to that level associated with the recovery of short run incremental costs. On the 1977-78 data available to the study team, the level was approximately 34 per cent of allocated costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The measures recommended in the report were:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) an increase in air navigation charges of 25 per cent. This was not to be applied generally, and certain exceptions such as agricultural aviation were proposed,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the introduction of aircraft movement charges for general aviation, including gliding operations, at primary capital city airports, shared airports and general aviation airports, that is, at the 27 Commonwealth airports which are listed in Table 9.5 on page 173 of the study report. It was proposed that the movement charges would be $20 at primary airports, $10 at shared airports, and $4 at general aviation airports. It was not proposed that charges be imposed at Commonwealth airports not listed in the table. Movement charges were to be applied on the basis of a movement being either a take-off or a landing except for flying training operations involving circuits, where a touch and go operation should be treated as a single movement. Associated with these principal recommendations concerning charges, certain relatively minor measures were also recommended, namely,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the 50 per cent 'based away' refund or remission for all general aviation and the 15 per cent remission for agricultural aviation be abolished,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) aircraft operating under permit be subject to lower air navigation charges to equate that achieved through the presently allowable 50 per cent reduction in air navigation charges by refunds or remissions,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) consideration be given to introducing air navigation charges for gliders to recover the costs associated with their use of airway services; and</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) a separate air navigation charges classification be introduced for the agricultural aviation sub-sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) On 16 July 1981 the Government announced that it had rejected the cost recovery recommendations of the general aviation study. It is intended that air navigation charges for general aviation will in future be considered each year in the Budget context, as has been done in the past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1981 (Hansard, page 53) Senator Jessop asked me a question without notice concerning the administrative costs covered by the Commonwealth grant to South Australia for local roads. The question also raised the point that local government in South Australia raises and spends $46m on roads. In my reply I undertook to check the accuracy of this figure to which Senator Jessop referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> This statement was made to the South Australian Public Accounts Committee by a member of the Local Government Association.</PARA>
<PARA> Local government in South Australia does spend in the vicinity of $46m on roads from sources other than Commonwealth and State Government road grants. Australian Municipal Information System data suggests that this figure is correct for the years 1975-76 and 1976-77, and that more recently the amount has increased to over $50m.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible, however, to determine whether the total amount is raised by local government. For instance, it is possible that the figure referred to by Senator Jessop includes some general revenue sharing funds from the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1981 (Hansard, page 56) Senator Martin asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. It refers to a newspaper report today that the Department of Transport will today seek talks with airlines on the subject of the critical shortage of air traffic controllers, which will probably result in a curtailment of services to some major airports, and that Brisbane Airport is most likely to be affected first. Can the Minister confirm that the first proposition to be put to the airlines today is that the 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew at Brisbane Airport be extended by two hours, closing from probably 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. to jet operations? Will the Minister give an assurance that if such an agreement is reached it will not operate for those months when daylight saving is in operation in other States in Australia, given that when other States advance their clocks by one hour it is necessary for people seeking interstate connections for flights originating at Brisbane to leave at 6 a.m.?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the shortage of air traffic controllers throughout Australia, particularly in Queensland, the Department of Transport has announced that Brisbane terminal airspace, including the airport, will be closed between 9 p.m. and midnight from 10 September until sufficient controllers are trained in the terminal area control techniques to permit the resumption of normal operations at the airport. For the other 21 hours each day, operations at Brisbane airport are unaffected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 August 1981 (Hansard, page 225) Senator McLaren asked me a question, and a supplementary question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. His question concerned the proposed sale of wool stores controlled by the Australian Wool Corporation in Palmyra, Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following additional information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A number approximating 20 per cent of the wool stores which are managed, controlled and maintained by the Australian Wool Corporation in accordance with Part VII of the Wool Industry Act are situated on leasehold land. Many of the leases, as is the case with the land leased at Palmyra, have been re-negotiated from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation nominated the stores which are surplus to its minimum requirements. Four of the twelve stores at Palmyra are expected to be disposed of during this financial year and the remainder in 1983-84.</PARA>
<PARA> The stores will not necessarily be disposed of as a going concern but under the conditions of the lease the actual buildings are Commonwealth property, vested in the Australian Wool Corporation, and could even be dismantled and sold as second-hand building materials.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services will be acting on behalf of the Australian Wool Corporation in the disposal activities in all States. I would expect open and honest dealing as a matter of course from the representatives of Commonwealth interests in the transactions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 August 1981 (Hansard, page 322) Senator Ryan asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, without notice, whether the Minister was prepared to instruct the Chief Australian Electoral Officer to make Commonwealth enrolment claim cards available at all polling booths for the forthcoming elections for the National Aboriginal Conference. I indicated that the Minister was not prepared to issue such an instruction. Senator Ryan then asked the following supplementary question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, does the Minister consider that by providing enrolment forms and information at booths the Chief Australian Electoral Officer would be acting within the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in the same way as he is acting when he sends enrolment forms to householders in urban areas, which those people are invited to fill out to maintain their position on the rolls?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no suggestion that the provision of enrolment claim cards and enrolment entitlement information at National Aboriginal Conference polling booths is to be seen in the same light as the Australian Electoral Office sending enrolment claim cards through the mail inviting householders in urban areas to maintain their positions on the rolls. Generally speaking the Australian Electoral Office only sends cards to those whom it has reason to believe are subject to the compulsory enrolment provision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of simply having enrolment claim cards and enrolment information available at NAC polling booths the position is-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) cards could be made available;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) there is no enrolment information available in suitable form and in sufficient numbers that could be used to explain to Aboriginals their electoral rights-and in particular that enrolment on their part is voluntary;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in fact the Australian Electoral Office while it conducts electoral education/information programs for Aboriginals does not solicit Aboriginal enrolment;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) on the other hand in respect of the NAC elections there is active encouragement for Aboriginals to attend and complete a voter card on polling day for that election;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the active encouragement to participate in the NAC election and the presence of Commonwealth enrolment cards at NAC polling booths would no doubt lead to confusion in the minds of Aboriginals on the question whether they should enrol for Commonwealth electoral purposes. It could even be seen as a campaign by the Australian Electoral Office to enrol Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) furthermore, the polling officials engaged to conduct the NAC election are not officers of the Australian Electoral Office. In accordance with the procedures for the conduct of NAC elections they will, wherever possible, be Aboriginals. Many will be undertaking this activity for the first time and the Australian Electoral Office is endeavouring to keep procedures in the polling place as simple as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) In any event the involvement of these polling officials in the NAC election procedures will not leave them with any time to explain to Aboriginals the differences between paricipating in NAC and Commonwealth elections or that for Commonwealth elections, enrolment was a purely voluntary act on their part.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the adjournment debate on 20 August, (Hansard, page 211) Senator Colston raised a number of questions regarding the establishment of Trans Australia Airlines as a public company and TAA groundstaff superannuation. His questions sought clarification of a response provided by the Minister for Transport to earlier questions on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the possible sale of equity in TAA, as has been repeatedly made clear the Government has made no decision on such a sale and will not consider the matter again until after the consultants have reported and the Parliament has had the opportunity to debate that report. Therefore such issues as priority in the allocation of equity to TAA staff have not been addressed. The consultant has not yet been appointed but it is anticipated that interested parties will be invited to make submissions shortly. As stated by the Minister for Transport on earlier occasions, the consultant will be required to report before 30 June 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the establishment of TAA as a public company is quite separate from changes to the superannuation arrangements applying to TAA. As to the first of these questions, I repeat that the legislation to transfer TAA's operations to a public company provided for the transfer of all staff on the same terms and conditions as applied to them when employed by the Australian National Airlines Commission. Changes to the TAA superannuation arrangements had been in train for some time prior to the decision to change the status of TAA. In fact, TAA's 1979-80 annual report referred to the superannuation proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> It was decided that the former arrangements whereby TAA groundstaff and flight engineers were permitted to join the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme were no longer appropriate. Rather, it was considered that TAA superannuation arrangements should follow the industry standard set by arrangements operated by Ansett Airlines of Australia for its staff.</PARA>
<PARA> With effect from 1 July 1980, no further TAA employees have been permitted to join the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. TAA staff who joined that scheme prior to 1 July 1980 may continue their membership and they will not be obliged to join the new superannuation arrangements. However, should these employees wish to transfer to the new TAA superannuation plan they may at their option apply to transfer with full credit for their period of membership of the Commonwealth scheme. I emphasise that any such transfers will be at the option of the employees concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The details of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme can be found in the Superannuation Act 1976. Broadly, it is a scheme where benefits on death or retirement are available as a pension, with an option to receive the employee-financed part of the benefit in lump sum form. The employer-financed part of the pension is not commutable and is therefore subject to post-retirement pension increases. The new superannuation plans for TAA ground staff are schemes that provide lump sum benefits of amounts related to the length of scheme membership and significant benefits on resignation prior to attaining retirement age.</PARA>
<PARA> The principal difference in the costs to TAA of the former and new superannuation arrangements is that as the new plans provide lump sum benefits on retirement there is no need to meet the cost of post-retirement pension increases. It is not possible at this stage to indicate the extent of future savings. Suffice to say that any reduction in costs to levels approaching those of its competitors will assist TAA's competitive position.</PARA>
<PARA> The new TAA groundstaff and flight engineer superannuation arrangements do not affect the other longer standing schemes for TAA pilots and flight attendants. These latter schemes already reflect airline industry standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Mutual Provident Society was selected to administer the new superannuation arrangements and provide investment services. I understand that the Society provides similar services to Ansett Airlines of Australia and has thus experience in the airline industry environment. It is correct that Sir Robert Law-Smith is a director of the AMP Society but the Government does not see any conflict of interest arising from this.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the years TAA has, with Government approval, borrowed amounts from its superannuation funds for general business purposes. No such borrowings were specifically for the Airbus purchases.</PARA>
<PARA> As to TAA's corporate structure, the establishment of TAA as a public company has not yet taken place. As set out in the Australian National Airlines Repeal Act 1981, TAA's operations will be transferred to a public company, specifically established for the purpose, on a day which has yet to be proclaimed. At present, TAA still operates as the Australian National Airlines Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the repeal Act quite carefully preserve as far as possible the terms and conditions of employment, including superannuation, enjoyed by TAA staff immediately prior to the transfer. Thus those employees who have transferred before that day to the new ground staff superannuation scheme will find their terms, conditions and entitlements maintained in accordance with the legislation after the transfer, as well as those who have continued their membership of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.</PARA>
