<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. A short time ago I asked the Minister about foreign ownership of rural land in Australia. Since then, I have had several reports expressing concern on this subject. The main concern of people is that Australian rural land may be owned by nationals alien to our democracy. I ask the Minister whether the Government, in consultation with the States, will seriously consider setting up a Federal register of land ownership in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I well recall the earlier question that was asked by Senator Elstob. The Government would share his anxiety if it could be revealed that there were trends leading to serious and significant foreign ownership of land, particulary rural land. I had indicated that primarily the matter is one of State sovereignty, although one does not resile from a Federal responsibility in terms of the entry of investment capital. I had traversed the ground concerning how difficult it is to trace investment capital through its various stages. Whilst I would not comment at this moment on the idea of having a Federal register, as such-it may present some difficulties in a federation-there is obvious merit in having consultation at the Federal-State level to consider the problem. As I understand the honourable senator, he is seeking a solution of the problem rather than the employment of a particular mechanism. I will refer the matter to the relevant Ministers who would be, I believe, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and ask them to give it consideration. I believe that in fact the Treasurer already has under consideration the general question of the direction of investment funds in Australia. Our primary interest is to ensure, as far as possible, that a significant proportion of inflowing funds should be in the form of investment capital in developmental works which would employ Australians, not simply provide foreign ownership. In that spirit, I will refer the general principle of the question to the relevant Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>

Although the Government is not currently contemplating further additions to that base, the recently increased maritime activity in and around our northern approaches will be maintained.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to Aspect House, the crisis and respite centre for handicapped children in Hobart. The Minister last week said that he was considering the comments of parents on the report on the continuing funding of the centre. Is it a fact that the Minister has now decided that Aspect House will not receive recurrent funding from this Government? Is it also a fact that a similar decision has been made in relation to the Tasmanian Aboriginal Child Care Centre in Launceston? Why has the Government taken this attitude, if it has? If these decisions have been made, why have the organisations concerned not been informed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am frightfully chuffed by the fact that the honourable senator's source of information is so inaccurate. I am used to people getting all sorts of information from all sorts of places. The honourable senator seems to be grossly misinformed. I welcome this new development in Federal Government affairs. However, the matter of Aspect House is still under consideration. As I indicated before, I have been in close consultation with State Government Ministers from the honourable senator's home State. The matter is still receiving consideration at State Government level. I expect to speak again to the new Minister concerned, Mr Adams, later this week. I indicated before that the two governments were working together on the problem, and that is still the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Aspect House received funding from the Commonwealth through the family support services scheme, a scheme which provides funds on the recommendation of the State government. So there has been a close involvement of both governments from the beginning in respect of Aspect House. That is continuing and I will at the earliest opportunity let the Senate know what the decision is with respect to Aspect House. I would, however, expect to make Aspect House aware of that decision before I make a public announcement because I think that would be the proper and polite thing to do. There are, as the honourable senator would know, a number of people who are very concerned about that situation. I have not responded to the detailed submission they have put in. I therefore will not make any announcement in this place until they have had a proper and formal reply to the views they put to me and to the Tasmanian State Government.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Tasmanian Aboriginal child care agency, again I am a little mystified as to why the honourable senator should assume that it is not to be funded. There has been a quite long history to this matter, which may be the reason for the honourable senator's statement. I think most honourable senators would know that there was a proliferation of Aboriginal child care agencies under the administration of this portfolio by my predecessor, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who funded first the Victorian agency. Since then agencies have been funded in most States but not yet in Tasmania. A proposition put forward by a Tasmanian group has been under detailed consideration between the group and my Department and I think, again, relevant State authorities. I have looked at papers on that within the last 24 hours. I am not sure of the propriety of making an announcement here, but I can say to the Senate that funds are to be provided to the Tasmanian agency to provide some services in that State.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, although some aspects of it bear upon the responsibilities of the Treasurer. Is it true that schools, colleges and universities are exempt from the proposed sales tax on books? Is it also true that professional persons and others may, when exceeding the terms of the general rebate, claim the cost of appropriate books as a full tax deduction? However, with regard to sales tax on book purchases by individual students, is it true that it is not practical to distinguish students from other persons in order to exempt them from the tax or to distinguish essential text books from other books in order to exempt those books from the tax? Has it been drawn to the Minister's attention that for a tertiary student, as one example, the cost of essential text books, including the 2* per cent sales tax, will approximate $200 each year? Accordingly, and finally, I ask that the Minister and the Government give urgent consideration to increasing the incidentals allowance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme which has been held at the same level now for many years, that is, $100 for eligible university students, $70 for college students and $30 for technical and further education students.</PARA></TALK.START>

If so, why has the Minister refused to approve the employment of Aboriginal liaison officers in outback central Australia where English is not spoken or written by a large number of Aboriginal people?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think I have approved the appointment of 10 part time Aboriginal liaison officers in Queensland. I was in Alice Springs a week or two ago and I spoke there with the Aboriginal liaison officer in Alice Springs. I can assure the honourable senator that we do have Aboriginal liaison officers in central Australia. We do not have our full complement at the moment. I think we are seeking at least one additional recruit. One Aboriginal liaison officer who was there retired recently. I think the allocation for that part of Australia is three.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There may be some confusion in the honourable senator's question with our proposal to appoint some paid agents of the Department on an experimental basis. That was announced at Budget time. The proposal is that, in centres where there is an inadequate volume of work to justify a full time officer of the Department, we might see whether the appointment of a part time paid agent might provide a useful link between the Department and the clients it seeks to serve. That is an experiment. The locations in which those paid agents will be appointed have not yet been determined. I am awaiting recommendations from my Department. But it is anticipated that they will be appointed in a variety of types of communities, including some Aboriginal communities, so that we can get an idea of whether that is a successful way of extending the contact between my Department and its clients in the more remote parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I will, however, check the Aboriginal liaison officer position generally. It may be that the number in Queensland is 10. I am sorry that I do not recollect the precise arrangements, but I will let the honourable senator have a more detailed reply. It is certainly true that there are difficulties in terms of client contact in parts of central Australia. At places such as Yuendumu the local Aboriginal council has itself employed someone to do liaison work between the Department and the community. This is an area in which the Government and the Department are concerned to ensure effective service delivery and we are looking to making continuing improvements in this area.</PARA>

Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that yesterday the Minister, in very categorical terms, made the position of the Government clear in respect of the no frills service being offered. In fact, I believe that he has telexed both Ansett and Trans Australia Airlines drawing their attention to the fact that there has been a very high degree of cancellation of services between Canberra and Sydney and, for that matter, Canberra and Melbourne in recent times. As to drawing the attention of the Minister to expanding further that point of view and to pointing out to the companies providing the services-in particular Ansett-that the services ought to be better advertised, I will certainly refer that part of Senator Reid's question to the Minister and ask him to consider the matter favourably.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Thomas comes from Geraldton he would have a very keen interest for himself and his constituents in whether the satellite is properly placed. I am aware that some people in Western Australia have expressed concern about the planned orbital position of the satellite. The early planning proposals placed the satellite in an orbit above the Equator at a position, I understand, 128 degrees east, which is aligned with the Western Australian border with the Northern Territory. Following further studies and advice from two international consultants, it was decided to place the satellite at 160 degrees east. This is the basis of the concern expressed by Senator Thomas. The planned position of the satellite does not disadvantage Western Australia; in fact, to the contrary. I think that is the important point to make. From that position further east Australia will look narrower than it would from a position above the Equator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The signal strength of the transmission received from the satellite by Western Australia will actually be greater, not less, than it would be if the satellite were placed north of Australia. I am advised, although I do not claim to be a physicist, that this arises from application of the basic laws of physics. I am not told which basic laws of physics, but I have no reason to doubt what I have been told. I understand that this will mean that the beam will be narrower and therefore more concentrated on the target area. The matters have been discussed with the Western Australian Government and it acknowledges that the location of the satellite, as specified in the request to the tenderer, will not disadvantage Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In strict terms, the answer to the honourable senator's initial question is no. There was a Review of Commonwealth Functions decision that involved examining the work of social workers in the Department of Social Security, and that was specifically related to the need to ensure that their work was related to the responsibilities of my Department. The review was carried out by the Public Service Board, not by the Department, and is either not yet complete or just complete. Honourable senators would be aware that, in the various decentralised offices of the Department, social workers provide a link between the clients and the Department, particularly in circumstances of difficulty, whether difficulty of communication or difficulty of social circumstance. The role of those social workers is, I think, well established and unlikely to be interfered with.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think that one related to whether an extension of the existing ban on television and radio advertising of cigarettes would be in line with the Government's stated policy. I can emphasise that the Commonwealth has no power to extend the existing bans to the print media. This is very much within the province of the State governments. The bans which we introduced were introduced under the Broadcasting and Television Act. The question of further bans is primarily one for consideration by individual State governments.

Is this the reason for the Commonwealth Government's insistence that Telecom Australia generate revenue sufficient to provide approximately two-thirds of its gross capital expenditure requirements? Further, is it a fact that of all major public utilities in Australia the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission has, for the past two years in particular and generally, had the lowest proportion-that is, less than one-fifth-of its gross capital expenditure provided from internally generated funds? Does this indicate that current consumers are in fact being heavily subsidised?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rae's question raises some very important principles. It is a fact that a number of statutory bodies, no doubt directed by governments for political purposes, have engaged in what is very improvident husbandry. That is, to take a quick trick, if I may use that phrase, they have kept tariffs unduly low. They are putting their heads in the sand by not disclosing to the people, the community, that if they do not bear a substantial proportion of capital development from revenue, they will have to get it in the end from borrowing. The interest charges on that borrowing in the long run will cost the consumer much more heavily. So the device of a low percentage is an illusory one; it is bad husbandry and, in the long run, punitive to the community itself. It is true, therefore, that the Commonwealth Government has been taking the view that Telecom should increase its percentage of capital development out of the ordinary tariff revenue so that the long term indebtedness would not build up with huge interest charges and bear more heavily on the community. The fact of the matter is that all responsible treasuries in Australia recognise this and all responsible economists recognise this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now give an illustration of the situation by way of figures. The percentage of internally generated funds as a proportion of gross capital expenditure for Telecom, for example, during the two previous years was 64.8 per cent in 1978-79 and 66.7 per cent in 1979-80. I think Senator Rae asked about the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission. Its figures were 12.4 per cent in 1978-79 and 20 per cent in 1979-80.

More importantly, perhaps, does this statement about films mean that the proposed new uniform literature censorship system, which was also decided and announced at that meeting, will apply the lowest rather than the highest standards of tolerance now prevailing?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having viewed some of the films that are in fact banned altogether I think we would be plunging back into the dark ages if they were perpetrated on the Australian community. All the State Ministers who had the opportunity at that meeting of viewing some of the absolutely ghastly material that is produced by obviously sick minds would, I think, be astounded at the suggestion that control of censorship of this material should be completely removed. I think it was also clear from the discussions that took place and the methods of cuts on certain films employed by the Film Censorship Board that there is still a fairly liberal attitude indeed taken-perhaps many people would think a too liberal attitude-by the Censorship Board. However, as I said in that Press release, the general view expressed by the Ministers was that the Board was in fact giving effect to community standards in this area and was doing a good job. The only criticism of the Board expressed in some quarters was that it perhaps was being a little too liberal, but not in the direction that Senator Evans is complaining about. That is what I meant by the statement. For my own part, I reiterate that from the discussions I have had with the Board, from what I have seen of its work and certainly from what I have seen of the films that it has actually banned, I believe that it is setting a sound community standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The literature censorship scheme is very much in the early formative stages. The general principle would be to endeavour to obtain agreement on the sort of material which would be placed in specific categories and the form of access to that material. That would be the responsibility of a national body, the form of which has not yet been determined. Each State would still reserve the right to make specific decisions about what material was in fact put into any particular category. I cannot give the Senate very much detail about the scheme, but that was the approach that was agreed upon. Officers have been asked now to prepare a detailed scheme and the Ministers have decided to meet within the next 12 months to give it further consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the particular statements to which the honourable senator has referred. However, they do not sit well with the information that I have received from the Minister for Primary Industry concerning tuna imports, in that it would not appear that there is an unlimited supply, one that is rapidly increasing; rather is the reverse the case. That is not to say that the matter is not of concern to the Government, but probably I can put some of the honourable senator's fears to rest on the basis of the information that I have. I am advised that in recent months there has been a marked fall in the importation of canned tuna into Australia. In the last financial year 2,300 tonnes product weight of tuna was imported, compared with 2,900 tonnes in the previous year. That trend has continued, with imports in July and August totalling 122 tonnes as against 402 tonnes for the same months in 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that the Australian industry is capable of supplying the domestic market. However, imports have been required to fill a gap in the market which has resulted from the fact that Australia exports a good deal of its tuna to overseas canneries, so it is a two-way trade. Last year 5,500 tonnes of pole tuna was exported and almost 7,000 tonnes the year before. Overseas tuna prices fell last year and that, coupled with a record Australian catch of 17,800 tonnes, was another important reason for the difficulties that the industry is now experiencing. The Department has advised me that the proportion of the market held by imports has varied in recent years as follows: For 1980-81, 29 per cent; for 1979-80, 53 per cent; for 1978-79, 28 per cent; for 1977-78, 26 per cent; and for 1976-77, 22 per cent. The Government has taken a number of initiatives to assist in the development of the industry, including a tariff of 15 per cent on imports. Industry views have played an important part in the annual talks with Japan on the terms and conditions of access of Japanese tuna vessels and the Government will continue to consult and to work closely with the industry on appropriate policies for its development.</PARA>

I refer to a report in the 9 October 1981 edition of Overseas Trading which states that a plant to produce enough synthetic motor fuel to replace about 10 per cent of petrol used in Sweden is planned and that production will be based on coal and heavy residual oil feedstock. The Minister will be aware, of course, of the developments in Victoria in the conversion of coal to fuel. Does the Swedish decision to proceed with a full scale production plant indicate that the need for pilot plants has been obviated? Further, will this technology be available to Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am aware that a number of countries are investigating a wide range of synthetic fuel options specific to their energy requirements and resource bases. In general, the objective is to reduce dependence on imported crude oil by more effective use of alternative resources. By way of interpolation, I think I read, perhaps in this morning's Australian Financial Review, that the Bank of America is forecasting that indigenous oil-oil from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries-will cost in the order of $100 a barrel by 1990. So, although there might be a becalmed situation at the moment, the need in the future to get alternatives, including syncrudes, is very obvious, as is the need for lead times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the specific Swedish decision, I am not aware of the particular technology contemplated for this project. But in any case, I doubt its applicability in the Australian context since it involves the production of hot water and synthetic fuel gas, presumably for heating, as well as some synthetic motor fuel. As Senator Lewis would know, in some countries of Western Europe municipalities actually pipe hot water both for domestic use and for heating--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, and who would know better than Senator Button because he has it continually piped en suite, as it were. I am not aware of the specific situation. Our approach so far has been to focus on projects that will essentially produce liquid fuels for the Australian market. This is reflected in the research and development work carried out under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council program and in the co-operative projects such as the joint Australia-West Germany study being carried out with other countries. A total of something like $14.3m has been committed in recent years for investigations of synthetic fuels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I will ask my Department to have a look at that Swedish proposal. But I make the important point that whatever may be the lulls now in the synthetic crude situations or in conservation, the fundamental need for the world is to realise what I have said repeatedly; that is, we are using oil at twice the rate we are finding it. We are going to run out. Syncrudes must come on stream. They take an enormous amount of research and pilot plant in the first place. One has to get all that work done ahead of the time when one needs the commercial plant, and that is what we are trying to do in Australia.</PARA>

Those guidelines are being progressively extended by agreement and negotiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a more difficult problem with aeroplanes. Like Senator MacGibbon, I am sometimes unable to obtain a non-smoking seat. I believe the airlines need to take much greater cognizance of the fact that today a majority of Australians are non-smokers and that those who smoke, whilst exercising a perfectly legal right, are in a minority and that appropriate divisions of seats should be made to allow the non-smoking majority to obtain non-smoking seats, if they so wish. As to whether seating in planes should be divided in a different fashion, I think that is a suggestion which might be made directly to the airlines with the comment that in providing a public service they might want to look seriously at such a suggestion.</PARA>

<PARA>In moving this motion, I wish to say that the most serious reflections have been made on this chamber of the Parliament. The most serious reflections have been cast on its future powers by an act of the House of Representatives yesterday which I and others believe may well have been an act outside the Constitution of Australia. In refusing to consider the requests on Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) conveyed to it by the Senate, the Government does so illegally. It is my purpose to seek leave to make a further statement on this matter following resolution of the matter which is now before the Senate. At this stage I merely move that motion and invite any further debate on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I support the motion. The proposal seeks to invoke the suspension of Standing Orders in accordance with Standing Order 448. It may be suggested that Senator Mason had other forms of the House available to him which he could have brought into play in order to highlight the problem that has arisen as a result of the failure of the House of Representatives to act in a constitutional manner. It may be said that Senator Mason could have raised a matter of public importance or proceeded with the matter in the adjournment debate this evening. However, this is a matter of an urgent and serious nature which requires a deliberate proposition to be put before the Senate. If the matter were dealt with by way of an MPI or by way of Senator Mason or any other honourable senator speaking in the adjournment debate then, of course, it could not be brought to an appropriate conclusion. The Senate as a whole could not under either of those measures consider the proposition in a positive and deliberate manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of Standing Order 448 is quite clear. The Standing Order provides for the Senate to deal with a question in a substantive manner in cases of urgent necessity. It may be suggested that the unconstitutional action which was taken by the House of Representatives yesterday does not pose a matter of urgent necessity to the Senate itself. On the other hand, it may pose a question of urgent necessity on the House of Representatives and on the Government. As I see the action taken by the House of Representatives yesterday, it was not only unconstitutional but also it ensured that the time clock for action to be taken under the dissolution provisions of section 57 of the Constitution could not run. I really could not have cared less because, so far as the House of Representatives was concerned, by refusing to consider our pressed request it had taken a step which denied to the Government the precondition set out in section 57. The reason I advance that-it is based on quite solid argument-is that the time does not start running until the House of Representatives refuses the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise on a point of order. My point of order concerns the procedure which has just been followed, quite apart from the matter to which you referred, which was the debate on the suspension of Standing Orders in relation to Senator Mason's previous initiative. Following that Senator Mason sought leave to give notice of a motion. He was granted leave to do that. By implication, in seeking leave to move a notice of motion he is saying that he wishes to debate this matter on another day; he gives notice to the Senate that he wants to debate it on another day. After giving that notice of motion, he said: 'I seek leave to make a statement about the same matter'. Standing Order 448 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In cases of urgent necessity, any Standing or Sessional Order or Orders of the Senate may be suspended on motion, duly made and seconded, without Notice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Having given notice of a motion about a subject matter and indicated, by giving notice to the Senate, that he wants to deal with it on a subsequent day, it is totally contradictory to rely then on Standing Order 448 in moving to suspend Standing Orders, saying it is an urgent matter. It is quite wrong that he should be able to do that. The Opposition and the Government granted him leave to give notice of his motion. We are happy to discuss it when it comes up. But for him then to rely on the Standing Orders to make a statement is, I believe, quite wrong and should be ruled out of order. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>If I might summarise, the report highlights two things; firstly, the short-sighted approach of this Government in the amount of profit it demands that the Overseas Telecommunications Commission remit; and, secondly, the way in which staff controls are affecting the operations of this statutory authority just as they are hampering other government bodies. The profit of the Commission is considerable, and the organisation is to be congratulated on its performance during the year ended 31 March. It was the seventh year in succession that the Commission reduced its tariffs. There was only a marginal fall in profit. In the previous year abnormal items added a once-only profit of some $5m. It is noteworthy that the tariff reduction generated during the year a total increase of one-third in telephone traffic and an increase of 20 per cent in telex traffic. Because of the tariff reductions, telephone revenue increased over 23 per cent and telex revenue by only 10 per cent. My second comment is in regard to the Government's policy on profits of organisations such as the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. The Chairman, Mr Bob Somervaille, points out in the report that the short-sighted policy of this Government in plundering the Overseas Telecommunications Commission of profit, and this applies equally to Telecom Australia, has some very bad effects. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission is faced with major capital expenditures on projects already approved by this Government. When this Government sees a prestigious program coming forward, such as the proposal to put a cable under the sea to Canada, it approves the proposal as there is a lot of prestige attached to that approval. But when it comes to working out how it will be financed by a body such as the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, it restricts that Commission's financial capacity to meet the cost of the project. The particular item of capital expenditure to which I have referred is the new trans-Pacific high capacity submarine cable system known as ANZCAN, which the Government has approved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Overseas Telecommunications Commission, as is indicated by this report, wanted to pay the Government a dividend of 15 per cent or $7.5m this year-that is not a bad dividend, I would have thought-and retain the balance of its profits for major capital works such as the submarine cable. Not many honourable senators can obtain an investment in a major Australian corporation which returns much more than 15 per cent. That is what OTC wanted to pay to the Government but the Government said that it must pay more. That creates difficulties for the Commission in funding capital works. The Government has insisted on a dividend that is three times that suggested by the Commission. It is not a recent policy. It has been going on for the past five years, and it ought to stop. The result, for the OTC, is that the $200m that it has to contibute to the cost of the submarine cable-contributions are to be made also by Canada and I believe New Zealand and so on-will now have to be provided, in a lopsided way, through borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission, by not obtaining permission to retain a higher proportion of profits, will have to seek short term accommodation in order to tide over periods of tight liquidity. This requirement comes from a Government which talks about its business management capacities. The Chairman of the OTC makes the point in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> With this higher order of borrowings, it is inevitable that the future customer will pay more for the service than would have been the case if a greater share of past profits had been retained by OTC for its capital financing requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the same shortsighted attitude on the part of this Government has already greatly harmed Telecom Australia and prevented it from meeting its commitments out of the profits which it generates in the area of domestic communications. Now the same policy is being applied to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. Domestic communications have been damaged-not just according to me but according to the Government's own expert committees on Telecom-by the shortsighted financial policy of the Government. While Telecom's capacity to deliver domestic services has been inhibited and, to quote the words of the McKinsey report, not my own, its productivity and efficiency lowered, the Government is embarking upon similar policies in relation to our international communications. Far from displaying any degree of pride in the efficiency of the OTC, the Government has its fingers in the till of that organisation to a greedy and exorbitant extent. I draw the attention of the Senate to the point made by the Commissioners of OTC in their report about staffing. That point, which I imagine has relevance to many other areas of government, concerns the difficulties that are created by the poor salary scales available for skilled workers. This already has caused disruption in such departments as Transport, which skilled workers in aviation control have left for private industry. It has caused problems also in Telecom. Indeed, it caused the recent industrial dispute about which the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) indulged in such huff and puff before conceding the justice of the claim. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the problem of the drift of skilled workers from these instrumentalities because of an incapacity to pay adequate salaries. OTC reports the same problem. Many private firms avoid the high cost of early training by paying higher salaries to attract government employees. The artificially depressed wage scales represent not only shortsightedness on the part of the Government but also create a capacity for it to engage in unfair dealing with its own employees. However, ultimately the consumer pays the Bill by meeting the cost of training skilled workers, at public expense, for the eventual use of private employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The OTC also makes the familiar point about the effect of tight staff ceilings. It seems to me to be an amazing illustration of this Government's ignorance of good management that an enterprise which is as profitable as is OTC is not able to exercise freedom to any degree at all, in determining the size of its work force. One wonders what else this organisation would have to do to show that it was managing its affairs competently. Its profits are impressive. Its reductions in charges show its capacity to deal in the market place. It seems that that is not enough for this Government, which is incapable of coming to grips with the most fundamental aspects of management and policy direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend a close reading of this report to any honourable senator who is interested in questions of business efficiency and the importance of the Government operating efficient business enterprise. Here we have one such enterprise, but its efficiency, productivity, and capacity continually to reduce tariffs are being curtailed by the Government's policies. It is time that the Senate looked more closely at those policies and at the kinds of difficulties raised in the report concerning them, because they are symptomatic of the effects of government policies in many areas of gross mismanagement. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was informed as I passed through King's Hall to obtain a copy of the report on Radioactive Waste Management and the annual report of the Uranium Advisory Council, which are listed as papers Nos. 10 and 13 for presentation today, that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) had presented those reports in the other place with an addendum and that copies of the reports were not available. I was told that the Minister had tabled a copy of each report in the House of Representatives and that copies were available only in the Parliamentary Library. Having hot-footed it across King's Hall, as I was anxious not to miss this debate, I found that three copies of the reports-they are some hundreds of pages thick-are available. Of course, they are Library copies and are not able to be removed from the Library. I therefore pose the question: How on earth is one supposed to be able to make a comprehensive speech if one is not aware of what reports contain?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been mentioned in this chamber many times that when a report is tabled or a paper is presented adequate copies of that report or paper should be made available. If it had not been for a chance meeting with a member of the House of Representatives I would have been unaware that the addendum had been presented in the other place this morning. No mention of an addendum is made on the list of papers to be presented. I think it is a matter of some concern for this chamber as well that not only are copies of reports or papers not available but also we are unaware for some time that something else is introduced in the other place. Only if we happened to pick up a copy of the Hansard report of the day's proceedings would we be aware that an addendum had been introduced to either of these reports or to both of these reports. We could be unaware of other addendums that relate to other reports or papers that could have been introduced during this morning's proceedings in the other place. I think that this stage of affairs has to be rectified fairly rapidly. I understand that Senator Elstob is a member of the Publications Committee. I do not know whether that Committee can expedite matters in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> When I inquired of the Library as to the availability of the addendum to either or both of these reports I was informed that it may not be available for some three to four weeks at which time, given all the rumours that are floating around at the moment, one could assume that the Parliament will have risen. I come from Western Australia and unless I make a mental note now or make a note when I get to my office it will be extremely difficult for me to keep track of that addendum. I think it is high time that honourable senators recognise that this situation is impeding their work in this chamber and in the community. Although there may be an interest and concern about a specific area, up-to-date information that is readily available and has been tabled in the other House is not able to be made available to the general public.

<PARA>I simply state that already the Opposition spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs has made a statement largely endorsing the stand of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) in relation to this matter. A delicate question such as immigration remains reasonably bipartisan only when we eliminate any cheating such as that which was personified in this case. I suppose that the merchants of misfortune-if one can define them as such-have to be exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be said that our problems relate to people coming to this country over water. However, a parallel can be drawn with the problems experienced by the United States of America from time to time in respect of wetbacks crossing from Mexico. I want to say in my brief observation that my colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Young, made a plea to the Minister to build on the goodwill of this bipartisan approach by establishing a joint parliamentary committee which would look continuously at problems of this nature. I say that because the United States, when confronted recently with an outflow from Cuba of some legitimate migrants and some who were not, at least had joint parliamentary surveillance of the situation. I know that the concept of executive government in the United States is different from ours. However, I simply take this opportunity to commend the Minister for the attitude he took which removed certain doubts that people had that we were inclined to gloss over some of this cheating.

<PARA> That General Business, Order of the Day No. 2, relating to the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriation and Staffing, be postponed until the next day of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is appropriate that I should make a few comments at this stage. In moving for the postponement of this matter I am very conscious of the interest the report has created on both sides of the Houses of Parliament and also the interest that has been shown overseas. This morning I had discussions on the subject with the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick. He has assured me that he is pursuing the matter. We believe, as a matter of courtesy, it is important to get the Government's reaction to the report before it is debated in this place. He has assured me that this matter is receiving his active consideration at the moment. He has indicated to me that an interdepartmental committee report on the document will be ready for him to examine tomorrow. He has assured me that as soon as possible after that time he will present it to the Cabinet to seek its reaction. I believe we should extend this courtesy to the Government to get its reaction to the report. I propose to ensure, certainly before the end of this session, that the matter is debated in the Senate. I understand that Senator McClelland, the Deputy Chairman of the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriation and Staffing, is seeking an appointment with Senator Carrick to discuss the matter with him personally to impress upon the Leader our very strong wish and determination to see that this important document is debated as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jessop has made a statement as to why he has moved that the discussion on this matter be deferred. I briefly want to comment on this matter. Senator Jessop has indicated that I have sought an appointment with the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick, to have a discussion with him about the matter and about the attitude of the members of the Australian Labor Party who sat on the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriation and Staffing. They put in an awful lot of work on the subject. It is only because of my commitments in this chamber this morning that I have not been able to see Senator Carrick as yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I want to impress upon the Government that we regard the matter as one of great importance. There is a tendency on the part of, if not the Government, the bureaucracy, to want to shelve these things. I instanced in a question to one of the Ministers this morning how there is a tendency on the part of the bureaucracy to ignore the affairs of this Parliament and particularly the Senate. Merely because an interdepartmental committee was appointed by the Government to report on the report of the Select Committee, that is no excuse at all as to why there should be any attempt on the part of anyone to fob off this Parliament's dealing with the report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the proposed amendment to Standing Order 33 be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should have before them the report of the Standing Orders Committee, which sets out the argument concerning each of the matters addressed by the Standing Orders Committee. Briefly, Item No. 1 relates to the fact that the two leaders, who are members of the Standing Orders Committee, sometimes find it difficult to attend meetings. This was one reason why meetings of the Standing Orders Committee occurred infrequently from time to time. The proposal, as set out in the report as a recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Standing Order for the appointment of the Committee . . . be amended to provide for the two Leaders to be ex officio members and to allow them to appoint other Senators to act in their place as members of the Committee when they are not able to attend meetings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to item 2. I want either to oppose it or to suggest that it go back for reconsideration by the Standing Orders Committee. Honourable senators will recall that at the beginning of this session we had a debate in this Parliament on a proposal which I moved that there should be instead two officers, a Deputy President (Procedures) and a Deputy President (Committees). The proposal, which was put forward by Government senators, was defeated at that time. It was opposed by the Australian Labor Party substantially on the basis, I think, that the matter had not been discussed by the Standing Orders Committee and there was objection to the way in which it had proceeded. That, of course, was a proposal for two officers and it was proposed that certain functions should be separated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the title 'Chairman of Committees' would give the impression that somehow the Chairman is responsible for the running and management of the committee system, whereas we know from practice that he does not have such effective operation. In fact, that aspect of the Senate's work is headless in the sense that there is no direct attention given to how the committee system is operating. I have since had correspondence with the President on that matter and I understand that it has now gone before the Standing Orders Committee, having been on its agenda for some period. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, yet. We have a proposal today which seeks to give two names to the one officer. I say that the proposal concerning the Deputy President seems to be a sensible idea. I am not objecting to that. But in effect, we are pre-empting the proposal put forward. Honourable senators on this side certainly intend to press for the adoption of the proposal because we believe it provides for a better system of operation. Senator Button argued so persuasively at that stage that the proposal should have gone before the Standing Orders Committee. It has gone there. Now the Standing Orders Committee has put forward a recommendation that impliedly rejects that suggestion. I know that that is not a fact. I know that the Committee has not considered it. I think the matter ought to be considered by it. I think there is a need for a change in the situation. But the motion pre-empts that and seeks to change the title at this stage. I cannot see the need for doing that before it has been considered. I cannot understand why the Standing Orders Committee has passed over this item on its agenda and not given consideration to the proposal which was debated in the Parliament and which I think was defeated very substantially on technical grounds and not necessarily on the merit of the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I think that I should seek to move that consideration of this item be postponed until the Standing Orders Committee has further considered the proposal which was debated in the Parliament at the beginning of the session. It would be quite wrong for this chamber to adopt today the item without consideration of the alternative proposal and the alternative titles of Deputy President (Procedures) and Deputy President (Committees), or some other titles. To pass this motion would be impliedly to suggest that the Standing Orders Committee is not prepared to face up to an examination of the proposals that were then put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. Senator Missen, there may be all sorts of things in the minds of honourable senators for inclusion in the agenda of the Standing Orders Committee for consideration. According to Senator Missen's argument we remain paralysed about taking any decisions on anything until we have considered the ramifications of all possible changes to Standing Orders. That is not the position at all. I am a member of the Standing Orders Committee. I assure Senator Missen that if the proposal he, amongst others, is floating around is adopted by the Standing Orders Committee I will meet and vote with him on any change that has to be made subsequently to the title of Deputy President, as suggested in this document. I assure the honourable senator of that. If that proposal is adopted we will meet him on the changes. By this recommendation the Senate Standing Orders Committee is not in any way trying to pre-empt the discussion on that matter. As I indicated on an earlier occasion in this chamber, we would like information and argument about how the proposal will make the Senate more efficient, as the honourable senator suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we are considering those arguments, we would be prepared if we accepted them-I believe all honourable senators ought to be prepared if we accepted them-to reconsider an alteration to the Standing Orders which would then be consistent with the new arrangements. I think it is wrong to ask the Senate Standing Orders Committee to adjourn consideration of this proposal on the basis of some hypothetical consideration which we have not yet dealt with. I think it is unfair-I use that in the nicest possible way I can-to suggest the implications of adopting this proposal are as Senator Missen says. </PARA>

To call him Deputy President and Chairman of Committees seems to be an accurate representation. I reiterate what Senator Button said today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman and Mr Deputy President, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the proposed sessional order as contained in Appendix C to the report be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the single matter of real substance in this report of the Standing Orders Committee which may attract some controversy and debate. The matter is discussed at some length on pages 2 and 3 of the report. I draw the attention of the Committee of the Whole to the limits of the proposal. It is proposed only that the Standing Order should be for a trial period, should be by way of a sessional order and should provide for a procedure to apply on one day of the week only, that is, on Thursday. It will try to ensure adequate time for the discussion of papers which are presented. It involves some acknowledgement that time would have to be found for that within the program of the Senate. I do not intend to go through each of the proposals in turn unless they attract the concern of honourable senators. I add that this was a proposal that emerged from the Standing Orders Committee by consensus as a result of considerable discussion of what has been a difficult matter. It is the considered opinion of the Committee. On the basis that the proposal is for a trial period by sessional order, I commend it to the attention of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President and Chairman, I wish to query this matter. I wonder whether we are proceeding in the right way even though it is only a sessional order and it is for only a trial period. Of course, there have been difficulties with the presentation of papers. I wonder whether we will not create other difficulties which will be equally as annoying to some of us. First, I raise the simple matter that obviously the House of Representatives will not fall in line with it. The way it went on yesterday, it most certainly will not. We will then have a situation-I know it sometimes occurs now but it will occur obviously more often-whereby sometimes a very important report comes down in the House of Representatives and does not turn up here under those circumstances for at least two days or even a week. That may create some difficulties with some people who are keen to talk on such reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter is the rigidity of the time of an hour and a half for consideration of motions. One day early last week we considered a series of reports which had come in a fortnight before. We attempted to debate them in the time available but took much more than an hour and a half. If everyone had been here who would have liked to have spoken on those reports on that Thursday night, it would have taken considerably longer than an hour and a half. I wonder what consideration has been given to that sort of difficulty because quite frequently we do have batches of reports all coming down together, including those of the Auditor-General. It may take much longer than an hour and a half to deal with those reports even if only one senator spoke, such as the shadow Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that it is within the competence of the Senate at any stage to order that the procedures should be varied on any particular day. If Senator Grimes is saying that there may be some days when special circumstances arise which require special arrangements, I believe they could be accommodated by goodwill and by arrangements on both sides of the Senate. Again both the Standing Orders Committee and I are only suggesting that we have a trial period to see how it goes as a sessional order. It will be no more than that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly on the same point because it is one that had concerned me and it is one which I have discussed with some officers of the Senate. I have taken into consideration the comments made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). I feel that there could be an occasion when the hour and a half would be too inflexible. I note that it is only a sessional order and if it does not work satisfactorily it will not necessarily become a Standing Order. However, it is possible that it could work satisfactorily for one session, and an occasion could arise when it would not be satisfactory, for example, if a large number of very important reports were presented, say, on the last day of a session. Honourable senators might feel that they had been unfairly precluded from commenting on things that are important. I would not oppose the sessional order. If it worked satisfactorily, I would not oppose it becoming a Standing Order. I think it should be understood that honourable senators do have a concern that on some occasion in the future this may prove to be a rigid requirement. I am sure that none of us would want then to be in the position of being told: 'This is the way it must be done because it is in the Standing Orders and it is necessary for the Government to get its business done' or whatever. If it does become part of our procedure, it must be on the understanding that it is not intended in any way to limit senators' rights to debate reports of controversial matter. It is intended in fact, to give us all a better go at having an opportunity to debate certain types of reports.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President and Chairman, I support this proposal, as indeed I did after a lot of discussion on the Standing Orders Committee about it. I largely support it for the reasons hinted at by Senator Martin, in that this is only a sessional order at the moment and for a trial period. I refer to paragraphs (b) and (d) of the proposal. I feel remiss, as a member of the Standing Orders Committee, that I allowed without comment paragraph (b) to be inserted, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No petitions shall be received on Thursdays. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be a very good thing for the Senate if the Standing Orders Committee considered at some stage amending that sessional order so it reads: 'No petitions shall be received on Wednesdays or Thursdays'. The reason for that statement is that, because of my responsibilities as communications shadow Minister, I have occasion to consider the question of ratings. I tell honourable senators that the ratings of this Parliament, in terms of its listening audience, are rock bottom. One of the reasons for that is the material for debate which we allow to go on air. For example, frequently the Standing Orders report is debated on a Wednesday.

I have been present in the Senate chamber when up to three-quarters of an hour of broadcast time has been taken up with the reading of petitions. I think that people who listen to the broadcast are entitled to ask: 'What is that place all about? What are they doing?'. I believe the Standing Orders Committee should consider the terminology of paragraph (b). In relation to paragraph (c) of the recommendations, it just might be-I am very much conscious of my own conduct in this regard-that the imposition of a 10-minute time limit would sharpen the concentration and wit of those honourable senators who are making a contribution in regard to reports. Indeed, if brevity, as we are told, is the soul of wit, it may do something to improve the quality of the discussion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that we were discussing one item at a time. It had been my intention to say something about petitions also. I did not intend to be quite as strict about the matter as was Senator Button. I am sure that he would have no objection to a suggestion that the Wednesday proposal be included. The point I wanted to raise is that a difficulty could arise if there were a blanket banning of petition on certain days if it happened that the day-whether it be a Wednesday or a Thursday-was the last day of the parliamentary session. It may be that just the timing of the receipt of a petition would mean that that petition was not presented for several months. I am not suggesting that an amendment be made to the wording, but I think that when the new Standing Orders are drafted-if we decide that this should go into the Standing Orders-provision should be made similar to that which exists in paragraph (a).

<PARA>I would propose that words such as 'unless there are exceptional circumstances requiring the presentation of petitions on other days'. The circumstances, as I see it, would be where there was an undue delay in the presentation of a petition, perhaps several months. Because of the timing of the receipt of it, perhaps it could not be presented during that session. </PARA>

I take it that if the honourable senators have a strong view on this, it is quite competent for them to move an amendment to paragraph (b), perhaps in the terms Senator Martin has suggested. She has suggested an amendment that petitions should be received on Tuesdays only-if I understood her correctly-unless there are exceptional circumstances requiring the presentation of petitions on other days. If that is the honourable senator's view and she wants to test the feelings of the Committee, I suggest that she move an amendment to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make two comments about the matter. I am a member of the Standing Orders Committee. I suppose I am the only member who does not understand the Standing Orders; perhaps that is why I am there. Two fairly distinct understandings are needed for this sessional order to work. The first is that, basically, there will be no discussion of matters of public importance on Thursdays. It really devolves on this side of the chamber to stick to that side of the bargain. The second point-we have to emphasise this necessity if the arrangement is to work-is to get the reports as early as possible. It is not much use honourable senators coming into the chamber on a Thursday just before papers are presented, being given a bundle of reports and papers and then be expected, as Senator Button said, to make a lucid, concise and concentrated 10-minute speech. There would just be a desperate shuffling of papers as honourable senators tried to make their points. If the proposed sessional order is to work, those two matters need to be borne in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to the point raised in passing by Senator Robert Ray that on Thursday mornings, when the presentation of reports will take place, there is nothing to stop matters of public importance being brought forward and wiping out the morning. Paragraph (c) provides that discussion could continue for an hour and a half. I suppose that is the answer to my question. The reading of petitions on that day has been wiped out, which usually takes only 10 minutes or so, but the possibility has not been wiped out that the rest of the morning might be taken up with a discussion of a matter of public importance. Can I have some comment on that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond. I make it clear in passing that the Standing Orders Committee report is not a matter of Government Business. I am responding as a member of the Standing Orders Committee, not as a Minister in the Government. I think that paragraph (d) of the proposed sessional order takes account of the matter by stating that the consideration of papers may go on after 8 p.m., if necessary. It was in people's minds that, while normally there would be no matter of public importance, if there were and if we needed more time, it was possible to obtain the balance of the one and a half hours after 8 p.m. I believe the point which the honourable senator raised is adequately catered for.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been suggested that I move an amendment to the relevant sessional order. When I looked at the wording of that sessional order it became a little difficult to do it off the top of my head. The wording has been designed to fit in with petitions and reports. Previously when we have considered reports of the Standing Orders Committee we have gone through the recommendations seriatim and accepted, rejected or amended them. It would be easier for me to move an amendment to recommendation (b) on page 3 of the Standing Orders Committee report to the effect that no petition shall be received on Wednesdays or Thursdays unless there are exceptional circumstances requiring the presentation of a petition on one of those days. If the Committee accepts the recommendation, it should direct whoever has to present the sessional order to us for acceptance as a sessional order to redraft that sessional order in accordance with the Committee's views-whatever it determines in relation to recommendation (b).</PARA></TALK.START>

I presented a petition with over 6,500 signatures in relation to subscriber trunk dialling telephone charges. I can assure honourable senators that I always tried to choose a Wednesday to present it because I knew that large numbers of people in Victoria, especially in rural Victoria, were trying to listen to the petition being read.

I think the matter ought to be referred back to the Standing Orders Committee, not necessarily because I agree with the point Senator Lewis made, but rather because I think there may be other ways through the dilemma of Wednesday's petition time-which is driving all of us bonkers-which might not be quite as far-reaching as that proposed by Senator Martin. For example, another alternative that might be considered is simply enabling honourable senators to introduce a petition and shortly describe its contents in the way we do at the moment, without having the terms of the petition actually read. That would give everyone a place in the sun with their petitions on broadcast day and serve the interests of democracy accordingly but not bore everyone witless for three-quarters of an hour while the detailed texts of the petitions were in fact read. I would be happy for that proposal, for example, to be adopted right now, but to draft that on the run is probably a bit too much of an enterprise even for someone of the calibre of Senator Martin or Senator Lewis. I suggest that the appropriate course is to refer the matter back, and I would support any such motion moved by Senator Lewis.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the Senate long. At this stage I want to say something about the situation with West Block which, I believe, is to be handed over to the Department of Administrative Services next Monday. Recently that building has had about $4.1m spent upon it. One or two of us are going to have a look at the building later in the day if we can get a pair. Even if we cannot, I think we might have a look at it. I will go through a bit of the background of the building. Under the Parliament Act 1974 West Block lies within the parliamentary zone. I feel that Parliament has a need to consolidate its accommodation requirements in one building. Currently we have an overflow from this building. We have to use the Hotel Canberra and the Hotel Kurrajong. I feel that half of West Block would meet the needs of the Parliament until the completion of the new Parliament House building in 1988. On 22 November 1979 the Senate passed a motion requesting the Government to allocate West Block to the Parliament. The appropriate resolution is recorded on page 1090 of the Journals of the Senate of 22 November 1979. Part (c) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>that-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Government be again requested to allocate West Block to Parliament for its use, pending building of the New and Permanent Parliament House;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not absolutely sure whether we did. Maybe that can be found out in the next few minutes if anybody else intends to speak on this matter and we can hear what the actual reply was. Certainly it appears, with the Department of Administrative Services taking over next Monday, that that resolution of the Senate has not been acceded to. The allocation of accommodation within the parliamentary triangle is determined by an interdepartmental committee and its recommendations are dealt with by either the Department of Administrative Services or the Government, as the case may be. In the case of West Block, with which I believe the Parliament is very much concerned, no parliamentary department representatives were on that committee, nor were their opinions sought in spite of that resolution of the Senate. I believe that the committee was chaired, interestingly enough, by the permanent head of the Department of Administrative Services when it was recommended that Administrative Services be allocated West Block. I believe that it is pretty well outfitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that most of the benefits around this place are going to bureaucrats, Ministers and those who claim special positions. Maybe it is time that some of the back bench senators made public details of a few of the things that are happening and a few of the expenses that are being incurred around this country. I have laid off asking a few questions I could very well have asked over the last year or so for several reasons. I am getting very rapidly to the stage of doing so. I am sick of the way back benchers in this place are not being treated as equals. I am sick of the situation in which some people get extra staff, whether they be Ministers or others who claim special positions. I am sick of the way some people get access to the VIP aircraft that cost this country a tremendous amount of money. It seems to me that the Government is doing all it can to keep back benchers in the dark. I suppose we all know what the mushroom club is. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been recommended that all members and senators have extra staff provided once facilities are available. For people who are not very often on committees to have extra staff when those who do have a lot of extra committee work do not is a crazy thing. I want to say more about that at another time. Until senators can get suitable offices-which, of course, many of us do have now-it seems we will not be able to get extra staff. I believe the Government should have acceded to the Senate's resolution. There has been a big increase in the number of people working in Parliament House over the last few years and there are quite a few more years to go before the new Parliament House is completed. I believe the Parliament should have been given access to at least half of West Block. I believe a couple of other people are interested in this matter. Perhaps they can be persuaded to support some of the things I have just said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak very briefly not only to give this matter the attention it deserves but also to support what Senator Townley has said in regard to West Block and the provision of premises that the Parliament needs and without which, under the present arrangements, it cannot capably operate. I have had, as has Senator Townley, recent correspondence with the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and I am totally dissatisfied with the reaction that I have received so far as this matter is concerned. It seems to me that this Parliament cannot continue in the crazy way in which facilities are provided for the back bench members of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true-I tried to suggest this by way of interjection-that if by chance one is in the Opposition one does get a better service. Senator Harradine recently had upgraded his extra member of staff. He has had an extra member of staff for some years and now $27,000 has been provided so that he can have a staff member who can also travel with him. I do not begrudge Senator Harradine that. Although he may not belong to any committees of the Parliament-and I belong to 11 parliamentary and party committees and am active on them-he has other activities and other interests in the Parliament. Likewise, I think the Australian Democrats have four extra staff members over the ordinary entitlement of back bench members. I do not begrudge them their entitlement but we are told constantly in this Parliament that we, the back benchers, are not able to have more. They say there is a different situation for members who do not have a government or a party behind them. I do not see that situation operating at this time. Those of us who are in this Parliament and who are, say, back bench Government members or back bench Labor members have to face the fact that there are not only Government Bills coming forward but also Opposition and Democrat Bills coming forward. We have to make our own assessment and provide our own knowledge. We cannot rely on the relatively slender services which we get from our parties to provide us with the knowledge required in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have responsibilities as chairmen of various committees in this Parliament, whether they be committees of the Parliament or committees of parties, find that when we are in Canberra we have no staff whatsoever to assist us. Most of us have nobody to assist us in the direction of our operations. It would be a crazy way to operate a small retail store, a fish shop or something like that, but it is an incredibly crazy basis on which to run a parliament. Many of us in our professions beforehand had substantial staff to service and assist us. We have here a limited number of 64 senators who have to serve on a growing number of committees in this Parliament, and for us to be expected to operate here as our own 'fetch and carry' people and to not have facilities provided is a crazy way to run a parliament or a house of a parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> So far attempts that have been made to get the Government and the Minister to take a sensible attitude towards this matter have led to our receiving rather stereotyped letters. The letter I got and the letter Senator Townley recently got from the Minister could be substituted for each other. We put forward different arguments and different remarks but we got the same sort of reply. 'It has been done for this one and that one over the years and independent members have been given particular facilities, but when we ask about the situation now it is just said that this has been done in the past only for particular purposes and there is no addressing of the reply itself to what should be done for members of Parliament. I am saying that the committee system of this Parliament is at a crisis stage. We have more committees and more demands for them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are things that are not properly done in this Parliament by all of us. I regard myself as quite incompetent to handle the things I am taking on at this time. I invite others to suggest that they are in the same position. If the people of this country think that, by paying us a reasonable sort of salary and not supplying us with the proper support and assistance, they are getting a proper go for their expenditure, I say that is not so. Therefore, I join in supporting the recommendation and the remarks made by Senator Townley today. At least we ought to have West Block. That would take away the argument that has been put that we could not have staff here because there is nowhere to put them. I have recently graduated to a larger room. I can fit someone else into my room and would willingly do so. Others cannot do so at this stage because of the lack of accommodation. Certainly West Block would provide that accommodation and ensure that someone was quite close. An honourable senator referred to staff for members of committees. Although not adequate, it is a help. But those staff are not available to individual senators to assist them in their electoral duties and their own committee duties in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry to take up the time of the Senate but I want to declare war. I am not satisfied to go on in this way any longer. I will campaign now vigorously to ensure that members in this House of the Parliament-those in the other House do not answer us or write back to us and we do not know what they are doing; they can fight their own battle-who are doing a job and creating a committee system are getting a rotten go in this Parliament, and I am not content to let it last. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wonder whether anyone can tell me where he can get 23.75 per cent interest on a Commonwealth Government guaranteed security? In a few minutes I will tell honourable senators where they can get it as a result of an announcement made yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). Many items relevant to the outcome of the Budget and to the Budget strategy are not included in Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 or 2 which are currently being debated. One of those items is the payment of interest on income equalisation deposits. These deposits, introduced some years ago, for very good reasons, are a device under which primary producers may lodge money in a Government trust account which becomes immediately a deduction from taxable income. A taxpayer paying the maximum marginal rate of 60 per cent may avoid $60 taxation by depositing $100 in the income equalisation deposit. In other words, the effective deposit of a taxpayer in that category is 40 per cent or $40 in every $100 actually deposited. Yesterday the interest rate paid on the entire deposit was increased to 9.5 per cent. So for an effective deposit of $40, a nominal deposit of $100, the taxpayer receives $9.50 interest a year or a rate of 23.75 per cent per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A consistent policy of the Fraser Government since it came into power, the only consistent policy, probably, has been to redistribute income in a regressive way. But of all the regressive actions which this Government has taken, few are as blatant or as little understood as this particular rort. It does no credit to the National Farmers Federation to have grossly distorted the truth about this matter in the way it did in its Press release issued today, in which it had the audacity to complain as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Before the latest increase, the yield on IEDs was 7 per cent, which is totally unrealistic in the current market. An acceptance of the NFF's formula for the IED rate pegged 2 per cent below Commonwealth bonds would lift the IED yield to around 12.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, acceptance of that proposition would lift the IED yield for a taxpayer on the maximum marginal rate not to 12 1/2 per cent but to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Treasurer to justify publicly the decision he has made. His credibility has been seriously damaged by this decision on two grounds: Firstly, his declaration of an open season for raids on treasury funds in the form of effective interest rates of 23.75 per cent for a handful of millionaire graziers, some of whom happen to be temporarily in control of that Treasury upon which they have now invited an open-ended raid; and, secondly, the way in which he has been trying to persuade everyone for the last two months that interest rates at the very worst have peaked and that probably they are starting to move downwards. The rationale that he used for this gross extension of an existing rort and rip-off in his Press statement yesterday was that it was necessary to increase this interest rate in order to remain consistent with market trends. </PARA>
<PARA> No trust security pays 23 3/4 per cent interest on any deposit. Few trust securities pay much more than half of that rate. No wonder the Treasurer sneaked that Press release out into the boxes at 6 o'clock last night hoping to beat the deadline for the major dailies for those few, I suppose, who were sufficiently interested in the subject or sufficiently well informed about the effect of such taxation measures to report it at all. It is a disgraceful decision which has been made known in a furtive way with the deliberate intention of minimising the degree to which it was recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> This item is not the only item of expenditure which escapes being included in Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 or 2. There are two other major groups of items which are also relevant, those for which money is appropriated in other legislation and of course a whole host of taxation concessions which, once enacted, escape parliamentary scrutiny forever. We have seen a lot of these in the last 12 months. We have seen the film tax rort under which the Government will pay between 90 per cent and 120 per cent, concealed in the taxation system, of the cost of making a film. It would be cheaper for the Government to make the films itself and give them away than it is to subsidise them through the taxation system by more than 100 per cent as it is doing. I defy Senator Guilfoyle to provide any rational justification for that rort produced off the top of the head of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the heady days of the last Federal election, apparently at the instigation of a Channel 7 make-up girl. </PARA>
<PARA> There are tax concessions for water pumping and distribution, for irrigation, which, under certain circumstances, will cost the revenue 103 per cent of the investment. That is just as bad as the film rort. There are concessions for storage of fuel in small tanks by small business. To store 267 million gallons of fuel in thousand gallon tanks costs $174m. Subsidised through the tax system in this way it would cost government revenue, at a marginal tax rate of 46 per cent, $80m to provide a tax concession for the storage of 267 million gallons of fuel. The same quantity can be stored in million gallon tanks at a total cost of $67m. Again, it would be cheaper for the Government to buy the tanks outright and give them to oil distributors than to subsidise storage through the taxation system in that way. Needless to say, that is another Malcolm Fraser special. </PARA>
<PARA> I could continue to quote from that list but believe that I have cited enough examples. I have given three instances, in two of which, because of the hidden taxation concession for investors, the loss of revenue is greater than is the investment itself. It is not possible to devise any more effective mechanism for maldistributing investment resources. In the case of the other concession, which is rationalised as a plan to provide emergency stocks of fuel, it would be cheaper and more effective for the Government to buy appropriate tanks outright than to subsidise it in this hidden way through the taxation system as it has done. I repeat: Once the taxation law has been amended, it escapes annual parliamentary scrutiny until such time as the amendments are repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another item that is highly relevant to the budgetary outcome but is not shown in the Appropriation Bills concerns government borrowings. Under this Government we are afflicted with a cargo cult theory of private borrowing, one under which it is implicity stated that borrowings in the public sector affect the capital market and push interest rates up, but borrowings from the private sector do not have that effect. That is the implicit belief which underlies all recent Government statements on the subject. That example of cargo cultism was repeated in the House of Representatives today by Mr Sinclair when, in between falsifying his Hansard records, he stated that it would be quite inappropriate to allow Telecom Australia to borrow an additional $3m on the capital market in order to provide the business data facility which he prevented it from having. He said that it was much better to allow private enterprise to do this. The cargo cult belief could scarcely be more clearly stated. If Telecom borrows money on the capital market, it pushes interest rates up. If Kerry Packer or the Myer group borrows money on the capital market, interest rates are not affected. No wonder the country is in a mess. </PARA>
<PARA> An item in these Bills on which I wish to comment, because it is equally as ridiculous as some of the other things that I have mentioned, is the provision made for national disaster relief funding. A particular scheme which was announced by the Prime Minister on 23 June would be funded under this item. On that date, the Prime Minister announced that money would be made available under this provision allegedly to assist drought-affected New South Wales wheat growers in planting a crop and that the security for the loan would be a lien against the crop that was about to be planted. Of course, the announcement of 23 June was too late for its ostensible purpose. Any wheat farmer who, by 23 June, did not actually have his crop planted, or at the very least have all the necesary pre-arrangements made for planting, would be well advised to forget about planting at all. But even if one overlooks that gross error of timing, that fundamental error by a government which prides itself on having half a dozen farmers in the Cabinet, something even more interesting was revealed in the proceedings of the Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements, the first $10m spent on national disaster relief in New South Wales is provided by the New South Wales State Government. All expenditure in excess of that amount is provided, as to 75 per cent by the Commonwealth Government and as to 25 per cent by the State Government. It is anticipated that total payments under this scheme in New South Wales this year will be in the vicinity of $18m. In other words, at the margin and $8m below the margin, of every dollar lent under this scheme the Commonwealth will be providing 75 per cent. Interest is paid to the State at 4 1/2 per cent on the face value of the loan, but since the State provides only 25 per cent of the loan the effective interest rate to it is 18 per cent. This is an open-ended invitation to a government to ingratiate itself with its own electorate by distributing irresponsibly Commonwealth largesse and making a profit in the process. Who could blame the New South Wales Government if it behaved in that way, if it followed the axiom that if you see a mug you might as well rip him off. One would be battling to find a greater collection of mugs than the people who made that provision available. </PARA>
<PARA> One might legitimately question, as many do, whether money should be made available at all on those terms-partly on equity grounds, because these funds at 4 1/2 per cent interest do go to people who have considerable assets and net worth. The equity of the general taxpayer who provides loans under such concessional terms might legitimately be questioned. On efficiency or resource allocation grounds it can also be argued, and ought to be by anyone who purports to believe in a market economy, that the cost of drought and disaster should be negatively capitalised in the price of land. Arrangements such as that to which I have referred frustrate that market outcome. But if money is to continue to be made available at an interest rate of 4 1/2 per cent we are at least entitled to demand that the mugs who are running this country, the mugs who have issued this open-ended invitation to yet another group to raid the Treasury, should clean up the most blatant sloth over which they have presided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills and the Budget with which they are associated are slothful in detail beyond the point of ridicule. They are fatally flawed in regard to what the one-time Treasurer, the pre-Stumpy Gully Treasurer, used to refer to rather boringly as the broad thrust. It is to be condemned in both the micro sense and the macro sense. </PARA>
<PARA> A great contemporary myth, which unfortunately is even believed by some gullible journalists, is that the economy is healthy. The myth is peddled by the same people who asserted in 1975 that the economy was in ruins, that indeed it was in such a condition that any political action, any sleazy act-as a present Liberal member of the House of Representatives, the then Senator Hall, described it-was justified in grabbing power. The justification given was the allegation that the economy was in ruins. It is worth while just to look at a few objective facts behind those two assertions that are peddled by the same people-that the economy is healthy now and that it was in ruins in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of the 1975 Budget produced this effect on the following major economic indices: The level of inflation was then 13 per cent and falling. At the end of June 1982, according to the forecasts put out by this Government, it will be 11.9 per cent, near enough to 12 per cent, and rising. In 1975-76 the rate of unemployment was 4.5 per cent and stable. The rate of unemployment now is 5.8 per cent and rising. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to economic growth. The level of non-farm real gross domestic product growth in the calendar year 1976-the period affected by the 1975-76 Budget-was 4.2 per cent. This level has not been reached in any year since. The forecast for this year by the Government is for non-farm real GDP growth of 3 per cent which the present indicators clearly show is an overoptimistic forecast. The range of interest rates, of course, can be measured. Right across the board, interest rates are now 3 per cent higher than they were in 1975-76. Of course, notwithstanding the assertions by the Treasurer that interest rates have at the very worst peaked and are probably falling, we saw that ridiculous and scandalous example yesterday where the Treasurer increased interest rates furtively and surreptitiously to a few favoured clients of this grazier Cabinet to 23 3/4 per cent, secure I suppose in the knowledge that the level of numeracy of members of this Parliament-certainly on the Government side, and probably in the community in general-is such that they are incapable of understanding just how much they have been ripped off by this scandalous decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It was asserted in 1975 that taxes were at a crippling level. As a proportion of GDP they are now 10 per cent higher than they were at that time due to what the Prime Minister used to call 'the secret tax of inflation'. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers will pay 22 per cent tax more this year than they paid last year, even with so-called half indexation and real 40 per cent indexation. That has now finished. There are no constraints at all any more on what the Prime Minister used to call 'the secret tax of inflation'. At present rates of increase in money income, income tax, after adjustment for inflation, will grow by $1,500m a year. After adjustment for inflation there will be a real increase in personal income tax of $1,500m a year for as long as what the Prime Minister used to call-he does not talk about it any more-'the secret tax of inflation' continues. There are now no longer any constraints against it. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of single income families, about which this Government professes to be primarily concerned and about which so many of its back benchers make mawkish speeches from time to time, is much worse than that of taxpayers in general. It is much worse than the position of pay-as-you-earn or wage and salary earner taxpayers in general. Wage and salary earners' taxes will go up 22 per cent this year on the Government's own forecast. If we look back over the whole period of the Fraser Government, a single income family with two dependent children on average weekly earnings-the source of this data is not the Australian Labor Party and not even the Parliamentary Library but the comments of Eric Risstrom published in the Sydney Morning Herald last week-is paying anything up to 81 per cent more tax in real terms than it paid six years ago. It is not paying 81 per cent more tax in money terms but 81 per cent more tax after adjustment for inflation than it paid six years ago. That is what the Government has done for the group about which it professes to have a profound concern. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most popular boasts of this Government right now is that the economy is in good shape, that growth has been restored and that Australia has emerged from the recession. It is true that growth last year in non-farm real GDP was in the vicinity of 4 per cent which is high only by comparison with the other Fraser years. It is lower than it was in 1976 when the economy, insofar as it can be controlled by a Budget, was controlled by the Budget of the Labor Government. The recession in Australia, unlike that of the rest of the world, bottomed not in 1974 or 1975 but in 1978 when non-farm real GDP growth fell to almost zero-specifically to 0.7 per cent. The recession bottomed after three years of Fraser and it is going in that direction again. Australia is the only country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which has never had a recovery from the slump of the mid-1970s. This Government's economic policies, by its own terms, by its own standards, have been a dismal failure. The objective record cannot show anything else. Fraser looks good only by comparison with his alter ego, Margaret Thatcher whose acronym is TINA-there is no alternative. She will find out in a couple of years that there is certainly an alternative Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it worth looking at the OECD and the Australian figures for the major economic indices-unemployment rates, GDP growth and inflation rates-in respect of two period, namely the calendar years 1974-1976 and 1977-1979. Unemployment rates in Australia during the three years 1974-1976 averaged 3.8 per cent whereas in the OECD as a whole they averaged 4.6 per cent. For the latter period-the Fraser period-they averaged 6 per cent in Australia and 5.1 per cent in the OECD as a whole. GDP growth in 1974-1976 averaged 3.2 per cent in Australia and 1.5 per cent in the OECD as a whole. That was our performance during that period compared with the rest of the OECD. Our average growth rate in 1974-1976 was more than double that of the rest of the OECD. How has it been since? In 1977-1979-the Fraser period-non-farm real GDP growth was 2.5 per cent in Australia and an average of 3.8 per cent in the OECD. Only in respect of inflation did the Australian figures bear out what the Government keeps asserting is the international reality and then only to a marginal extent. Of course, in reality the figures refer to the 1977-1979 period; they do not refer to the present. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a preposterous claim regularly reasserted by Government spokesmen that we are beating inflation. However, the Budget documents show that the consumer price index up to the year ending last June increased by 8.8 per cent and the forecast for next June is 11.9 per cent. An increase from 8.8 per cent to 11.9 per cent is some way to beat inflation! It requires a great capacity for self-delusion to believe that we are beating inflation with this Budget. Those who have such a capacity for self-delusion mouth an associated piece of nonsense. It stands as a piece of nonsense quite independent of the fallacious assertions about inflation. This piece of nonsense is that if Australia has a lower inflation rate than that of our trading partners we can guarantee that we will remain internationally competitive. That has not been true since the Bretton-Woods Agreement was buried 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian inflation rate or if any country's inflation rate were consistently below the average of its trading partners, other things being equal as a consequence of that the exchange rate would be appreciated. The international value of the currency of that country would be changed upwards, not perhaps immediately and maybe not in a precise one-to-one ratio but the so-called competitive edge which a lower rate of inflation gives to a country would be eroded almost entirely before very long by exchange rate adjustments. I suppose to have a view of international exchange transactions which is only 10 years out of date, only 10 years behind reality, is not really that bad for a government whose views on general economic questions reflect pre-Keynesian primitivism. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget achieves the almost unique distinction of being both contractionary and inflationary not because we of the Opposition say so, not because some academic economists which the Government regard as being kinkos might say so, but because this Government in its own published estimates in Budget documents, admits that economic growth will fall, and by a revised estimate would have to fall even more, and that inflation will rise from 8.8 per cent to 11.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I made a comment a while ago about pre-Keynesian primitivism. It is almost inconceivable. Indeed, it is conceivable I suppose only to those who watch Margaret Thatcher-TINA-that any government in the 1980s and even in the 1950s faced with an unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent and rising could bring in a Budget with a domestic surplus of $1,500m or if it is adjusted for the freakish event of an extra pay period, an effective surplus of $1,900m. There is some linkage between that high surplus, the high inflation rate and the decline in growth, all of which the Government itself has forecast. The linkage of course is the very high levels of indirect taxation which the Government has imposed in recent years and which it exacerbated with the sales tax Bills, some of which have managed to get through the Senate; more is the pity. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on just one other price. We know that the increase in the consumer price index, what is loosely called 'inflation' by the general public, is going up, according to the Government's forecast, from 8.8 per cent to 11.9 per cent. But there is one price that is coming down and that is the price of shares, stock and equity in public companies. On 9 October last year, which was just before a Federal election and when there was a perceived need by one media meglomaniac to prostitute his media outlets in order to minimise or defeat Labor's chances of winning government, the All Ordinaries index had fallen. It fell the day before to 661. The Daily Telegraph reacted with these headlines:</PARA>
<PARA> Mums and dads hit hardest say brokers</PARA>
<PARA>The brokers who allegedly said that were not identified, nor if they had been of course could anyone explain how they could identify whether it was the mums and dads or who it was who had been hit hardest. 'Millions lost in new plunge', shrieked the Daily Telegraph, and 'Labor's poll lead to blame'. </PARA>
<PARA>The infallible judgment! The All Ordinaries index then was 661. Ever since the middle of April this year that same index has been falling. It fell on 25 September to 563-16 per cent below what the Murdoch Press asserted was a catastrophic, disastrous level. It was 16 per cent lower 18 months later. There was no comment from the Murdoch Press. But there was this comment, and I quote from the editorial of the Australian of 29 September which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>One would think that the share collapse, and the low prices now being quoted, would spur the small investors to get into the market for bargains. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is what Monty Python might call looking on the bright side. It is certainly not the hysterical, fraudulent reaction of the Murdoch Press at the time there was a perceived need, perceived that is by its megalomaniacal proprietor to destroy Labor's electoral chances. Just before I finish my remarks I want to make one other comment which I should have made when I was speaking about this fallacy that is mouthed by the mugs who are temporarily running this country. I suppose it is a charitable description to call them mugs. The alternative is that they actually do know better but they consistently follow policies that deliberately mislead the public. I refer to this nonsense that if a country's inflation rate is below that of its trading partners, international competitiveness is guaranteed. I leave aside of course the fact that our inflation rate is no longer in that position although it was a couple of years ago. In the annual report of the Australian Dairy Corporation I read with some horror yesterday this extract:</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation appreciates the . . . overriding policy of containing inflation as being in the best interest of producer, manufacturer and consumer alike. </PARA>
<PARA>The first comment is that it swallowed this nonsense that inflation was being contained although in fact it is going up. But it got even worse. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be hoped that the Government's success in inflation control will ultimately permit some relaxation of the upward pressure of the trade weighted index on the value of the Australian dollar relative to its USA counterpart. </PARA>
<PARA>It might be necessary for those who are interested actually to read the text of that and work it out for themselves. But what these mugs are saying is that if our inflation rate is lower than that of trading partners, lower than that of the rest of the world, the pressures to appreciate the Australian dollar will disappear, will be deflated, which is the reverse of the truth. As I said, I read that passage with some horror. It was almost reminiscent of the profound economic illiteracy displayed by the wool industry knights, William Vines and William Gunn, back in the 1960s when they put up the ridiculous proposition that if the wool supply increased prices would rise. I had hoped that economic illiteracy at that level had been purged from Australian statutory authorities. Apparently that is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comment before I move the amendment on behalf of the Labor Party is that the Government in a desperate last attempt to extract itself from the political difficulties of its own making and the electoral defeat which it now faces is orchestrating a campaign for phoney tax cuts sometime next year. I say phoney tax cuts advisedly because thanks to the secret tax of inflation, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) used to call it-he never talks about it now but a few years ago he used to talk a lot about the secret tax of inflation, which I mentioned earlier-at present rates of increase in money incomes, income tax will automatically increase by $1,500m a year in real terms-not increase by $1,500m but increase by $1,500m after allowance has been made for inflation. The reality of that is that any tax cut, so called, of less than $1,500m is a disguised tax increase. Any tax cut of less than $1,500m is phoney and is in fact a disguised tax increase. I know that the public interest in the details of these matters is frequently minimal. Even more deplorable, I suppose, is that much of the media has an equally minimal interest in them. I suppose the public reaction reflects that. It is vital that that simple arithmetic reality be recognised; under present circumstances any tax cut, so called, of less than $1,500m is a disguised tax increase. For those reasons, I move the amendment which has been circulated in my name on behalf of the Opposition. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add ', but the Senate rejects the budget strategy because:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) it deliberately reduces the rate of economic growth;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) it increases unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) it adds substantially to the rate of inflation;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) it relies on a massive private capital inflow;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) it fails to tackle the real causes of rising interest rates; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) it increases the burden of taxation to the highest level in our history,</PARA>
<PARA>and in addition, deplores the Government's callous disregard of the millions of Australians living in poverty and its continued attempt to reduce the living standards of the great majority of Australians'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I foreshadow the amendment. In doing so, I want to point out two things. Clearly, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) is amendable by the Senate. Under the so-called 1965 compact the practice was accepted of having two separate appropriation Bills. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is for the ordinary annual services of the Government and is not amendable. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) is for capital expenditure and for grants to the States for such things as the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, and items of plant and expenditure which are clearly definable as capital acquisition. Those capital items are contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 2), which is clearly amendable. However, the Senate cannot amend Appropriation Bill (No. 2) under the terms of section 53 of the Constitution, which states that the Senate may not propose amendments in such a way as to increase the charge or the burden on the people. This means, in fact, that Appropriation Bill (No. 2) can be amended so as to decrease the expenditure on one item and increase it by a corresponding amount on another or to decrease the total expenditure. One may not increase it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We gave careful thought to whether we should move an amendment reducing expenditure on one item under Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and increasing it on another. We were very tempted to do this because it is significant that under Appropriation Bill (No. 2) the allocation to the States for housing has been reduced by $24.3m. In 1980-81 the amount was $286.5m and it is shown in the Bill under discussion as $262.2m for 1981-82. That is a drop of $24.3m in the allocation to the States for housing. It is significant that in the same Bill the allocation for the new Parliament House is $24m. We have a situation in which the Government has seen fit to reduce the allocation to the States for housing by $23.4m and to create a new allocation for the new Parliament House, a luxury for the members of this Parliament, of an almost identical amount. It has taken money from the people for housing and put it into the expenditure for this current year on the new Parliament House. We were very tempted to move an amendment along these lines. However, we refrained from doing so because we felt that that may delay the passage of these appropriation Bills to the degree that it could cause hardship in certain sections of the community and may delay vital and important capital expenditures in other directions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Australian Democrats point out that they are greatly concerned about the contraction of the Australian housing construction industry. Adequate housing is one of the most basic requirements of a civilised and humane society, yet housing assistance to the States is being reduced. We have suggested in our foreshadowed amendment that it be increased by $189.3m. How was that figure arrived at? First of all, we took the amount of $165m-the amount recommended in the Democrat's alternative Budget-as the increase that could be afforded for housing. I point to the amount of $165m because it is significant that the Democrat's alternative Budget was balanced. We had an increase of $165m for housing and we fully indexed taxation, yet we were still able to have a balanced budget. Clearly it is within the realm of good economic management to make this additional grant of $165m to the States. To that we believe should be added the $24.3m that is being taken from the States this year in relation to expenditure last year. The $165m and the $24.3m add up to the $189.3m incorporated in our foreshadowed amendment which we hope will be attached to Appropriation Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to pursue the importance of housing to any greater degree. It would seem to us to be self-evident that something has to be done. Apart from a basic human necessity, housing is, of course, a vital industry. It is one that would, if given additional funds, react quickly and substantially contribute to lowering the rate of unemployment in this country. We believe that it is intolerable that the States should be asked to take an actual reduction in their allocation for housing this year. In the amendment, the Australian Democrats are proposing that the reduction be restored and that an additional allocation of $165m be appropriated. I commend the amendment. (Quorum formed). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with grave concern that I continue this debate on the Appropriation Bills on behalf of the Opposition. I have grave concern for the elderly, the poor and the unemployed in the Australian community. I have grave concern for Australia's manufacturing industry and those workers whose livelihoods depend on its well-being. I have grave concern that this Government, in bringing down the 1981-82 Budget, has totally ignored the welfare of 90 per cent of Australians. In budgeting for a surplus of $1,500m in this financial year, the Government has deliberately taken money away from the people through massive increases in taxation to satisfy its manic desire to bring down the growth in money supply. This financial year pay-as-you-earn tax collections will increase by 22 per cent; indirect tax collections will increase by nearly 40 per cent; and, pay-as-you-earn taxes alone will account for 60 per cent of the total revenue increases. Receipts, as a proportion of the gross domestic product, will reach a record 27.5 per cent this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Budget allows for $300m in tax avoidance by companies and by the wealthy. It is pretty obvious where this Government's sympathies lie. The increases in sales tax will particularly affect the low income groups in the community. Pensioners and the unemployed will be forced to pay more for pet food-up to a massive 17 1/2 per cent-clothing, footwear, sheets, blankets, pillow cases, towels and mattresses. The Australian Democrats would be advised to take note of the last five items, which are also regarded by most people as necessities of life. Pets are companions for many old people, but this Budget will make it impossible for many to keep their cats and dogs. So much for the lucky country!</PARA>
<PARA> The massive increases in taxes will also have a disastrous effect on the Australian economy. As manufacturing industry slows down, unemployment will soar to record levels. The Budget is deliberately designed to slow down the economy as a means of bringing down the rate of inflation. But the economy is already slowing down. Growth of gross non-farm products fell from 6.1 per cent in the first half of 1980-81 to 1.6 per cent in the second half of that year. Unemployment is increasing once again, rising from 5.2 per cent in June to 5.8 per cent in August. Not only is unemployment rising but also there are distinct trends towards long term unemployment. The most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that more than one in five unemployed persons in Australia has been out of work for at least a year. Indeed the percentage of those unemployed for more than nine months has risen from 25 per cent in 1980 to 31 per cent in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in indirect taxes in particular will have a catastrophic effect on many of Australia's manufacturing industries. Australian manufacturers have already been badly hit by the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the last 12 months. Already in the first quarter of this financial year imports have been at record high levels. The massive capital inflow which this Government has encouraged is directly to blame for this state of affairs. The imposition of increased taxes will only compound the problems of many vital industries as consumer spending declines. </PARA>
<PARA> In my home State of South Australia the motor vehicle and white goods industries, which between them account for over 25 per cent of the manufacturing work force, will suffer greatly. This Budget will also hit the already ailing building industry. Rising interest rates caused by the massive inflow of speculative money from overseas have already affected the demand for housing in Australia. It has become impossible for many Australians to save enough money for the initial deposit, let alone be able to afford the forever increasing cost of mortgage repayments. The latest figures released on home loan approvals by building societies confirm the downward trend in the building industry. In August the amount of approvals was $7.1m less than in July and $81m less than August 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's persistence in restricting the money supply and its stupidity in imposing sales taxes on building materials will plunge the building industry deep into recession. In fact, this Budget will throw the whole Australian economy deeper into recession. If the current trend of rising unemployment continues, the unemployment rate will reach 7.6 per cent by June of next year. All this Government can offer unemployed kids is useless training schemes, such as the Special Youth Employment Training Program, which is used by many employers simply as another source of revenue. We have already witnessed the fiasco over CYSS, the Community Youth Support Scheme, which clearly showed the insensitivity of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) to the needs of the unemployed. There is no better example of this insensitivity than his recent advice to one unemployed girl when he was reported to have said that she needed a psychologist rather than a job. How dare a Government Minister make this sort of remark! Just think what it did to the poor girl's confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should be experiencing strong economic growth, but instead we have the spectacle of companies, such as ICI Australia Ltd, deferring construction of the proposed $500m Point Wilson petrochemical project in Victoria. The company has blamed the deferral on the Federal Government's mismanagement of the economy, pointing to the appreciation of the dollar, and its uncertainty with regard to future support for the manufacturing industry. Clearly, the Government is in trouble. It targeted for money supply growth in this financial year of 11 per cent, but the rate in July and August was equivalent to an annual rate of only 4.2 per cent. The possibility of a credit squeeze cannot be ignored. Even the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, has publicly opposed the stance of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in relying on foreign capital to maintain the growth in the money supply and compensate for the balance of trade shortfalls. The fact that inflation is now into double figures and rising clearly indicates that this Government's policies are not working. No doubt early in the new year we will see a mini Budget introduced in which Mr Howard will offer income tax cuts and try to persuade the Australian people that he is doing them a favour. He will have to do this to avoid too large a reduction in the money supply and a credit squeeze. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is in a shambles. As we come hurtling off the economic rails and follow the path of Britain and the United States of America, this Government is determined to plod on with its restrictionist monetary policies. The Government cannot simply rely on the phoney resources boom to provide the jobs which Australians need. Between now and 1985 over 700,000 new jobs need to be created in Australia. The most optimistic forecast of the impact of the resources boom shows that it will create only an additional 200,000 jobs. This Budget will not even create one of those additional jobs. The Government's economic strategy is being opposed by Australians from all walks of life. It is with grave concern that I also oppose this Budget which will only further increase the burdens on the majority of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly on these Appropriation Bills. Two amendments have been mentioned-an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2), which has been foreshadowed by Senator Siddons. I want to indicate why I support the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and why we will not be supporting the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which is to be moved by the Australian Democrats. The amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) deals with the substance of the economic issues as we see them. That amendment is concerned about issues such as the effect on the Budget on families and the imposition of higher taxation-increased by 22 per cent-on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. The amendment is concerned about the rate of economic growth and increased unemployment. The last paragraph of the amendment expresses particular concern about the number of Australians who live in poverty. However one defines the poverty line, a figure of 3 million Australians living below the poverty line has been bandied about. The figure might be 3 million or 2.5 million; it depends on one's definition of the poverty line. But it is a shocking thing to have said about a society such as the Australian society, a society in which we are parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those are the essential issues of the Budget, as indeed is the area of housing. I fully share Senator Siddons's concern about the level of the Commonwealth allocation in this Budget to housing. When one looks at a Budget one has a lot of concern about the general thrust of it and the effects it will have on Australians, particularly on the least wealthy members of the Australian community. What concerns me about the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Siddons is simply this: One could select for special attention any number of items which bear on the social good of members of the Australian community, such as the unemployment benefit, family allowances, the effects of inflation and interest rates, and one could say: 'Why don't we move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to increase the rate of the family allowance or increase the money available for welfare relief schemes or the unemployment benefit?'</PARA>
<PARA> One could do all of those things and the Democrats have chosen to do that in respect of housing. I do not want to be unkind to the Democrats but I rather feel that as a political party they see themselves as some sort of political equivalent of a rape crisis centre where anybody who has some complaint or feels threatened in some way or another can bring his cause, have it taken up and dealt with. I find that unfortunate, in a sense. What happens as a result of that is that undue emphasis is given to an issue when there are a range of issues which ought to concern this Parliament in the context of a Budget debate. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened here-I assert this quite openly-is that the person who has sought relief in the Democrats' political rape crisis centre is Mr Kennett, the Liberal Party Minister of Housing in Victoria. It is common knowledge that Mr Kennett has been touting this issue around for a very long time. He could not get anywhere with the Federal Government and he could not get anywhere with the Opposition, so where did he go? He went to the Democrats. The Liberal Minister of Housing in Victoria went to the Democrats in search of succour. If I might use the word succour again, or with the same sound but a different spelling, that is what they are for taking up this issue. Let us look at Mr Kennett's performance as a Minister of Housing in Victoria, and his conflict with Mr McVeigh, the illustrious Minister for Housing in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. We can look at Mr McVeigh, the Federal Minister for Housing, in the House of Representatives. It is indeed difficult to find out what Mr McVeigh's thought processes on the subject of housing in fact are. Insofar as one can divine them, they have brought him into conflict with Mr Kennett in Victoria. Mr McVeigh felt constrained to point out to Mr Kennett at one stage that there is some case for putting your money where your mouth is in relation to matters such as housing. Mr McVeigh pointed out in the course of that disagreement between the Federal Fraser Government and Mr Kennett in Victoria:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The average expenditure on housing per head by all the State Governments in Australia is $16. The figure in Victoria is only $6 per head, and that is the lowest of any State contribution anywhere. So if the Victorian Government goes to Canberra to ask for further funds, it is speaking with a hollow voice because the Federal Government in Canberra-</PARA>
<PARA>Will refuse those requests. The Victorian Government came to Canberra and sought further funds. It failed and the Minister then went to the Australian Democrats, the alternative government as I think I heard Senator Siddons describe them, having an alternative government program for the land of Nod or somewhere like that, I suppose, but certainly not for this country. Mr Kennett went to the Democrats and prompted this amendment to Appropriation Bill No. 2 which Senator Siddons has foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want in any way to decry the importance of housing. It is of vital importance. The performance of the Federal Government in relation to housing is abysmal and getting worse, but so is the performance of the Liberal Government Minister in Victoria. I have just read the figures which show what he is prepared to spend on housing in Victoria. What is Mr Kennett's solution, backed up against a wall as he is and having in front of him only the quaking Premier of Victoria? They all have their backs to the wall waiting for the axe of the next election in Victoria. There they are quivering away and Mr Kennett rushes off to the Democrats. He is trying to distance himself from the Fraser Government because he knows that if the members of the Liberal Party in Victoria can at least distance themselves from the Fraser Government they will not lose 27 seats in the next election; they will only lose about 15 seats. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it sad that the Democrats are being used by a smart, articulate, very capable, likeable young Minister in Victoria. They are being used as a Trojan Horse in his little scheme. The Democrats are a wooden horse being trundled into the Senate with Mr Kennett inside in an effort to embarrass the Fraser Government and distance Mr Kennett from the Fraser Government for the purposes of a State election in Victoria. What a shameful little exercise to be indulged in by the party which is going to keep people honest. I am very surprised that the Democrats have allowed themselves to be used in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the honourable senator does. I hope he is very accurate in what he says. I find this a most unfortunate exercise and, concerned as we are about housing, concerned as we are about the other issues which are dealt with in the amendment to Appropriation Bill No. 1, we cannot for those sorts of reasons support the amendment to be moved by the Democrats. By the way, let us look at the figures in respect of housing in Victoria and at the bona fides of my friend, Mr Kennett. He is one Minister in Victoria with a bit of style. I have a lot of admiration for him. Let us look at the allocation for housing in State Budgets. In Victoria in 1979-80 the allocation was $52.2m. In 1980-81 it was $67.1m. In 1981-82 it was $56.4m. The allocation was going backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In New South Wales, just to take an example, the comparable figures are of the order of $90m in each case. I think it is sad that this matter has come up in this way. I think we should look at the real issue of the attention which the Fraser Government is paying to welfare housing. Although Mr Kennett is not good at allocating large sums of money to assist the housing situation in Victoria, he is pretty good on the rhetoric. Let us hear what he has to say. Speaking about the Fraser Government, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no idea of what's happening to people out there. They don't see the tragedy of people who have nowhere to live, and the effect on families. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kennett went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is at the stage now where I must decide where my loyalties to the Liberal Party and the people I represent start and finish. I have decided that people are more important than politics. </PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty good stuff. Mr Kennett said that he had decided that people are more important than politics. I do not know whether that is foreshadowing a resignation in the near future, but I would think not, knowing Mr Kennett's upward political mobility. On 3 September this year Mr Kennett announced that he was unrepentent in his attitude to the Fraser Government and that he would fight this one to the end. Here it is-the end is here today-the amendment to be moved by the Democrats to Appropriation Bill No. 2. He is fighting it to the end. Mr Kennett goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has got to realise that its policies might be very good for resource development, but they are hopeless for people. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to deal with the figures on the allocation for housing. He indulged in a bit of xenophobia and said:</PARA>
<PARA> It's amazing. An extra $100 million in foreign aid just like that. Yet in housing they--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Fraser Government-</PARA>
<PARA> Actually cut the money. </PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Siddons looks at the Victorian Budget he will find that shortly afterwards Mr Kennett actually cut the money too in the Victorian Budget. Mr Kennett went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the marriages of low-income people without decent accommodation are breaking up. The Federal Government doesn't understand. They don't realise what they're doing to people. Instead of investing in homes that provide security and satisfactory living conditions, they are more willing to let families be destroyed and then pay the cost through higher social welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA>That, if I might say so, is the nearest Mr Kennett gets in his rhetoric to a genuine, well phrased and articulate social critique of the importance of housing. That statement is important. It is related to all the other issues in respect of which this Federal Budget should be condemned. It is very hard for us to say that we will vote against a suggestion that $189m more be allocated to housing because, of course, that is important. But to single out that issue as the most glaring iniquity in this Budget, to single it out from all the other iniquities, the sins of omission in terms of social policy-'concern for people' as Mr Kennett would put it, concern for social welfare and concern for equality in society; all the things which are ignored by this Budget-particularly when one has regard to the fact that housing policy demands contributions from both State and Federal governments is, as I say, unhappily to allow oneself to be used for a shabby political trick by a clever politician in the State of Victoria who is anxious to distance himself from the authors of this dreadful Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate although I am not on the speakers list. I am on record quite firmly in regard to the matters that are generally before the Senate. I am inclined, of course, to support both of the amendments that have been presented to the Parliament this afternoon. The actual need for me to speak at this time arises as a result of comments made by Senator Townley and Senator Missen this afternoon in respect of the extra staff member that has been provided to me virtually since my becoming a member of this place. These particular comments were allowed to pass by the Minister at the table at that time without the Minister putting on record the facts of the situation. The comments by Senator Missen and Senator Townley-to whom I have indicated that I will be replying to them; I would like them to be present or listening in-were part of a subterranean attack that has been developed by a number of back bench members of the Government in the Senate. That attack began to surface in the Press on 1 September in the Sydney Sun. Under the byline of Tony O'Leary in Canberra, the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senators holding the balance of power in the Senate have been given a special deal on staff by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative Services Department has revealed the Democrats have been given four extra posts and independent Senator Harradine an additional ministerial officer position. </PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned, that extra staff member has been on my staff almost since I have been a member of this chamber although, by reason of the salary differentials between staff, he has recently been reclassified. The Australian came into the fray with an article, generated by Senator Townley, headed 'Libs want more pay for staff'. It refers to the extra staff member allegedly given to me and makes out a 'case' for extra staff for the back bench members of the Liberal Party. Now this subterranean attack is well out into the open. It has now surfaced into the open and that is how I like to fight because one can see who is who and where. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been the addition of an innuendo by Senator Missen on the matter of committee work within the Senate. I have had a brief look at the Notice Paper, which contains the membership of committees. I notice that Senator Townley is on one committee, I am on one committee-the Library Committee, which is a very vital committee in this parliament and it will be more so; I am also chairman of a sub-committee of that Committee-and Senator Missen is on five committees. When I first came to this place I sought to go on to three committees. I discussed the matter with the then Leader of the Opposition to find out the Opposition's attitude to my taking one of its places, since the Government was not prepared to let one of its positions go to me. It was generally agreed by the parties that it would not be appropriate for me to upset the balance at that time. I now challenge one of the Government members-they are making the attack-to resign from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and allow me to get on to that Committee. I challenge the Government to allow that. </PARA>

If they want to upset the balance in respect of the committees and if they want to throw out those sorts of innuendoes, I challenge them to resign from the committees, particularly from the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, and allow me on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of these matters were dealt with by the Estimates committees. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle handled the questions quite well from the Government's point of view. Strangely enough, she was asked a question about my staff entitlement by Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who was careful to state however that she was asked to ask this question for somebody. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The somebody becomes pretty clear. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, at page 491 of Estimates Committee C Hansard, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have only one of those. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, one senator not affiliated with a major political party. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If an explanation has been asked for then perhaps we should go back to 1974 when Prime Minister Whitlam agreed to Senator Steele Hall's request for a private secretary but refused a request for a research officer. In August 1974 Prime Minister Whitlam approved an assistant private secretary position for Senator Townley, then an independent senator. </PARA>
<PARA>That was an additional position. She then said:</PARA>
<PARA> The assistance was granted to help with the additional amount of legislation being brought before the Senate at that time. Senator Townley and Senator Steele Hall had sought some classifications and it was recognised that you had to look at the individual person and at the fact that he did not have the collective resources of a party. </PARA>
<PARA>A factor to which I will advert later on in this speech. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Additional assistance has been given in the past to an individual not connected with a major political party. In this case such assistance has been offered. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no excuse for Senator Townley to raise this matter in the Committee of the Whole. Senator Bjelke-Petersen is on record, immediately following Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's comment, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Could I have a copy of a statement like that to hand to my inquirer?</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably she did hand it to her inquirer. Nevertheless, the matter has surfaced again here in the Parliament. I just comment on the question and also refer to the statement of none other than Senator Reg Withers, who was Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time when the additional staff member was provided to me in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> That redoubtable senator Reg Wright asked a question as to why Senator Haines should be entitled to special appropriation. She, at that time, was an individual senator. Senator Withers, in respect of my situation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That was an establishment laid down by the previous Government for Senator Steele Hall. Senator Hall was allowed an extra assistant because he did not belong to a party. The Whitlam Government gave it to him. We provided it for Senator Harradine. It has also been provided for Senator Haines as a single member of the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose he means an individual. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hall lost his extra assistant when he became a member of the Liberal Party, but Senator Harradine and Senator Haines have had the same establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Wright then said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am interested in these matters because they obviously exhibit opportunities for political patronage for the swinging vote, whether it be for Harradine, Hall or Haines. I do not impute any malevolent motives, but the Parliament is bound to scrutinise patronage for the swinging vote in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Withers dryly said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have been wasting our time with Senator Harradine. I do not think that he has voted with us once. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter goes back a long time. If people only took the time to have a look at the facts and history of the matter they would not raise it. One wonders, of course, why they have been raising this particular matter and doing so in a subterranean way by murmurings about the corridors of the Parliament. I am glad the matter is out in the open. As Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said, individual senators do not have the collective resources of a party, and she referred in particular to the amount of legislation being brought before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me state to the Senate that since I have been in this place 1,220 individual pieces of legislation have been put before the Senate. I am not Mandrake and I am not in a position to say to members of my electorate, if anybody asked me how I voted on the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, that I followed party policy, that I am bound by that policy and I voted for it. I must have a reasonable explanation for my vote on the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill or any number of amendments thereto. I have, of course, to have an explanation about why I voted in the way I did in relation to the wide range of legislation that comes before this Parliament. In addition I must have a reasonable explanation, for which I am solely responsible without falling back on party policy or otherwise, for any action that I take in the Senate in respect of matters of public importance, amendments to legislation, procedural motions and the like. They are many thousands in number. What we have now is an attempt to deny this opportunity to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention the mail that comes into my office. I challenge the Remuneration Tribunal to look at the work that goes through my office and to compare it with the work that goes through other offices that I prefer not to mention. I challenge it to see the volume, the range and importance of that work and to compare it with the work of other offices. The mail that comes across my desk is numbered in the thousands. I have received thousands of individual pieces of mail within only the last three weeks. They have referred to contentious matters such as the sales tax issues on which of course I, along with other colleagues in the Senate, have received representations. I have received representations on the university fees issue, which I have discussed with people from the University of Tasmania, and on a number of other matters such as the Community Youth Support Scheme. In addition, people around Australia get it into their heads to write to me thinking that this chamber has the power to fix all the ills in the community or that I have some power to fix all the ills in the community. I think they are labouring under a grave misapprehension on both counts. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, in addition I must keep myself informed on a wide range of matters which are of importance to the community, from industrial relations to questions of family law, from pensions to foreign affairs, and so on. Indeed, I have been honoured with a request to chair the South-East Asian section of the Asia Pacific Security and Development Conference to be held in Tokyo next week. I wonder now whether the Government is prepared to say something about this matter. The Minister at the time was not prepared to say anything and forced me into the position of having to say something. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer very briefly to the statement by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle about individual members of Parliament who are no affiliated with parties not having the collective resources of a party. What are those collective resources to which other senators have access, maybe not directly but certainly indirectly? They are to be found in an answer to a question on notice by Senator Walsh which appears on pages 99 to 108 of Hansard of 19 August 1981. Of course, every member of the House of Representatives and every honourable senator has an electorate secretary and an electorate assistant. Excluding those two positions, which are provided for every member of Parliament, the Government parties have an extra 180 staff paid for by the taxpayer to assist them, and the Australian Labor Party has an extra 43 staff. The breakdown of those figures is also provided. In addition, of course, honourable members and senators may use a wide range of facilities, a fact which I challenge any member of the Government parties to deny. They include telefacsimile facilities which are not available to me, and me only, among members and senators of this Parliament. For example, I cannot go to a telefacsimile unit in a Minister's office and send material to Tasmania. I challenge the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who is at the table, to deny that members of the back bench use his telefacsimile facilities in Adelaide to assist them in the performance of their functions in this Parliament. It happens all the time. I am the only member of the Parliament who is denied access to telefacsimile facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other facilities to which I do not have access are available to members of Parliament who belong to political parties. I do not deny the right of the Australian Democrats, who are five in number and play a vital role in the Senate, to have an additional four staff members plus a stenographer. Those staff members are fully utilised and the Australian Democrats are entitled to such assistance. I assume that the second smaller party here, the National Country Party, who are three in number could, if they wished, pool their resources. I am entitled-and I want the Government to understand this very clearly-to such assistance as is necessary to perform my functions as an independent senator for the State of Tasmania. This sort of subterranean attack that has been going on, until it surfaced in the Parliament, is in effect at attempt to deny Tasmanians their right to have an individual, independent senator. Those circumstances have forced me to give grave consideration to running another candidate in the next Senate election, in 1983. As the Government and the Opposition would be aware, I did not run a candidate in the 1977 elections. I did not need to run a candidate in those elections to maintain my electoral base because that has been done on a number of issues and because the organisation is there, well oiled and intellectually informed. </PARA>

I state quite clearly to the Government that, whilst I got 12.8 per cent of the vote in 1975, I got almost 22 per cent-maybe it was more; I cannot recall, but it was certainly around 22 per cent-in 1981. I did not need to rely on running a candidate in the 1977 election to keep that organisation oiled. In fact, I remind Senator Rae that in my own electorate of Franklin I got more primary votes than did either he or the leader of the Australian Labor Party team. If he calls all of those voters NCC members, Catholics or whatever, he has another thing coming. If that is the type of rubbish that is dished out by representatives of the Government, the Government will get what is coming to it. I have referred to the subterranean attack that has been made. We see now one of the people who obviously is behind it. Frankly, I do not know what Senator Rae and Senator Townley have against Senator Watson but, whatever it is, they have forced me into the situation of giving very serious consideration to--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell a little anecdote about Senator Rae which occurred during the last election in the town of Georgetown. Senator Rae will remember it. A mother of five for the first time in her life was handing out how-to-vote tickets. She was handing out my how-to-vote tickets and as Senator Rae would know, most of the booths were manned by my workers. She was being pleasant about it and a person came up to her-a person who was identified currently as Senator Rae-and said: 'You are handing them out too close to the entrance to the polling booth. This is against the Electoral Act.' With that, of course, she was rather flustered but took the advice from the honourable senator and moved away. The honourable senator then went to the Australian Labor Party candidate and said: 'Look, make sure you put Harradine last because we want to make sure that, if you go out, of course we come in.' Senator Rae would have been doing that because he knew that a large number of Australian Labor Party voters broke the ticket. That canvasser for the ALP was so concerned about that sort of statement that he went to the captain of my area in Georgetown and told him the whole story. There are a lot of other stories but time is marching on and I will not delay the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make it perfectly clear to the Government-do not let it be under any illusions at all-that if it proposes to deny the people of Tasmania their right to an independent senator by denying to that senator the minimum staff which is required to enable him to represent those people properly, that senator is entitled, in the interest of the State from which he comes and which he represents, to stand other candidates for the position of senator in Tasmania during elections and, if necessary, to consider the situation as a whole so far as the Senate is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to give the lie to what Senator Harradine has just said. I would be happy to produce statutory declarations from two people who were with me at all times when I was at Georgetown during the last election to show that at no stage did I talk to other than Mr O'Doherty, at no stage did I raise any question of whether any person was too close to the booth, at no stage did I have such a conversation with Mr O'Doherty, at no stage did I suggest to the Australian Labor Party that it should put Senator Harradine last. In fact, that is typical of the sort of fabrication, the sort of smear and sneer which is so typical of the way in which my fellow senator from Tasmania has enjoyed his political and quasi-political career both before and after he was thrown out of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since Senator Harradine chose some weeks ago to fictionalise in relation to me in the chamber, I sought an opportunity to reply to what he said, having read his remarks. As my Whip will confirm, it was not possible for me to get a timely occasion to be able to reply. I decided that I would not reply, time having passed. The situation has been reached where Senator Harradine engages in fictions such as, for instance, the nonsense by which he managed to confidence trick the Tasmanian electorate into supporting him in the last election when he decided that he would take up a petition in relation to family allowances. The impression that was given to everybody was that this petition would influence the Budget in some way. That petition was proudly presented by the honourable senator when journalists were already locked up reading the Budget. Yet the public of Tasmania was misled into believing that somehow this was part of a cause and a campaign being led by the shining knight, as he is known in some quarters or by Senator Lilywhite, as he is known in other quarters. This was the cause he was leading. Some cause!</PARA>
<PARA> I can only say that I do not wish to go into the sort of nonsense he has gone into. I do not wish to reply to the matters that he raised. I do not even wish to go into matters he raised this afternoon other than to say that I think I could probably sympathise first with him and secondly with the electors of Tasmania that he probably does need more assistance than he has at the moment. I am not sure whether he needs someone receiving $27,000 or $28,000 a year to assist him. But certainly he might need more assistance in view of his past voting record in this place. From the beginning of 1976 when he first came here to the end of last week-Senator Harradine might like to note this-there have been 549 divisions. Senator Harradine has not found it possible to be present in the chamber during divisions to participate on behalf of the people of Tasmania whose interests he so proudly represents in this chamber on 275 occasions. Can honourable senators imagine that a man of honour and decency would stand up in this chamber and say the sorts of things that he said in relation to denying the people of Tasmania their independent representation when their independent representative, with or without staff-but for the whole time with more staff than any of the rest of us-has been absent for almost half of the divisions which have taken place in this chamber?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me just give Senator Harradine's voting record because I think it is of relevance and interest. He voted with the Government on 9 per cent of the times he voted. There are some people in Tasmania, including a number of people-misguided people perhaps-even within the Liberal Party who thought it might be good if Senator Harradine were elected because he would support the Government notwithstanding the fact that he was a devoted member of the Australian Labor Party for many years. Although he struggled valiantly in an effort not to be thrown out of the Labor Party he was eventually thrown out on what he said was perjured evidence in relation to his National Civic Council affiliations. I quickly add that I do not regard that any reference to the NCC has anything to do with sectarianism. The industrial and union activities of the NCC are hardly to do with sectarianism. But perhaps that is a matter for debate on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me continue. From the beginning of 1976 until the end of last week Senator Harradine voted with the Government on 9 per cent of the occasions and with the Opposition on 37 per cent of occasions he voted. On 4 per cent of occasions he voted on other matters-mainly referendum questions-which did not require a vote on party lines. As I mentioned, he was absent on 50 per cent of occasions. This is the man who claims to be entitled to extra staff to represent the people of Tasmania, who has not been here, who has not voted in the five or six years he has been a member of the Senate on one out of every two occasions there has been a division. I do not think I need to add another word in reply to the smear and sneer campaign which my regrettable colleague from Tasmania engages in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do. The statement that was made by Senator Rae that I was absent on 50 per cent of occasions when divisions were called is quite untrue. The facts of the matter are that I was in fact present on the majority of those occasions but because I had no desire to vote either for the Opposition or for the Government I deliberately absented myself from the vote, as I have a perfect right to do. Also, there were occasions which I will not go into when I, perforce for domestic reasons, had to be absent from the Senate. Nevertheless, the fact remains that on roughly 90 per cent of the occasions when I did not vote I absented myself from the vote deliber- ately because I could not support either the Government or the Opposition and because, as an individual senator, under Standing Orders I needed a seconder for an amendment of my own and would not get one. That is another reason why I ought to have a supporter from Tasmania after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> At end of motion add ', but the Senate considers that Appropriation Bill No. 2 should be amended so as to increase payments to or for the States and the Northern Territory in Division 896 under the Department of Housing and Construction for the purposes of the Housing Assistance Act by $189,300,000 to $251,500,000 so as to provide a total expenditure for the purposes of the Act of $451,500,000'. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to allude to some comments that were made by Senator Button that it was sad that we, the Australian Democrats, had been influenced by a Victorian politician, Mr Kennett. I would like to point out that the amount of money that we considered to be necessary to stimulate the home building industry in this country, which amount is incorporated in the amendment, was published in our alternative budget at least two weeks before Mr Kennett ever got the idea of trying to pressurise the Government into spending more money on housing. It seems to me very sad that for political reasons the Australian Labor Party will not support this vital amendment. If we are concerned about unemployment in this country, if we want to stimulate the economy quickly there is only one place that that can be done and that is in the home building industry. It is that industry and that industry alone that will react quickly to additional money. That industry is the vital area. Of course, as Senator Button pointed out, there are many areas calling out for attention. There are many areas about which one could be critical, and we have been critical, of the Government in the Budget. But there is only one point of action where money spent can have an immediate and dramatic effect and that is money directed towards stimulating the home building industry. It is a vital, urgent matter of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> It was on that basis that we moved our amendment. The amendment was not prompted by the hope of gaining cheap political mileage; it was put forward for the very best reasons-reasons that we consider are vital to the economic management of this country. I hope that the Labor Party will take note of the comments that we have made in the past and are making now in connection with the urgent need to direct priorities where they are effective, which has to be in the home building industry. </PARA>

It had been my intention to speak on the appropriation Bills. Until about an hour ago I still expected to be speaking on them. I was listed to speak on the appropriation Bills this afternoon. It was my understanding at one stage that when the set number of speakers had concluded their speeches the debate on the bills would be adjourned and that I would be able to get on to the list again next week some time. I deliberately took myself off the list because my private member's Bill was to be debated this afternoon. I thought that if I took myself off the list I would have a better chance of having a certain amount of time set aside for the debate of that Bill. I took myself off the speakers' list for the Bills thinking that the Bills would be brought on for debate next week and that I would be able to speak on them some time next week. I now find that the debate on the Bills will not be adjourned but that they will go into the Committee stage and therefore I will not be able to speak on them. Because I took myself off the list of speakers to try to bring on my private member's Bill, I have not been able to speak on the appropriation Bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to announce today to honourable senators the Australian Government's decision on the question of Australia's participation in the proposed Sinai peacekeeping force. In doing so, I want to set that proposal against the background of the history of the Middle East over the last 30 years, for it is only against that background that the importance of the proposal can be judged and the decision relating to it understood. Over the last three decades the Middle East has been the most unstable region in the world. This instability has had many causes, but what has given it special character has been the conflict between Israel and the Arab states. This has generated more bitterness, more hatred, more suspicion than any other conflict in the world during this period. Four times in one generation it led to war: In 1948 immediately after the creation of Israel; in 1956 during the Suez crisis; in 1967 and again in 1973. These wars not only disrupted the region itself, but also threatened the peace of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as war, the conflict caused a terrible refugee problem, fed fanaticism and terror, and distorted and warped the lives of the countries involved. By the mid-1970s, for example, Israel found it necessary to spend 36 per cent of its gross national product on defence, with crippling results for its economy. All efforts to end the conflict, and there were very many, failed in the face of accumulated suspicion and hostility. The differences appeared irreconcilable. Then, in November 1977, the nearest thing to a political miracle in our time occurred. In an extraordinary act of political courage and vision, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt flew to Jerusalem and addressed the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. This single dramatic act created a new situation overnight. It set in train a process of negotiation between Egypt and Israel, with the United States of America closely involved. Within a year, this had culminated in the Camp David Accords of September 1978, and, in another few months, it resulted in the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty of March 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> These events were generally welcomed as an historic breakthrough. It was not a matter of believing that all problems were solved, for clearly there was a long hard road ahead and the principal actors would need not only great determination and skill, but all the support they could get from the international community, if they were to complete the journey. But the problems no longer appeared utterly intractable and a willingness to contemplate compromise had replaced complete dependence on solution by the gun. </PARA>
<PARA> The Camp David Accords and the peace treaty contained two essential elements. One dealt with the procedures for implementing 'full autonomy' for the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza after the establishment of an elected self-governing authority. The other dealt with the bilateral aspects of the peace treaty and, specifically, with the return to Egypt of the territory occupied by Israel in the Sinai Pensinsula during the earlier fighting. </PARA>
<PARA> Several things need to be noted about these two parts. First, they are not separate and discrete but interconnected, two parts of a total and very carefully negotiated package. In particular, progress on the future of the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza depends on maintaing confidence at the bilateral level between Israel and Egypt, and this in turn depends on the completion of the return of the occupied territories of the Sinai to Egypt. Secondly, the future attitude of the other Arab states to the Accords is likely to depend very substantially on the successful carrying out of the Accords as they relate to the Sinai. If the current reservations and suspicion of the Arab states are to diminish, it is essential that they be carried out. Thirdly, both elements of the peace process require substantial political and strategic concessions by Israel. These were agreed to by Israel in return for an agreement on a satisfactory set of arrangements to guarantee its security. It is here that the peacekeeping force assumes prominence. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the confidence established at Camp David, Israel has already withdrawn from approximately two-thirds of the Sinai and, given the history of the relationship between the two countries, that it has done so has been remarkable. It is scheduled to have withdrawn completely from the Peninsula by the end of April 1982. But, as the text of the treaty makes clear, that complete withdrawal is conditional on the existence of a peacekeeping force which will supervise both the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and the implementation of the security arrangements agreed on in the treaty. The existence of an effective peacekeeping force in the Sinai, one which would by its presence secure Israel's southern flank, is therefore a necessary condition for total withdrawal. It would also help to create the kind of confidence required for progress to be made with respect to the West Bank and Gaza. The existence of such a force would not guarantee success-nothing can do that-but without it there can be little hope. The peace force that was envisaged in the treaty was a United Nations force. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to bring that into being. The Soviet Union, which has consistently opposed the Camp David Accords and which vetoed the extension of the mandate of the United Nations emergency force, stands as an insurmountable obstacle to its creation. The Soviet Union has consistently adopted an obstructionist approach to the search for a Middle East peace, has sought to encourage and take advantage of instability and to position itself to make strategic gains. </PARA>
<PARA> The question has been, therefore, whether, faced with the Soviet veto, there should be no force at all-with the disastrous consequences that would entail in the whole peace process-or whether there should be an international peacekeeping force outside the United Nations system. In considering that question, it should be noted that the likelihood of a Soviet veto was anticipated at the time of the signing of the treaty. In letters to both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin, President Carter undertook that:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Security Council fails to establish and maintain the arrangements called for in the treaty, the President will be prepared to take those steps necessary to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable alternative multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter and the assurance it gave were an integral component of the agreement reached by Egypt and Israel in 1979. The Australian Government believes that while it would have been preferable for the Sinai peacekeeping force to be established under the United Nations mandate-if that is ruled out by the position taken by the Soviet Union-in terms of what is at stake, in terms of peace in this highly sensitive region, it is infinitely preferable that there should be an international peacekeeping force created outside United Nations auspices than that the whole peace process should be frustrated by the absence of any force at all. Let me add that we should be careful, in a situation where it is possible to take significant initiatives for peace, before we circumscribe them by establishing circumstances in which the Soviet Union would gain a permanent capacity to interpose a veto, for that might give to the Soviet Union a greater power than it could manage on its own account to thwart and frustrate progress towards peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Granted that the need for a peacekeeping force to support the continuation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is accepted, the question remains as to whether Australia itself should participate in such a force. No one would pretend that this is an easy question to answer and this Government has deliberated long and hard over it. I make no apology at all for the time we have taken in coming to a decision. There are considerations which weigh for and against participation, and these were set out in the statement to the Parliament by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on 26 May. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of major arguments point in the direction of participation. Participation by Australia would encourage the formation of a more broadly based peacekeeping force which would enhance prospects for international acceptance of the peacekeeping force-a force which is needed to ensure that Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai can be carried out in accordance with international commitments. Australia has given strong support to the development of the peace process in the Middle East and has a responsibility to follow up with practical assistance. President Sadat took great political risks in initiating and persevering with the peace process and it is vital for his successors who have committed themselves to support that peace process that the remaining third of the Sinai still under Israeli control be regained by Egypt in April 1982. The failure of Australia and other Western countries to participate would require the United States to bear the burden itself and would be seen as a failure by the West to support United States policies in the Middle East. This would risk giving propaganda opportunities to the Soviet Union, whereas participation in peacekeeping would encourage constructive United States involvement in efforts to bring about a lasting settlement of Arab-Israeli differences. Our participation would be welcomed by Egypt and Israel, as well as the United States, and our participation would imply our continuing support for Israel's security. It would have positive impact on Israel's approach to negotiating similar arrangements for its other borders. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of arguments have also been used against Australian participation. It is sometimes said that our policy has been to participate only in United Nations sponsored peacekeeping operations, and that a force which was not broadly based would find little international acceptance. Some have said that the Middle East is remote from Australia and that the reactions of other states in the region might be adverse. Some have said that the extent of any Australian commitment would be uncertain and potentially too extensive, especially in view of our commitment to participate in peacekeeping in Namibia. Some have said that participation in a peacekeeping force in such a volatile area is too risky, and that it might even result in an adverse impact on support in Australia for our relationship with the United States. While there are weighty considerations on both sides a number of factors have led the Government to the view that Australia must be prepared to contribute to the multinational peacekeeping force. The starting point is that Australia has a clear and strong national interest in the progress of peace in the Middle East. It is first and foremost a matter of deciding what it is in our own national interest to do, and then acting accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Without question, the continued progress towards peace in the Middle East is of enormous significance to Australia. An outbreak of conflict would have repercussions not only for the region but also for the peace of the world which would affect us profoundly and in manifold ways. It would affect our allies and friends in ways which could not but impinge greatly on our international relationships and with risks for the strategic balance of great moment to our national security. Australia's interest is in seeing what is probably the single most serious threat to world peace removed. Further warfare in the Middle East could trigger off a much wider war. Australia has a legitimate interest in preventing this. This point is so evidently true that I believe it does not require elaboration here. There is also the economic fact that Egypt is Australia's largest single trading partner in the Middle East. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said in the House of Representatives yesterday, a stable Egypt is very important to the whole of our trade with the Middle East region. It is in the interests of Australia and the whole world that Egypt's stability be maintained, and this maintenance requires continued international support for the policies commenced by President Sadat, and which his successor President Mubarak is pledged to continue. That we have an interest in peace, rather than war, in the Middle East is, I believe, indisputable. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to the second fact which has weighed in our decision-that the peace process which has been begun in the region under the Camp David Accords is the only framework for peace which has been put forward in the long history of that region which shows some prospect of achieving its immediate objectives. While other proposals have been made from time to time, none has yet achieved the degree of acceptance from Israel and Egypt the Camp David Accords have achieved. Senator Church made this point eloquently in Canberra yesterday when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been much said for and against the Camp David Accords, but remember that those Accords, though they are still only partially implemented-and far from perfect-represent the only formula that has yet achieved a peace in this part of the world . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A central part of the Camp David process is the establishment of a peacekeeping force in the Sinai. The Government is aware that many Arab governments have stated public opposition to the Camp David Accords. The Government believes, however, that there is support for the concept of returning Arab land to Arab sovereignty; in this case returning Sinai to its rightful owner, the Government of Egypt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government attaches great importance to its relations with Arab countries, and understands their wish to achieve a settlement which makes proper provision for the interests of the Palestinian people. Australia hopes that its relations with Arab countries will continue to develop. There is a growing realisation that many countries, including a major part of the Arab world, are seeking the same objective-peace. Given that peace in the Middle East is in Australia's national interest, and given that the only existent basis for peace is Israeli-Egyptian accommodation, and the establishment of a multinational peacekeeping force, Australia cannot avoid the question: Do we have a capacity to make a contribution to the peace process by membership in that force? One fact is plain: There is a limit to what Australia as a middle power can do. We must avoid an unrealistic view of what we can achieve. But to say that there are limits is in no way to say that we could not make a useful and a valuable contribution, in conjunction with other countries which share our interests and our concern for peace in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Egypt, Israel and the United States-the nations which signed the agreement in August this year providing for the establishment of a multinational peacekeeping force-have made it clear that they would welcome Australian participation in the force. Indeed, they have indicated that they attach great importance to our participation and that the assassination of President Sadat has made that participation even more important to them. President Sadat's successor, President Mubarak, has indicated his determination to remain on the course set by his predecessor. President Sadat's assassination has in fact created a greater need for international recognition of the conditions for peace in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Egypt without President Sadat needs more support from other nations to continue the peace process than Egypt with President Sadat, and the Egyptian Government made clear to the Deputy Prime Minister on his recent visit that this was very much its own perspective. This consideration has weighed with the Government and has been significant in tipping the balance in favour of participation in the peacekeeping force. We have a capacity to contribute, and our contribution is sought by the countries most closely involved. These facts place the most weighty responsibility on us. This Government has never taken the view that Australia should refrain from doing what it can to create a better and more peaceful world. Within realistic limits we have consistently argued that Australia has responsibilities, and must recognise those responsibilities in our actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has had recent involvement in peacekeeping in the Middle East: Australian forces were part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Sinai from 1976 to 1979 and were only withdrawn when the Soviet Union indicated that it would veto an extension of the force's United Nations mandate. In this case it would obviously be more comfortable to do nothing-to say that peace in the Middle East does not concern us, or that we cannot contribute to peace. But neither of those propositions would be true. Those attitudes widely adopted amongst nations in other times and in other conflicts have led in the end to catastrophic war. If all nations wanting peace were to leave the active pursuit of peace to others, peace would fail by default-and we would all bear the tragic costs. Australia is concerned. We can contribute. And accordingly, we have decided, provided certain reasonable conditions are met to make a contribution to the multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 October the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote to President Reagan informing him that the Australian Government would agree to participate in the peacekeeping force if certain conditions were met. The Prime Minister informed President Reagan that the Government has decided that Australia will agree to participate in the Sinai peacekeeping force subject to Britain and Canada also agreeing to participate. In the interests of obtaining the broadest-based international acceptance of the force, significant European participation is a critical factor. We are glad to see from published reports that France is reconsidering her attitude. The Australian contribution would be limited to the contribution we are initially called upon to make, and that contribution will be of limited duration to be agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the membership of the peacekeeping force there are other matters which the Government believes are important to provide full protection for Australia's independence and sovereignty, and which were set out in the Prime Minister's letter to President Reagan. As is usual practice, we would need to instruct the commander of any Australian contingent that if he received orders from the commander of the force which he believed were contrary to, or went beyond, the agreed purposes of the force, he should not comply with them until he had consulted with Australian authorities. No part of the peacekeeping force, including the United States component, should have any association with the United States Rapid Deployment Force. A solution to the Palestinian issue is clearly central to the future stability and peace of the Middle East. In participating in the Sinai peacekeeping force we would be concerned that our contribution would have the maximum positive influence in continuing and broadening the peace process in the Middle East. Australia has consistently supported the continuing peace process but we have been disappointed by the lack of progress and prospects for further movement in the autonomy negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister stated in his letter to President Reagan that Australia will be looking to the United States to exert and sustain the strongest pressure to ensure effective progress in implementing the Camp David Accords as they relate not only to the Sinai but also to Palestinian autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise how much the United States has been doing in an endeavour to establish lasting peace in the Middle East. We recognise also what President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin were trying to do in their search for a peaceful solution. It is important for the Middle East and for the whole world that these efforts should be continued and should have the widest possible support. </PARA>
<PARA> Our participation in the peacekeeping force would be on the understanding that all the parties to the Accords abided by word and deed with their provisions, and press forward with a continuing peace process in the Middle East. The conditions necessary for Australia's participation have all been conveyed in the clearest terms to President Reagan. The Australian contribution under consideration at present comprises elements of an air transport unit, equipped with helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, and probably involving some 200-300 personnel. But the precise composition of our contribution will of course depend on the outcome of discussions with other participants. I want to set out step by step the timing of the decision and the discussions and consultations which led up to it, because it is important that there should be no misunderstandings about this. During the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting the Prime Minister obviously would have wanted to consult with leaders, and at the time President Reagan put the same suggestion to him and to certain other countries. As a result, our Prime Minister consulted with the Prime Ministers of Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in Melbourne during the Conference. Then following the assassination of President Sadat, the Deputy Prime Minister consulted with Secretary of State Haig, Dr McGuigan, Lord Carrington and Mr Colombo, who were in Cairo for President Sadat's funeral. These consultations in Cairo took place on 10 October, and the Prime Minister was informed of their content by cable and in telephone conversations with the Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision that Australia would participate under the conditions that have already been outlined was taken on 12 October. I want to make it plain that that decision was taken after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the Deputy Prime Minister who was overseas at the time. The Government's decision about participation in the peacekeeping force and the conditions for that participation were conveyed by letter to the President of the United States and to the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Canada on 12 October and the Prime Minister of New Zealand was subsequently advised of our position. It will be obvious to the Parliament that while Australia's decision was taken on a completely independent basis, the practical commitment which will flow from it will depend upon the decisions of other governments. That is why the Prime Minister said in the other place on Tuesday 'There is no procrastination on this issue by this Government' and also said: 'I expect to be in a position to make some announcement about this decision in the relatively near future, but that is not necessarily waiting on decisions of this Government, but decisions of other governments'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was appropriate, in view of the conditional nature of Australia's decision, that the other governments should have some time to formulate their own positions in relation to that, but it is the view of this Government that events have now moved ahead and that Australia's position should be made known. The Australian Government believes that this multinational peacekeeping force is a significant step for peace. It is not a decision which is pro-Arab or pro-Israeli. It is a decision pro-peace. It is a decision which could never have been made had President Sadat not taken his historic initiatives. The assassination of President Sadat has strengthened, not weakened, the need for international support for the peace process. A role of the utmost importance now falls on Prime Minister Begin. Many have questioned his approach to peace and the implications of his policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made abundantly clear on many occasions, its support for the State of Israel behind secure and recognised borders as specified in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Our credentials on that matter are not exceeded by any nation. So let me from that point of support and friendship say that much will now depend on Prime Minister Begin and on the Israeli Parliament. There are many who believe that it was President Sadat who was foremost in carrying the banner for peace in the Middle East. Notwithstanding that Prime Minister Begin has fully participated in the progress to that point, with President Sadat's death there now falls to Prime Minister Begin the opportunity to hold aloft the banner of peace that President Sadat carried with such courage. Prime Minister Begin now has the opportunity to make sure that the autonomy talks are meaningful, and do all that he can to bring about positive results. Let him make sure that there is a true and fitting memorial to President Sadat in a peace settlement that can endure and that leads to a wider settlement in the Middle East. There is a challenge before Prime Minister Begin, Israel, Egypt and other countries such as the United States to act with vigour and initiative so that those who celebrated President Sadat's death by firing their guns for joy are confounded, and the terrorists and promoters of discord are defeated. Let those who have used terror as an instrument recognise, with the vision of a Sadat, that the true road to peace lies in a recognition of Israel's right to exist, then discussion and negotiation can replace the sound of gunfire. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this commitment I wish to emphasise that what Australia will contribute to is a peacekeeping force-not to a conflict. The Sinai peacekeeping force will not be taking sides with either Egypt or Israel. It is not going to be involved in either military attack or defence in any military sense. Its role is to monitor, to observe. I consider it most understandable that when two countries, with a long and sorry history of mutual conflict, decide to put this history behind them and engage in a new era of peace, they should wish to have mutual friends in whom they can have confidence to assist them in the sensitive business of overcoming past suspicions. The Sinai peacekeeping force is to play the role of mutual friend. If the time should come when either party should wish to attack the Sinai force, then the whole peace process would have come to an end. By definition the force's role would also have come to an end and it would leave the region. But this situation will not come about, and it will not come about because Australia and other countries are ready to play their part, which is after all a modest part, in ensuring that Israel and Egypt pursue their mutually declared objective of developing a new and friendly relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that at the moment there are differences of view on this important issue. I hope that honourable senators and the Australian public will give very careful consideration to all the considerations I have mentioned and will agree that in the end the right course for Australia is the one the Government has decided to take. Australia has played a significant role over many years by its willingness to contribute to peacekeeping forces in trouble spots around the world, and while this particular decision has been more finely balanced than others, I have no doubt that in the end the easier decision would be irresponsible and wrong. The easier decision would be one we might well live to regret, for surely none of us would want the situation in which a failure on our part to help two countries in their search for a lasting peace might contribute to increasing instability in a region where it is the interest of Australia as of the whole world that there should be increasing stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to members of the Opposition not to seek to divide Australia on this issue. I appeal to them not to be swayed by talk of war when the proposition and possible prospect is one of peace for one of the most war-torn parts of the world. The conditions wrapped around this particular decision are such that all parties can accept the decision itself as one that in no way derogates from Australia's sovereignty, as one that recognises our responsiblities to do what we can to help achieve the objective of peace that is so close to the hearts of all Australians and as one that is in Australia's widest national interest. I commend the statement to the Senate and move:</PARA>

<PARA>We do not have many debates on foreign affairs in this Parliament. Perhaps we should have more. On page 10 of this statement the Prime Minister-I take it they are his words-states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have no doubt that in the end the easier decision would be irresponsible and wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>What does 'the easier decision' mean? I do not think this was a hard decision for the Prime Minister. He has been seeking to make it for weeks. It was not a hard one for him to have to make. He wanted a decision which would bolster his amibitions and so on as an international statesman. There is a bit of nervousness about that in this statement. On page 8-a very significant passage, I think-he says:</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it plain that that decision was taken after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the Deputy Prime Minister who was overseas at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is that inserted in the statement? It is inserted in the statement because many people in the community believe-rightly so, I think-that this is a decision of the Prime Minister. In the current state of volatility within the Liberal Party he has to be very careful about making those grandstand decisions on his own at this time. He has to embrace in the statement the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, and go to specific lengths to mention that the Deputy Prime Minister was involved in this decision. I would have hoped so. I would have hoped that any government taking a decision as serious as this would embrace the views of the Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers. I am very gratified to see that at least the Deputy Prime Minister was involved in this decision. I wonder who else was. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential part of the statement is that a force of between 200 and 300 Australians will be sent to the Sinai. It is still undecided whether that force will have aircraft or helicopters, et cetera. However, that force will be sent subject to certain conditions. The Prime Minister says that on 12 October, some 10 days ago, he wrote to President Reagan telling him we would participate under certain conditions. The first condition was that Britain and Canada should also participate. Why should they participate? We do not know whether they will. I should have thought the British Government would be very ill advised to send British troops to the Sinai having regard to the history of British involvement in that region. The second condition it that a significant European participation is a critical factor. What is meant by 'a significant European participation'? Who is he talking about? Who decides what is significant? Who decides what is participation? What does that expression mean? The third condition is that the force will be there for a limited time. What is a limited time? I remember hearing a similar expression in about 1963 when advisers were first sent to Vietnam. The fourth condition is that there be no association with the United States Rapid Deployment Force. Who guarantees that? What criteria are available to us to determine whether there will be an association with the United States Rapid Deployment Force?</PARA>
<PARA> Those are very serious qualifications and in a strange way they go to the question of Australian sovereignty in relation to this issue because the statement brought down by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate is in fact the response to an ancient summons made by ex-President Carter. The advisability of this course has been a matter of discussion for a very long time and we are now responding to that summons. However, we are responding to the summons, not so much because we believe in putting our troops where our mouths are, but subject to the assurance that Britain and Canada, which we have selected as the other two powers which should be involved in this matter, also agree. We are doing it on the basis that there be a significant European participation. So ultimately the Australian decision will not be made in this Parliament or in this country; it will be dependent upon the views of foreign governments and foreign parliaments in Europe, Canada and the United Kingdom. That is where the ultimate decision lies. Of course it is a provident, sensible and prudent course to say we are not going to do it alone; it is a very sensible course and the Government is to be congratulated for that. But ultimately the decision on whether Australia participates will not be made here. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say, speaking not so much as an Australian Labor Party senator but as an Australian, that I am sick of those decisions about the commitment of Australian troops being made elsewhere. That is the entire history of this country. Australia's involvement in international affairs has a history of glorious failures, from the Boer War to Gallipoli and to Vietnam. Perhaps it was not a glorious failure in Vietnam, just a failure. In all those areas Australian troops have been committed because some foreign government has crooked its finger and sent out the call for Australian troops to be involved in an exercise which does not involve the basic concerns of this country-not at all. The Sydney Morning Herald referred to that this morning in its editorial. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Why should Australia which has plenty to occupy itself in its own strategic neighbourhood, get involved in a Middle East mess like that?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a question which could have been asked year after year and decade after decade in relation to decisions made by conservative governments in Australia in conjunction with conservative governments elsewhere to commit Australian forces to ventures of this kind. It would be understandable if one felt for a moment that this Government had a world view about some of these issues. This statement of the Prime Minister is full of rhetoric about the importance of international justice and international peace and about the importance of hosing down the inflammable situation in the Middle East. It is full of rhetoric about that sort of thing. However, where is the Prime Minister's world view when it comes to considering issues in South America, for example? The same sorts of questions are involved there-the question of sovereignty of particular countries, the question of corrupt regimes and so on. Where is the Prime Minister's world view in relation to the situation in El Salvador? It is very different from the Canadians there; it is very different from the French there. They are the people whom he calls upon as being suitable fellow participants in this venture in the Middle East. Canada and France have a quite different view about South American realities from that of the international statesman, Malcolm Fraser, the hero of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting's Melbourne Declaration and so on. There is no consistency in his world view because, on the one hand, he spends his time sucking up to American Presidents and, on the other, he spends his time hosting CHOGM and attempting to persuade the world of his bona fides in Africa, about which I happen to believe he is genuine. There is an inconsistency in all of that and it is important that when we consider these issues we should debate some of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> So, if the Government has its way, by Anzac Day next year Australian troops will be in the Middle East for the first time in a number of years, apart from the small peacekeeping force referred to in the statement. We will be exposing those troops and this country to further involvement in the region through the errors and commissions of foreign commanders and foreign governments and the policies of others. For those reasons, the Sinai venture is seen by the Opposition as not being without very serious risks in terms of command and in terms of overall purpose. The rhetorical question that can be asked in strategic and world terms is: Why should Australia contribute military forces to the Sinai? Some argue, first of all, that in a world of economic interdependence the stability of the Middle East, which is a major oil supplier to Europe, Japan, to some degree Australia, and the United States, is important to all countries because of our links with world markets. If that is the basis for the commitment, Japan should be providing the largest force in the Sinai because it has the biggest stake in Middle East oil supplies; it has the biggest stake in Middle East peace in economic terms. Has Japan been asked to contribute by President Reagan? Has Japan made an offer? If not, why not? Why has Australia been asked? Certainly Japan's Middle East interests are much greater than those of Australia, and Japan, like Australia, has a security treaty with the United States, which is sponsoring this force. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the proposal which disturbs the Opposition is the fact that the emphasis and purpose of the multilateral force seems to have changed since it was first touted. Originally it was intended to protect and further the Camp David process but now, in the wake of the death of President Sadat and the emergence of instability in Egypt, it seems, if one looks at the statement and pays by weight, that the main purpose of the multilateral force is physically or symbolically to prop up the new Egyptian regime of President Mubarak. The history of propping up unstable, unpopular or incompetent regimes in Iran, in South Vietnam and in South Korea would provide many lessons to any government but a Liberal government led by Malcolm Fraser. In the end, the Shah of Iran collapsed under the weight of arms intended to support him. He collapsed under the weight of the hostility that his policies and American policies stirred up in the Iranian people. In Vietnam, a generation ago, President Diem collapsed under the weight of American arms and his own unpopular policies. There are many other past examples, and there are future possibilities of this sort of event if we do not have some better world view of Australia's role in international affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Opposition understands the importance of Egypt in this situation. It understands the importance of President Mubarak's success, the importance of progress towards a Middle East solution. But the Opposition just does not understand the Government's claims that the best way to go about that is through a multinational military force in the Sinai. At the same time as the Sinai force is being patched together, one patch depending upon the arrival of some other patches from other places, and a recognisable and significant European presence and so on, there is an American build-up in Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia of arms aid and bases which bears a sinister resemblance to what happened in Iran and Vietnam. There is a Soviet build-up, too, in countries which fall in the status, I suppose, of remote or mini-satellites of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government is to commit troops it should also obtain from the United States and other nations involved in Sinai some recognition that there will be a renewed and greater diplomatic effort for a Middle East solution. In other words, the Government should not think it can rest on its laurels on the Sinai troops issue, if that is how it perceives the matter. Any effort at a greater diplomatic solution to the problem would involve some consideration of the Israeli position relating to the other half of the Camp David Accords dealing with the West Bank and so on. As the Prime Minister rightly points out, there is a lot of onus on President Begin to do a few things in pursuit of the Camp David Accords which he has been pretty reluctant to do to date. Those matters would have to be taken into account in pursuit of greater diplomatic efforts to solve the Middle East problem. If we commit troops to the Sinai it may be of more help to Egypt's internal situation than it is to the longer term aid of a Middle East solution. So the Government should now promise and explain in some detail its post-Sinai policy. If there is no wider Middle East solution than the Sinai force it may well be there indefinitely, and the longer it stays the greater the risk of it being involved in hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is taking a very high risk decision and the Australian people should understand those risks. If ever there is a nation which, from years of bitter experience, has had its fingers burnt as a result of this kind of venture it is Australia. This decision was glibly entered into not because of all the attention which the Prime Minister claims in those agonising sentences in the statement, the work of some wordsmith in his Department, but because the Prime Minister has been desperate to make it for weeks on end in search of his own aggrandisement. It is a dangerous way for a government to make decisions. We think it is a wrong decision. We think it is a wrong emphasis in trying to provide a solution to the long-term problem of the Middle East. We think it is inconsistent with Australia's overall attitudes to world realities and, as I said earlier, we think it is a decision which we should be warned against by the sad history of previous involvements of this country in efforts of a similar kind. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not seek to divide Australia on this issue. We seek to have a government which makes sensible decisions about this matter and recognises Australia's place in world affairs for what it is and does not go on with all this tub thumping and so on which is contained in this statement. We will fix that up at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are opposed to sending Australian troops to Sinai. There are no geographic, historic or other reasons why we should take part in that force and many reasons why we should not. I will deal with some of those a little later. This decision is an irresponsible act that is plainly against the wishes of the majority of Australian people. I believe that it is an act of cynicism on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and for the Leader of the Government (Senator Carrick) to have stated that the Government had no wish to divide the Australian people and did not want the Opposition parties to divide them over this issue. I have news for both the Prime Minister and Senator Carrick. The Australian people do not want it and the effect of the Government's statement will indeed be to divide them very deeply and profoundly over this unwise and stupid decision. It is perhaps not too late for the Government to change its mind. I hope that will be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Are the Australian people really against it? Of course they are. This has been shown by polls already conducted. For instance, the poll conducted by the Melbourne Age on 21 September showed that 72 per cent of Australians were opposed to sending troops to the Sinai. It is not just a matter of a 51-49 vote. This represents a vote by virtually three-quarters of Australians against the proposal. There is a parallel with the sales tax legislation as it concerns the necessities of life. Again the Government is flying in the face of public opinion. I wonder how, in a democratic system, the Government feels that it can justify this under any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is one of deep concern to the Australian Democrats, whose opposition to an Australian contribution to a Sinai force was specifically reaffirmed by a motion of the national convention of the party in Brisbane last month. I believe that most Australians, if they had the choice, would rather see us tackling the issue of East Timor, which is close to us and with which we are morally involved. This is very much to the point because the parallel with East Timor must be one of the deepest possible irony. Here we have a small country just to our north, one that is close to us, with which we do have geographic and historic links of the deepest kind, a part of the world where people gave their lives in tens of thousands in order to enable our people to escape during World War II, and we ignore it. The Australian Government has said that it is its policy to accept the six-year pattern of aggression and genocide employed against these people. The Government now has the cynicism to say that something that has happened in the Middle East, far away from Australia, historically and geographically, where we have no obligation, has to be acceded to. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be a matter of deep concern to the Australian people that this sort of judgment in foreign affairs should have been made by the Government, that it should have said: 'Yes, we will commit Australians and accept the possibility of Australians fighting and dying in the Middle East but there is no way in which we could go back to Indonesia and say: ''These people should have self-determination. Maybe we could have an armed force in there if necessary to see that things work out equally for the people and that there is fair play in the small territory, which has been damaged so much''.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Sinai decision is wrong. It has ominous and possibly tragic possibilities for the future. It is rather surprising that 10 days have elapsed since the Prime Minister wrote to President Reagan without this Parliament being told anything about what was going on. I suggest that this is in effect rather contemptuous treatment of this Parliament which at least might have been told of it. Did the Government have the opportunity to tell us? Indeed, it did. Only two days ago, on Tuesday, I asked the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) as Minister representing the Minister for Defence in the Senate, a detailed question concerning what progress had been made in regard to the Sinai force situation. I was given the extraordinary answer, for a question which presumably a senior Minister would know about, that I had better place it on notice. That was indeed extraordinary but now, of course, I appreciate that the Government already knew that Australia would go into the Sinai but was not prepared, when a member of the Senate asked a question, to reply to it-stating instead that it should be placed on notice. That seems to me to represent a degree of dishonesty and dereliction of duty towards the Parliament that it is very difficult to comprehend. I hope that it will not be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> That one example should be enough to show starkly that the Government, the Executive, sees itself as a sort of dictatorship of this country, that it does not accept any responsiblity to provide information to honourable senators who, after all, with their fellow members of parliament are the representatives of the Australian people. If the parliament is to be treated in that way in the future, I hate to think how far the precedent might be extended. We derive from it the idea that no matter what happens the Government will make the most deeply involving arrangements for the Australian people, such as this might be, and then go ahead and blandly say that it will not tell the Parliament about it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are great dangers of a major conflict developing in which our people will be heavily involved if they are sent to the Sinai. The movement of peoples and goods out of Sinai itself may well be a violent process. It is certainly unlikely, in any realistic view, to be without incident. However, one of the main reasons why we should not participate is the fact that it is not to be a United Nations Force but rather one sponsored by the United States of America. I want to make it quite plain that the Australian Democrats are not in any way adopting an anti-American role, far from it, but we do foresee problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In June of this year, Senator Don Chipp and I, in a joint statement, drew attention to the grave dangers that could arise if Australia decided to send troops into the Sinai. We called on the Government then to declare publicly that Australia would not participate in the Sinai force. I would like to recapitulate some of the points made then because they are very valid still. </PARA>
<PARA> The parallels with Vietnam are too obvious to be ignored. In regard to Vietnam, the United States sent forces to a distant location without the endorsement of the United Nations on international opinion in order to promote what it saw as its national interest vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. The results were catastrophic for the United States and Vietnam and also, of course, for this country. We cannot run the risk of the same thing happening again in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we considered it objectionable that Australian participation in the proposed force should be sought by Washington in order to give the appearance of general support and respectability for the move when such support did not in fact exist. We made that statement in June. Were we prophetic or merely cynical? What is happening now is precisely what we forecast in that statement-the sort of situation in which we have said: 'We will be in it if Canada, Britain and a major European power will be in it. We will put our two bob's worth in and maybe that will persuade the others to do so'. That is exactly what we meant when we said that that appearance should not have been given by Australia. We are not in a position geographically, historically or even in size by world standards to make that sort of decision. Our decision should reasonably follow, if it is to be made at all, a decision by those other countries, not be contingent on the decision of other countries. Senator Button made the point very well that it is wrong that decisions of this weight in this country should depend on decisions made in other countries. Of course, such decisions will be made without regard to our interests. That is natural and reasonable. I do not expect the other countries involved to consider our interests. They must consider their own. That is reasonable enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The third important aspect on which we expressed concern in June was that the Soviet Union could use the Sinai force as a precedent for sending its own multinational so-called peacekeeping forces to distant trouble spots. Presumably, that is something that the United States and every other part of the free world would deplore, yet again we are creating the precedent. We can foresee, if this goes ahead, a situation in which zonal so-called peacekeeping forces on both sides roam the trouble spots of the world. What better combination for trouble and war could we get than that? The hidden trap that perhaps the Government has not understood is that by contributing to an American-sponsored force we are creating a precedent for the Soviet Union to say: 'If it is good enough for the Americans to do it, it is good enough for us', and the Soviet Union will go ahead and send forces to trouble spots such as Angola and have them involved in much the same way as our force eventually will become involved in the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fair comment to attribute to the Prime Minister-that this would be a contribution to an American or a zonal force? It is a fair comment because the Prime Minister has said it himself. I have not heard anybody who has yet spoken about this matter draw close attention to the statement of the Prime Minister. On page 9 of his statement the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of Australia and other Western countries to participate would require the United State to bear the burden itself and would be seen as a failure by the West to support United States policies in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>So here we see the situation stated quite plainly by the Prime Minister in his statement. This force will be there to support United States policies. It is not for us in this place to debate extensively whether United States policies are justifiable. That is a matter for the Congress of the United State to debate and for the President of the United States to decide. But we are Australians and it is up to us to have some rights to decide how far we will be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> How far would we go to support United States policies? I repeat that these are in the Prime Minister's written words in a considered statement. Would we go to a limited nuclear war that President Reagan has recently talked about; to a Korean type war as has happened before; to a Vietnam type war; to a task force in some part of the Middle East to fight for the oil pipelines? These are all questions which I think are going to beg an answer before we are finally committed to this force. It would appear now that unfortunately the Government has committed us to such a force. That, of course, is the reason-this is relevant-why the Australian Democrats have moved in this place that no commitment of Australian troops abroad for a peacekeeping force or any other military purpose should be made without a motion of approval by both Houses of the Parliament because the Houses of Parliament are at least responsible to the people in a sense that the Executive is not. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of record that half an hour after I gave notice of those amendments to the Defence Act, the Government removed that business from the Notice Paper of the Senate. It came up again recently; it was removed again. Is it because the Government did not want that matter to arise here before it announced its decision on the Sinai force? I fear that that may be the case. This is a classic example of the necessity for these sorts of amendments to the Defence Act that the Australian Democrats are promoting. Indeed, there should not be any participation in peacekeeping forces or any participation in any foreign adventuring without the approval of both Houses of the Parliament. If there is an urgent necessity, the Governor-General may approve by proclamation but both Houses of Parliament must be called together to approve of that within 48 hours. There is nothing new about this; it is done in other respectable Commonwealth countres. For instance, it is done in Canada. I think it is time it was done here and this decision is a perfect example of what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister on page 14 of his statement quotes Senator Church of the United States. The Senator, in a very reasonable statement, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been much said for and against the Camp David Accords, but remember that those Accords, though they are still only partially implemented-and far from perfect-represent the only formula that has yet achieved a peace in this part of the world-</PARA>
<PARA>This is given by the Prime Minister as justification for our participation in the Sinai force. Senator Church made the point in that quotation that the arrangement is not perfect, that it is far from perfect. Is a far from perfect Camp David Accord the best that can be got together following the death of Anwar Sadat? Is it not reasonable that we should perhaps look at the agreement again? Is it not reasonable that the whole question of consultation with the Arab world at large is at issue? Should this not be done before small middle powers like Australia decide we are going to commit our young men to an area which could explode like a powder keg and where their deaths can now be said to be a strong possibility? That is what we are talking about. We are talking about a decision which places the lives of young Australians at risk. The fact that they are servicemen, that they have enlisted in the martial profession, is no reason whatever to place their lives unnecessarily at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Government is well aware, as the Prime Minister has said, that many Arab governments have stated public opposition to the Camp David Accords. The Government believes there is support for the concept of returning Arab land to Arab sovereignty. I suggest that is irrelevant to the basic issue of what is happening. It is the relationship between Israel and the United Arab Republic of Egypt which is at issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We find from reading page 19 of the Prime Minister's statement that the Australian contribution has not even been decided yet. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian contribution under consideration at present comprises elements of an air transport unit, equipped with helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, and probably involving some 200-300 personnel. But the precise composition of our contribution will of course depend on the outcome of discussions with other participants. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinary statement which worries me intensely. In other words, we do not have sufficient sovereignty in this place to say for ourselves what we are going to do. We are going to be told by somebody else what we are going to do. I suggest that is very serious. I recommend that the Australian people should read this implication in the Prime Minister's statement again and again. They should take this statement very much to heart because, in the Prime Minister's words, we are going to be called on to provide armed forces to serve in a hostile theatre of war far from our country. We are not even going to have the right to say ourselves what the force is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 25 contains what I think is the most tragic and cynical statement. It is a statement which I think is appalling in its implications. At the top of the page the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the time should come when either party should wish to attack the Sinai force, then the whole peace process would have come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> By definition the force's role would already have come to an end and it would leave the region. </PARA>
<PARA>How naive, how cynical can one be to say that if a group of 50 to 90 Australian soldiers in the desert come under attack at night from forces from either side and are forced to defend themselves the Prime Minister can sit back quietly in the safety of the Lodge and this place in Canberra and say: 'The whole peace process would have come to an end. By definition the force's role would already also have come to an end and it would leave the region'? This to me seems a tragic and terrible assessment of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I could say much more on this statement. However, I know that the Senate is pressed for time. I have made the main points that I wished to make. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a number of matters under this general heading, not the least of which is the situation relating to Airlines of Western Australia. If that name is unfamiliar to the majority of honourable senators, might I make the point that until recently it was MacRobertson Miller Airline Services. The name change has not done a great deal for the service unfortunately and will not prevent those people who rely on that service in Western Australia from affectionately or otherwise calling it Mickey Mouse airlines. There is a reasonably good reason for people in Western Australia to refer to it in such a way. However, because that airline has such a monopoly on air services in the State it is virtually able to run services when it is ready. I am prepared to admit that that may sound a trifle unfair, but I am sure it is not an unusual statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will tell the Senate what happened to me when I had to travel to Geraldton which is some 300 miles north of Perth or some 45 minutes flying time. Senator Thomas who comes from Geraldton probably experiences much more frequently than I do the problems of travelling to and from that place. I rang to make a booking and said that I wanted to travel on a particular day of the week and he said: 'Yes, certainly senator, 6.15 a.m.'. I said: 'No, I do not mind rising early but I prefer to travel a little later than that. How about noon?' He replied: 'No, if you don't go at 6.15 a.m. you can go at 6.45 p.m.'. I said: 'Why do I have to leave so early when it is going to take you only three-quarters of an hour to get me there?' He said: 'Oh, we would like you to be there for the start of the business day'. I am prepared to admit, Senator Thomas, that the people of Geraldton are very industrious but I do not know very many people in the city of Geraldton who start their business day at 7 a.m. If you want to travel to Geraldton in the morning you now have to leave at 6.15 a.m. and arrive in a country town at 7 a.m. Your alternative is to leave at 6.45 p.m. and arrive at 7.30 at night which is frequently too late to attend a dinner or an evening meeting and just a little out of the ordinary, I would say. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not unusual and I am not saying that it applies just to Geraldton. It applies to places even further up from Geraldton. The disadvantage that people in Geraldton and Carnarvon in Western Australia have is that they have to come down to Perth before they can go any further. The airlines do not, for instance, run flights from Geraldton say through to Karratha, Newman, Port Hedland, Broome or Derby. You still have to come down to Perth. The fact that the airlines do not charge you any extra-they charge you as if you were going directly north from Geraldton-really does not matter. The point is that you have the inconvenience of having to come down before you go back up. The reason they like you to travel that early in the morning to get to Geraldton is that they are not so concerned about getting you there for the start of the business day as they are about getting the people of Geraldton back to Perth for the start of the business day. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is called something like utilisation of aircraft. I do not know about utilisation of aircraft. I have seen aircraft taking off at the same time in the morning with up to eight or nine flights leaving between 6 and 6.45 so I suggest that the aircraft are not being properly utilised. But I imagine that the difficulties which I experience when I travel to the north of my State and which Senator Thomas experiences when he travels are nowhere near the problems that are experienced, for instance, by Mr Graeme Campbell, the member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Kalgoorlie, who not only has the largest electorate but also has the inconvenience of having a monopoly airline in the State. This frequently prohibits his travelling to sections of the same area on the same day. For instance, he may be able to travel to one part of the Pilbara but he may not be able to get through to the other part without some unnecessary delay or having to come back down to Perth before he can go on any further. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems of course with transport in the north of Western Australia because of the high prices that are charged. The charter aircraft companies, I know, are feeling the pinch at the moment and it is not surprising in view of the increase in the price of avgas and the subsequent increase in the price they now have to charge for their charter flights. But there are other problems because, for instance, they have to go to Darwin to renew their licences and to have their aircraft checked over. They also have the difficulties of coping in the wet. I remember one occasion when I went to Fitzroy Crossing on a beautiful fine day. I arrived there at about 12.30 in the afternoon and proceeded to attend to my state of affairs after having advised my pilot that I would be ready to leave at 8 a.m. the next day to go on further into the Kimberleys. Unfortunately, that afternoon at about 4 o'clock it started to rain and we had something like five inches of rain in four hours so it was impossible to get the aircraft off the ground. The airport was closed. Whilst I was able to hire a car and drive back to Derby and continue on my trip on the domestic commercial flights the pilot had to remain in Fitzroy Crossing for up to three days because he could not get his aircraft off the ground. I realise that these climatic conditions are not something that governments can sort out but there are areas that governments can sort out. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate at this time in a general discussion that we have a look at the other airlines, that duopoly that has the charge of transporting people from one side of this continent to the other or up and down the east coast. I think I would qualify, after the 7 1/2 years that I have been a member of Federal Parliament along with other members and senators from Western Australia, as one of those people who travel perhaps more kilometres than the majority of other people in Australia. I am not bragging about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am simply stating that I travel 7,000 kilometres every week, as do my other Western Australian colleagues, to get to and from my place of work. Whilst this session may be the shortest on record it does not mean that I and other members of the Parliament will not be travelling because we all serve on our various committees and that of course accounts for a certain travel period even when the Parliament is not sitting. The point I make is that in all of the time that I have been travelling I have never once been asked whether the aircraft are travelling at a time which suits me. But when I complain to the airlines that this is so they say they do constant surveys. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming from a background of radio, television and public relations let me assure the Senate that there are ways of conducting surveys and ways of conducting surveys. One of the best ways of conducting a survey is to frame the questions in such a way that you get the desired result. Just as a matter of interest on that same point, I have not met with anybody who has been invited to participate in one of those surveys either. But I can, for instance, imagine the type of question which would be asked. If you were on a midday flight or a flight around midday departing from Perth and your alternative was a flight at midnight and the question posed you was, 'Did this aircraft leave at a time that suited you?', then naturally you would say 'Yes', because you would not want to leave at midnight to land in Melbourne at 5 a.m. So naturally you would answer yes to that question. If that is the way the airlines conduct their surveys then they probably get the yeses in the right places and the noes in the right places. But it is not the way that people should conduct surveys. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not suggesting for one minute that that is the way they conduct their surveys. I am questioning whether in actual fact they conduct surveys at all because there are times when I feel that these two airlines have confused dual scheduling with competition. If I may give a further instance, on a recent Wednesday I wished to go to Sydney and having obtained a pair in respect of my commitment that morning I decided I would leave on a midday flight and come back on a flight which was to leave at 4.45 p.m. When I contacted the airlines I was told that the 12.40 p.m. flight had been cancelled. I said: 'Well, in that case I will try the opposition.' He said: 'Oh no, they have cancelled theirs as well'. I said: 'You mean no one has a flight leaving Canberra at about 12.30'? He said: 'That is correct'. I said, 'Well, I would have anticipated that if you were both going to cancel your flights one would have cancelled the 12.30 flight and one would have cancelled the 2.30 flight', to which he replied, 'If we did that it would not be considered competitive'. As I said, I think the airlines confuse dual scheduling with competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting now to see the attitude that has been adopted by both major airlines in this country in regard to the provision of a service by East West Airlines Ltd. I was very happy to note that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) had expressed criticism of both airlines on the matter that I have just raised and that is the cancelling of flights, sometimes at a minute's notice for the people of Canberra who want to travel between Canberra and Sydney and Canberra and Melbourne. A typical attitude has been adopted with the announcement that East West intended to provide a no frills service between Canberra-Sydney-Canberra at what I considered to be in these days of high prices a fairly reasonable rate. I am intrigued by the fact that now both of these major airlines have suddenly made application for and received permission to have these same no frills flights to Sydney which after all take about 35 or 40 minutes. Let me assure honourable senators that there is not much of a frill on such a service even for someone paying the full price. I would not call having a cup of tea plopped down in front of me and then the tray being taken away before I have had time to drink it a frill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are not going to get seats but will have to sit on the floor that will explain everything. I thought for a moment that it meant that we would have to sit out on the wings. I will wait with bated breath to see just how long it takes either of the airlines-Trans Australia Airlines or Ansett Airlines of Australia-to cut out the no frills pricing arrangement now that they have effectively squeezed out East West Airlines and revert to a system of higher pricing until eventually they decide to cancel that service when it is not profitable and then cancel other flights they they have scheduled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Ansett has a distinct advantage with its no frills service because it has chartered an Airlines of New South Wales aircraft for the no frills flight. Of course, Airlines of New South Wales happens to be wholly owned by Ansett, which gives that company a little advantage. It has now forced East West into the situation in which, from offering to provide at very little profit, I assure honourable senators, a service to the people of Canberra who want to travel to Sydney and the people of Sydney who want to travel to Canberra, it has been effectively squeezed out of the market by a Government decision to allow the existing duopoly to operate the same type of service. Of course, East West has had to take the decision to defer the provision of that service. As I said, I will sit back and see just how long it takes before the other operators get back to their existing caper of cancelling flights at their whim, increasing prices and reducing services to the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that people who contract to do a particular job in a particular area have a responsibility to the people for whom they contract to do the job. In this instance the airlines have made a contract with the travelling public of Australia. If I happen to want to go to Sydney at 12.30 p.m. and they have scheduled a flight to Sydney at that time they are obliged to run it. If the airlines cannot run the service at a profit they should not be in the business. We should not allow this ridiculous attitude to our two airlines policy to continue any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to draw the attention of the Senate to a particular concern of mine. I am sure other Western Australian senators are equally concerned. I refer to an article in the Sunday Times of 18 October which describes the problems being experienced at Perth Airport in the traffic control area. It makes a damning statement. I am reminded of an incident which occurred some years ago when I was travelling overseas and I expressed my concern at the amount of fuel and luggage that we were told was on board the plane. Later, when I was invited to the flight deck, I said to the captain: 'Is that an unusual amount?' He said: 'It is a little more than usual and if we had had to abort we would not have been able to because the runway is not long enough at Perth Airport'. That did not make me very confident when I was coming back to the Perth Airport. The newspaper article relates to traffic control operations. I will read the article into Hansard. It may take a few minutes, but I am sure honourable senators will be interested and concerned. It appeared under the heading 'Air chief slams control of traffic' and was written by Peter Laud. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Operators in the air traffic control nerve centre at Perth Airport are using secondhand spare parts to keep operations going, a Government air chief said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> And he warned that Perth could lose some of its domestic and International air links unless a new $3.6 million control headquarters was given the go-ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr H. B. O'Keeffe, Transport Australia's First Assistant Secretary (Airways Operation Division) said some key equipment was almost 20 years old-kept going with ''cannibalised'' spare parts. </PARA>
<PARA> He said: ''We have been doing a Band-Aid job on it for years. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Certain components have for some years been available only through dismantling equipment of the same vintage and transferring it from other locations. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The expansion of facilities is hampered by the uncertain availability of such obsolete components.''</PARA>
<PARA> He said at the airports's 12-year-old Kalamunda radar unit up to five operators were working in space designed for two. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing equipment at the airport-where annual aircraft movements have rocketed from 58,000 in 1970 to 81,000 last year-is due to reach capacity by 1984-when movements will have topped 100,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Pressure on air traffic controllers working in already overcrowded conditions was resulting in delays of up to 10 minutes for some outgoing domestic services. </PARA>
<PARA> And RAAF Pearce, centre of the Macchi jet training program and Australia's busiest military airbase, has been forced to limit navigational exercises. </PARA>
<PARA> A new air traffic control centre, to replace one built in 1962, is a key facility in a five-year development program at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Checks have revealed that:</PARA>
<PARA> Surveillance from the existing tower is difficult because of runway extensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Night observation is impaired by apron floodlighting. </PARA>
<PARA> The control tower cabin is too small for a new five-man console to handle airport traffic in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is rather marvellous how we always tend to buy equipment that we need but we never make sure that we have the space to put it in. In this case we have a five-man console going into an area in which two people are overcrowded in their working conditions. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Tenders for the new tower structure, estimated to cost $900,000, are due to be called next March. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works-which met in Perth this week-gives the go-ahead the new tower should be in operation by late 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of air traffic controllers will rise from the present 57 to 88. </PARA>
<PARA> By the year 2000 Perth Airport is forecast to be handling 66,000 overseas flights and 181,000 domestic services a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Keeffe said before leaving Perth for Canberra: ''If we do not take action and improve facilities aircraft movements might have to be restricted with Perth losing some services. </PARA>
<PARA> ''It's either that or compromise on air safety and that would not be acceptable either to the travelling public or to the Department of Transport.''</PARA>
<PARA> Four units comprise air traffic services at the airport-the control tower, the area control centre, the Kalamunda radar unit and the flight service centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Keeffe said the facilities at area control and flight service centre were of a design superseded 17 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I could be quite wrong in my assumption-if I am, I would like someone to tell me-but I assumed that there is a component for airport tax in each ticket sold and that that money is earmarked for the express purpose of providing new and better services at the airport. If I am wrong, I am quite happy to be corrected. If I am not wrong, I want to know what has been happening to the funds provided by those taxes over a large number of years. The cost of domestic flying has not decreased. It is all very well for the airlines to say that they have introduced APEX fares, three months in advance fares, and travel by night and pay by day fares or whatever they like to call them, but they service only a small section of the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Western Australia and elsewhere who use Perth Airport-I remind the Senate that Perth Airport is an international airport-are entitled to know that the facilities that are being used, firstly, to get them up and, secondly, to get them down again are the best facilities available, that they are not being kept together by band aids and that the people working these facilities are fully cognisant of the responsibilities placed on their shoulders when they report for duty. They cannot do that if they are working in cramped, overcrowded conditions with material that was, as Mr O'Keefe said, superseded 17 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to raise very briefly-I do not intend taking up much of the time of the Senate-is the quite recent decision of the Western Australian Government to discontinue a large number of bus services in metropolitan areas. It has cut the schedules until it now appears that there is no public transport available after 7 o'clock at night. There are further restrictions during the weekend. Of course this decision falls on those people who can least afford the imposition. I refer to those people who do not have a car, those who cannot afford taxis and those on lower incomes who are dependent on public transport for a number of things. They are not only dependent upon public transport to get to the shops and meet with their friends but also dependent on public transport to keep in touch with the rest of the community. They are dependent on public transport to maintain a relationship with their families. A lot of people on low incomes do not live together. A lot of children of low income families no longer live at home. They have married and moved away from the family home but they want to maintain contact. Public transport provides them with the opportunity to receive medical, dental and optical care and whatever other care they may need. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to recognise the fact that even in this day and age a large number of doctors have evening surgery. I would suggest that it is sometimes more convenient, even for people who rely on public transport, to visit their doctor in the evening. This will not be possible for a large number of people who reside in the metropolitan areas of Western Australia because of the decisions of the Western Australian Government. It also means, of course, that unless they restrict their entertainment, these people are no longer able to go out and enjoy the theatre, the arts or whatever they particularly enjoy doing, even it if is only going on a bus down to the pub to play darts; it is an avenue for them to go out, but not under this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The elderly and those people on low incomes who do not have transport will now be confined to their homes, unable to socialise and all because a State government will not accept that there has never been a public transport system in the world which has made a profit. There is never going to be a public transport system in the world that is going to make a profit and provide the service that the public, those people in the community, need and deserve. I think this is a backward step for the people of Western Australia. But, as Senator Thomas knows only too well, they will have their opportunity within the next 18 months to change the attitude by changing the Government in that State. I suggest that, if they are finding it difficult now, they can only look forward to much more of the same in the very near future. There is this distinct attitude on the part of the Liberal Party Government in Western Australia to make things as difficult as possible for low income people who reside in that State. I think that it is a criminal attitude for the Government to adopt and I condemn it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start speaking on the subject on which I wish to concentrate tonight, one of the matters mentioned by Senator Coleman came home fairly hard to me today. Next Monday, I have to go to a major provincial town in Victoria. I was not due to get back to Melbourne until about four o'clock in the morning. So I decided to come up to Canberra late on Tuesday, on the 12.40 p.m. Trans Australia Airlines flight. I was booked on that flight. Today I had a phone call to say that flight was cancelled. I immediately said: 'You had better put me on the Ansett Airlines of Australia flight'. Lo and behold, the Ansett flight was cancelled too. So Senator Coleman is quite justified in her criticism. The two-airline policy should not mean that because one flight is cancelled the other is also cancelled. Surely there are enough passengers to go on one of those flights?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address my remarks tonight to the Australian National Railways Commission report. One of the surprising facts that has come out of that report and from other sources is that VicRail-the Victorian Rail Department-is leasing trains from the Australian National Railways. The reason is that 50 of its own locomotives are out of service. That seems to be an awful lot out of service. The reason for that is that there are not enough spare parts in Victoria for these locomotives. Also the numbers in the maintenance crews are down to rock bottom. So, we have 50 locomotives out of service. This will disrupt the grain harvest in the forthcoming year. I hope that will be of some concern to the National Country Party members here, including yourself, Mr Deputy Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a report in the Melbourne Herald on 5 October about the Victorian railway system. A special operation called the TERI-that is the Transport Emergency Resource and Information project-has been set up. One of its tasks, as reported in the Herald, was: 'To pacify angry passengers'. If honourable senators know anything about the Victorian rail system, they will understand why it has to do that. As well as that, the Victorian railway employees are given a course in how to use a loud hailer. I am not too sure that it was intended that they should shout down the angry passengers or use it as a dangerous weapon to knock them back. Nevertheless, we now have this special task force in Victoria to dampen down angry passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might ask: Why does the need for this exist? There is no doubt that the Victorian rail service is absolutely deplorable. In the last year its loss alone was $189m. I ask honourable senators to consider that amount-$189m. The trains are expensive when one wants to use them. They are nearly always late or cancelled and they are extremely uncomfortable. We still have what we term in Victoria the 'red rattlers'. These are carriages that are 60 or 70 years old, made of wood and painted a rather grimy colour of red. They are a fire hazard. All that is needed is one match and they will go up as quickly as one clicks one's finger. Therefore these red rattlers cannot be used in the underground in case they catch on fire. They can be used only on certain lines. The real problem is the fatigue of the underframes. That means that if there is any accident-a head-on crash or something-the carriages end up like matchwood. Honourable senators can imagine what would happen to the people inside them. Every day in Melbourne trains are late and cancelled. On the Australian Broadcasting Commission 3LO radio station every morning a list of cancelled trains is read out, and it is never less than 10 or twelve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The radio station advises people of the ones the rail authorities intend to cancel. Just to make the game a bit more interesting, a few more are knocked off in the process in case anyone thought he or she would catch the later train. Fares have sky-rocketed in Victoria. From 4 October this year, some short distance travellers are paying 83 per cent more to travel by train. The average rise is 15 per cent, and that is virtually double last year's rate of inflation. In September, the Melbourne Age pointed out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commuters from Blackburn, Huntingdale or Moorabbin would pay an extra $2.30, or a total of $10 for a weekly ticket, a rise of 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That rather strikes home to me because I live in Huntingdale and I catch the train from there. I am not miserable enough to try to bluff my way through with a gold pass, as I know some members do. I actually pay. I thought I was buying a train rather than paying for a fare into the city the other day. </PARA>
<PARA> Freight charges have gone up by 19 per cent in one year and will probably go up another 19 per cent for each of the next three or four years. The Train Travellers Association estimates that late or cancelled trains in Victoria cost Victorian business $450m a year. Earlier this morning I heard Senator Lajovic ask a question in the Senate, implying criticism at the New South Wales Rail Authority for lifting prices in Sydney. I checked the Sydney Morning Herald and lo and behold, many of the train fares have gone up by 10c! I think we should compare the two rail services. Since 1970, Victorian rail patronage has dropped by 38 per cent, yet, in 1980 alone, the rail patronage of Sydney went up by 17.5 per cent. Let us do a price comparison because I think that may indicate why one is dropping and one is rising. A four-kilometre ride in Melbourne will cost 70c. A comparable journey in Sydney is 30c. A 10-kilometre ride in Melbourne is $1.10 and a similar length journey in New South Wales is 50c. A 44-kilometre ride in Melbourne-Melbourne to Frankston-is $2.40. This is a single fare. In Sydney the same ride is $1.10. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would have to ask themselves what the Victorian Government is doing about this-or anything for that matter. The first thing it did was to commission a report, known as the Lonnie report or, as some people say, the 'looney report', which was brought down late last year. The report was brought down late last year at about the time of the Federal election. Certainly, that helped us to win a couple of marginal Federal electorates. I wonder what it will do for us in the State election. The Government picked a businessman who had no knowledge of the railways to undertake the inquiry. I am reliably informed that one night when his son's best friend wanted to be driven to a railway station in his suburb, Mr Lonnie did not even know its location. Mr Lonnie recommended the closure of country lines, country passenger services and suburban services. One would not have to guess very far which lines he was going to close down. He closed down the Altona line, the Port Melbourne line and the Gorae line. He decided to close down all the lines which ran into Labor electorates. However, he did close down the St Kilda line but I think that was because he presumed that Mr Dixon, a fellow aspirant for the leadership in Victoria, was going out anyway and it was a good way to finish him off. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has restored some of those railway services on a temporary basis. A similar type of line goes into Alamein in Melbourne and sneaks into the eastern suburbs. That had a lower patronage than any of the lines going into Labour electorates but, of course, it survived the axe. That goes into Mr Kennett's electorate. No doubt the Federal Government wishes that had been closed down also. Earlier this year, in June, we had a series of hijacks around Victoria. Trains were being stolen. Everyone said: 'The union ratbags and the Labor Party rabble are stealing trains'. I can assure honourable senators that members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party were involved in that. People in those areas felt so strongly that they hijacked the trains and held the Government to ransom. The Lonnie report has been a total failure in solving our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to admit that the Government has ordered some new trains. Incidentally, we cannot have double decker trains because they would not fit into the underground. The Government is to spend $55m over the next 10 years on trains and we will get an extra three to five trains a year. However, the engineers made a small mistake. They made them 7.5 centimetres too wide; so the trains can only operate on a very few tracks in Melbourne. If two of them ran in opposing directions we would have a classic train crash. It is typical of the Victorian Government; firstly, we have tracks in Victoria that are too wide and that no other trains in Australia fit; now we have trains that are even bigger still. Thirdly-this is a rather sensational development which has occurred in the last few days-the Premier of Victoria has announced that there will be free train rides in Victoria on Sundays over the holiday period. This is an enormous concession to the rail travellers who use trains quite a deal on Sundays. One can wait at a station and every 50 or 60 minutes get on a train free of charge-not every 10 minutes or 20 minutes, but every 50 or 60 minutes. A person can get on a train and be bashed up by hooligans because no station staff will be used to man the gates, there will be no ticket inspectors and no one else. So one gets a free train ride, quite possibly to hospital. The end result of that will be a failure. It will be used to justify the closing down of railway lines in Victoria on Sundays. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing which the Government does to improve the railways lines is to blame the unions. We are told that they are wrecking the system. However, in the last year man hours lost on the railways have dropped by 700 per cent. That is in one year. This in itself presents problems to the Victorian Government because every time the workers go out on strike the State Government makes $300,000. The fact that there have hardly been any strikes in the last year has bumped the deficit up by another $12m. I think Senator Button would agree with me that we are quite proud to be Victorians. We have always taken a pride in our State. We have the best beer in Australia, the best footballers and, I think, the best politicians. But we have the worst public transport system in Australia. The whole infrastructure is there. Virtually every other city has ceased using its trams. We have kept ours. We have the potential to have the best transport system in Australia; yet we have the worst. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that all this will be rectified in the next six months. Mr Maclellan, the current Minister of Transport, might be promoted to the position of Leader of the Opposition by about March or April of next year. That is provided he holds his own electorate and provided the train travellers from Berwick vote for him, but I rather doubt that they will. The Victorian rail system is not just a parochial issue to Victorians. It is a national concern. If we do not solve that urban problem in Victoria it will take hundreds of millions of dollars to fix it up. The Wran Government in New South Wales has taken steps to rectify the problems which exist in the area of public transport. In Victoria the roads are getting clogged, the trains are running slower--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I wish to deal with the problems facing Brisbane Airport and the air traffic controllers. As I listened to the story by the previous speaker, Senator Robert Ray, it reminded me of the time that I was on one of Queensland's famous trains run by Bjelke-Petersen. Of course, having travelled on such a train, if one were to travel on the Victorian trains one would have to agree that the trains in Victoria are of a very high standard. However, I return to the points I wish to make about the air traffic controllers. The problem facing the air traffic controllers at Brisbane Airport is of national importance and it is very important to the State of Queensland. If the Government continues with its policy in relation to air traffic controllers and if no remedial action is taken the situation will develop where Brisbane Airport, along with other airports throughout Queensland, will be closed to air traffic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Air traffic controllers in Brisbane have a loss rate of 8 per cent which is double the national average. The national average runs from about 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. During a discussion of the matter at an Estimates committee hearing, I posed a number of questions in relation to air traffic controllers. It was claimed by officers of the Department of Transport that the loss of air traffic controllers in the Brisbane area was because of age. I continued to question the departmental officer about the problem facing the controllers and why such a loss rate existed in the Brisbane area. He repeated that it was because of age. Having had a discussion with the air traffic controllers in Brisbane, I know that it is not due to age. The problem relates to health. Ill health is brought about by the sorts of pressures that are placed on the air traffic controllers because of the shortage of staff and the growth of air traffic in the metropolitan area of Brisbane. The loss rate applies not only to the young air traffic controllers but also to the older controllers. The loss rate continues because of the pressure which is placed upon them and the number of hours they have to work because of the shortage of controllers, because there are no replacements and because of the density of air traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> The controllers are subject to transfer throughout the State to places such as Mount Isa, Cairns and Townsville. Other members of their organisation who are employed in the other States are not subject to transfer in the same way as those employed in the metropolitan area of Brisbane. The air traffic controllers at Brisbane work with inferior equipment. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has claimed that the equipment is not inferior but, in answer to a question which I posed in this place, he replied that the sort of equipment that the air traffic controllers were working with in Brisbane had been designed in the early 1960s and was commissioned in Brisbane in 1965. This is 1981. There has been no change in the equipment that the air traffic controllers are using in the Brisbane metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> The air traffic controllers work under the worst airport conditions in the whole of Australia. Brisbane has the fastest rate of expansion of air traffic of any airport of the Commonwealth of Australia. Due to the understaffing situation many controllers are waiting for up to two years just to take normal leave. Because of the shortage of air traffic controllers at Brisbane Airport it is not easy for people employed there to take their normal annual leave when it is due. There are not the men available to replace them during their period of leave. This is having a fairly bad effect on the health of the air traffic controllers in the Brisbane area. I believe this is one of the reasons for the increase in the loss rate at Brisbane Airport to 8 per cent, which is 4 per cent above the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do we have problems in relation to the air traffic controllers in Brisbane. We also have problems in relation to a number of airports outside Brisbane. I believe the Senate should be made aware of the problems that exist at the Maroochydore Airport. This is one of the smaller airports situated outside Brisbane which are too far outside the air space area to be controlled by the air traffic controllers at Brisbane. They cannot control the planes flying in. The transport planes fly in carrying people from the southern States. At the same time we find that there are also people who are learning to get their pilots licences landing and taking off. On the one hand there are the large transport planes flying from the metropolitan areas and on the other hand there are the small planes being flown in the same air space by people learning to fly to gain their licences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Maroochydore Airport is the gateway to the Sunshine Coast area. It catered for something like 42,000 passengers in the year ending 30 June 1981. It is probably as big as the Bundaberg Airport. Maroochydore Airport is Queensland's fifth fastest growing airport but despite the busy nature of Maroochydore it has no air traffic controllers at all. There is no control on the number of aircraft and their passengers coming into the airport. The air traffic controllers in the Brisbane area believe that Maroochydore is becoming the most dangerous airport in Australia but they cannot supply the control staff as they do not have the numbers. They do not have the numbers to run the metropolitan area airports so they cannot provide any people to go to the Maroochydore Airport. Queensland has 20 per cent fewer air traffic controllers per aircraft handled than anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do we have the problem of having no controllers at the Maroochydore Airport coupled with the growth of the airport because of the number of passengers moving in and out during the year, but also we have a problem-an inspection was undertaken at the airport-in relation to the fire hazards. During a recent inspection we found that only two fire hoses near the main terminal were available and one behind a locked steel roller door. No fire extinguishers were visible in the main terminal building or passenger approaches to the runway. No fire-fighting information was displayed anywhere in the terminal or the airport. No smoke detectors were visible. There were no automatic alarms connected to the fire brigade or the police station. It takes something like 15 minutes to drive from the police station or the fire station to the airport and that is if the driver drives at a high speed. There are no fire tenders, fire-fighting equipment or fire-fighting staff stationed at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport must make adequate fire-fighting equipment available, even on loan, until the airport management can get its act together and the Department of Transport must restrict air-space for commercial aircraft using Maroochydore Airport until the air traffic controllers are working there. We see advertisements in the southern newspapers advertising cheap flights to the north coast which land at the Maroochydore Airport with bus services to Noosa and Caloundra. We find that the cheap flights are being taken by people in the southern areas who are going to the north coast for holidays. There is an increase in traffic and it will further increase because of the advertisements being placed in newspapers by the airlines. We find that there are no air traffic controllers in the area and no visible means of fire-fighting equipment anywhere near the area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very near future we will find that there will be a major accident, whether it be in the air or on the ground. If it happens in the air there is no way in the world that people will be able to get any salvation from the staff or the people who should be available to fight the fire that might be caused. If there is a fire in the area no one will be available. There will be no expertise, no knowledge and no training for people in the area who might be available. It seems to me that with an airport which is growing at the fifth fastest rate of any airport in Queensland and is handling something like 42,000 passengers a year, the Department of Transport has a responsibility to see that the number of air traffic controllers are increased not only at the Brisbane Airport but also at the Maroochydore Airport. It should also see that some training is given to people in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to take too much time of the Senate. One other point was raised during the discussion on the Estimates and that was the point that the Transport Department was handing over control of the Cairns Airport to the harbour board. Fancy a national government handing over an airport in an area such as Cairns, which will one day become the prime area for international flights bringing tourists to the State, to a local board which has been set up and which is not even responsible to the State Government. It has very little responsibility in relation to its finances and probably has no responsibility to the Auditor-General. What other country would allow its national government to hand over responsibility for an airport to a local board which has been set up in the area?</PARA>

It seems to me to be pretty irresponsible on the part of the Minister for Transport and the Department to hand over an airport which, as anyone must know very clearly, in the very near future will be one of the major airports in one of the major areas of Australia. It will handle passengers from overseas who are coming into Australia. The Minister has the hide, the gall, the lack of knowledge or the lack of foresight to hand over this airport to some harbour board setup so that the national government does not have to pay the expenses of running that airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can consider the argument of security or defence. We have seen this Government today saying that we are going to have an Australian force sent to Sinai to try to maintain peace. We have a city in the north of Australia which is in a very strategic position and the national government has handed over control of its airport. It seems to me that it does not have any real sense of real responsibility to the people of Australia. The upgrading of this Airport would be a defence investment. Its development would be an essential part of Australia's northern defence. That is one more reason why Cairns Airport ought to remain a Commonwealth responsibility, yet the Commonwealth has pursued a deliberate policy of neglect and has allowed the Airport to run down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion I would like to return to the Brisbane Airport, to what is happening in other airports and to the situation concerning the air traffic controllers. I repeat that double the national average of people are leaving the air traffic controller service in the metropolitan area. One of the major reasons is the lack of people being appointed to that area and another is the lack of recruitment of air traffic controllers by the Department. I think that emphasises again the lack of foresight shown by the Minister and the Department of Transport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could it be five? Nothing one says in this place about communications stimulates any debate. It is a dead issue in the Senate because all the decisions are made by that National Country Party Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) who does not know what he is doing and nobody can understand those decisions, particularly, I suppose, Government senators. It makes it very difficult in that situation to have any debate about the very serious issues involved with communications. For example, if honourable senators want evidence that the Country Party Minister does not know what he is doing they should consult the House of Representatives Hansard for this week. He took it upon himself on Tuesday to give a lecture to one of our members about the terminology in a certain area of broadcasting. In the course of doing that he displayed that he knew nothing about the terminology himself. He has, in fact, done that on three occasions this week. It is a serious and sad situation that there should be such a Minister in charge of such an important area as communications. That is nowhere better displayed than in the area of the Minister's activities regarding Telecom Australia where, one suspects, the only sort of policy idea that flows through the Minister's head is that there is a sort of perfect like desire to discipline all instrumentalities under his control and also to ignore the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts about Telecom and its recent troubles have been very clearly documented, not by me but by Government advisers, Government committees and so on. In the last fortnight three sets of documents have been published-not by the Minister, who does not believe in open government or discussion about the largest employee in Australia, but by me-which go to the question of the Government's policies on Telecom. The first was the McKinsey report on the capital and policy requirements of Telecom for the 1980s. It was commissioned jointly by the Government and Telecom to consider that topic. It is a very important topic, one would have thought, for this very big, profitable organisation of government. One would have thought that in making the decision to commission that report-in fact, Mr Staley made that decision-the Government might have had some intention to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, the report was published. It made a number of very laudatory comments about the relative efficiency of Telecom, it made some suggestions about the degree of capital investment required by Telecom and it drew the conclusion that Telecom's major need was for an injection of new capital investment in order, in the words of the report, to improve the efficiency and productivity of that organisation-words which I thought would roll lightly off the tongue of a Minister such as Mr Sinclair, interested as he is in these matters in his outside business activities even if not in his role as a Minister in the Fraser Government. The Government totally ignored the recommendations of that report. Some six days after the report became public the Minister for Communications justified his decision to give the development of videotex to private enterprise with the glib statement that over four years it would cost Telecom to develop the system $3.5m which would best be put into the development of the conventional telephone network. I do not think Mr Sinclair really knows what the annual capital investment of Telecom is. I do not think he has a clue. It is $1,200m or more a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Considerably helped, of course, by the performance from Senator Rae. Seriously, I would like to address myself to the 1981 report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. In doing so, I address myself to a few problems relating to the housing industry. The problems, as we know, are many and varied and in the debate this afternoon they were raised in the context of a statement made recently, and one which has been made frequently in recent days, by the Victorian Minister of Housing. That statement was to the effect that the Federal Government has not been allocating sufficient money in the areas of housing, especially in the area of welfare housing, the area that we call public sector housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to discuss generally the federal problem, but address myself mainly to the problem facing housing in South Australia. The problem in that respect is highlighted very significantly in this report. In many ways this report can be seen as a vote of no confidence in the policies of the South Australian Government, both in the general economic sense and specifically in relation to its housing policies. We have had decisions from the Federal Government on three fronts which have affected the housing industry. We have had massive reductions in government housing outlays. In 1974-75 housing outlays were 3.9 per cent of total Budget outlays. In this financial year, as stated in the Budget recently introduced, the outlays now stand at one per cent of the Budget, a decrease from 3.9 per cent to one per cent. They now stand at one-quarter of what they were in real terms when Labor was last in government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the specific area of public sector housing in 1974-75 the Whitlam Labor Government spent 3.9 per cent of its government expenditure, and the amount paid out in that Budget was $392m. In this current Budget, the amount allocated for housing has gone down to one per cent and stands at $255m. It is no wonder that the Victorian Minister has lent his support to the call of the Australian Labor Party both here and in Victoria for increased funding in this area. One has to be in one's electoral office only one or two days a week to have constituents come in with housing problems. I have had quite a number of people coming in who do not have homes. I refer to people with families and to single parents of one sort or another who are in desperate need of housing and who, because of the specific policies of this Government and, in our instance, the South Australian Liberal Government, cannot find suitable housing to accommodate themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned government outlays. I cannot go much further without mentioning the deliberate policy of this Government which has led to continuing increases in interest rates and finally the impost of 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials. In this respect I should like to refer briefly to a Press statement issued by Mr Bill Kirkby-Jones, the National Executive Director of the Real Estate Institute of Australia. On 19 August, in response to the Budget, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The impost of a 2.5% sales tax on building materials used in the construction of new houses flies in the face of the Government's stated priority for home ownership and is in complete contradiction to the findings and recommendations of the Housing Costs Inquiry, set up by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That Real Estate Institute representative gives the lie to the Government's policy. He refers to a stated policy of home ownership, and that is very much all it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn specifically to South Australia because the report to which I am addressing myself covers the South Australian situation. We in South Australia find ourselves in a much more serious position than other States. The forecasts in this report indicate the seriousness of this position very strongly. The report refers to these problems on page 75. I will quote very briefly from it. The report refers to the decline in the rate of growth in housing in South Australia and states in paragraph 6.5.28:</PARA>
<PARA> These patterns are expected to continue over the coming triennium. Net population loss through interstate migration is expected to average 6,000 per annum (a net loss of 500 was assumed in the last Report). This increased loss is attributed to the high level of unemployment compared with other States and to people moving to other States with better job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>In one short statement this independent report prepared by housing industry bodies and all levels of government says that the housing industry in South Australia is gone because of the economic policies implemented in that State. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This low population growth will be a major constraint on housing demand in South Australia. Furthermore, current economic conditions and prospects are expected to dampen the rate of household formation. </PARA>
<PARA>I can quite well expect some mutterings from the other side of the chamber to suggest that the decrease in the rate of growth in population in South Australia is not the cause of this current Liberal Government. In response to that type of interjection before it arises, I wish to refer to the House of Representatives Hansard of 19 August 1981 when, in answer to a question on notice on page 528, asked by Mr Uren, the Federal Treasurer, Mr Howard, issued a set of figures which showed that in the financial year 1976-77 there was an increase in the South Australian population of 3.9 per cent. In the following year, 1977-78, there was in fact a decrease, a minor one, of 0.6 per cent. In 1978-79 there was a minor decrease of just over 3 per cent, but in the first year of the Tonkin Government that decrease in population doubled to 6.9 per cent, and that is where it stood for the financial year 1979-80. In fact, the figures supplied by the Federal Treasurer, together with this report, show to what extent the South Australian population is showing its vote of no confidence in the current administration of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn specifically to some of the indicators for housing for South Australia. When we look at them, we find that they all indicate one thing; that is, that the industry is in deep crisis and the crisis will continue. The statistics show that there has been a decline in the number of houses financed, in the number of housing approvals granted and in the number of houses commenced. For the first five months, to May 1981, 8,292 houses were financed in South Australia. In the same period one year earlier, in a period which felt the effects of policies implemented by a Dunstan and then a Corcoran Labor government, over 9,500 homes were financed. In fact in the first full year of Tonkin administration 1,276 fewer homes were financed than for a similar period the year before. Let us look at the amounts of money which were spent in the area of housing in that same five months period. In the term of the first five months to May 1980, $236.7m was spent. In the same period this year, only $225.3m has been spent. The figures in this area indicate quite significantly that even without taking inflation into account there has been a decrease of over $11m in finance in the housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the number of dwellings that have been approved for construction, another figure which is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In the six months to June 1981, 2,406 new private homes were approved for construction in South Australia. In the same period in 1980, once again a period which was very soon after the fall of the Labor Government and subject to the policies of that government, over 2,870 homes were built. Once again that indicates another vote of no confidence in the Tonkin administration in that almost 500 fewer homes were built at the start of this year than there were last year. </PARA>
<PARA> One asks oneself why South Australia is suffering in this way. As I said earlier, the report on the housing industry to which I am referring highlights two of the major problems in this area. I have referred to those problems and quoted from the report in relation to them. We do have the problem of population loss. The report makes a prediction as to the number of houses to be built, in view of that loss, in South Australia in the forthcoming year. A year ago, the prediction was that 9,000 new houses would be built. This year, the Association revises its assessment of the forthcoming year and predicts that only 8,500 houses will be built. That is the final, conclusive fact which emerges from this report, in its assessment of the Tonkin administration's housing policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that the reasons are clear. South Australia does have poor economic conditions and a recessionary policy, but that is not an affliction of that State alone. It has been perpetrated throughout the country by the deliberate policies of this Federal Government, policies which have proven to be unworkable and impracticable in the United Kingdom. They will also, given the unpopularity of President Reagan, prove to be unworkable in the United States. Equally, I predict that they will prove-as is already evident-to be unworkable in Australia. That will be shown by the vote at the next Federal election. In respect of South Australia, the national problems have been heightened by an incompetent, inept administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I will merely refer to the summary of economic indicators which have a direct effect on the housing industry. I have mentioned population growth. In respect of the consumer price index, over the previous year South Australia has had one of the largest increases in Australia. I have already given the figures as to number of new houses financed. Another indicator that one may look at is the number of new motor vehicle registrations. In South Australia, the figure for the June quarter of 1981 was only 6 1/2 per cent higher than that for the June quarter of 1980. Throughout the rest of Australia, new motor vehicle registrations have increased by 10.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Retail sales growth in South Australia in the same period also lagged behind. In regard to the growth of job vacancies-an issue on which the Tonkin Government came into office with grandiose promises-there has been in fact a decrease in the 12 months to May 1981 of almost 29 per cent. Throughout Australia, there has been an increase of just over 19 per cent. The unemployment rate in South Australia stands at 8 per cent whereas for the rest of Australia it stands at about 5 1/2 per cent. The most indicting figures in this category are those that I saw today. They reveal that, in every one of the last 21 months of the Tonkin administration, South Australia has had the highest rate of unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of employment growth, another indicator that is often studied by the Federal Government, over the 12 months period to June 1981, the rate for South Australia has been 1.6 per cent. For Australia generally, it has been 2.3 per cent. I do not know whether I am holding up anyone who may want to speak after me but I propose to end my remarks by making the point that I see this 1981 report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry as a massive vote of no confidence in the economic policies of the South Australian Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening I heard one of my colleagues, Senator Coleman, speaking about air transport in Western Australia. I would like to take a short time to say something about air transport in the western parts of Queensland. Amongst the papers that we are debating tonight are some which relate to both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines. It is my opinion that neither of those organisations is really pulling its weight in rural Queensland. In fact, Ansett has almost totally withdrawn from areas of Queensland which are not on the coastal city routes; TAA is doing its best to pull out of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland is very dependent upon air transport, because it is such a vast State and highly decentralised. To give an indication of the size of the State in relation to other States which are south of it I will cite some figures. Queensland has an area of 1.7 million square kilometres. By comparison, Victoria has 0.2 million square kilometres and New South Wales some 0.8 million square kilometres, and is therefore about half the size of Queensland. In addition, Queensland is very highly decentralised. If honourable senators picture a map of Queensland, north of Brisbane they will find such major cities along the coast, or near the coast, as Gympie, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone and Rockhampton. From the Tropic of Capricorn north there are cities such as Mackay, Townsville and Cairns. Even north of Cairns there are major centres which, although not heavily populated, are important as far as the general commerce of Queensland is concerned. In addition, there are cities of note to the west of the coast. Toowoomba is a major inland city and Mount Isa is a very major city which is further inland. A number of other major towns are also well back from the coast. Therefore, in addition to Queensland's vast distances, this high degree of decentralisation makes air transport vital to the State. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give honourable senators an idea of some of the distances in Queensland so that they may know how far Queenslanders must travel and how dependent they are on air transport. If one travels from Brisbane to Cairns, as many of us in Queensland do quite often, one travels 1,435 kilometres. The distance between Brisbane and another major city, Mount Isa, by direct flight is even greater-1,580 kilometres. From time to time some honourable senators-I notice other Queensland senators in the chamber tonight-probably travel distances such as I will talk about in a moment. From Brisbane to one of the Torres Strait islands is a distance of 2,300 kilometres one way. That is greater than the distance from Brisbane and Melbourne. That should give honourable senators an idea of the length and the vastness of the State, which makes air transport so vital for Queenslanders. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks the people of western Queensland have seen something quite remarkable happening. It has seemed remarkable to them because they are fighting for the survival of an airline in their area, yet they have seen TAA, Ansett and another major operator fighting one another for the Canberra-Sydney route. It is remarkable that those airlines have been competing for this route which, judging from the way they are competing for it, must be profitable yet in western Queensland people are fighting to retain an airline. The airlines have been falling over themselves to try to get the Canberra-Sydney route, yet they are falling over themselves to get out of western Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment about the services in Queensland and western Queensland. In general, those along the coastal areas of Queensland are reasonable. They are probably reasonable because they are profitable routes. The Brisbane-Cairns route is quite profitable. On a number of occasions, I have been unable at short notice to get a seat on a flight on that route because the plane has been totally booked out. There are some direct flights between the two centres, but there are more on the Brisbane-Townsville route, which is also profitable. Nowadays, with the tourist industry developing in central Queensland and the areas just north of it, the routes to those areas are also profitable. Probably one of the most profitable at the moment is the Brisbane-Proserpine route, which five or six years ago was not well known at all. Many flights go directly from Brisbane to Proserpine and some even go from Sydney to Proserpine. </PARA>
<PARA> In comparison with the good services that we have on the Queensland coast, the services in western Queensland are abysmal. I acknowledge that TAA is providing a service there-Ansett is not-but it is a poor one. I will give an indication of something that happened to me recently which is not atypical. I am sure that it would happen to a number of people who wished to travel to western Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to go to a meeting at Longreach on a Friday morning. I have my office in Brisbane; so I wanted to leave from that city. To be at the meeting at Longreach at about 10 or 11 o'clock on the Friday morning I had to leave Brisbane at about midday the day before. The plane made a number of stops and eventually got to Longreach at about a quarter past four in the afternoon. It was not too bad flying when I did a few weeks ago. But one can imagine what flying conditions are like in western Queensland during summer. It is not that pleasant to fly at that time of year. Nevertheless, I had to leave on the Thursday to be able to attend the meeting at Longreach on Friday morning. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time the Friday morning meeting was over, the Friday plane to Brisbane had left. It had left some time in the morning while I was still at the meeting. The next flight that I could have caught to Brisbane did not leave until the Saturday afternoon. So to attend a two or three hour meeting at Longreach I had to leave Brisbane about midday on the Thursday and I would have arrived back in Brisbane at about 6 o'clock on Saturday night. In fact, I thought of driving and I probably would have been able to get up and back much more quickly than by flying. But I decided not to drive because, quite frankly, some of us drive too much. It is a little less dangerous if one lets someone else carry one around in an aeroplane. </PARA>
<PARA> On that occasion that is what I normally would have had to do. I say 'normally' because I was a little lucky. On Friday afternoon following the meeting I was offered a lift back to Brisbane in a charter aircraft. I was able to get back to Brisbane on Friday night. I might mention here that I was quite thankful for the lift which was offered to me by the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt. This arrangement was satisfactory for me. It meant that I was home 24 hours earlier than I would have been. However, any person who did not have that opportunity would have been away from Brisbane for a long time in order to attend a short meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably not so much people travelling from Brisbane who face this problem. It is the people from areas such as Longreach who have to conduct some business in Brisbane and then get back to their home town who face this problem time after time. They have to stop over in Brisbane as I would have had to stop over in Longreach if things had gone normally. This gives us an idea of the type of service which they are offered, a service which is not all that good. I might mention that if I had gone back to Brisbane on the Saturday afternoon I would not have travelled with TAA because the airline does not operate a service out of Longreach on that day. I would have flown back with Bush Pilots Airways Ltd. That flight would have gone from Longreach to Emerald and from Emerald to Brisbane in what is called the Metroliner or what the people at Longreach call the jet propelled pencil. </PARA>
<PARA> Three major areas in western Queensland are dependent upon TAA for their air transport. If we go west from Brisbane we have places such as Roma, Mitchell, Charleville, Quilpie, Windorah and Birdsville. That general area is dependent upon TAA for its air transport. If we go up into central Queensland from Charleville we have places such as Blackall, Isisford, Longreach, Aramac, Muttaburra and Winton. Those general areas in central western Queensland also depend upon TAA for their air transport. Then there is a third area from Townsville out to Mount Isa which takes in places such as Charters Towers, Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek and Cloncurry before going into Mount Isa. Those three general areas are heavily dependent upon the TAA Fokker Friendship aircraft which fly there. </PARA>
<PARA> TAA has said that it cannot continue to fly into these areas unless it receives a subsidy. Executives of TAA told me that there is no other way out other than that the airline receives a subsidy. If the airlines charge higher fares to try to recoup its costs it will then have fewer passengers and the whole system will grind to a halt. Nobody will travel on the planes and they will be withdrawn. In fact, some people in western Queensland now prefer to take a bus. People from places such as Longreach find that it is far cheaper to travel by bus to Brisbane even though such a trip takes about 20 hours. It costs about half as much to travel by bus than to fly. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the fact that the Fokker Friendship aircraft are probably reaching the end of their operational life. They are probably not as economical as we would like but they are the type of aircraft that is needed in these western areas. People in western Queensland do not want to see the Fokkers replaced by a plane which has fewer facilities and, probably more importantly so far as I am concerned, less freight carrying capacity. I will deal with freight in a moment. I will outline the reasons people want to see the Fokkers retained. First of all, they have flight attendants. One might ask why we need flight attendants. Children who travel on a service such as the one I described earlier which leaves Brisbane at midday and arrives at Longreach at a quarter past four in the afternoon and involves a number of stops need supervision. They probably sometimes need the help that a flight attendant can give them. A number of young children in these areas travel by aircraft. They may have to travel to school or go away for medical treatment. Sometimes they have a parent or an escort with them. Sometimes they travel by themselves. The people of these areas would like to see aircraft with flight attendants. </PARA>
<PARA> They would also like to see aircraft flown by two pilots. I notice that a Queensland senator has just come into the chamber. He is a pilot and he would probably be quite happy about flying in an aircraft with one pilot. He would probably be quite happy to pilot a plane himself in these areas. But when one is not an experienced pilot, when one does not know much about the mechanical aspects of flying a plane and one is travelling in these areas, one certainly likes to have two pilots up front just in case something happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it all costs money. I imagine that this is one of the reasons TAA is finding it unprofitable to be in these areas and why it is saying that it will be unable to operate unless it receives a subsidy. There are probably other reasons such as the type of planes that are being flown. It might cost money to operate planes with two pilots but at the same time it is much safer to have two people up front. For safety's sake, I would rather it cost money. It also costs money to provide flight attendants. However, I think that flight attendants are necessary in some situations. I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have outlined the reasons the people of these areas want to see the Fokkers remain in service. They want these aircraft to operate until some other aircraft which is more economical but which has the same facilities and freight carrying capacity as the Fokker comes on to the market. One of the reasons I mention the freight carrying capacity is that during the wet the roads in these areas are often blocked altogether. Sometimes the railways lines are blocked. The only way of getting provisions into these areas is by aircraft. The Fokker has a freight carrying capacity which is useful on such occasions. TAA mentions that a subsidy is necessary. I do not think we should dismiss the idea of providing a subsidy in western Queensland. I am not quite sure what subsidy is necessary but some TAA people to whom I was speaking recently said that they would probably need about a $3m subsidy a year to keep providing the service in western Queensland. Let us accept that it is $3m or even let us accept it may go up to $5m. I would like to mention just two areas where subsidies are paid in Australia to provide people with transport, not necessarily air transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed in the explanatory notes we had in our consideration of the estimates for the Department of Transport this year that the estimate for providing an air fare subsidy for travel on routes between Melbourne and Tasmania is $5m. In other words, the Australian Government will provide a subsidy of $5m to keep air travel between Melbourne and Tasmania on a proper basis. Even if we were to have a $5m subsidy for western Queensland it would not be unique. Coming closer to home I do notice that here in the Australian Capital Territory ACTION buses, the A.C.T. Internal Omnibus Network as it is properly called, had a loss of $11.7m on its operations in 1980-81. If ACTION buses had a loss of that amount it means that we as taxpayers through the Australian Government are paying a subsidy to the people of Canberra for ACTION buses to the tune of $11.7m-over twice as much as would be required for the subsidy for the western Queensland area network. I notice that the estimate for 1981-82 in the Appropriation Bill that was before us here this afternoon was put at $12.2m, so things are not getting any better here in Canberra. We are still paying out this money by way of subsidy so that the people of Canberra can have a bus service. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just mentioned these two areas. I do not say that there is anything wrong with either of these two areas. I am not quite sure of the amount of loss that you are referring to but within a reasonable level I do not see that there is any real reason to be upset about subsidising public transport. I must admit it seems a little high to me to have a $12m loss here in Canberra, but there may be reasons for it. There are many areas of public transport that do not have a profit-in other words, they run at a loss-and governments provide subsidies so that people are able to use those services rather than have to use other services such as a motor vehicle, for instance, in Canberra or the major cities. If we accept the fact that we are going to pay subsidies like this why do we not provide subsidies for an air service of the type that is required in western Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I acknowledge the fact that the aircraft that are being used are probably coming to the end of their economical life. I am told, and other people would be more aware of this than I am, that there are aircraft coming off which would be able to replace the Fokker and which would be far more efficient than the Fokker. I acknowledge that some of the routes in western Queensland do not provide the passengers with a full service that some of the airlines would like to have. But acknowledging all those things I do believe that the people in western Queensland have a case for asking for some sort of assistance to allow TAA to keep its operations going in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> When the meeting that I referred to earlier in my speech was on the Minister for Transport was in Longreach and he was presented with a number of submissions from organisations in Longreach asking him to keep this air service operational. The people in Longreach, of course, were interested in their particular area but there are all these other areas that I have mentioned as well that deserve to have the air service continued. I was rather encouraged by one of the comments made by the Minister at that meeting. He said that he lent towards the idea of providing a subsidy. He could see the merit in it but he said he would have to take it back and convince his Cabinet colleagues so that the money could be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would like to mention tonight is that the people in western Queensland do have a case. Subsidies are being paid in other areas for public transport. Subsidies are being paid for air transport. If the Minister for Transport is convinced that a subsidy may be the way out, then I would certainly support him so that he can take that case to his Cabinet colleagues and see whether the money is available. I am sure that most of the representatives from Queensland would support him. </PARA>

Whilst the honourable senator was probably a little facetious in his remarks I was quite genuine in my remarks and I think it is important that the Minister should get support from both sides because if he does not receive support from both sides-supposing he heard some remarks from this side which were disparaging towards this idea of a subsidy-he might have less cause to fight for the case as hard as he normally would. I think it is important that we have a bipartisan attitude on this sort of question because these people definitely deserve the air services and the subsidy to which I have referred.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 4 June 1981 the Government announced the Guidelines for the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission for the 1982-84 triennium and asked the Commission to recommend the detailed distribution of grants. On 24 September, I tabled Volume 2 of the Commission's Report, which responded to the Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the allocation of funds following Government approval of the financial recommendations put forward by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission in respect of State institutions, although some funds yet to be allocated for 1983 and 1984 will be included in subsequent annual amendments. The grants are for recurrent expenditure by universities and colleges of advanced education for the 1982-84 triennium, and 1982 expenditure for Technical and Further Education and for capital and equipment expenditure in universities and colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> Amounts expressed in the Bill for the 1982-84 triennium reflect new cost adjustment procedures adopted by the Government whereby, from the beginning of 1982, a prospective allowance is made for cost increases. Grants for 1983 and 1984 are expressed in the same terms, on the basis that each year they will be adjusted for further cost movements. The Bill also amends the existing legislation for the 1979-81 triennium to provide for cost adjustments in respect of the existing tertiary education program. </PARA>
<PARA> Before describing the detailed provisions of this Bill, I should like to set the Government's funding decisions in context. Notwithstanding our overriding objective to contain public expenditure as an integral part of the Government's economic strategy, there has been a small increase in real terms in the sums made available in 1982 for tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the total funds provided for tertiary education there has been a reallocation of resources between the sectors. In real terms, while total expenditure in higher education has been slightly reduced by 0.4 per cent, funds for TAFE have been increased by 6 per cent. The additional funding provided for TAFE reflects the high priority which the Government accords to TAFE where enrolments are rising substantially and where important initiatives are being undertaken in relation to transition programs. The Bill provides for the continuation of a substantial TAFE capital program. In total 72 projects will be under construction in 1982 at 58 locations. Of these projects 35 will require a Commonwealth contribution in excess of $5m. In 1982 the Commonwealth Government will provide more than $112m for TAFE capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also continued to provide priority for higher education in the context of its overall budget strategy notwithstanding that enrolment levels have stabilised. In this context, the Government has noted the concern expressed by the Commission on the declining proportion of young people who are proceeding to higher education. The Government will be asking the Commission to undertake a more detailed study of this decline against the background of the enrolment patterns and prospects for tertiary education as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted that the planning ranges originally proposed by the Commission earlier this year for enrolment levels for universities and CAEs, for the 1982-84 triennium, should be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides funding consistent with the decisions taken by the Government for the rationalisation and consolidation of resources in higher education. The Commonwealth is firmly convinved that its policy of consolidation will not only improve the efficiency of institions and enable them to be more responsive to community demand; it will also improve the quality of education provided for students. Its program of consolidation was initiated following advice from the Commission, and the Government will continue to look to the Commission, in consultation with the States and institutions concerned, for advice on the consolidation and rationalisation of tertiary education. I am pleased to inform the Senate that of the thirty colleges of advanced education identified for rationalisation, at this stage acceptable arrangements have been received for all but seven. I pay tribute to the way in which State Governments have co-operated with the Commonwealth over the consolidation of institutions. In Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, all of the consolidation proposals made by the Commonwealth have been agreed to by the States and action is in train in respect of the consolidations. Some particular issues in New South Wales and Victoria remain to be resolved, and I look forward to further consultations with these States on the oustanding issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, funds for 1982 for those colleges of advanced education in New South Wales and Vicotira, for which acceptable consolidation arrangements have not yet been received, have been included in the legislation in a national unallocated reserve. Should acceptable consolidation arrangements be reached before the end of the year, the Minister, after advice from the Commission, will be able to allocate amounts from this reserve to the newly consolidated institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of the Government's decisions on rationalisation, the Commonwealth will continue funding for the Wollongong Institute of Education and Newcastle, Armidale and Townsville Colleges of Advanced Education only if they merge with the Universities of Wollongong, Newcastle, New England and James Cook University of North Queensland respectively. Allocations for Wollongong, Newcastle and New England universities for 1982 have been included in the Bill on the basis that amalgamations with the respective colleges will proceed. In order to ensure the maintenance of the two streams of tertiary education in these universities however, the minimum amounts required for teaching purposes in advanced education, as recommended by the Commission, have been earmarked in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education where acceptable arrangements for amalagmation have been developed, funds for 1982, 1983 and 1984 have also been appropriated in the Bill. For the other three universities and the related colleges where suitable amalgamation arrangements are yet to be proposed, grants have not been appropriated for 1983 and 1984. These will be provided in a subsequent legislative amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Should suitable arrangements not be worked out by the end of 1981, it will be possible for those funds presently allocated to the three New South Wales universities for 1982 in respect of advanced education to be transferred to the national unallocated reserve. In those circumstances, the legislation would enable funding for the three universities and the related colleges to continue for 1982 only. Funds for 1983 and 1984 will have to be the subject of further legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would be able to make similar funding arrangements in respect of the other outstanding colleges listed for amalgamation to which I refrred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill incorporates the funding recommendations for individual institutions and projects as recommended by the Commission. In some States not all of the funds available for advanced education have yet been allocated to particular colleges and the Bill provides that this can be done at the request of the States concerned. In accordance with the Commission's recommendations, provision will also be made to permit these funds to be transferred between years. These funds should provide added flexibility which will assist with the consolidation and rationalisation of higher education institutions that is already proceeding in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the limted reintroduction of tuition fees from 1982. The Bill specifically excludes the charging of tuition fees for students undertaking courses leading to first awards. It also exempts students who commenced second degree or diploma courses before 1982 from paying fees for those courses, and it sets a maximum fee, that is for full-time students, of $1,000 per annum. Subject to these principles, the Bill contains a provision for the Minister to make determinations as to the circumstances in which students are either required to pay tuition fees or are to be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to various exemptions, to be covered by the determinations, students who have already gained a diploma or a degree, who enrol in a university or an advanced education course, will be required to pay tuition fees. Exemptions from tuition fees will apply, for example, where higher degree students are in receipt of Commonwealth awards or awards of at least $3,500 per annum from universities, colleges of advanced education and State Governments. The States and institutions have been consulted on the detailed arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will contain as a condition of recurrent grants that institutions charge fees in accordance with these arrangements and that they do not charge fees in other circumstances. The Bill provides for recurrent grants scheduled in the Bill to be offset by an amount equivalent to the money from fees which those institutions will be required to charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National University Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill, which are also being introduced at this time, contain provisions for the reintroduction of tuition fees in the same terms as this Bill, except where particular requirements necessitate differences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered the Commission's recommendation that the arrangements for the disapproval of new teaching developments should be extended to cover such developments regardless of the source of funds. It does not propose to legislate in the way recommended by the Commission but will ask the Commission to continue to monitor new teaching developments and to bring to its attention any examples of proposed new teaching developments funded from other sources which in the Commission's view are not in the best interests of the balanced development of tertiary education in Australia. I will also seek the co-operation of State Governments and institutions in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's election undertakings the Bill contains a specific allocation of $16m over the triennium for research centres of excellence, and $0.9m in each year of the triennium for the development of community language courses in universities and colleges of advanced education. The allocation of funds to particular universities and colleges of advanced education for the development of community language courses will be approved by the minister after taking account of the views of the Commission and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Similarly detailed allocations for the research centres of excellence will be announced after the Government has considered the recommendations of the special committee established to provide advice on the implementation of this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides an increased level of support for those non-government teachers colleges in the States which, until now, have been in receipt of partial recurrent funding. The two institutions included in the Bill, McAuley College in Queensland and Avondale College in New South Wales (together with Signadou College in the Australian Capital Territory), are not recognised as colleges of advanced education. The Government's decision to increase the level of support for these institutions is consistent with its view that freedom of choice in primary and secondary education is dependent upon the preparation of teachers with a special commitment to teach in non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides financial assistance to the Northern Territory for advanced education purposes. Following an inquiry into the proposal to establish a university in the Northern Territory the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission recommended that an external studies centre be established at the Darwin Community College, and that subject to the agreement of the Australian National University, the North Australia Research Unit of that institution be given the capacity to co-ordinate research directly related to the needs of the Territory. The establishment of an external studies centre is currently under discussion, but funds for the proposed centre have been included in the legislation in the national unallocated reserve. Provision for the North Australia Research Unit of the Australian National University will be included in the annual appropriations of my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of additional financial provision from 1983 for superannuation for staff in universities and colleges of advanced education, which was recommended by the Commission, is under separate consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Bill provides evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to the development of tertiary education in Australia. Some particular parts of the tertiary education sectors have faced, and will continue to face, the need for substantial readjustment. This is required if valuable resources are to be allocated to the most urgent priorities. All Governments would like to increase spending on education-it is an investment in the future of Australia. Resources, however, are not unlimited, and the Government's decisions are both reasonable and responsible. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1981</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the limited re-introduction of tuition fees at the Australian National University. In addition to this primary purpose, the Bill provides for two other amendments to the University Act, requested by the University, concerned with aspects of the administration of the University. These relate to the election of undergraduate and postgraduate representatives on the University Council, and the granting of status and exemptions in respect of courses at the University. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to its primary purpose, the same principles are involved in this Bill as in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill for the re-introduction of tuition fees. The three Bills are viewed as parallel legislation for this purpose and have been drafted in the same terms except where the particular requirements of the States Grants Act or the Acts of the two institutions necessitate differences. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is similar to the States Grants Bill in its provision which empowers the Minister to make determinations in the same terms and subject to the same general conditions, as that Bill. The same annual limit of $1,000 is set. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill differs from the States Grants Bill in that there is no specific provision for the adjustment of grants to take account of fees revenue collected. This power is not needed in either this Bill or the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the States Grants Bill places the obligation on the State, as a condition of grant, to ensure that fees are charged in respect of those students required to pay fees, in the case of this Bill this obligation is placed on the Council of the University. In order to give effect to this obligation, the Council is empowered to make a statute in line with the requirements of the Minister's determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to its primary purpose, the Australian National University Bill also contains two amendments to the Act requested by the University. Clause 3 is intended to clarify the distinction between undergraduate and postgraduate students for the purpose of the election of representatives to the University Council. The Act provides for undergraduate students having two representatives on the Council and other students having one representative. Clause 4 broadens the power of the University to grant status or to grant awards to persons who have undertaken studies in other institutions. At present this power is restricted to students from other universities so that the position of colleges of advanced education, for example, is not recognised in the Act. Clause 4 similarly includes a power for the University Council to grant exemptions in respect of particular courses. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is intended to provide for the limited re-introduction of tuition fees at the Canberra College of Advanced Education and is a companion measure to the Bill to amend the Australian National University Act and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The same principles are involved in this Bill as in the Australian National University Bill and the provisions of the Bill relating to the re-introduction of tuition fees are in the same terms. There are no additional matters covered by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the Minister to make determinations in connection with tuition fees on the same basis as with the University Bill and there is a similar obligation for the College Council to ensure that each student liable to pay tuition fees does so. The same annual limit of $1,000 is set. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In speaking to the defence equipment statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) this week I say at the outset that this is one of the most important statements, if not the most important statement, presented to this Parliament in the three-odd years I have served in this chamber. I think the people of Australia owe a great debt to the Government for bringing down this statement. In particular, they owe a great debt to the Minister for Defence for the way he has handled this program with great care and great circumspection. Above all, the people of Australia owe a great debt to the evaluation team of the Department of Defence-the servicemen and civilians who worked for a period, in aggregate, of over 10 years in preparing the submission accepted by Cabinet this week. I also thank the Australian Democrats for their support of the statement when it was brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A major part of the Minister's defence statement dealt with the selection of the new tactical fighter. This is a matter of fundamental importance to the defence of Australia. We spend a great deal of time in this parliament discussing internal matters, such as welfare programs and various administrative and legislative matters for the benefit of the community, and they are very important matters for us to spend our time on. But, over and above everything else, the defence of the nation is the primary responsibility of the government of the day. We have to maintain the security of this country. It is in that context that the defence statement must be considered. The importance of this statement is not just in terms of the aircraft selected but it will form a fundamental part of the defence of this nation insofar as the choice of that aircraft, which will be one of the main armaments of the Royal Australian Air Force for the next 25 to 30 years, will dictate the nature of the response we can make to threats to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious thing that this aircraft will do, as a fighter, is give us control of air space. It is axiomatic that if we do not control air space we cannot move on the land underneath it. That is very important to a large mass like Australia. However, the most important aspect of the new tactical fighter lies in the capacity it gives Australia to deter any aggressors. In that sense the strike capacity of the aircraft, which was the second string to the RAAF requirement, is in many ways the more important component of the two. In defence debates a lot of time is spent talking about strategic concepts. Indeed, when the Mininster's Defence statement was made, the Opposition spent quite a while discussing the lack of strategic concepts. It simply is not possible to define in specific terms what the threat to Australia will be. As General Sir John Hackett said in a statement earlier this year, 'once you define a scenario you always can come up with a theoretical counter to it as to why no move should be made along those lines'. The defence of Australia does not turn on being able to define precisely the nature of the threat. It is a matter of a general review as to what is the most likely risk that can befall us and of taking a broad approach to counter that threat. In very general terms, the threat to Australia from any aggessor comes either through the land bridge from Asia or through the sea. Therefore, the strike capacity of this new tactical figher is very important as a deterrent to any movement through the land bridge or in the maritime role. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I spoke on two occasions in considerable detail on the characteristics of the two contenders for the new tactical figher force. With respect to Australia's needs-I emphasise, specifically with respect to Australia's needs-I indicated that in my judgement the F18 aircraft was the better of the two. The General Dynamics product, the F16, is a very good aircraft, if slightly dated in some ways. But in my judgment and in the judgment of the Cabinet and the selection committee it is not the optimum choice for the specific needs of Australia. I can see that it is a very useful aircraft for some of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, such as Denmark, for Taiwan and for the United States Air Force in an entirely different way, where it is part of a very large inventory. The characteristics of the F16 are that it was designed to be the simplest type of high technology dog-fighter to counter threats that existed during the Vietnam war. It is equipped only with the infrared AIM9L or AM9 missiles, which are a very short range dog-fighting weapon with a killing range of about five nautical miles. The whole design parameter is built around this concept. That means that its radar range is quite short; it only has to have a range to acquire its targets out to about 30 nautical miles to cope with the envelope of about five nautical miles for the missile it is fitted with. Above all, its basic design parameter was to be part of what has become known as the high-low-mix-the low threat in a situation where the high threat is taken are of by far more sophisticated equipment. In the case of the United States Air Force it is taken care of by the F15, which is the ultimate air superiority fighter that it has. In other words, this fighter was never meant to stand alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I listed the defects in the aircraft as I saw them. I say again that we are not talking here simply about an aircraft; we are talking about a weapons system. It is true that a modern fighter has to have certain characteristics of performance with respect of its airframe and engines. It has to have range and manoeuvrability. It has to be able to carry certain stores and weapons. But it has to be seen as an integral weapons system with a navigational system, a target acquisition system, a missile guidance system and the ability to interface electronically with the missiles that it is carrying. That is very different from just looking at a simple airframe and engine combination. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems that I saw with the F16 were related principally to its target acquisition and missile guidance system. The radar fit was quite a short range system, as I mentioned before. It had not programmable signal processor with it; it is a hard-wired system. Basically modern radar systems rely on having a powerful enough set to get a signal out and a good return back and then having an on-board computer so that that signal can be processed through various modes and programs to extract the information wanted. That was not possible with the old F16 system. There were great difficulties in improving that system. The physical restraints of the size of the cross-section of the nose of the F16 dictate that it has a very small antenna size. I pointed out that the power output through a radar antenna depends very much on the diameter. A 10 per cent increase in diameter is equivalent to a 46 per cent increase in systems power. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem of the F16 is the fact that it is a single-engined aircraft and the engine it has is a particularly unreliable one in service. Let me say that it is a very high technology engine. It is built to the limits of current technology. But, because of that, it is a bit overpeaked and it suffers from a reliability point of view, which has been reflected in the loss rate for the F16 in service, which has been paralleled by an in-flight engine failure in the twin engine installation in the F15s. It is a high by-pass ratio engine which puts it towards the civil type airliner engines, which gives it a very low specific fuel consumption on the cruise. However, this means that it has poor acceleration characteristics and when it does go on to full power, particularly in the afterburner mode, it uses a great deal of fuel. So, in that situation, range is compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very expensive engine to build and it roughly costs twice the price of one of the 404 engines in the F18. It is also a very expensive engine to overhaul for the mandatory replacement of certain parts. It has a problem on throttle response, particularly in the top left-hand corner of the flight envelope at high altitudes and low air-speeds. When it goes from either a moderate power setting or an in-flight idle power setting to 100 per cent power or afterburner power it has had a regrettable tendency to compressor stall, which is undesirable in a combat aircraft. The result of these problems with the F100 have led to a high attrition rate with the aircraft, which is very significant for a country like Australia which wants to run a long fleet life out of an aircraft. The production line, presumably, will close down half way through the life that we want from those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The F16 has the reputation of being a very manoeuvreable aircraft. It is said to be a great dog-fighting aircraft but that is not technically true when one looks at its flight envelope. It is a very manoeuvreable aircraft in the low altitude mode, between 20,000 feet or 10,000 feet. But the type of fighting we envisage doing in the Pacific area is not carried out at those low altitudes but rather at the top end of the altitude spectrum. It has a control problem in that it has a limitation on its angle attack. In other words, the relative air flow is limited by the flight control system to somewhere around 22 degree to 27 degrees. That is a limitation in a fighting aircraft, particularly when one gets up towards its ceiling. If one is dog-fighting there and cannot go into all angles of attack, the altitudes that that aircraft can be put in are severely compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those factors that I have mentioned have come to pass and led to what was known as MSIP-the Multinational Staged Improvement Program-by General Dynamics to overcome shortcomings that I have listed. It was on that basis that the modified F16, the F16C, was presented to the Royal Australian Air Force. THe MSIP seeks to overcome all of these problems. The essential point is that it will be 1985 before that program is fully flight-tested, evaluated and placed on the production line. There are problems with this. I do not doubt that Westinghouse will get to an acceptable level of development with its new radar, but there are no guarantees on that. It may slip on the way. When it will get there and at what cost is quite impossible estimate at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The design concept of the F18 was quite different. The time when it was designed was also quite different: It was a generation later. When we are talking about electronic developments today, time is absolutely crucial. The design concept of the F18 was to provide in the one aircraft an air-to-air and an air-to-surface capability with a one-man crew. There have been many fighters and many fighter bombers in air force service around the world, but all of those aircraft have either started out as fighters, which had the capacity later to be modified for the fighter-bomber role, as did the Mustang, or conversely with the Mosquito which started out as bombers and had the capacity to be modified to the fighter role as was the Mosquito. The F18 is the first aircraft that right from the drawing board was designed to perform both roles without compromise. It was also set out to be very maintainable, with low costs both on man hours and on equipment and with a very high degree of reliability. That was partly a consequence of it being designed for aircraft carrier operations for the United States Navy, because one simply cannot carry out the maintenance at sea that one can on land. It has a very high corrosion resistance and a very high degree of reliability in both the airframe and the engines. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is it a twin-engined design but it also has two extremely reliable engines in it. They are the General Electric F404 engines. The design philosophy there adopted by General Electric was to set out to design something 5 per cent or 6 per cent below theoretically obtainable limits so that there was always a conservative margin left. It is an engine that has performed exceptionally well in service from a reliability point of view. It has also performed extremely well in the air. The engine can come right back to in-flight idle, go on to 100 per cent power with afterburners, close it down and keep moving the throttle as fast as one can with complete response every time without any compressor stall or any problems at all. It also has a low by-pass ratio engine with respect to the F100. That means that it accelerates very quickly and decelerates also very quickly. Those are two properties which are very important in a fighter. This gives the F18 the fastest acceleration of any aircraft presently flying. It similarly gives it the fastest deceleration. It is faster than the F15 until it gets right out towards the ultimate end of the speed range. The F18 has gone through its flight test program with no more problems than are normal with an aircraft of that type. The problems that did exist have by now been modified and corrected and the whole of the flight envelope has been explored. </PARA>
<PARA> In general layman's terms, what is good about the F18? First of all, it is a very well engineered aircraft, as one would expect from McDonnell. It has two reliable engines. It is a very manoeuverable aircraft and it is probably more agile than anything else in the top half of the flight envilope in excess of 20,000 feet. That is where we will be fighting when we use this aircraft in the air superiority role in the Pacific theatre. Quite simply, it has the best cockpit layout of any aircraft in the world. McDonnell has done an enormous amount of ergonometric work, simplifying all the systems and the control layout and coming up with a cockpit which is better than that in any other aircraft flying today. It has a head-up display system where all the essential parameters are projected on the pilot's windscreen. The symbology of this is far more advanced than anything else available. </PARA>
<PARA> It has the hands-on stick and throttle system where all the controls that are required to fly the aircraft to acquire the targets, and to launch the missiles are on either the left hand side or the right hand side of the pilot on either the throttle or the control stick. As I mentioned, the aircraft is optimised for both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles. It has a fully digital electronic system. Most importantly, it has an effective ESM and ECM electronic counter measures suite aboard. There is no ECM capacity on the F16. If an ECM capacity is required on the F16 it is added in the form of pods-the ALQ131 pod or one of the other American systems. This is a great defect because any offensive situation will be contested and it really is an electronic war. We must have an ability to be able to detect radar signals, to analyse them to determine whether they are friendly or unfriendly, to find out whether they are tracking or guidance, to locate the source and to apply counter measures, either by a jamming or a decoy, within a fraction of a second; otherwise that aircraft will be lost to an enemy missile. An ECM capacity should be built into an aircraft at the drawing board stage. From an electronic counter measures point of view, the F18 is a top state of the art aircraft. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would be the Foxbat. The radar of the F18 is the top radar in existence today. It can be outranged by the radar of the F15 and the F14, but the modes and the facilities that are built into this radar exceed the capacities in anything else flying. In fact, the F15 has been modified to accept the modes that are in the F18. Most importantly, from our point of view, it has a very good air-to-surface capacity-both air-to-land and air-to-sea. We have a great interest in having a maritime capacity in this aircraft. It comes qualified with all the ordnance in the United States Navy inventory, except the Phoenix missile, which is the missile carried by the F14. It has a range in excess of 100 nautical miles. Also it has a cost which is probably in excess of $1m for the one missile. It comes with the AIM-9Ls, the AIM-7Ms, the Sparrows, the Harm, which is an anti-radiation missile for taking out radar sites, the AGM-84A, the Harpoon and the GBUs. This is a very important difference between that aircraft and the F16. The F16 will carry all these weapons on its store stations on the wing, but that is not what it is about. One can bolt a 44-gallon fuel drum on to these wing stations and fly with them. The big difficulty is the electronic interfacing and the guidance between the target acquisition systems on the parent aircraft and the missile. That is where the millions of dollars in proving are involved. This is where the F18 has a great advantage, particularly in respect of the Harpoon, over the F16. It is fully qualified-flight tested to launch these missiles. It is also a very low maintenance aircraft which means, in peace time terms, that it will not cost us an arm and a leg to keep it flying. Of course, in a wartime situation that has a great force multiplier effect. In other words, this means that we can do the job with fewer aircraft than we could with an aircraft that was more manpower intensive. It has a complete suite of built-in test equipment so that the aircraft itself can monitor its own complex electronic systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now wish to answer all of the charges which were laid by the Opposition-by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, in another place and by Senator Evans, when they spoke after the statement was presented. I view some of the charges which they made as being quite serious. I have always tried, on the occasions when I have spoken on defence in this chamber, to treat it as a bipartisan issue and to follow the example set by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). I do not see defence in terms of party politics. We are all concerned about the welfare of this nation. The security of it is the most important part of that welfare. The part that I took exception to in Mr Hayden's speech was the very clear implication that the selection body that looked at and reported on the selection of this aircraft, in his eyes, was clearly inadequate, not to say incompetent. I will not accept that proposition at all. The team consisted of a large number of highly qualified people. Service people and civilians were involved. They have been working on this program for nearly five years. Not all of them members of the Royal Australian Air Force. Certainly, all were not pilots. There were engineers, scientists, mathematicians, analysts, systems analysts of all kinds and specialists in the various fields. Thirty-six men were involved in all. Twenty of them were from the Air Force and 16 were from the civilian component of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a considerable amount of support from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Central Studies Establishment. Indeed, the Central Studies Establishment worked quite independently of the team that was examining these two aircraft and made four major reports. I do not know what was in their reports. The material is confidential. Presumably it supported the decision of the main selection body. I think it is very wrong for the Leader of the Opposition to attack the integrity of the evaluation team. What the team did will become a model for the evaluation of other aircraft by other air forces around the world. The team made its evaluation on the most thorough grounds possible. It was made impartially. Members of the team exhaustively considered every detail. They analysed all the information that was before them and they made endless model studies of attrition rates, serviceability and went through all the possible costing parameters. </PARA>
<PARA> If the reports in the Press are to be believed, the team overwhelmingly favoured the F18. I think the charge that Mr Hayden made that the Minister did not back up in detail how the decision was arrived at can be simply explained in terms of the fact that a lot of the information that the selection board used was material that is regarded as commercially in confidence. It was material commercially sensitive to the interests of both manufacturers, material which they made available to the Government of Australia on the clear understanding that it was for the information of the Government and was not to become a matter of public moment. </PARA>
<PARA> After attacking the integrity of the selection team, the central charge of the Australian Labor Party turned on the matter of cost. I regret to say that Mr Hayden fails to recognise that when one compares things one has to compare like with like. The Minister made the claim that there was a 7 per cent differential between the two competitors on the prices offered to the Australian Government. That figure accords with the figure presented to the Canadian Government in April last year when the same two aircraft were before the Canadian Government for consideration. Both of these aircraft were offered to the Australian Government by the United States Government in a standard foreign military sales contract with fixed price incentive clauses-that is, both a target price and a ceiling price were nominated by both manufacturers. Below the target price the contractor makes an agreed profit. Between the target and the ceiling price the contractor shares the cost with the Government. Above the ceiling price the contractor makes no profit at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to make an appeal to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to ensure that the Australian Government will use any powers it possesses to smash the National Front which is trying to capitalise on the economic distress in various parts of Australia, particularly in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. It is trying to divide people on the basis of colour or creed. I think we can all learn lessons from abroad. There is no doubt that some of the problems the Thatcher Government has encountered with race relations developed when the National Front in Britain was allowed, under the guise of free speech, to prostitute that principle. I do not want to see that happen in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think my party has always expressed reservations in relation to the annual immigration intake. When a set number is applied and people come to Australia as permanent residents we will not condone people trying to divide other people on matters of colour or origin. That is the whole theme of this National Front. It is true that in the area concerned there is a very high teenage population and job opportunities are extremely limited. But those matters are not solved when people resort to the law of the jungle. As to the responsibilities of the Federal Government, I know that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Ian Macphee, has already written to Cameron, the No. 1 man in this National Front, making disparaging remarks about his views and pointing out what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also that Bishop Bede Heather, a Catholic churchman in the area, has also expressed concern in relation to what can happen. Whilst there might be a media bonanza for a couple of days, if riots occur and people are attacked because of racial characteristics and all the rest of it, a scar is left on those teenagers involved. Many of those people will carry perpetual feelings of animosity to other people who make up the components of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity in a very minor way to peruse a report prepared by Commissioner Walker, who is certainly not a friend of mine, in relation to a dispute in the New South Wales railways system in an area in which the work was arduous. There was a question of favouritism or otherwise. In that case racial rivalries were found. In a broader ambit, I make an appeal to the Australian Government not to be namby-pamby about it. I know some people argue that civil liberties are sacrosanct. They are to a point but that should not mean that licence takes over from liberty. I know the views of the Minister for Immigraton and Ethnic Affairs and I know the attitude of the New South Wales Minister responsible for police, Peter Anderson. They certainly will not tolerate this sort of loutism combined with racism. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to direct my remarks particularly to this individual called the Skull who was featured in the Sydney Press tonight. He has been around a long while. In the days of the anti-apartheid demonstrations in Sydney and at the earlier Springbok tour he got his kicks molesting women demonstrators. That was one of his general ideas. I know of another incident subsequently in the famous election rally of 1972 which led to the election of the Whitlam Government. He was there that night. To the credit of the New South Wales Special Branch he was moved away swiftly. Whilst I have complete confidence that the Wran Government through the police will not have any qualms about grabbing hold of him and his friends and dealing with them as harshly as the law permits, the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that because if we looked back to the 1930s we would see that we had one blot on our record. I refer to the race riots in Kalgoorlie in the 1930s. Surely we have learnt lessons about it. I go so far as to say that the provisions of the Crimes Act should be used. I say that being fully aware that that view can be distorted. The fact of the matter is that this Government from time to time has had recourse to proscribing organisations. If the principle is there it should be applied to blot out this neo-fascism. There is no question about that. It should be nipped in the bud. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition have had a lot of irritation. We have expressed and we will continue to express concern about the limited job opportunities among teenagers. We all know that the solution to the problem is not to accuse anyone else and deem them to be a rival regardless of whether they are born in Australia or overseas, whether they have different religions or whether they have different facial characteristics. These are things that have to be stamped out very quickly. I make a very strong appeal that the Commonwealth Attorney-General will use any Federal laws, if necessary, to harass this group and drive them into the ground. The National Front represents the dregs of society. When I look at this photograph of the Skull I think I have seen him around Sydney a lot. </PARA>

Men like him have to be harassed all the time. The police should make their life a misery. I have no pity at all for those people. We should drive them into the ground in every way. I repeat that I know the New South Wales Government will play its part. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, has already gone on record as damning these people. Prevention is better than cure. I will leave the matter to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I spoke to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) before he left Australia. I hope the Acting Attorney-General will have a very close look at the law to see whether this organisation can be smashed and harassed. We could look to see whether the Skull pays any tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about smashing the Government-figuratively that is-in relation to three matters of concern to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, although I do not blame him personally in that they are matters which relate to Ministers he represents in the Senate. One is a matter of a totally unsatisfactorily answered question and the other two matters relate to other unanswered questions. The Senate may recall that in mid-August there was a dispute involving the Australian Broadcasting Commission and broadcasting engineering officers. This occurred on the weekend of 14 and 15 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government required the ABC to implement stand-downs under the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act supposedly of those who could not be gainfully employed because of the ABC being off the air. In fact, the full crew of 24 in Hobart were stood down supposedly because they could not be gainfully employed. In actual fact the only difference in their duties because of the ABC being off the air on that Sunday night was not putting to air a brief news bulletin. Apart from that, they would have been fully and gainfully employed on normal duties involving the preparation of taped program material for the coming week, maintenance and all sorts of other parts of their normal duties. As I understand it the management in Hobart was quite willing to have them continue in their normal duties and did not accept that they came under the CE(EP) Act as being unable to be gainfully employed. Yet there was insistence from those at the top; whether it was from within the ABC or whether it was the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) I do not know.</PARA>
<PARA> I asked for an explanation at the time-this is two months ago-of those stand-downs. I suggested that the Government was not being honest about the matter and in fact wanted to lock out all the other employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission because of the broadcast engineering officers dispute. After two reminders to the Minister, I finally received a reply last week that, in my view, was totally inadequate. The reply from Senator Baume, on behalf of the Minister for Communications, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Full consideration was given by responsible senior officers in the ABC as to the staff whose work was affected by the BEO's strike. I am advised that, as a result, only those who could not be usefully employed were stood down. </PARA>
<PARA>I would particularly point out the phrase 'I am advised that'. I suspect that that is the Minister trying to avoid responsibility for the information in that, as I have said, it is quite clear--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister require a withdrawal from me? I am not sure whether I actually used the word 'lie'. If I said anything contrary to the Standing Orders, I withdraw. I was trying to show that the staff involved could have been gainfully employed-would have been gainfully employed-and it is wrong to suggest that only those who could not be usefully employed were stood down. They were all stood down en masse at the Government's instructions. I think it is wrong that that sort of answer is given to a question when there is a genuine inquiry about the method of communication between the Government and the ABC management in New South Wales and the other States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other two matters I want to refer to quickly concern unanswered questions. I refer to Question No. 998 and Question No. 1000 to Senator Baume representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). They were initially asked on 18 August. I know that that is only two months ago and that there are many questions on the Notice Paper dating back to the beginning of the year, if not to last year. The point about these two questions is that I believe there is no reason why the information could not have been provided to me by now. I think it is regrettable, to say the least, that it has not happened. Question No. 998 refers to the Government's plans for the Perpetual Trustees building in Hobart, which was bought by the Whitlam Government and which in recent times has been left unoccupied and without attention. I want to find out what the Government's plans are for this building. Will it renovate it or sell it? What will it do with it. The fact is that in recent weeks scaffolding has gone up around that building, so obviously something is happening there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, I have not been told. Obviously some plan has been decided on and some work is proceeding on the building. For all I know it could be being demolished, which would be the greatest crime that the Government could commit against that part of the streetscape in Hobart, which is a valuable historic intersection. In view of the fact that something is happening at that site, I think there should have been an answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No. 1000 refers to the Government's staffing plans at the Commonwealth Government Centre in Hobart. I believe that the night security staff were informed by the Department of Administrative Services last week that they were likely to receive retrenchment notices by the end of the year. I do not know the exact details, but they were given some information about their future in view of all the rumours. Senator Mulvihill referred to this sort of matter in relation to the Commonwealth Government Centre in Sydney on Tuesday night. When I heard about this meeting I thought, obviously, that the Government had come to a conclusion about its plans and I was upset that I had not received an answer to the question in view of the fact that, clearly, the Government had come to some finality about the matter. On reflection, I thought that, fair enough, the staff involved should have heard first and not through some news item or an answer to me. However, I thought there should have been an answer within a few days of when the staff were informed in view of the fact that the question was straight forward. I would have thought that the Minister for Administrative Services could have provided an answer to that question as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise those three matters and express my annoyance at the way in which the ABC question was answered, totally inadequately, and in regard to the other two questions which should have been able to be answered but which have not been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree on the face of it that they have been there since 18 August. I will make that known to him. Senator Mulvihill raised an issue of some importance; that is, the activities of an extremist organisation in, particularly, the western suburbs of Sydney, according to recent newspaper reports. He drew attention to two of the people whose names have been associated with the activities of that organisation. Like Senator Mulvihill, I have had the doubtful fortune of seeing the gentleman known as 'The Skull' at various meetings and have seen some of his behaviour. I have seen some of the reports of his appearances in court on different charges. That is how I knew he was an invalid pensioner; he is so described in his various court appearances. I will certainly pass on Senator Mulvihill's concern. However, I point out that the practice of totalitarianism in the defence of democracy is scarcely a defence of democracy, so that whilst Senator Mulvihill has called for stern action against these gentlemen I take it that that would not extend to putting them behind bars, as Senator Mulvihill hopes they might be by next Tuesday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 June 1981 (Hansard, pages 3192-3) Senator Grimes asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice, concerning services in Victorian hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The print media in Victoria has suggested that the Victorian Health Commission is looking closely at possible ways in which the services and facilities provided by private hospitals can be effectively used along with public hospital facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of detailed consideration by the Government of the recommendations of the Jamison inquiry the Government decided to introduce new health funding arrangements. The Jamison inquiry highlighted the fact that there is considerable waste, inefficiency and duplication in the States' hospital systems. The new arrangements will provide State Governments with positive incentives to manage the total supply of hospital services, both public and private within their borders and to seek to remove any waste, inefficiency and duplication in their hospital systems. For Victoria this should 'free up' resources without lowering the present standard of health services in that State.</PARA>
<PARA> The new health funding arrangements are principally aimed at ensuring that State Governments take up their proper responsibilities for providing health services.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements the Commonwealth provides funding to the States for public hospitals, services previously funded under the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme through general revenue grants at the level of funding provided in 1980-81, plus 10 per cent, less a share of the revenue that the States can reasonably be expected to raise by the introduction of appropriate inpatient and outpatient charges from 1 September 1981 having regard to new health insurance arrangements which came into effect on that date.</PARA>
<PARA> With the revenue increase arising from increased charges, the States that implement the arrangements fully will have at their disposal increased resources in 1981-82 and there will be no requirements laid down by the Commonwealth as to the services to which these resources should be allocated.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements the Victorian Government has the responsibility to determine its own priorities in the delivery of health care and to allocate funds to individual hospitals in accordance with those priorities as it had under the hospital cost-sharing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter for the States to determine how they will administer their responsibilities and explore, if they wish to, co-operative ventures with hospitals in the private sector. Such arrangements have operated in the past in Victoria, when public patients have been admitted to a private hospital as an extension of the public hospital system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 September 1981 (Hansard, page 629) Senator Mulvihill asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. By way of preface, I refer to yesterday's declaration by the Australian Council of Trade Unions that greater attention should be paid by all governments, particularly this Government, to industrial safety. I remind the Senate that, during the last session, Senator Peter Baume said that an interdepartmental committee was determining whether industrial safety in the Commonwealth sphere would be the responsibility of the Minister for Science and Technology or the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the Minister whether any decision has been made. I would imagine that the Minister for Industrial Relations should be the one to look after industrial safety.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions decided that responsibility for industrial safety in the Commonwealth sphere would be transferred from the Department of Science and Technology to the Department of Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of this decision has been the subject of a review by the Public Service Board in consultation with the two Departments concerned and preliminary findings have been sent by the Board to the Department of Industrial Relations for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Once discussions have been held between the Department and the Board, the review will be finalised and the transfer of functions completed.</PARA>
