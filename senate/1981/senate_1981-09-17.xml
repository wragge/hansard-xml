<TITLE>Human Rights in Sri Lanka</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> When Imperial Britain left the shores of Ceylon, she introduced the Soulbury constitution in 1948 which handed over parliamentary power almost exclusively to the majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese leadership interpreted and implemented its political power by such acts as:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Disenfranchising nearly one million Tamils in 1948.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Declaring Sinhalese as the ONLY official language of the country in 1956. Thus disadvantaging the Tamil speaking population in employment, education and administrative matters.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Demanding Tamil children be educated in Sinhalese for employment in government sector.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Government sponsored colonisation of traditional Tamil districts, with the eventual objective of depriving Tamil representation of those areas in the legislative assembly. This has happened in areas where colonisation has taken place in the Eastern Province.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Discrimination against the development of Tamil areas by channelling the foreign assistance schemes almost entirely to develop Sinhalese districts. A study of the developmental projects utilising Australian aid would be revealing.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. A more important aspect of such discriminatory policies was the well planned and government encouraged attempts at the physical elimination of the Tamil people by acts of terrorism, plunder, rape and murder at regular intervals. Communal riots occurred in 1956; 1958; 1961; 1966; 1972; 1977; 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> During May and June 1981 the government security forces unleashed violence in the Tamil district of Jaffna, killing innocent people, set ablaze shops, homes and public library with historic Tamil documents, Tamil bookshops, newspaper offices and printery, presumably in an attempt to destroy Tamil identity and culture.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> Urge the Federal Government of Australia to raise the problem of human rights of the Tamils of Sri Lanka as a matter for consideration at the forthcoming conference of the Commonwealth Heads of Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the fact that it was revealed recently that the figure of $12m quoted by the Government spokesman in respect of the cost of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting does not include a number of items which should have been included, such as the total cost of the Queen's visit and the cost of transport between Melbourne and Canberra-two items which were specifically cited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer Senator Button's question to the relevant Minister. The costs must be viewed against the background that CHOGM will bring together in Australia some 41 or 42 heads of government in the world who represent something like one quarter or more of the nations of the world. I think it is a great tribute to Australia that the function should be held here. It is a very important function and will obviously be costly. The Australian community will, I think, be willing to accept that, for something which affects the well-being and the economic and political stability of peoples of one quarter of the world, the cost is well merited. It is our contribution towards international understanding and the improvement and the well-being of nations, particularly developing nations. Against that background I will endeavour to obtain further figures and inform Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and relates to the current strike by Overseas Telecommunications Commission employees. The strike has had a major impact on Australian importers and exporters, preventing them from sending messages overseas and severely restricting incoming messages. Firstly, has this industrial action restricted media services from overseas or have the bans been selective? Secondly, is there a conspiracy of silence concerning this strike which seems not to be reported in any of today's newspapers? Thirdly, is the Government aware of this industrial action and the impact it is having on Australian businesses involved overseas? Finally, what is the Government doing to relieve this burden on these industries?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="818" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of the industrial dispute within the OTC caused by bans which have been imposed by the Professional Radio and Electronics Institute of Australasia. We are also aware that the bans are now having operational effects on the services of the OTC. We are concerned. A conference, chaired by Public Service Arbitrator Watson, was held on 14 September, at which the OTC outlined details of the work bans and sought an order directing the PREI and its members to lift the bans and prohibiting them from applying the bans. I am sorry to have to report that the PREI representative indicated that his members would not comply with such an order if it were issued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Service Board has indicated that it is undertaking a pay survey in respect of the physical grades of technical staff and that a common date of effect for any increases would be offered as a result of the survey. This is in answer to the last part of the honourable senator's question about what is being done. The Public Service Arbitrator has called for a further conference on Thursday or Friday of this week, today or tomorrow. There is no prospect of settlement of the dispute while the bans remain in force, and the implications of the bans are under urgent and critical examination. The honourable senator asks specifically about whether the bans are selective and whether the Australian Press is applying some conspiracy of silence-I think those were the honourable senator's words-in relation to the dispute. I will have to refer those matters to my colleague and obtain information for the honourable senator. I would sincerely hope that the reporting of this dispute would be the normal reporting and that there would be no attempt to hide its effects from the Australian public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Acting Minister for Health. I refer to his statement made last night relating to the Government's mistake over the health insurance arrangements involving its agreement with the States and claims for pharmaceuticals in hospitals under sections 99 and 94 of the National Health Act. Was that statement a result of an actual attempt by a State or States to claim under both sections? If so, which State or States? What are the details of the claim or claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="819" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no mistake involved. I just remind the Senate of the situation: Before the hospital cost sharing agreements came into force in 1975, there was a mechanism which provided for this reimbursement. Between 1975 and 1 September this year there was a different agreement. Now that that agreement is no longer in place, it is necessary to revoke those former approvals. There has been no mistake. This is appropriate action being taken to protect against the possibility of double payment. The honourable senator asks me specifically whether any State has actually made a such claim and whether our action is a response to such a claim. I think that states the question correctly. To the best of my knowledge there has been no such claim by any State and the action that is being proposed is action to prevent any such claim being made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Acting Minister for Health: Is it a fact that over recent years we have spent a greatly increased proportion of our national income on health care without any perceptible improvement in the health of our community? Are doctors' fees for services a significant part of this health care cost explosion? Has the Minister seen reports that the Australian Medical Association has claimed to Dr Isaac, who is conducting an inquiry into medical fees, that the overheads of a medical practice have risen in the last eight years from 44 per cent to no less than 56 per cent of the gross income of the practice? Has the Government any independent evidence to support this extraordinary claim, bearing in mind that the overhead level claimed is almost twice as high as that claimed in Canada? Will the Minister see whether the Government can provide the inquiry with some realistic figures on this key issue in medical costs? Might not the result be that the charge for services might fairly come down instead of go up, to the great benefit of the community?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="819" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While it is correct to say that health costs have increased over recent qears, it is not correct to say that there has been no discernible improvement in health outcomes. It might be fair to say that there has not been as much improvement in health outcomes as we might have hoped, but I refer the honourable senator, for example, to the dramatic downturn in the incidence and outcomes of ischaemic heart disease-coronary disease-which have improved markedly. It is noted that the AMA's first submission to the 1981 medical fees inquiry makes reference to the fact that at 30 September 1976 the medical fee index for general practitioners contained a cost component of about 45 per cent and an income component of about 55 per cent. According to the AMA's most recent survey, which covers the year ending 30 June 1980, these components were then about 56 per cent cost and 44 per cent income. I point out that in its submissions to the medical fees inquiries the Government has levelled some criticisms at the quality and representativeness of the AMA survey data. To that extent I can confirm the point the honourable senator makes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of similar studies conducted in Canada and I am unable therefore to comment on any comparison between Australian and Canadian experience. However, I point out that there could be some fallacy in using percentage figures because if, for example, Canadian doctors had double the gross income of Australian doctors they might well have higher practice costs but the percentages might be different. Nor am I able to comment on the proposition that, given that Canadian doctors have a lower practice cost to gross income ratio, they are in any way better business managers. I think that was implicit in the honourable senator's question. Similarly, I am not aware of the taxation provisions which apply federally and provincially in Canada. I am unable to comment on whether it is more or less difficult to obtain taxation advantages in Canada than in Australia. However, if the honourable senator requires more information or if more information is available, I will certainly undertake to make it available to him.</PARA>

What contribution would the Commonwealth be called on to make and what input would the Commonwealth have as to the ultimate design or location if a dam were to be proceeded with?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the Tasmanian Government has announced that it proposes to put to a referendum some questions as to alternatives for proceeding with electric power generation in Tasmania-specifically, hydro-electric power. Whilst the Commonwealth Government has a keen general interest in the whole matter-an interest to ensure that the State itself has adequate and continuing electric power and an interest in general conservation-the matter is and must remain a Tasmanian Government one. I do not want to comment further at this moment. I shall be interested to follow the progress of the referendum, including the questions to be asked. Tasmania vitally needs electric power. The Commonwealth Government, of course, set up the Zeidler Committee to inquire into the possibilities of an electric power grid involving the four States in south-eastern Australia. That concept would involve at some stage in the future a cable under Bass Strait. My instinct is that in the longer term Tasmania would benefit from such a connection. To that extent the Commonwealth has a very real interest. We have an interest because the resources development of Australia cannot be pursued and full employment guaranteed to people unless power generation is at the optimum level. I shall follow the developments with very keen interest.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Acting Minister for Health, refers to the drug depo-provera which has been recently rejected by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee as not being suitable for use as a contraceptive on the grounds that there are 'unresolved questions relating to its safety for this indication'. Is the Minister aware of allegations that a medical practitioner in the Australian Capital Territory recently revealed in an Australian Broadcasting Commission talk-back program that he administers depo-provera to women for use as a contraceptive and overcomes the illegality of this practice by describing a different purpose for the drug? Can the Minister say whether there is any truth in this allegation and, if there is, what action he proposes to take against the offending doctor? Further, if the Minister finds that there is substance to the allegations, will he take steps to find out how widespread this abuse is and indicate what steps will be taken by the Department of Health to end a practice which is clearly counter to the best interests and good health of the female patients of the doctors engaged in the deception? Finally, does the Minister not agree that the apparent complacency with which some male doctors perpetrate such drug abuse on their female patients, when they are far more cautious with what they prescribe for their own sex, is a sorry indictment of those members of the profession participating in the practice?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not aware of the allegations. They have not been drawn to my attention. I regard them as significant allegations. I will undertake to find out what I can about them. I do not know of any medical practitioner in the Australian Capital Territory who has set out to circumvent regulations in the way the honourable senator has suggested. For that reason I cannot anwer all the other parts of the question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the first bushfires I was ask to attend to after I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was a problem involving the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service in Queensland. It was in some financial difficulties at that time. It became clear that the resources available required the Legal Service to set some priorities in terms of the classes of work which it undertook. Criminal work was clearly the most important and the Legal Service indicated that a priority list existed. The feeling has been that conveyancing work, while important to individual Aboriginals, is a lesser priority and that the Legal Service should direct the available funds to the very great need for representation in court for Aboriginals in Queensland. So it has been a matter of allocating resources and using the priority setting. I think it is for this reason that conveyancing work is not carried out by ATSILS.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the debate in the Senate on the matter raised by Senator Missen. I do not know whether it was on 29 May. I accept the facts as he retailed them. It is true that I did give an undertaking, I think both inside and outside the Senate, that I would give further consideration to these amendments to incorporate a public interest test in certain exemptions in the Freedom of Information Bill. I have done that. I gave an undertaking that I would raise the matter with the Government and I have also done that. The debate on the Bill in the House of Representatives has been deferred pending the Government's consideration of the matters that I have raised. Admittedly the second reading debate has proceeded; but, as these would be matters for the Committee stage, I do not think there has been any breach of any undertaking by allowing the second reading debate to proceed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. In November 1978 the United States Congress amended the Energy Conservation Program relating to consumer products and called for energy efficient standards for 13 categories of products.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Department is keenly interested in the question of energy efficiency, and a number of research bodies, including advisory bodies, also are taking a keen interest. My Department will be seeking to give a lead for all Australians, whether in industry or in commerce, to conserve electricity, that is, to use less where they can. Clearly, in a domestic home one can become more energy efficient simply by not leaving on an extra light. I regard Senator Elstob's question as a significant one. It is indeed essential to obtain more efficient machines. To give the honourable senator some idea of what could be achieved, I point out that, if we could effect a saving of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in the use of electric power in Australia, in every decade we would avoid the need to build two large power stations. We would save something in the order of $2 billion and therefore, because we would have more electric power available, we would be able to employ more people. The thrust of Senator Elstob's question-how to achieve more energy efficiency, whether in regard to the use of electricity or otherwise-is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have an arrangement with the automotive industry whereby vehicles, which some three years ago consumed on average 11.2 litres for every 100 kilometres of travel, should have that consumption reduced to 9 litres for every 100 kilometres by 1983 and to 8 litres for every 100 kilometres by 1987. I am happy to say that, when we measured the situation at the end of the last year, the 11.2 litre average had been reduced to 9.9 litres. Therefore, we have two years in which to reduce the figure from 9.9 litres to 9 litres. I think that is possible. Reductions will become increasingly difficult to achieve. The answer to Senator Elstob's question is yes, there is pressure in Australia to achieve more energy efficiency; but, more importantly, we have a program called the National Industrial Energy Management Scheme or NIEMS, the aim of which is to achieve energy conservation and efficiency in industry. When required we provide experts to carry out energy audits of industry. That is proceeding now. Much more can be done and must be done in the kinds of areas that Senator Elstob has raised. Because it is a big subject and because I do not want to hold up Question Time, I will make further information available to the honourable senator.</PARA>

However, the report warns that babies may be at risk from the lead solder in cans of food. On the basis of those findings, what action does the Federal Government intend to take, given the conclusion of the committee that it would probably be wise to reduce all main sources of lead as far as is practicable, because of the effects on children and the possibility that even low exposure to lead can be a health hazard?</PARA></TALK.START>

I point out to the honourable senator that it is not only the very young who face a danger from lead intake. When I was a trainee doctor in Tennessee we had a lot of lead poisoning. We discovered that that was because people made their illicit liquor-moonshine-in car radiators. The lead leached out of the car radiators and we saw a lot of adults with lead poisoning. Nevertheless, the question which the honourable senator raises is very significant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a copy of a letter which the President of the Angurugu Council on Groote Eylandt, Mr Jambana Lalara, had sent to the Chairman of the NAC indicating that the Council will not take part in the forthcoming NAC election and that it will not assist in any way. I thought that the Council had set out three reasons, and I am not sure whether they are the same three as the honourable senator has raised. The Council asserted that the NAC representative is seldom seen. I cannot comment on that. The Council said that the election in this area favours the biggest community. It said that decisions are taken by the NAC executive without reference to the Aboriginal people. Obviously, I am disappointed if any Aboriginal community should adopt this position in relation to the NAC election. I have already written to Mr Lalara, encouraging him and his community to participate in the election to be held on 17 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just make the point that the NAC is an effective forum. The Conference has established itself since 1977 as an effective voice for Aboriginal people where their views are expressed and debated. In addition, the NAC executive recently assumed an advisory role to the Minister, replacing the former Council for Aboriginal Development. I suppose the only other thing to say is that I am aware of special difficulties faced within the Northern Territory in the more traditional communities in relation to their representation on the NAC. Put very simply, the size of the electorates, 4,000 or 5,000 people or whatever it is-this covers several traditional communities-means that it is difficult for someone from one community to represent others. We will take this under study after the NAC election with a view to trying to make some special arrangements for Northern Territory communities with the agreement of the whole of the NAC. I will be disappointed if the Groote Eylandt community does not take part. I am not aware of anything in the letter which refers in any way to decisions about the Commonwealth Games, which I think was part of the honourable senator's question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will obtain for the honourable senator the answer to the last part of his question as to what the fee will be for those people who do not wish to be connected to ISD. I know that the Perth central business district is served by four exchanges which provide a total of 29,000 services. At the present time ISD or multi-metering can be provided on three of the exchanges, which cover 21,000 of the 29,000 services. Those three exchanges are scheduled to be upgraded to provide ISD call charge recording progressively between December 1981 and March 1982. The honourable senator's question refers to those telephone numbers with the prefix 321. I take it that they are the customers on the remaining exchange. I am advised that those customers who require ISD and who are willing to accept a number change will be able to transfer to one of the other three exchanges. Those people in the Perth central business district who require ISD will be able to gain access to it, either directly through their existing numbers or by accepting a number change. Telecom plans to upgrade the other exchange in the mid-1980s. There may be several years delay.

It was submitted to the censorship officers of my Department only because they have to give a certificate that it would not be a prohibited import under the Customs regulations before the book can obtain bounty under the Bounty (Books) Act.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to read either book, actually. The fact of the matter is that the censorship officer to whom this book was submitted did give it a restricted classification in the terms of the New South Wales Indecent Articles and Classified Publications Act. I am going on only what has been alleged in a radio interview by the publisher. All we actually know is that a book called Lauren written by Ruth Adams was submitted to the censor and he gave it this classification. The book was not prohibited under the Customs regulations. Therefore it was passed for bounty. The fact that it was given a restricted classification did not mean that it was not passed for bounty. I do not know what is proposed about the bounty part of it. Perhaps it is a hoax. I trust it is a hoax, because if it is not a hoax the publisher might be in some fairly serious trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The substantial part of the question is about the consistency of censorship policy. Problems arise in many ways. There is the question of the registration and classification of films-that is why we have the Film Censorship Board-and the question of the classification of literature for importation under the Customs regulations. A certain amount of classification is also performed by officers of my Department for the States, including for the New South Wales Government. That was the case in regard to this restricted classification. It was really made under New South Wales legislation. They perform that function under State law. Then, of course, other decisions are made under the Bounty (Books) Act. So there is a real problem of consistency with all these various pieces of censorship responsibility. The fact of the matter is that I have been emphasising to the officers of my Department in regard to the censorship of films that as far as possible a consistent policy ought to be followed. I am assured that they do follow such a policy on a very difficult subject indeed. It is extremely difficult to achieve consistency in this area.</PARA>

I undertook to obtain further information in response to his eight questions. The questions and answers are as follows: The first question asked: What was the cause of the fire which destroyed the vehicle? The answer is a leaking fuel line. The second question asked: Was the vehicle owned by Australia Post? The answer to that question is no. The third question was: Who owned the vehicle? The answer is Hawker Transport, Mount Gambier. The fourth question asked: Was the vehicle carrying mail only? The answer is no. The next question asked: If not, what was the nature of the other contents? The answer is the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper. The sixth question asked: Were these goods inflammable? I am advised that the answer to that question is no. The next question asked: What precautions are insisted on by Australia Post for the carriage of mail? The answer to that is that the conditions prescribed by Australia Post for carriage of mail by contractors include the provision of a fire extinguisher in the vehicle and protection for mail from weather, damage, loss or theft. The vehicle was equipped with a fire extinguisher but the extinguisher was inadequate to meet the extent of the fire.</PARA></TALK.START>

This applies to all processes, including typesetting, which may be purchased from other persons in the course of making the finished product.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, I present a report on the Committee's reference concerning the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries, together with the transcript of evidence taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In presenting the report on behalf of the Committee, I wish to refer to the fact that the report is lengthy and detailed and I see little point in taking up the Senate's time in a recitation of its contents. Included in the report is a summary chapter and a summary of the recommendations requiring action. In essence the changes recommended by the report are these: So far as legislation is concerned, the Committee considers that the Minister for Primary Industry should be given a formal power of direction over the Australian Dairy Corporation to ensure the accountability to Parliament of those responsible for the Australian Dairy Corporation's actions. If Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd is to continue operating in its present form, then the Dairy Produce Act 1924 should be amended so as to give specific power to the ADC to create a subsidiary to engage in these activities. The Department of Primary Industry member of the ADC should in future be a non-voting member and not a full member as at present. Section 5 of the Dairy Produce Act 1924 should be amended to insert a provision specifying the primary duty of board members to the Board as a whole in the resolution of any conflicts of interest. The Dairy Produce Act should be amended to require the ADC to report to Parliament every six months. The relevant legislation should be amended to ensure that authorities are not able to create subsidiaries without prior parliamentary knowledge and ministerial approval and that Ministers inform the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the establishment of such subsidiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as ministerial practice is concerned, we recommend that all types of significant ministerial involvement in the Australian Dairy Corporation should be by way of formal written direction. Directions should be tabled within 15 sitting days of being made except where commercial confidentiality is involved in which case they should be tabled as soon as possible with an appropriate explanation and included in the ADC's next annual report. If the Dairy Corporation or its subsidiaries is in breach of Australia's treaty obligations we believe that the Minister must direct the ADC to cease that breach. This should be done by way of a formal direction which is recorded in writing and brought to the attention of the Parliament as soon as possible. The Minister should also be obliged to ensure that the direction is complied with once given. The Minister for Primary Industry, noting the Committee's view expressed in paragraph 12.33, should make a more explicit statement on the question of the ownership of the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund than that which was made in the Minister's memorandum dated 26 June 1979. In the event that Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd is sold the Government should direct that the proceeds be paid into the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as departmental practice is concerned, the Committee recommended that the Department of Primary Industry should keep the Australian Dairy Corporation informed of Australia's treaty obligations. The Department should draw the Australian Dairy Corporation's attention to any breach, or anticipated breach, of these obligations and also inform the Minister of any breaches by the Corporation or its subsidiaries. The Department should issue and publish broad guidelines to the Dairy Corporation to govern its practices in relation to expenditure controls. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Australian Dairy Corporation practice is concerned, the ADC should be given 12 months to establish and implement over Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd effective expenditure controls, guidelines for the authorisation of recurrent expenditure, procedures for the resolution of conflicts of interest, standards consistent with stock exchange requirements for Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd reports to the ADC and to Parliament and control procedures and reporting requirements to satisfy the Auditor-General. The Dairy Corporation should be responsible for maintaining a written record of ministerial communications. These ministerial communications should be published in the ADC annual report. The Corporation should ensure that its subsidiaries are informed of Australia's treaty obligations and that no breaches of those obligations are incurred by those subsidiaries. ADC nominated directors of the Asian subsidiaries should report regularly to the ADC, particularly on matters which impinge on Government policy. The annual reports and audited financial statements of the subsidiaries should be incorporated in the ADC's annual report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Dairy Corporation should take all steps in its power to ensure that Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd reports sufficiently and should apply any necessary sanctions such as the replacement of ADI (HK) Ltd's directors. The ADC and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd should ensure that they do not become involved in activities such as bribery, corruption, tax evasion and secret commissions and other unethical practices regarded as unacceptable in the country involved. Funds should not be paid to individuals without an adequate system to ensure that they will eventually be paid to their rightful recipients and that this can be subject to audit certification. Consideration should be given to not appointing Australian dairy produce manufacturers to the boards of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd and the other joint venture companies of ADC. If the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund is to remain in existence it should continue to be expended in accordance with section 11 of the Dairy Industry Act 1924. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the Auditor-General's Office is concerned, it is recommended that one auditor only should be appointed to audit both the Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd and that that auditor should be the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General should report, on both section 63P of the Audit Act and other reports on the accounts and records of authorities, to the Parliament under his general reporting provision. If the reports contain commercially confidential material they should be made available in the first instance to a parliamentary committee, if necessary on a confidential basis. The Committee indicates to the Senate that it will review the activities of the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries in approximately 12 months to see whether the changes recommended in our report have been implemented. In addition, we will keep the matter of ministerial power of appointment to authorities under review. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the fact that, as has been indicated in statements made to the House of Representatives, certain matters relating to the affairs of Asia Dairy Industries were reported by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to the police. The Committee was careful to avoid any inquiry which would impinge upon matters which had been referred to the police and deliberately avoided any examination of those matters. They will no doubt be dealt with in the long-awaited ministerial statement relating to the police inquiry. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make a brief statement pointing out some of the major recommendations. The other aspects of the Committee's findings are contained in the report itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply want to comment briefly on the report in my capacity as a member of the Committee. No doubt the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, Senator Walsh, will want to comment at rather greater length and with more elaboration than it would be appropriate for me to do as a member of the Committee. I simply make the point that it is a complex report involving a very large cast of characters, engaged as they were over a number of years in a number of different kinds of activity and involving government at a number of different levels. Essentially, I believe that the report must be left to speak for itself. The important points to appreciate about it are, firstly, that its findings and recommendations are, without exception, unanimous. Secondly, the language of those findings, as will be evident from Senator Peter Rae's summary account of some of the recommendations, is careful, precise, non-tendentious and in no instance goes beyond what a reasonably objective observer could conclude from the evidence that was available to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The length of the report and the care with which it has been written will undoubtedly mean that for its full implications to be appreciated will take some time. What is clear from even the most cursory examination that someone might give the report is that none of the leading characters or organisations involved emerges with their credibility completely intact. In the case of the Australian Dairy Corporation, it is evident that that statutory authority has been erratically and for the most part very poorly administered. The behaviour of Asia Dairy Industries and other Asian subsidiaries has left a good deal to be desired by almost any criterion, not least in terms of the understanding of the officers of those corporations and those to whom they are responsible of basic notions of accountability to the public parent which created them or sustained their existence. The behaviour of the Department of Primary Industry and its senior relevant officers when it has not been simply incompetent has been positively weak, vacillating and self-serving. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is evident from even the most superficial reading of the report and the way in which the conclusions are written that the behaviour of the relevant Minister, Mr Sinclair, has been such that it is difficult to believe that his departure from ministerial office can be much longer delayed-if the same standards of probity are to be applied to him as have come to be applied in recent years to other former leading lights of this Government. However, I repeat that all of the matters with which this report deals must ultimately be left to speak for themselves. The preparation of the report has been a prolonged and difficult task because of the acute sensitivity of the whole range of issues involved. I repeat that what must be appreciated about the report and everything in it is that all of the conclusions and recommendations come from a bipartisan committee on a completely unanimous basis. I hope that, accordingly, this Parliament will give due weight to those recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -On 30 August 1979, more than two years ago, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, asked a question about what he termed misfeasance, as he put it, in a statutory authority under the control of the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair. The next day when Mr Sinclair was opening a cheese factory he attacked Mr Hayden in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sort of speculation that comes out of the questioning by the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament yesterday based on unsubstantiated allegations about statutory marketing corporations and those who operate them cannot help consumer or producer confidence in these instrumentalities, their role, function and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In your industry--</PARA>
<PARA>He was addressing dairy farmers-</PARA>
<PARA>let me assure everybody here, that the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries have demonstrably worked very much in the interests of Australian dairy farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>We now know why Mr Sinclair attacked Mr Hayden. We now know much more about the magnitude of the misfeasance and the then Minister's determination verbally to bludgeon into silence anyone who tried to expose the facts. No wonder he attacked Hayden. We also know why the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the dairy industry establishment subsequently tried so vigorously to cover up the scandal. A bipartisan committee has effectively said at page 174 of the report in paragraph 9.38 that it does not believe what Mr Sinclair said in the House of Representatives. It could be described in other terms which usually are not accepted in this Parliament. But, in the unanimous judgment of three Liberal and three Labor senators, the Minister's statement in the House was untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago a judge held that another Minister had committed, what the judge said, was an impropriety. There were no charges, no convictions. That Minister's behaviour was improper in the judgment of that judge. That Minister was immediately sacked. But Mr Sinclair, a battle scarred veteran of assorted villainies, will still survive, as will his cohort, Mr Nixon, in spite of Nixon's role in the meat scandal and the Dairy Corporation coverup. This dynamic duo are, by a charitable judgment, the chiefs of a culpably negligent Department of Primary Industry, the source of an apparently endless supply of scandals. The question presents itself: Has the endemic corruption of the National Country Party infected the Commonwealth bureaucracy?</PARA>

The paper is one which we are told has been in the hands of the Senate for, what, 10 minutes? We are now getting into a debate which might be more suitable on some other form of motion but which is certainly not suitable on the motion to take note of this paper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the matter of relevance, I have cited chapter 9, paragraph 38, of the report, to which the remarks I am making are directly relevant. I refer to the question of whether statements made by the then Minister in the House of Representatives in fact were accurate. One telephone call which one judge believed to be improper got a Liberal Minister the sack. National Country Party Ministers with common records of administrative negligence, parliamentary concealment and obfuscation survive. Apparently in this Government the National Country Party is inviolate. It is ironic to recall a statement made by the former Minister for Primary Industry on 21 November 1977, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our standards are very high indeed and the standards that I have set I believe maintain exactly the same standards as anyone would wish a person in high office to set. </PARA>
<PARA>It is ironic also to recall the sanctimonious prime ministerial humbug about ministerial propriety with which we used to be plagued. If the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) lacks the courage or the common decency to clean up his own Ministry, it is time that the Liberal Party of Australia got rid of him. It is not surprising that culpable negligence at the highest levels filters down through departments into authorities under their control. I will take a couple of short quotes from pages 355 and 357 of the Committee's report relating to its findings concerning a member-in fact the Vice-Chairman-of the Australian Dairy Corporation board. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are not able to conclude whether Mr Pyle did in fact, disconnect the speedo or whether he used this statement to attempt to explain the duplicated claims for expenses. Certainly, it makes it impossible to establish the extent of the duplication. The Committee considers that Mr Pyle's behaviour in relation to the disconnection of the speedo speaks for itself. We are not concerned to decide whether Mr Pyle's actions were, in his words, 'stupid more than dishonest' or whether they were dishonest more than stupid, they were certainly a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The system used by the ADC for the reimbursement of the travel expenses of the Deputy Chairmen (and Acting Chairman for 6 months)-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Pyle-</PARA>
<PARA>was unsatisfactory. It was capable of simple abuse and was simply abused. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Committee has found that the Vice-Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation has been double dipping, is in effect guilty of fraud and has been robbing dairy farmers. He holds office at the Minister's pleasure. Surely he should be sacked. But with the present Minister's record, can he sack anyone?</PARA>

His fitness to retain his position on the Corporation board must be called into question. All of the people who have been exposed in this report very nearly got away with it. Mr Hayden asked a question, originally more than two years ago, that produced a volley of abuse. Some came from Mr Sinclair-I have already quoted some of that-and some came from other quarters. In particular, I quote three short sections from the Primary Industry Newsletter of 5 September 1979 in which, in response to Mr Hayden's question which, I emphasise, did not name any individual or even any corporation, this was written:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am quoting comments made more than two years ago on the very issue of misfeasance, as the Leader of the Opposition originally put it, in a statutory authority under the control of the Corporation; the very misfeasance which ultimately led to the Senate inquiry and the production of this report. The Primary Industry Newsletter of 5 September continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> PIN found nothing in its ''investigation'' to suggest any wrong doing, let alone any ''misappropriation''. </PARA>
<PARA>PIN went on:</PARA>
<PARA> After evaluating the information available to it and making some inquiries of its own, PIN concluded that the allegations being made were without substance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>PIN also stated that there were wild allegations of very large sums of money having been involved. It was found by the Committee that a sum in excess of $1m which disappeared into a bank account in Asia could not be traced. That might not be a very large sum to the proprietor of PIN, but it is a very large sum to most people. The theme played in that issue of PIN was consistently played in subsequent issues of PIN, reinforced from time to time with attacks on nosey politicians and replayed by a slothful and sycophantic agricultural Press. With the sole and honourable exception of the Weekly Times, the agricultural Press gave no or negligible coverage to either the original Auditor-General's investigations or the subsequent Committee hearings. Perhaps the prize for the most undistinguished member of the agricultural media on this issue should be awarded to the Australian Broadcasting Commission's rural department. The reaction among the agricultural establishment to the disclosures which have come out to date was that, if they threatened the establishment, it did not want to know about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, who become Minister in September 1979, which was soon after this matter became a question for public discussion, consistently refused to table the original Auditor-General's report received by his predecessor in August 1979. He has given a variety of conflicting reasons for not doing so. In April 1980 he claimed in the House that the Auditor-General had advised him not to table the report, that it would be inappropriate to table the report. That question was pursued at Senate Estimates committee hearings in April 1980 and Mr Taylor, the Assistant Auditor-General, explained then-and subsequently by letter-that the advice given to the Minister was that there were certain reports the tabling of which was mandatory, and there were other reports the tabling of which was optional. The Auditor-General's report on the Dairy Corporation fell into that latter category. A ministerial option to table the report, or notification that there is a ministerial option to table the report, is very far removed from an Auditor-General's advice that it would be inappropriate to table the report. Presumably the present Minister's comprehension of the English language is not so feeble that he is not aware of that very important distinction. However, he still refuses to table that report. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1980 sections of the report were leaked to me. On 18 August 1980 Mr Nixon sent certain matters to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. On 24 October 1980 and 11 March 1981 he received reports as a result of those police investigations. According to an answer given to a parliamentary question, he sent those reports to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). As far as is known-the Minister was asked a question about that this morning-the reports are still buried there, although information obtained since Question Time suggests that within a few days those reports will be either released or acted upon. Nothing, apparently, activates an inert Minister like a shot across the bows. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1980 I tabled the leaked sections of the Auditor-General's report which, I think it is fair to claim, provided the basis for the ultimate committee inquiry of which the report which has just been tabled is the final product. If that Auditor-General's report had not been substantially leaked, it appears from the record that Mr Nixon would have continued to suppress information relevant to this matter. He would have sat on that report for ever. A mutually supportive white wash group comprising, among other people, Mr Nixon, Mr Pyle, Mr Anderson and, to a lesser degree, Mr Bennett, assisted in the cover-up. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Mr Anderson, the transcript of the March 1979 hearing provides clear prima facie evidence for at least two charges of perjury. The Committee probably decided not to press ahead with those charges on the grounds that a prosecution might well be futile. There is a marked and unexplained contrast connected with the ministerial decision in April 1980 to extend Asia Dairy Industries trading powers in dairy products-it was under a very dark cloud at the time-to biscuits, fruit juices and probably some other commodities. For some years ADI had dealt with negligible quantities of Australian dairy products and had traded mainly in the dairy products of third countries, which were sold in South East Asia. It seems extraordinary that a subsidiary of a statutory corporation trading only in Asia, trading mostly in goods sourced from and sold to foreign countries and trading scarcely at all in the product for which it was originally established should have its trading power widened in that way at that time when it was under a very heavy cloud of suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast that with the more recent decision to instruct the Australian Wool Corporation to dispose of the Australian Wool Testing Authority, a body which operates entirely in Australia and which deals entirely with Australian products. I hope that at some future date we will get from whoever happens to be the Minister some elucidation of government decisions on those questions. What has really been exposed here is yet another sordid scandal involving the Department of Primary Industry and the corporations and services under its control and the Ministers responsible for it. If ministerial heads do not roll as a result of these disclosures Australia will have regressed even further into banana republicanism than it has already in nearly seven years of Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations is probably the most eagerly awaited report since the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange was put down. We are confronted with an unfortunate situation in a number of ways. The first is that another major primary industry in this country has had its overseas image tarnished and its reputation in terms of fair dealing exposed. It is a pity that the Department of Primary Industry has not been able, in the time that these allegations have come forward, to change its procedures sufficiently to meet the types of things that this report quite correctly suggests ought to have taken place. It is also a pity that the Senate was not able to see the report at the same time as the media obviously was. It is obvious from Australian Broadcasting Commisssion radio this morning that this report has found its way into the hands not of senators who ought to have been the first to actually receive it but into the hands of reporters. It seems to me that that is a subsidiary matter in terms of not only this report but also other reports. The methodology by which these reports are handled may need looking into and, probably, urgent revision. I do not think this chamber is being treated fairly if it is possible for people outside the Parliament to have access to something that senators here cannot have access to. I hope this matter will be taken up in a short time. It is hoped that the various recommendations of the report will be debated at greater length than we can debate them today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the political matter which is obviously contained within certain elements of this report. If this chamber is not given some reasonable explanation for the issues which this report has raised and documented I believe the forms which are available to this chamber ought to be used to puruse those elements until such time as the responsible Minister has given a response which is acceptable to the chamber. I foreshadow later moves if an adequate response is not forthcoming. On occasions in the past where the Senate was frustrated in ascertaining material, adequate forms were available by which that material could eventually have been ferreted out and tabled. I hope the Government, having received this report, will look at those politically sensitive matters and bring forward a detailed explanation of the events outlined in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that this chamber place on record its debt to the members of the Committee for what obviously is an extremely detailed and thorough report into an area of extraordinary importance to our primary industry. We hope that, unlike to so many reports that are tabled in this place, urgent attention is paid to this report and that we do not have to wait two years for a government response, as so often is the case. Let us not go through the tedious rigmarole which we had to go through in relation to the meat industry. Having received a bipartisan report of a committee which has looked at all areas thoroughly and has given its recommendations, let us not have another departmental committee sitting on a report to see what the Government will do about it. Let us hope that in a short time-I do not see why it ought to proceed past the non-sitting weeks which we are coming up to-the Government will be able to give a response as to what it will be doing in relation to this report. I hope it will give a favourable response to the detailed recommendations contained in the report. I commend that type of action to the Government. The Australian Democrats will be eagerly waiting for that indication on the part of the Government. I reiterate that if this is not forthcoming we will pursue other forms in this chamber to make sure that it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in relation to the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. Firstly, I refer to the in terrorem tactics that Senator Macklin has just directed at the Government in relation to this report. I find it quite incredible that senators come into this Chamber without any experience of Government-I am one of them-and proceed to tell Ministers how they should react to reports produced in this chamber. A report takes almost 12 months to prepare, after careful analysis. It makes an enormous number of recommendations. Clearly they are recommendations which require, firstly, ministerial and then departmental investigation in depth, then recommendations to Cabinet, then decisions of Cabinet and finally implementation, possibly by way of legislation. Yet honourable senators come into this chamber and say that because we have produced a bipartisan report we ought to be able to respond to it within a few months, and if we do not they will use the procedures of this House to do something or other to us. The power seems to have gone to the heads of the Australian Democrats. I am pleased to see that members of the Opposition joined with us last night in order to show where the power really lies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see that most members of the media have departed from the chamber, having heard the exaggerated and emotive language flowing from the vituperative tongue of our colleague, Senator Walsh. No doubt they now have the headlines that they can explode across the newspapers this afternoon and tomorrow morning, and reports for the television and radio. I hope that rather than listen to the language of our colleague, Senator Walsh, the media, the honourable senators in this chamber and the public will read carefully the words of the report rather than guess at what has been said. I draw the attention of the Senate to paragraph 9.38 on page 174 of the report which is the paragraph that Senator Walsh made so much of but did not quote. That paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a valid conclusion that a committee can draw on the basis of evidence, and one can draw one's conclusions about the recollection of people in relation to this matter. But as to guessing at the words that are used, it appals me that Senator Walsh, with all due respect, is able to come into the Senate and make his slanderous statements, without justifying them. I do not wish to comment in great detail on the contents of the report. The report stands on its own two feet. I do hope, however, that the concentration which Senator Walsh has given to this paragraph will not allow honourable senators, the public and the media to be distracted from the other items in the report. The report contains 350-odd pages and a great deal of detail. I refer in particular to the problem of statutory authorities and subsidiaries which subsume unto themselves power beyond the power which the statutory authority has in itself so that, for example, Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd is able to trade, notwithstanding the fact that it is not buying Australian skim milk powder but is buying skim milk powder from other nations. Is this a power that it ought to have?</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of whether the Government should dispose of Asia Dairy Industries, what should be its future role generally, and the flow of information from subsidiaries of statutory authorities to statutory authorities, to the Minister, to the department and to the Parliament-all of these matters are of vital importance to this Parliament. In particular I refer to chapter 16 in relation to applying the lessons of this investigation to statutory authorities generally and the creation by them of subsidiaries, the behaviour of subsidiaries and the behaviour of statutory authorities generally. I commend the details of the words of the report to the Senate rather than general guessing by honourable senators as to what the report contains. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I am or was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations that inquired into the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries, it was not my intention to speak on the report until my colleague, Senator Lewis, who also was a member of the Committee, had spoken this morning. I merely want to say that all members of the Committee who sat on the inquiry put a tremendous amount of effort, work and thought into the inquiry and into the preparation of the report. The conclusions and findings that have been reached were reached after a great deal of consideration, coolly, calmly and collectively, and after a sieving of all the evidence that had been presented to the Committee and which had been taken by the Committee both in public and in private. The recommendations that have been made have been made unanimously in a genuine attempt to assist statutory authorities in general and in particular the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries and in a genuine belief that all of the recommendations that have been put forward need the earnest consideration of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the remarks of my colleague, Senator Lewis, concerning Senator Walsh, I merely want to say that in respect of Senator Lewis's comments about paragraph 9.38 of the report, he emphasised one sentence of the Committee's report, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster. </PARA>
<PARA>I merely want to add the next sentence of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, it appears to the Committee that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair was told of the terms of the compromise which necessarily involved a continuing breach of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very serious conclusion and a very serious finding. It was a unanimous conclusion and a unanimous finding of the six members of the Committee, four of whom, I hasten to point out, are distinguished lawyers, and two of whom-one of whom is me-are former Ministers of the Crown. Therefore, I would certainly hope that all of my Senate colleagues would view that conclusion seriously and with concern. I point out that the Committee has said that on the balance of probabilities the then Minister, Mr Sinclair, was told of the terms of the compromise which necessarily involved a continuing breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is a very serious matter so far as Parliament is concerned. I believe it is a matter that has to be cleared up and I would urge the Government to give it close consideration. Having made that brief comment, I suggest that the remarks that Senator Walsh has made are very pertinent to that section of the Committee's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had no intention of entering this debate on the motion that the Senate take note of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations until Senator Lewis made some very uncomplimentary remarks about my colleague, Senator Walsh. He talked about Senator Walsh having a vituperative tongue and making slanderous statements. Senator Lewis said nothing about the vituperative tongues and slanderous statements being used against Senator Walsh by members of the rural community-in particular by that discreditor, the editor of the Primary Industry Newsletter-who tried to discredit Senator Walsh during the last election campaign when he was the primary industry spokesman for the Australian Labor Party. When one has moved around the rural community and has listened to some of the most slanderous statements levelled at Senator Walsh for having had the persistence and temerity to raise this matter in the Senate, one wonders now why Senator Lewis says the same things about Senator Walsh, when he defended himself by quoting from the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This document completely vindicates the persistence of Senator Walsh in bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. Had he not done so, as he said in his speech, the matter of the $1m which was falsely used and misappropriated-the Committee could not find what happened to it-would have been swept under the carpet. I think the Senate should give due credit to Senator Walsh for his persistence. He does not pull any punches when he finds that things are not all that they should be. I want to give credit not only to him but also to the members of the Committee who took this matter on board and who brought down a report to this chamber which completely vindicates the statements and claims by Senator Walsh who sought an inquiry. I was involved in this matter to some small degree when I gave notice of a motion on behalf of Senator Walsh when he was given a small holiday from this chamber. Had it not been for the honourable senator's persistence, Mr Nixon would have been off the hook. He would not have been under challenge today; neither would Mr Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> If this sort of thing had happened during the reign of the Whitlam Government honourable senators opposite would have bayed like wolves and called for resignations and sackings. The way Mr Whitlam conducted his Government, in his wisdom, he would have seen to it that had any Minister acted as these Ministers have acted-it has been stated in this report that they did act this way-they would have been removed from office. We wait with very intense interest to see whether this will be the fate of the Ministers talked about in this report, because the Federal Parliament of this country has to be consistent. We cannot make fish of one and fowl of the other where public money is involved. No doubt this matter will be dissected by the Press and by everybody who has an interest in it in the days to come. I hope a full debate takes place in this Parliament and that remedial measures are taken to see that no cover-ups like this are attempted ever again by Ministers of a Federal parliament. Senator Walsh was seeking only to have the matters aired so that it could be judged whether he was right or wrong. Senator Lewis now is a little concerned that Senator Walsh, in fact, has been judged to be right in regard to the statements and queries he brought before this Parliament. </PARA>

He selectively quoted from passages in the report. It was left to our colleague, Senator McClelland, who was also a member of the Committee, to complete the quotation embodied in paragraph 9.38. Senator Lewis left out the relevant part. He also did not refer in his remarks to the last two lines on page 176, although he has put his name to the report.

<PARA> Ministerial inaction in the face of a known continuing breach cannot be condoned. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable senator never mentioned that when he spoke; it was left to members on this side to pull out the relevant points. I am not conversant with the whole of the document although I did sit in on the inquiry for a couple of days to listen to what was being said. While this inquiry was going on, and even before it was set up, I was most concerned that attempts were made to make my colleague, Senator Walsh, the then Labor Party spokesman on primary industry, appear to be the villian of the piece-that he did not know what he was talking about, that he had set a hare going just to bring about some discredit to Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon. The evidence given to this Commitee was given under oath, and I have every faith in the job done by the members of the Committee. As a colleague has pointed out, four of them are lawyers-he said they were all prominent lawyers, although I have some doubt about that at times, particularly in regard to one of them-and he said the other two members were ex-Ministers of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that this report has now come into the Parliament and I am very pleased that my colleague, Senator Walsh, has been shown to have a clean skin and that he was doing his duty as he saw it, not only to the general public but also to the dairy farmers of Australia who had to place their confidence in Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. I am afraid that confidence was sadly astray. I hope that in the days to come remedial action will be taken as a result of this report and we will never have to see another report like this come into the Federal Parliament which shows Ministers of the Crown in a very bad light.

I indicate now that it is my intention, after a very brief contribution, to seek leave to continue my remarks. A number of honourable senators, in speaking to the motion, have indicated their concern that there should be a Government response to the report. It is understandable that the Senate and the Committee should want the Government's response to what appears to be a detailed series of recommendations on a range of matters. I think all honourable senators will understand that I in no way now wish to give that definitive Government response. The report is one of some 370-plus pages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making the comment that for an individual senator to purport to pass judgment on this report without having read it simply indicates that one is prepared to take a stance on the basis of general reputation and on the basis that one may or may not like the result of the report. I do not intend to fall into that trap. I will therefore make very few comments on the report because of my own inability to read it in the matter of minutes I have had it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I welcome the fact that Senator Lewis did bring the debate back to the words which are used in paragraph 9.38. He quoted a part of that paragraph and made the point that the journalists who had been here for the early part of the debate were likely to write in terms of the gloss put upon the Committee's findings by the speech of Senator Walsh. It was useful that Senator Lewis did that, and I commend those people who are examining the matter to read carefully the words of the report itself rather than at this stage the gloss put on it by honourable senators who have made comment in this debate. I say that with the greatest respect to all honourable senators. We are assured by those honourable senators who have spoken that the matter is a difficult one and that the report has been prepared carefully. Like Senator Lewis, I simply say that the words of paragraph 9.38 ought to be referred to rather than the gloss which has been put upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter I mention because I think it ought to be of interest and concern to all honourable senators. In flicking through this report, I noticed, in the some 30 to 40 pages of it which seem to relate to the paragraph which has received so much attention, that in the course of the Committee's inquiries on at least one occasion there was a leak which found its way into the media, a leak which was complained of and a leak for which expressions of apology were made to Mr Sinclair. I refer to the letter appearing on page 162 of the report which refers to an earlier letter from Senator Peter Rae to Mr Sinclair which appears on page 159 of the report and is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, and to date inexplicably, the fact that I was instructed by the Committee to seek to discuss this with you were leaked to the Sydney Morning Herald. Without accepting the responsibility for this my Committee expresses its regret that this has transpired. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 162 we find that Mr Sinclair in a letter to Senator Peter Rae inter alia expressed his appreciation of the expression of regret. I mention that because on AM this morning there was a report from Simon Nasht about this report which was to come into this place. Mr Nasht reported:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee has unanimously decided that the weight of evidence must be considered in Mr Webster's favour. The Minister's version must therefore be, in the Committee's opinion, in serious doubt. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that, in a spirit of concern about the role of the Senate, the role of the Parliament and its proper relationship to the public, the Executive and so on, there will be bipartisan concern about the fact that that report was on AM this morning. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that it may well involve a breach of privilege. I do so at this stage merely to put that on the record as a possibility. I hope that it is a matter of concern to all senators when the proper procedures are not followed, particularly in a matter which raises the sorts of allegations which have been made in this debate. At this early stage, I simply-not in any sense trying to be definitive on the matter-draw the Senate's attention to that possibility as one which I think we should also be considering when we examine this report and its implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I close my remarks at this stage simply by saying that, of course, the Government will be giving the report very careful consideration. It will, of course, respond to the Parliament and, in particular, the Senate, with respect to the matters which have been raised. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA>Meat Export (Penalties) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for severe penalties to be imposed on any person who contravenes the provisions of certain regulations under the Exports (Meat) Regulations. The necessity for this course of action to be taken has been brought about by the recent discovery of fraudulent misrepresentation with regard to meat shipments to the United States of America. The areas of difficulty which have been identified as a result of the recent events are covered by regulations 33A, 58 and 59 (1) of the Exports (Meat) Regulations. These relate to the misuse of inspection stamps, alteration or interference with descriptions, tags et cetera and the making of false or misleading statements in pursuance of the respective regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing maximum penalties for any breach of the regulations is $100. We are therefore amending the Customs Act, among other things, to allow this maximum to be increased to $1,000. Is is not considered appropriate to have a penalty higher than this incorporated in a regulation. However, the Government is strongly of the view that further provision needs to be made for much higher penalties to exist for offences of the nature I have just outlined. This is the reason for the Meat Export (Penalties) Bill. It provides for penalties to be imposed on anyone who contravenes those sections of the Exports (Meat) Regulations referred to previously. Any contravention of these regulations would make the offenders guilty of an indictable offence and consequently subject to penalties of up to $100,000 or imprisonment of up to 5 years or both. </PARA>
<PARA> These new and severe penalties are indicative of the Government's desire to ensure effective deterrents. However, as is normal in penalty legislation of this kind, the Bill also makes it possible to proceed against offenders by summary jurisdiction with the lesser penalties of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 1 year or both. Summary jurisdiction requires that the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so and the defendant and the prosecutor consent. It ensures extremely minor offences are not unnecessarily taken to a higher court and in no way undermines the ability of the legal system to impose suitably severe penalties for breaches of the law. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is one of the measures being introduced by the Government to heighten control over exports of meat and livestock from Australia and to increase the penalties currently available for offences against the statutory provisions governing such exports. Specifically, the Bill we are considering is designed to increase the penalty of $2,000 currently specified in the Act for cases where a licenced exporter exports meat or live-stock from Australia in contravention of a condition of his licence. It is proposed that, where a licensee is convicted of an indictable offence, the penalty shall be a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> An alternative provision is included for dealing with offences in a court of summary jurisdiction, provided the court sees this as the appropriate course and both the defendant and the prosecutor consent. The penalty in those cases would be a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to 1 year, or both. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 to provide for the imposition of higher penalties on any person who knowingly applies any false trade description to foodstuffs intended for or entered for export. Under section 12 of the current legislation, the maximum penalty for such an offence is $200. This is totally inadequate and the purpose of this Bill is to bring the penalty up to a realistic level and in line with that proposed under other associated Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for additional sub-sections to section 12 of the Act whereby anyone who contravenes the provisions of the Act in relation to foodstuffs shall be guilty of an indictable offence and subject to penalties of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years or both. The Bill also makes provision that where appropriate it will be possible to proceed against anyone who contravenes the provisions of the Act by summary jurisdiction with the lesser penalties of fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to one year or both. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs (Unlawful Exportation of Food) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to increase substantially the penalties in that Act for offences which relate to the unlawful exportation of food. The Government has decided to take this action following the discovery in the United States of America of Australian boneless beef being adulterated with horse and kangaroo meat. The measures contained in this Bill were foreshadowed by my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), in his statement to the other place on 8 September 1981. The penalty for the illegal exportation of any goods other than narcotics is now a pecuniary penalty of $1,000. However section 240 of the Customs Act does provide for a penalty of 3 times the value of the goods in respect of which the offence is committed if the pecuniary penalty is less than 3 times the value of the goods. The potential penalty could, therefore, be much higher than $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the potential of section 240 of the Customs Act, the Government is of the view that the penalty for conduct such as that involved in the illegal exportation of horse and kangaroo meat to the USA should be clearly expressed in the legislation as substantial. Accordingly, the penalties for the unlawful exportation of food will be increased by this Bill to a maximum fine of $100,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years, or both. For this purpose, a new offence will be created by clause 5 of the Bill. It will henceforth be an indictable offence to export food which is prohibited by any regulations in force under the Customs Act and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is made in the Bill for a court of summary jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings in respect of the new offence. Upon conviction that court may impose a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 1 year, or both. The penalty for a contravention of a regulatoin relating to food has also been increased, to a maximum of $1,000. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1649), Senator McIntosh asked the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, by stating that I understand that a Federal-State inquiry is to be conducted into Australia's wage fixing and industrial relations systems, as suggested by the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, and that, amongst other things, the inquiry will report on the economic implications of the 35-hour week and the level and effect of industrial disputes. Can the Minister say whether the same inquiry is prepared to take into account the effect of industrial accidents on the economy and, more importantly, on those in the community affected by the lack of proper and uniform safety standards? I point out that industrial accidents are responsible for about three times more lost time in industry than industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that industrial accidents can and do have a considerable impact upon the profitability of an industry in a number of ways, not the least of which is the impact on total labour costs through workers compensation premia. It needs to be recognised that industrial accidents also have a considerable cost in human terms and it is for this reason that the Government has encouraged industry to constantly review work practices with the purpose of minimizing the opportunities for such accidents to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> As to whether the Inquiry into Wage Determination and Industrial Relations Systems will address itself to the question of the effects of industrial accidents, I must point out that I am not in a position to indicate to what extent the Inquiry will or will not take such matters into account. That is a matter for the Inquiry to determine in the light of its consideration of the terms of reference. Senator McIntosh will, of course, have an opportunity to put a submission to the Inquiry on any matters he considers to be within its terms of reference.</PARA>
