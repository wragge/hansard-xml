<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Today's Press statements attributed to the Executive Vice-President and Director of Nippon Steel Aust. Pty Ltd, Mr Teranishi, express concern specifically at Australia's lack of reliability as a supplier of coal. Is the Government in a position to reassure our trading partners of improved supply reliability in the next decade? In light of the improved liaison between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, will the Government ensure that continuing and regular discussions take place with the ACTU so that a consensus of views may be progressively evolved which are in tune with the changing industrial scene?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1628" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question Senator Archer asks is of considerable importance, not only in connection with Japan but also in connection with those many countries which are now energy hungry and seeking from us urgently energy resources to take the place of oil which is in dwindling supply. Unless these countries can rely upon getting resources regularly their own economic and even political conditions can destabilise. So the need for Australia to accept a responsible position is doubly important. Japan is a major trading partner. If we are to supply both the energy resource and the minerals, such as iron, bauxite or alumina, it is essential that they be provided in a continuous fashion, otherwise the mills themselves will fail. It is enormously in the self-interest of the Australian people that this should be, because the loss of export trade is a loss not just to the profitability of a company but also to the Australian people by way of the taxation that comes to them and its distribution to the various services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last year, due to delay, at least $300m has been lost to Australia in revenue terms. As an example, I take the area of coal-mining. The number of days lost in 1979 was 232,600. In 1980 the figure was 710,700 although, as people know, that was affected by a housing dispute. Other areas, such as the stevedoring industry, were affected generally. Earlier this year I visited Japan and Europe. Wherever I went the one question that was asked in any critical fashion about Australia related to our industrial disputes and whether we could be considered as reliable partners. I believe that the ACTU is a responsible body. I believe that the ACTU would want to bring about effective conditions so that we can be reliable and so that we can provide jobs. Nevertheless, the question of reducing industrial disputes is of major significance to Australia. I repeat that this is not simply for the profitability of companies but to ensure that the world is not energy hungry and that the profit that is derived from the exploitation of minerals can, in its due share, be passed back to the people of Australia by way of higher living standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to a paper, circulated yesterday, which detailed how high income taxpayers with extensive farming interests could defer for at least three years the payment of a $60,000 tax assessment and reduce ultimate tax liabilities by $2,500 by lodging $100,000 in an income equalisation deposit for only 366 days on which 9.5 per cent interest would be paid to the depositor. I ask: Does the Government approve of such actions? If not, why did it enact the provisions which facilitate them? Further, will the Minister seek from the Prime Minister a guarantee that he, his wife, his family or her family or any of the 50 per cent membership of his Cabinet, who are ideally placed to avoid paying tax in this way, are not availing themselves of this provision? Will the Minister table this guarantee in the Senate before the end of this week?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement on the conditional decision to commit our Defence Force to the Sinai peacekeeping operation. Does the Government attach equal importance to the two arms of the Camp David Accords-the Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory in the Sinai and the solving of the problem of Palestinian autonomy? Has the failure to achieve a just and honourable solution to the Palestinian problem been the cause of great damage to the strategic position of the Western world in the key Middle Eastern area? In the autonomy talks to be held between now and next January between Israel and Egypt, will a marked change of attitude on the part of both sides be necessary if any significant progress is to be made? When the Minister said that our involvement in the Sinai peacekeeping force was on the 'understanding that all the parties to the Camp David Accords press forward with a continuing peace process in the Middle East', does this mean that our force will not be committed to the Middle East unless there is some substantial progress towards a solution which is just and honourable to both sides of the Palestinian problem?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1629" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's decision on the Sinai peacekeeping force relates specifically to its belief that there is a possibility of settling amicably and peaceably one of the three or four factors that have bedevilled the Middle East, be it the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank or the Golan Heights. The fact is that there appears to be-it has been reiterated by both Israel and Egypt-a likelihood that, in the months immediately ahead, Israel may withdraw peaceably its forces from the Sinai. If that is so, one of the significant trouble spots will have reached a successful solution. It is towards the end of seeking peace by those means that we have put this together. The fact of the matter is that the business of maintaining peace will require quite often the responsibility of earning that peace. Australia must help in that; peace is not achieved by standing by and shouting on the sidelines. There are a number of other sections to Senator Hamer's question relating to our attitudes towards Palestinian autonomy and the conditions attached. Senator Hamer has available to him the Prime Minister's speech. I think it best if I refer the remainder of the question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and seek a more detailed response to the other parts of his question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Transport to a question I asked on 3 December 1980 and a speech I made on 22 September 1981 about airport curfews. As the Airbus has now been operating for some time, will the Minister advise the Senate of the noise decibel readings from the monitoring stations at our airports? If these readings are at or below the accepted international criteria for noise levels, as defined in Federal Aviation Administration Part 36 and International Civil Aviation Organisation Annex 16, can the Senate be advised when the Airbus will be allowed to fly outside curfew hours, thus maximising its utilisation and helping to keep air fares down?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It so happens that I have a table showing noise level comparisons for various aircraft, including the Airbus. At a later stage I will seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. It is a fact that the particular noise levels to which Senator Collard referred have been tabulated. The results confirm that the Airbus has overall noise levels lower than those of any other airline jet aircraft in operation in Australia. In particular, the take-off noise of the Airbus is significantly lower than that of the DC9, the Boeing 747, the Boeing 737, the Boeing 727 and the DC10, and only marginally higher than that of propeller driven aircraft, particularly the Fokker F27. The Airbus also has low noise levels on approach to landing, although the difference is not so marked in that mode of operation. The Airbus meets the international noise certification standards of ICAO Annex 16. It also meets the standard of the United States Federal Aviation Authority's regulations in Part 36.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has informed me that a decision on whether the Airbus will be permitted to operate in curfew periods at airports will not be made until he has received advice on the matter through the Aviation Industry Advisory Council and has considered the views of the particular communities involved. He has also indicated that he would not contemplate any changes to existing conditions of the curfew unless such changes offered some improvement to the overall noise level and environment of that area. He expects the matter to take some time to resolve, but it will be considered in the not too distant future. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. It has been authoritatively calculated that Australian consumers paid $1,115m in 1977-78 for the benefit of protecting the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. If this figure is adjusted for inflation and applied to each State in relation to the number of vehicles sold in those States, the cost to Western Australia this year is $131m and to Tasmania, $39m. This is more than $3,000 extra for every vehicle purchased. The purpose of the tariff is said to be to create employment and also to support infant industries. If the claimed employment benefits are apportioned to each State and balanced against the cost, Western Australia shows an annual net loss of $123m. It may interest Senator Watson to know that his State of Tasmania shows a net annual loss of about $20m. Victoria shows a net gain of $443m based on those calculations. Can the Minister confirm the conclusions reached from these figures? Will he suggest to the Government that it either make a commitment to reduce this protection or take other action to correct the imbalance of benefits and penalties between the States?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in no position to confirm the figures which Senator Thomas mentioned in his question. I will seek to have those matters investigated and referred back to him. Nevertheless, the question that he chiefly asks is whether the Government will reduce this protection, which is available to the Australian motor vehicle industry, in such a way as to reduce the total impact on the States, as he suggests. Perhaps there are broader questions here which do deserve attention. The Government will not be taking any particular action which will be to the detriment of the motor vehicle industry and it will certainly be considering all the impacts of its various decisions while considering the reports of the Industries Assistance Commission in connection with the industry. I am in no position at this time to indicate when the Government may be making a decision on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Did the Minister notice further reports in this morning's Press concerning the depressed state of the uranium industry, including references to 8,000 unemployed uranium miners and mill workers in the United States of America, and predictions that the troubled industry will remain in its economic slump for at least five years? In view of the addition last weekend of the Kakadu National Park to the World Heritage List and the unlikelihood of Australia finding markets for any further uranium, will the Minister undertake a review of the feasibility of future mining in the Kakadu Park region, especially the proposed Pancontinental Mining Ltd mine at Jabiluka? Could any such review take into account two factors: Firstly, the now imperative importance of protecting the Kakadu National Park from any pollution from stored waste material or polluted flood waters; and, secondly, the economic value to Australia of the Jabiluka proposals when the realistic costs of such environmental protection are taken into account?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1631" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some statements regarding the current state of the uranium industry and the current demand, but Senator Mason should take into account the fact that they relate to the immediacy of the situation. The fact is-I will look up the actual figures and give them to him at the end of Question Time-that some 200-odd nuclear reactors are operating in the world today, some 200-odd are under construction and something less than that again are on order. So prospectively there is something in the order of another 300 or 400, certainly 200-odd, to come on-stream for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said before that, whilst the immediacy of the demand for uranium is not heavy, all indications are that it will be heavy as the decade progresses. I want to stress once again-I must stress this-that the best authoritative view in the free world is that there is no way that using renewable energy sources such as solar, biomass, coal or gas, the world will achieve an energy balance without a significant and continuous increase in the peacetime use of nuclear power. Equally, the scientists are pointing to the very grave dangers to the health and the ecosystem of the world of the overuse of coal in the disturbance of the ecosystem. So those who are criticising the general trend of the nuclear debate need to look at two things. They need to look at what would take its place and the dangers that otherwise would exist-economically, politically and to the health of the people. There is not a big demand for uranium at the moment. There may be, for some immediate years to come, some limitation on demand; but when I provide the figures Senator Mason will realise that there will be a significant growth in the nuclear building. He will note that the socialist President of France, Mitterrand, instead of abolishing his low water reactors, of which he had nine under construction, has now indicated that he will go ahead with six. So in socialist France those projects will still go on.</PARA>

<PARA> As to Kakadu, there will be a total protection by the Government in terms of its ecosystem. The World Heritage listing is subject to the nomination being protected by the host nation's rules and laws. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act provides legislative protection in Australia. Whilst there is no debarring of mining in the longer range future, Senator Mason should be aware of the arrangements that have been made with regard to the National Park. I see no reason why there should be a slowing down, particularly of the uranium mines now under contemplation, provided they conform with all the laws of the land. They will be subject to the normal world market forces. If they are and they abide by the protective laws of the land, I see no reason why they should not proceed.</PARA>

As at 30 June 1981 there were 243 nuclear power stations in operation throughout the world, there were 229 under construction and there were 55 on order. So Senator Mason will see that there are almost as many nuclear power stations under construction as there are now in operation. There are 55 on order, making a total of some 527 nuclear power stations. I do say to those who comment on this subject that many of those nuclear power stations have now been operating for over 20 years and are part of the ordinary domestic electric supply system in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not have a prepared answer, but I am advised that certain people are particularly susceptible to developing skin cancer and that considerable education is required in this country concerning the need to wear hats and the use of appropriate screening. It is a fact that a series of publications have pointed out that some sun screen compounds have, on testing, proved to be ineffective and a small number have proved to be quite effective. This listing, therefore, is a very important service. It is one that should be widely known and widely publicised so that the Australian consuming public can have access to and a choice of effective preparations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, is a flow-on from the answer the Minister gave to a question asked by Senator Mason on the future of the Kakadu National Park. By way of preface I refer to the second Fox report which warned about the capacity of the Alligator rivers system to cope with more than two mining operations at a given time. I marry that warning with the United States concept, whether Republican or Democrat, that certain parts of Alaska are exclusively off limits to any mining. Should I interpret the Minister to mean that, notwithstanding the World Heritage rating for Kakadu, he takes the point that each three or four years another mining operation will be started? In other words, we will have our cake and eat it too. To me the giving of a World Heritage rating to Kakadu is not the way in which to reconcile our United Nations obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not take the view that is expressed. The Government, of course, has taken steps to create the national park. It is a Government initiative. The Government has taken steps to have it rated in the World Heritage list. So the Government is foremost in the world in its sense of conservation. Let me repeat what I said before. When a park is included in the World Heritage list it is for the Government concerned to bring down the conditions of conservation of that park and, indeed, the full force of the national parks and wildlife legislative provisions will come into play. Let me make perfectly clear that nothing will be done that will in any way pollute or disturb the ecology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill will know that whilst there is no existing mine in the area and none proposed-that is quite clear; Ranger and Koongarra mine areas are, of course, excluded from the park-the Government announced in 1977 that there would be no exploration, mining or development at least for the time being in Kakadu. I want to make that clear. It is not an eternal exclusion but whatever is done for the future will be subject to all those rigorous provisions of conservation that I have outlined. However, the current plan of management for the Kakadu National Park sets out requirements to be met for exploration and mining to proceed should the Government so decide. The plan is to run for five years, and it came into effect on 2 April this year. I repeat that we have set up this park. We are second to none in our excitement about its concept, its grandeur and its essential link in the ecosystem. We will preserve it. Any steps that are taken by way of exploration for the future will be consistent with full conservation. As to pollution of the Alligator rivers, Senator Mulvihill will know that we have, of course, a supervising scientist on the spot. We have in position what we believe, according to the Fox reports, are the necessary safeguards to check these things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A United States Farm Bill is before the Congress at the moment. The Bill has been passed with amendments in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are two separate amendments, one accepted in the Senate and a different one accepted in the House of Representatives, which touch on the area raised by the honourable senator. What is known as the Melcher amendment was accepted by the Senate and the English amendment was accepted in the House of Representatives. They are included in the separate versions of the United States Farm Bill and would amend the United States Federal Meat Inspection Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Melcher amendment would prohibit the import of meat produced using chemicals not approved for use in the United States. Because of differences in environment and production systems, there are many chemicals used in Australian agriculture which are not used and therefore not approved in the United States. The English amendment is somewhat different in that it refers to chemicals positively banned in the United States. However, both amendments have the potential to cause considerable restrictions to our meat export trade. Both amendments have the appearance of measures to protect consumer health. On that basis they have attracted substantial congressional support. From the point of view of Australia, they are blatantly protectionist.</PARA>
<PARA> The use of agricultural chemicals in Australia, as in the United States, is subject to procedures to protect health including the establishment of safe residue standards. The differences between the two farm Bills are now to be resolved by the conference committee of the two Houses. The United States Administration is reported to oppose the English and Melcher amendments and hopefully will be able to obtain deletion of the offending passages at the conference stage. It would be well known to all honourable senators that the importance of the beef trade is well established in the Government's mind.

At the time it came out I indicated that we had some concerns about the accuracy of particular matters raised but that we accepted the validity of some of the thrusts that much needs to be done in Australia. Our concern with the report was, and remains, that it provided only one part of the picture. It set out the blemishes and showed none of the accomplishments. It did not emphasise the efforts that had been made. It did not emphasise the commitment that had been made over the last 20 years. To that extent it was an unbalanced report. I have no reason to doubt the assertions of the honourable senator in respect of the quite considerable efforts made by every State, including Western Australia, in this regard but will undertake to check them item by item and give him a more detailed reply.</PARA>

In previous royalty negotiations the rate was fixed at 2 1/2 per cent and royalties were to be divided between land councils, traditional owners and land trusts. Can the Minister advise the Government's attitude to payments of up-front or key moneys, amounting to several millions of dollars, and greatly increased royalty percentages being demanded? Does the Government favour that additional payment above the original formula? Is it considered that further guidelines are necessary in this respect and should they be enshrined in legislation? Can the Minister also advise whether any of those additional moneys will still be shared between traditional owners, land councils and land trusts according to the original formula, or is it to be expected that royalties will be needed to sustain land council operations and the repayment of operational loans to the Federal Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by saying to Senator Kilgariff that any arrangement that is made as a result of a negotiation requires ministerial approval. One of the things I would take into account would be the distribution of moneys both within a region and between different Aboriginals. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, in fact, does not contain any formula designed to determine the terms and conditions which might be contained in any agreement negotiated between a land council and a mining company. So there is no formula. The honourable senator referred in his question, I think, to a formula of 2 1/2 per cent. There is no formula. The problem is that only three agreements have been negotiated to date. All of them provide for different rates of royalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those agreements are the Ranger mine, where the royalty rate was 5 1/2 per cent; the deposit of Queensland Mines Ltd at Nabarlek, where the rate is 3 3/4 per cent; and the Mereenie oil and gas fields in central Australia where, under existing legislation, the rate is 10 per cent. So there is no single formula and there is no single formula to be enshrined in legislation. As the honourable senator said, there is a capacity for land councils to negotiate extra payments and these are determined by way of negotiation. They are not contained in the Act. But, as I have said, they must come to me for approval. The rate of royalty which is set for payment into the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account has been determined on a case by case basis by the Commonwealth and we intend to continue to do that. The land rights Act contains the provision whereby the Minister can determine what percentage of the royalty is made payable to the ABTA. The minimum rate is 2 1/2 per cent. But, as I have said, the amount is quite negotiable.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also asked about the sharing of money. I am very concerned that there should be the widest possible distribution of royalty moneys. Under the present Act there is a formula providing that 40 per cent of the moneys goes to land councils for their administrative costs, that 30 per cent goes to Aboriginal communities generally and that 30 per cent goes to Aboriginal communities in the region. I think that is quite an equitable distribution formula and it would not be my intention to vary that at present.</PARA>

If so, I ask: Why has the Government passed responsibility for soil conservation to the States? What future role will be played by the Commonwealth in the area of soil conservation? What action will be taken by the Government to make certain that the States have an assured annual amount available to spend on soil conservation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be true to say that the action of the Government following the RCF recommendation was one of passing over responsibility for soil conservation to the States. The responsibility for soil conservation was and is within the States. Land and the preservation of land within a State come under State sovereignty. The overwhelming responsibility for land and its management has always been and must be, because of State laws, within the States. A supplementary program of a small dimension-some $3m a year-has been established. The Government took the view that it would be best to incorporate that $3m in the extra money provided to the States. So in effect we are providing yearly, from now on, extra money to the States-true, it is a small amount-which they can add to their soil conservation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of the concern that exists regarding soil conservation. Much of our rural cultivation in this country lies within the first nine inches of topsoil and its safeguarding is vital. I am very well aware of that. The Commonwealth, in a number of ways, plays a significant role in this area. For example, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation carries out wide research into a whole range of matters. If the honourable senator is interested I could get that information extracted. The Organisation is involved in many areas of research. The Commonwealth is involved in the Australian Water Resources Council. As Senator Missen will know, that Council has a direct relationship to soil conservation because water, along with wind, is both beneficial and erosive. To the extent that the Commonwealth has a co-partnership, we will continue to take part in overviews of water programs throughout Australia. There will be a continuation. Certainly, we would not regard our action as weakening the position. On the contrary, it adds modestly to the amount of money available. In relation to research and our association with the States, we will continue to assert that soil conservation is one of the most vital projects in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some little time ago, Senator Jones asked a question regarding the Minatome (Aust.) Pty Ltd Ben Lomond uranium mines. I intimated I would get information for him and I have done so. I apologise for the delay but it was necessary to carry out scientific tests to get the information. I am advised that following heavy rain in February 1981 water flowed into Keelbottom Creek through small holes in a waterproof membrane surrounding a stockpile of 3,500 tonnes of uranium-bearing material. This material was in its natural form; the radio-activity it contained had not been concentrated by processing and the stockpile was designed to prevent water filtering through it and being discharged into local streams. The Queensland Government subsequently monitored the quality of water in the area and has provided information collected by the Queensland Water Quality Council. The purpose of the limits recommended for gross radioactivity in drinking water, identified by the National Health and Medical Research Council and quoted by the Queensland Water Quality Council, is to signal the level at which further investigation of water quality is required. The dose obtained from daily consumption over one year of 2 litres of water at these limits represents 5 per cent of annual background radiation. For individual radionuclides, health authorities may allow higher concentrations in drinking water-for example, radium-226, up to 10 picocuries per litre; uranium, up to 1,000 picocuries per litre; and strontium-90, up to 30 picocuries per litre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Information provided by the Queensland Minister for Water Resources and Aboriginal and Island Affairs is as follows: As to the gross radioactivity results in Keelbottom Creek, the creek was sampled upstream and downstream of the prospect area six times since February 1981, including 17 February. All results for gross alpha activity were less than 3 picocuries per litre, except one of four concluded due to sample contamination, and for gross beta activity less than 5 picocuries per litre. No significant difference between upstream and downstream results was determined. Recent results were less than one and four respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the gross radioactivity results, the Charters Towers water supply has been sampled seven times since February 1981. All results for gross alpha were less than three picocuries per litre, and for gross beta were less than five picocuries per litre. Recent results were less than 1.5 and five respectively. The desirable maximum concentrations recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council for drinking water are: Gross alpha activity-Three picocuries per litre; gross beta activity-30 picocuries per litre. I am advised that the conclusions are, firstly, that there is considered to be no risk to humans and livestock consuming water from Keelbottom Creek or the Burdekin River and, secondly, that prospecting operations at Ben Lomond have had no significant effect on background radioactivity levels in streams draining the area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have already said, in my absence last week while I was looking at West Block very briefly, and following a very quiet speech that I, Senator Missen and, I believe, Senator Peter Rae made, certain things were said by Senator Harradine that I believe should be corrected, First of all he talked about the number of committees that he was on and said that he was on the Library Committee. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Townley is on one committee-</PARA>
<PARA>In fact I am Chairman of one. I am also a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and still listed on the Notice Paper as a member of the Senate Select Committee into Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania, which is, I suppose, now defunct. At least I am available to serve on select committees. The other point I want to straighten out is this matter of staff and the history of it, which Senator Harradine and some other people have entirely wrong. When the Senate resumed after the double dissolution in 1974 Senator Steele Hall came into this chamber and claimed to be the leader of a party. Therefore, on that basis, I believe, he was given an extra staff member who had travelling rights. I subsequently wrote to Mr Whitlam on 17 July and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I note with interest that the other independent Senator has been given the facilities of a travelling secretary and I would presume that if you feel that he requires and needs a secretary to travel with him, that the same would apply to myself. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr President. It relates to the whole speech that Senator Harradine made. I will be brief. I will not go on at great length. The remainder of the letter said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely we are both in the same situation of having to deal with legislation in great detail, and it would be to the Government's advantage to give us both facilities that enable this to be done speedily. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall await your consideration of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Sincerely yours,</PARA>
<PARA>Following that, on 15 August Mr Whitlam approved a research assistant for me, not, as was said by Senator Harradine in quoting Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, an assistant private secretary. That person did not have travelling rights. Quite a different situation applied to me as an independent as applied to Senator Hall, as the leader of a small party, having one in number. The other point which needs to be made is that the salary that is now given to the additional staff in this place is much in excess of what was ever given or offered to me or to anyone else. To be accused of making a subterranean attack by mentioning this matter in public is not justified and completely misrepresents the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Georges, the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, regrettably has a medical commitment. He asked me to present on his behalf the one hundred and eighty-eighth report of the Joint Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The one hundred and eighty-eighth report is the annual report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. It contains a review of examinations conducted by the Committee during the period to June 1981, issues arising out of our inquiries and other matters which the Committee regards as significant in its development during the year. In reporting this way to Parliament, the Committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. The Committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and therefore the Committee has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting in all areas of government endeavour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The year contained two significant milestones in the development of the role of the Committee. Firstly, the inquiry into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-chemists' remuneration-was the first matter to be referred from the House of Representatives to the Committee under section 8 (1) (a) of our Act since the Committee was reformed in 1952. I commend this practice to the Senate as I firmly believe that it is an extremely worthwhile method through which matters of concern may receive proper scrutiny. The second major innovation for the Committee has been the preparation of the discussion paper on internal audit, our one hundred and eigthy-fourth report. This discussion paper did not result from a specific reference or inquiry, but was the product of the Committee's longstanding interest in public administration, particularly those aspects of management which have a significant impact on the quality of administration within the Public Service. For the information of honourable senators, I will be tabling two further reports tomorrow-one, a handbook on Commonwealth financial administration and the other on the collection and dissemination of statistics which my colleague Senator Lajovic will report upon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee often uncovers areas of neglect which are common across the complete range of Government administration. In our annual report we have attempted to identify a number of problem areas to the Parliament in the hope that they will stimulate greater discussion and consideration of those important matters. I refer here specifically to three issues:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Accountability of statutory and other authorities: The Committee has been concerned for a number of years with the number of statutory authorities, Government-owned companies and other bodies which fail to submit, or submit late, financial statements formally to the Auditor-General's Office for audit examination. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Follow-up of Committee's recommendations: The Committee is aware that within departments there is a very real desire on the part of officers to avoid where possible coming under the scrutiny of the Public Accounts Committee. However, we are not sure that departments apply their resources with the same degree of vigour to overcoming defects which have been identified in the Committee's reports. For this reason we are currently implementing mechanisms to monitor more closely the consideration of our conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Senior management in the public sector: The Committee has become increasingly concerned through its inquiries of an inadequate level of professional management capability in the higher or senior echelons of the public sector. Accordingly, the Committee will be examining the selection and training of senior management in some departments during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980-81 period has been a particularly demanding period in terms of the breadth and urgency of inquiries undertaken by the Committee. The Committee, therefore, wishes to place on record its appreciation to the Secretary, Mr Michael Talberg, and all its advisors and seconded and permanent staff for their untiring efforts during the year. In addition, the Committee wishes to thank all those who gave assistance to the Committee, particularly officers from the Department of Finance, Office of the Public Service Board and the Office of the Auditor-General who have continued to provide high quality professional advice and assistance as observers for all our inquiries. We are also appreciative of the work and valuable assistance of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and his staff and other officers and staff of the Parliamentary departments who have supported the Committee in its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I also wish to place on the public record my acknowledgement of the work of David Connolly, M.P., the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Mr Connolly has a thorough and complete understanding of administration within the public sector and his leadership of the Committee has been noteworthy in that he has been a pace setter in the production of high quality reports. I believe that the Committee has also greatly contributed to the better administration of the Commonwealth. Senator Georges has also been a great vice-chairman of the Committee and supporter of David Connolly. Senator Georges's vast experience, his humour and his timely unexpected questions to often difficult witnesses have a tendency to bring out the truth of the matter. On the other hand, Senator Georges has a balance because he shows a gentleness and kindness towards participants who are new in their approaches to the Committee. I thank both of them for their interest in and support for the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Committee's one hundred and eighty-ninth report relates to an inquiry into the purchase of airport fire tenders by the Department of Transport following the unfavourable comments of the Auditor-General in his report for 1978-79. Those comments were fully substantiated in the course of the public inquiry, and leave the arrangements for contracts between the Walter Motor Truck Co. of New York and the Department of Transport open to considerable criticism. In all, 25 ultra-large fire tenders were ordered from the overseas manufacturer which went into liquidation in October 1980, leaving one contract incomplete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Transport has consistently expressed its own satisfaction with its choice of the Walter fire tenders. It was not the object of the inquiry to question this view, but rather to examine the circumstances leading to their purchase and to investigate the problems and cost of repairs associated with their early operation which received public attention in the media and the Parliament. The Committee understands that the vehicles are now in fact operating satisfactorily. The Public Accounts Committee was particularly concerned to investigate allegations that specifications prepared within the Department of Transport gave a distinct advantage to an overseas manufacturer. The advantage was exacerbated when tenders from 11 manufacturers were assessed by a small committee whose composition was essentially the same as that which drew up the specification. As the report reveals the practices followed by the Department of Transport in ordering 25 fire tenders to the value of $4.2m dollars were not above reproach. The Committee has already brought about a review of those procedures aimed, I am sure, at preventing future circumstances which call into question the personal and professional integrity of some of its employees and reflect badly on the management of the Department as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The saga of the purchase of fire tenders for the 31 airport facilities managed by the Department of Transport around Australia goes back to 1972. Changing Budget priorities, cancelled contracts, excessive delays in finalising contracts and problems in manufacture and commissioning had disrupted efforts to modernise and adequately equip the full time airport rescue and fire fighting service. When tenders were called in November 1975 for vehicles with a 6,800 litre capacity, it was a specification which the Public Accounts Committee considered to be developmental and which should have been managed in two stages, separating the development and testing of a prototype from a contract for the delivery of the number of vehicles, of proven design, required. The Committee had previously made this requirement known in reports tabled in 1972 and 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the inquiry the Department maintained that it had not engaged in the production of a prototype and that an order for the full number of vehicles required was the appropriate procedure. Semantics aside, this action resulted in a situation where the Department of Transport received 16 vehicles all of which required essential modifications and repairs during training and in their early operational life. It is significant that the modification and repairs were particularly needed for the power-divider, a new feature in the Walter line of fire tenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the taxpayer of repairs, modifications and maintenance to put 16 new vehicles into duty approached a quarter of a million dollars in the period from their arrival in August 1978 until 30 January 1980. Most of this considerable cost was attributable to the initial order for 10 vehicles delivered in 1978. It is worth pointing out also that in the period from their commissioning until 30 June 1980, the 16 vehicles were out of service for a total of 1,542 days. In defence of the manufacturer, it should be made clear that many repairs and all modifications were honoured under warranty arrangements and often beyond the requirements of the warranty. Labour costs, however, were met by the department. </PARA>
<PARA> The aspects of the initial contract which were of concern to the committee included the failure to meet the then requirement for Australian industry participation in a large overseas contract. Regrettably, urgent delivery was a more prominent consideration. Relations between the Department and Australian manufacturers are poor, partly attributable to inadequate consultation on the part of the Department and its judgment that they could not meet the technical requirements of the specification. The report draws attention to the fact that the Department of Transport failed to check the financial viability of the contractor. In view of the fact that poor quality control during manufacture was a major contributor to vehicle defects, it is worth noting that no arrangements were made for the monitoring of the production. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome this report as an important example of a lack of proper accountability within government administration. During the course of our public inquiry I personally maintained a high level of interest in this inquiry because I believe it displayed an example of poor management on the part of the Department of Transport-a practice that I believe this Parliament and committees of this Parliament have a duty to prevent. I sincerely hope that the Department of Transport will heed the suggestions incorporated in the report for improved management and accountability. A number of allegations were made that the Department deliberately designed Australian manufacturers out of its specifications and out of the contract. Serious allegations were also made that a former head of the fire services section acted subsequently in a business way with the Walter organisation. There was also a problem in relation to the cancellation with Chubb of the United Kingdom of 12 rapid intervention vehicles. I believe that these examples and further examples which I will mention highlight not only gross negligence but also gross contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw particular attention to a number of aspects of the report while recommending at the same time that all those who are concerned with airport safety and transportation in general read the full text of the report. Firstly, I will put some views on Australian industry participation in contracts such as that for airport fire tenders. The three contracts which were under scrutiny for a total sum which grew to $4.3m went to an overseas company which produced 16 vehicles before it went into liquidation leaving an unfinished contract for nine vehicles which were to have been completed under arrangement by an Australian company, Wormald International (Aust.) Pty Ltd, in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems short sighted that the Department of Transport did not more closely examine the capability of Australian industry to produce its requirements for ultra large fire tenders. I believe it passed up a golden opportunity to encourage Australian manufacturing industry. In fact, I believe it deliberately went the other way. I make the point that monitoring of quality control-a major disaster in the American contracts-is much easier and cheaper within Australia than overseas. One of the problems we detected, which we mentioned in the report, concerned the lack of satisfactory monitoring and liaison. In fact, no use was made of Australian trade commissioners overseas in assessing the credit worthiness of this overseas supplier. Indeed it was a retrograde action on the part of the Department of Transport that it did not seek out from our overseas contacts a better analysis of the performance and creditworthiness of the Walter company. </PARA>
<PARA> I express my concern also that a subsequent contract for rapid intervention vehicles, also needed for rescue and fire fighting services at airports, apparently was awarded jointly to two Queensland companies not experienced in specialised fire tender production. Until proven otherwise, I will continue to show a lack of confidence in the Department of Transport until it improves its track record. I move to the deficiencies of the machines on their arrival in Australia. About $250,000 was required to make these units serviceable. This was at a time when Australia's airport safety standards were waivering on the brink of not meeting international safety standards. This is a very serious charge. The report gives details of the supposed exhaustive and rigorous tests conducted on the prototype in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> What went wrong was that all 16 vehicles had to be modified to overcome what can only be described as defects associated with the design of the power divider. I will explain that. The machine was a single engine unit as opposed to a two unit engine where one engine was used to drive the truck and another was used to drive the water pumping mechanism. Appendix 14 on page 80 of the report shows that 27 defects were reported initially by the Auditor-General and that another seven subsequently became evident. The power divider-this is the feature of the machine which was not of proven design in the Walter fire trucks-was the major fault among 16 fault types which required some upgrading of the vehicle design of all the vehicles. We draw attention to this in conclusion No. 7. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the problems associated with the Walter design are not yet over. It is reported within Australian industry that the former Walter agent, Wormald in Melbourne, which took over the uncompleted contract for nine machines of the 9,100 litre capacity had experienced real financial difficulties as a result of taking over this work. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that there are some important lessons to be learned from this inquiry into purchasing procedures of the Department of Transport. Firstly, the Public Service must consider what it can do about its officers whose management, skills and judgments seem to have been called seriously into question. Secondly, procedures must be reviewed to avoid further scandals which reflect badly on a Government department and further alienate Australian manufacturers of fire tenders who have managed to win overseas contracts but not from the Department of Transport. In fact, they have managed to win substantial contracts from the Australian mining industry but have still failed to win those from the Department of Transport. Thirdly, the total cost of contracts must be considered when tenders are assessed and balanced judgment must be made about what is best for the Australian taxpayer. I believe greater liaison must be established with and more use made of overseas trade commissioners to assess credit worthiness and performance ratings. With those remarks, I commend the reading of the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's 190th Report refers to an inquiry into Petroleum Royalties and Excise. This inquiry was undertaken in response to questions raised in the Auditor-General's reports on a number of aspects of the assessment, collection and verification of revenue due to the Commonwealth in respect of production from the Bass Strait oil fields. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular the Auditor-General was not satisfied that the procedures followed in accounting for and sharing royalties and fees between the Commonwealth and the State of Victoria complied with the relevant Commonwealth legislation or indeed that sufficient action was being taken to ensure that all revenue due to the Commonwealth was being collected and accounted for by the appropriate authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties to which the Auditor-General drew attention was the failure by the then Department of National Development and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to finalise satisfactory arrangements for the verification of the value of production from the various fields in Bass Strait and consequently of the royalties and excise payable by producers to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was appalled to find that it had taken 12 years, from 1968 to 1980, for a determination to be made by the designated authority as to the well head value of the petroleum produced and that for this period the final assessment of payments to be made by producers was left unresolved. The Committee regards this situation as completely unsatisfactory. It is convinced that the whole episode reflects unfavourably on the administration of offshore petroleum development in Australia and on the attitudes of the departments concerned which should have acted more promptly to establish the role of the designated authority and protect the interests of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also informed that because excise varies according to the size of the field by which it is produced it is necessary to draw up a systematic method by which end products are allocated back to the various gas and oil fields in the Bass Strait production area. In addition a mass balance procedure is required to measure the difference between the assumed total input of components to the processing plant and the measured output of end products. These complicated procedures, although by no means precise, are essential for the calculation of royalty and excise payments. However, the Committee found that these procedures had not been properly documented and it is only now in the process of being completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded from this evidence that departments had given advice to ministers in the mistaken belief that the information required to enable ministerial decisions to be carried out was available. It was obvious to the Committee that there had been inadequate liaison between the policy departments developing the program and the department which was to administer it. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the significance of the excise levy the Committee believes that departments have been negligent in not ensuring that adequate procedures were in place. Errors in the collection of excise could exceed plus or minus $10 million per annum and the Committee strongly condemns an administrative system which allows such a situation to occur and remain unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA> During its inquiry the committee considered the legislation passed in 1980 following the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States as to the administration of off-shore petroleum resources. In essence the legislation which has not yet been proclaimed is intended to give effect to the Government's intention to share power over and title to the seas surrounding Australia with the States and the Northern Territory. Commonwealth legislation is to apply beyond the three mile limit and State legislation within the three mile territorial sea. Mining operations beyond the three mile limit are to be under the control of a joint authority consisting of the relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers. In the event of disagreement, the views of the Commonwealth Minister will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's examination of this legislation has raised doubts as to the extent to which its stated objectives will be achieved. Having regard to the powers retained by the Commonwealth and the overall constitutional situation it is the Committee's view that ultimate authority and responsibility over the territorial sea remains with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly the Committee considers that it would have been more appropriate for the legislation to have provided for the joint authority to function both in relation to the territorial sea and the adjacent areas, with particular functions being delegated to the State designated authority as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has therefore recommended that, prior to proclamation, the legislation enacted in 1980 be re-examined and discussed with the States with a view to amendment to extend the powers of the joint authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also concerned that the position of the Commonwealth in relation to the collection of money does not appear to be adequately safeguarded under the legislation. Those responsible for the collection of royalties are State Government officials who are under no obligation to furnish full explanations to the Commonwealth. While the Committee believes that the State officials have co-operated fully in exercising their responsibilities, we have noted recent evidence given to the Victorian Public Accounts Committee indicating that the State authorities are unable to verify information provided by the producers upon which royalties are assessed. The Committee is strongly of the view that new methods should be determined to make relevant authorities accountable to both Commonwealth and State Parliaments. We have suggested that future reviews be conducted jointly by the relevant Commonwealth and State Parliamentary Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The well-head value concept of assessment of royalties and excise is an unnecessarily complicated procedure and one which has not been favoured in other countries which exploit off-shore oil resources. In the Committee's view further consideration should be given to the procedures followed overseas with a view to adopting a simpler and more administratively satisfactory solution to our own needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, our report contains a number of recommendations which we believe will assist in overcoming the delays and complications which have characterised the administration of off-shore petroleum resources up to this time and will help to prevent similar difficulties arising in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to honourable Senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that on 27 August 1981 I tabled in Parliament the Report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission on its recommendations for the calendar year 1982 which was in response to the Government's guidelines for financial assistance for schools in the States and the Northern Territory. The guidelines also included provision for some expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory for certain of the Commonwealth's specific purpose programs; funds for these programs have been appropriated for ACT schools in the normal Budgetary process for the 1981-82 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted all of the Commission's financial recommendations in its Report for 1982, apart from changes in relation to the Transition Program which the Government itself has made following consultations with the States, the details of which I will be taking up later in this speech. The Commission's recommendations were based on the policy and financial guidelines for Commonwealth education programs issued on 4 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated overall value of the Commission's recommendations for 1982 is $1,008.1m, an increase of some 4.6 per cent in real terms over expenditure in 1981. Most programs will be at least maintained in real terms, while others will be increased. The only decreases relate to Capital Programs for government schools which have undergone a reduction of $6.3m in real terms compared with a total Commonwealth expenditure on government schools of almost $480m, in the Special Projects Program to reflect the discontinuance of the school-level Innovations Program and in the Capital Grants Program for non-government schools where the reduction in real terms is occasioned by the non-supplementation of the new places element. Part II of the Bill contains provision for programs in government schools. Part III deals with non-government school programs. </PARA>
<PARA> General Recurrent Grants to non-government schools have been increased in accordance with movements in the government school standard cost and also to accord with the Government's election commitment to compress the present six subsidy levels to three funding groups. Group 1, replacing Levels 1-3, will receive per capita rates of 20 per cent of government school standard costs. Group 2, replacing Levels 4-5 will receive 30 per cent and Group 3, replacing Level 6, will receive 38 per cent. Group 3 schools will receive 40 per cent of government school standard costs in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> In the guidelines statement, the Government announced several changes to the procedures for assessing non-government schools' subsidies. These included changes in the ranges of expenditure from private sources and the consideration of schools' disposable income. It was also announced that the Minister will allow schools disadvantaged by the changes in expenditure ranges to remain at a higher subsidy level for up to two years until they adapt their resources to the new arrangements and that the Government will review any cases where this is not achievable within two years. </PARA>
<PARA> New non-systemic schools, formerly assisted during their initial years of establishment by being categorised to Levels 6, 5, 4 and 3, in the first, second, third and fourth years of their existence respectively will, under the new arrangements, receive additional subsidies at the rate of 10 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 5 per cent and 2.5 per cent of average government school standard costs respectively in each of their first four years of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> General Recurrent Grants for government schools have been retained at their existing real levels, despite the fact that government school enrolments in 1982 are expected to continue the downward trend which became evident after 1977. In continuing to maintain this program at previous levels, the Government has in effect slightly increased the real per student allocation in government schools. Expenditure per student on recurrent resources in government schools has long since exceeded the expenditure targets set by the Karmel Committee in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to direct Commonwealth expenditure for government schools, through programs administered by the Commission, the Commonwealth provides untied revenue-sharing grants to the States. These grants are available to State Governments to spend according to their own priorities and, along with funds from other Commonwealth and State sources, represent the bulk of the total funds for government schools, in fact, some 89 per cent; the States having the responsibility for the administration and delivery of educational services in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1979, the Commonwealth announced the introduction of the School to Work Transition Program for young people aged 15 to 19 who were likely to be 'at risk' in the transition process. At that time the Commonwealth and States had agreed that concerted action should be taken from both quarters. The Commonwealth undertook to provide a total of $150m in real terms over five years from 1980 for the program and asked the States to match this expenditure dollar for dollar for government schools and TAFE colleges from 1982 onwards. This was designed to provide a total additional effort costing $250m over the five-year period. The program commenced in 1980, and the Commonwealth agreed to continue it in 1981 without a State contribution for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> In my statement to the Senate of 11 June, 1981, I indicated that because the States had not at that time indicated their readiness to make additional contributions to match the Commonwealth's expenditure in 1982, we felt compelled to take special action to increase significantly the resources devoted to transition activities. We therefore proposed to earmark up to $27m within the Commonwealth General Recurrent Grants to the States for government schools for expenditure on transition education. From that sum grants at the rate of $10 per pupil were to be provided to each government secondary school. We also proposed to earmark about $19m of government schools capital funds for equipment and facilities for transition education. Following consultations with the States since 4 June, they have, in general, now indicated that they have increased or propose to increase their recurrent expenditure on transition programs in schools and TAFE over the base year 1979-80 by amounts which approximate, and in some cases exceed, the amounts proposed to be earmarked. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the Commonwealth no longer needs to proceed with the recurrent earmarking, since its principal objective has been met. On 22 September it was stated that we did not propose to proceed with the capital earmarking or insist on the allocation of a cash component to each government secondary school. This means that the Commonwealth's own expenditure on the transition program of $27m in 1982 will now be provided on the same basis as this year, that is, a reasonable balance in expenditure will be observed between schools and TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will expect the States to continue their increased effort in transition programs and will seek the provision of information on a continuing basis to monitor progress with the combined Commonwealth and State contributions in schools and in TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth hopes that, in appropriate circumstances, the States will arrange for school communities to participate in the development of transition projects. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the guidelines, this legislation will no longer contain provision for State Governments to request transfers of funds between the Commonwealth's general recurrent and capital allocations for government schools. The Commonwealth has allowed this provision over a number of years but as it tends to distort the basis of the Commonwealth's allocation of both recurrent and capital programs it should no longer, in the Commonwealth's view, be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> A change in the administration of the Capital Grants Program for non-government schools involves the absorption of the annual allocation from the unsupplemented triennial allocation of $25m provided for new places in non-government schools from 1981 to 1983 into the existing new enrolments element of the general capital grants allocation. As each non-government school building project requires Commonwealth approval, there will be no difficulty in seeing that this element of the general capital program is properly applied, and separate provision for this element in the legislation is no longer considered necessary. A further change in this program allows for capital grants to new non-government schools to be applied to the leasing of facilities for a period of up to three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Contingency Program for Refugee Children administered by the Commonwealth Department of Education will from January 1982 become part of the Commonwealth Schools Commission's programs. It will become one arm of the Commission's English as a Second Language Program, with the Commission's Migrant Education Program (retitled 'General Education in English as a Second Language') forming the other. Within the limits of the available funds, up to $750 per eligible student will be made available for intensive English courses for newly arrived immigrant or refugee children whose first language is not English. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the difficulty in forecasting the number of such children arriving in Australia and their destination on arrival, no attempt has been made to provide a State by State allocation of the funds for new arrivals. These funds will be made available to both government and non-government schools in States as the Commonwealth is advised of the numbers of eligible students undertaking appropriate courses. Provision has been made to allow transfers of funds between government and non-government sectors and also from the New Arrivals element to the General Education element of the program. Funds provided for both elements of this program have been increased in both government and non-government sectors. The opportunity has also been taken of partially adjusting the distribution of the General Education in the English as a Second Language element among the States to accord with the results of a recent national survey of students of non-English speaking backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for the English as a Second Language Program for non-government schools have not been allocated on a State by State basis in the Bill. This reflects the Commission's wish to give responsibility to State Planning and Finance Committees for distribution of funds to non-Catholic schools. However, the Government intends that the allocations to Catholic schools in the various States and Territories will be in accordance with the recommended distribution in the Commission's Report. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment has been made to the definition of 'program of ethnic education', to clarify the position of part-time ethnic schools in providing some instruction in the political and religious aspects of culture, as an adjunct to language instruction which will continue to be the major component of the course as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for Special Education Programs will remain at the same real levels as in 1981. There are, however, changes in the legislative provisions for these programs to enable funds to be more widely used to provide services to handicapped children beyond those provided in segregated special schools, centres and classes. In line with this philosophy, the former joint program for the Integration of Handicapped Children has been apportioned to each of the government and non-government Special Education Programs as an identifiable element. To reflect the wider application of the funds, the basis of allocation of funds among States has begun to be changed from that of enrolments in special schools and classes to an overall school enrolment basis. The new allocation formula will be fully utilised within three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-government special schools will for the first time be eligible to participate in the General Recurrent Grants Program for non-government schools. They will not be subject to the assessment procedures applied to regular schools and will receive subsidies at the Group 1 primary rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In Joint Programs for both government and non-government schools, which are dealt with in Part IV of the Bill, major changes involve:</PARA>
<PARA> the increase in funds for the Country Areas Program and relaxation of the criteria by which eligible areas may be selected for funding; and discontinuance of the school-level innovations element of the Special Projects Program</PARA>
<PARA> the widening of provisions relating to Multicultural Education to include projects involving instruction in Aboriginal language and culture which are to be eligible for funding</PARA>
<PARA> revised provisions for programs of education for severely handicapped students to enable them to participate in educational activities outside the institution or private home in which they normally require constant care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has approved the allocation of funds to Programs of National Significance in 1982 on the basis recommended by the Commonwealth Schools Commission as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$'000  Choice and Diversity in Government School Systems  300  Gifted and Talented Children  100  Schools Exchange and Travel Scheme  150  School Evaluation  150  School and Community  100  Education of Girls  100  General Projects of National Significance  503</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1,403</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's guidelines, the Bill will provide for both educational and financial accountability statements to be supplied by State and non-government school authorities in relation to the expenditure of Commonwealth funds. The Commission has been asked to consult with State and non-government authorities in the development of the revised accountability arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Allocations of grants for 1982 for the various programs for the States and the Northern Territory, are detailed in Schedules 1 to 10 of the Bill. Grants as shown now include provision of a prospective allowance for forecast cost increases. The prospective allowance takes account of cost increases in all programs up to the beginning of 1982. During 1982, the allowance is in respect of projected increases in the salary and wage components of recurrent grants. This means that the previous arrangements for cost adjustment have been converted in their entirety to a prospective basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Grants for current programs for calendar year 1981 are also adjusted under Part VI and Schedule 12 of this Bill in accordance with Government policy. The salary and wage components of recurrent grants are adjusted to June quarter 1981 price levels, except the non-government general recurrent and migrant education grants which, in accordance with the established practice, include provision for cost increases to the end of 1981. The additional cost of these adjustments is $40.8m. </PARA>
<PARA> Finalisation of the adjustment of 1981 grants will be effected in legislation to be introduced during the Autumn 1982 Sittings of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI also contains an amendment rewording a provision in the legislation applying to programs of education of severely handicapped children for 1981 to allow education activities which involve the movement of such children from the institutions or homes in which they are normally cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> The education of children in all schools, whether government or non-government, is a shared responsibility of both Commonwealth and State Governments. The continuing substantial overall level of support will enable further real improvements in schools' resource levels. The provisions of this Bill demonstrate the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to high standards in all Australian schools. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this BIll is to amend certain provisions of the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act No. 106 of 1977, which presently covers the giving of loan guarantees to non-government schools in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In September of this year I announced that the necessary changes to the current Act would be the subject of amending legislation in the present Budget sittings. The effect of the amendments will bring the arrangements for the giving of loan guarantees in the States more into line with those for non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory which are contained in the Independent Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act No. 23 of 1969. </PARA>
<PARA> The first amendment seeks to extend the coverage of the 1977 Act to include proposed as well as existing non-government schools in the States. Under normal circumstances proposed new schools do not have the necessary capital assets to offer as collateral in order to raise moneys for projects by borrowing. It is also the case with many proposed schools that they do not have an extensive parent body which can support heavy loan repayments. The widened definition of a non-government school contained in this amendment would then be similar to that used in Section 3 (1) of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act No. 135 of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment would extend the scope of a loans guarantee to cover the payment of interest moneys in addition to the repayment of principal moneys for the purpose of expenditure on an approved building project at a non-government school. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will continue to provide that a guarantee will not be given by the Treasurer unless the Minister for Education certifies that, (i) the terms and conditions of the loan agreement are satisfactory, (ii) in the absence of a guarantee a school authority would not be able to obtain a loan on satisfactory terms and conditions and (iii) a guarantee will not cover any part of the cost of a project that is or is likely to be the subject of a Commonwealth grant, including a grant under the advance approvals scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for an extension of the recovery provision to cover any payments made by the Commonwealth in respect of both the interest and principal components of a loan. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will result in the scheme being more attractive to both proposed and existing non-government schools in the States which are faced with increased enrolment pressure. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to direct a few remarks to the vote for the Attorney-General's Department and to refer particularly to the abnormal delay in replying to a question that I put on notice in regard to whether illegal migrants, or those facing deportation, share in legal aid as distinct from deserted wives to whom assistance in many cases is subject to the ceiling imposed on expenditure for legal aid. I am fairly liberal in my approach to the principle of giving legal aid, but several months ago I asked a question on this matter, instancing the case of the New Zealand deportee, Brett Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not object to Brett Collins trying all the legal avenues available to him to stay in Australia, his rather stormy past notwithstanding, but I am entitled to know whether, in the course of any of these appeals, he has been utilising legal aid. I do not make the point in any niggling way in the absence of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who was very helpful to me in relation to the giving of legal aid in a number of cases in which Latin Americans were involved in broken marriages. In one case the woman had nothing left and was in a real financial mess. Her husband had had a trucking business and had disappeared. She needed legal aid to unravel that tangle and, with the aid of the Minister, was successful. However, the Minister pointed out that, in view of the size of the legal aid cake, assistance must be limited. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had occasion to bring up other cases involving Latin Americans-an ethnic group which has language problems and sometimes problems with the law. Those problems concern not criminal offences but arguments over debts and the like. I repeat, the Minister has argued that the money available for such purposes was necessarily limited. I simply point out to the officers of the Department who are present that Mr Collins has now completed his pilgrimage of litigation. I believe that the matter is back with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). I mention this case as a litmus test of whether people in his position do receive legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by noting that in earlier years there was a great controversy in Canada about the application of that country's elaborate appeals system in relation to tourists-people who did not possess permanent residence. The question raised was whether a tourist had the same right to argue that he should remain in a country as did a person with permanent residence who may transgress the law and face deportation. Two sets of circumstances were involved. I believe there should be some feed-back on this important principle of the utilisation of legal aid. I have alerted the Minister to the question several times and thought that I might well receive an answer today. Perhaps the officers of the Department might advise the Minister on the matter now, so that I may be enlightened concerning it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters which relate to Group A. The first concerns the parliamentary estimates and the amount that has been allocated for the book vote this year and the implication that that, in turn, has had for periodicals purchased by the Parliamentary Library. The book vote, in fact, has been reduced by the extraordinarily large amount of 46.6 per cent this year-down from $74,948 in the last financial year to a mere $40,000 proposed for 1981-82. The way in which it is proposed to cut back Library expenditure in this respect extends to a rather savage attack by the Library on the periodical acquisitions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the further information that has been supplied following the conclusion of the Estimates Committee hearings just how far-reaching that cutback has been becomes evident. Six pages of periodicals are listed as having been the subject of cessation orders. In most cases, they will no longer be received at all by the Library. That is an occasion for great concern and disappointment, in respect of a Library which hitherto has been able to hold up its head as readily and quickly capable of supplying masses of information of current and immediate interest to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the periodicals that no longer will be received by the Library are the United States Congressional Monitor-not only its daily issue, which might be thought to be a bit expensive at $660 for an annual subscription, but also the weekly Congressional Monitor, which is an indispensible handbook for those of us who continue to have some interest in the way in which our American cousin legislature conducts itself. I notice that all student newspapers from around Australia have been cut completely from the list. They range from the National Student to Farrago, Tharunka, On Dit and all the other papers that are well known to emanate from all the campuses. </PARA>

It is a matter of disappointment that they should depart. I do not seek to prolong debate on this issue any more than is necessary; I simply raise it to bring it to public attention because it has not had much attention so far apart from a rather whimsical little note which appeared in last weekend's National Times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Direct Action is not mentioned on this list, but I notice that the acquisition of Arena, another sound Marxist journal, has in fact been chopped backed from two copies to one copy, so there is at least some sensitivity to the pink forces of evil that are swooping down upon us. The French publication L'Express disappears. I think just one other publication ought to be mentioned, and that is the Australian journal Overland, which has now disappeared completely from the holdings of the Library. That is a matter of great disappointment. It is a journal that has been going for a long time. It is partly a literary journal and, I suppose, as such it is outside the scope of a current affairs acquisition library of this kind, but it is also a journal which traditionally has devoted itself to matters of current political interest. Certainly over the years many articles which have appeared in its pages have become quite standard reference material. I notice that Quadrant is not given similar treatment. One wonders what are the criteria being applied by the Library in this respect. I raise this issue for two reasons: One, is to make the point of the general iniquity of the cutback in the Library's book vote, which is associated with a general paucity of cash available in that area; and the other, more particularly, given the cutbacks that have been set in train by the Library, is to make a plea on behalf of at least half a dozen publications that seem to me to be quite improperly given the chop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I raise I suppose also is essentially a small one, but it is one that worries me a good deal on the basis of the information that has been supplied. I refer to a matter arising out of the estimates for the Department of Industrial Relations. For item 370.2.02, relating to office requisites and equipment, $22,200 appeared in the estimates as the costs attributable to the changeover in Ministers this financial year. It is recorded in the explanatory notes accompanying the estimates as costs relating to the appointment of a new Minister. One presumes that the new Minister in question is Mr Viner, his having replaced Mr Peacock; although it remains another possibility that the estimates are once again showing their prescience about possible further developments this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned to see that an amount as high as $22,200 was attributed to the cost of a changeover of a Minister in the area of office requisites and I wanted to know how the figure got to be as high as that. I wanted to know particularly how a component for stationery got to be as high as $12,000. Although it is a fairly piddling sum by any standard given the magnitude of the sums we are considering in these estimates, sometimes small sums and the way in which they are treated can give a lot of information indeed as to the efficiency and standards that are in fact applied within a department as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the Estimates Committee hearings I asked to be supplied with further information on exactly how the appointment of a new Minister could possibly create a situation in which $12,000-worth of additional expenditure was involved for stationery. At the Estimates Committee hearings I was told in passing that it was, of course, necessary to print new envelopes with the new Minister's name on them, to print a variety of new letterheads with the new Minister's name on them, to print new compliments slips, business cards and so on. But the question that remained in my mind was how that could possibly add up to $12,000. The answer was given in what purports to be a disaggregated list of the make-up of that $12,000. Mr Temporary Chairman, I am sorry I did not mention this to the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) earlier, but I seek leave to have that short answer incorporated in Hansard to make sense of what I am about to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I extract just three or four items from the answer. For a start:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Ministerial Letterhead</PARA>
<PARA> A4 bond-50 reams</PARA>
<PARA> A4 bank-30 reams</PARA>
<PARA> A5 bond-50 reams</PARA>
<PARA> A5 bank-30 reams</PARA>
<PARA>The total is 160 reams of new ministerial letterhead. By the way, this material is not made available for departmental correspondence; it is prepared simply for ministerial correspondence. A substantial bulk of paper is involved in that, bearing in mind that a ream in fact is 500 separate sheets of paper. More to the point, the cost of that acquisition of new ministerial letterhead in Mr Viner's name is expressed to be $4,017. If one does some quick arithmetic one finds that the Commonwealth is chalking up a charge of $25 a ream for that ministerial letterhead. That is an extraordinarily large sum of money to be accounted for in that way, given that the cost to the Commonwealth of good quality bond paper without letterhead is down around $5 a ream. Also, further information I received in the last few minutes from officers of the Senate who are in a position to know is to the effect that the all-up cost of printing Senate letterhead for individual senators, with an embossed reference to the Senate plus detailed printing indicating the addresses of a Senator-this often necessitates printing the addresses of two offices-and so on, including the cost of the paper, was around $11 a ream in 1980. Even making allowances for inflation, the cost of that paper could not be more than $15 a ream this financial year-on the information I have been given, the actual cost of that paper would be a maximum of $15 a ream. Yet here we seen this vast sum of $25 a ream being spent on ministerial paper with Mr Viner's name on it. I do not know whether his name is embossed in gold. Then we find this reference in the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>'With Compliments' slips</PARA>
<PARA> size A5-6 reams</PARA>
<PARA> size A6-6 reams</PARA>
<PARA>The total cost to print that is $437: Twelve reams in all at $36 a ream. It costs that to print some lousy 'With Compliments' slips. That staggers the imagination. Reference is made also to 200 reams of A4 bond news release paper for Mr Viner. Clearly he is something of a hound when it comes to getting his stories before the world. He may not be terribly successful in actually communicating; nonetheless, clearly at least he anticipates going through the physical motions. A cost of $1,824 is shown for printing on 200 reams of A4 bond paper Mr Viner's name and the expression 'News release'. That represents a cost of around $9 a ream. I am informed that the all-in cost of Senate Press release paper, which is lesser quality paper, is $5.30 a ream. That includes the cost of the paper. Again, there is a substantial disparity in that. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to consider the Minister's business cards. We are told in the explanatory notes that Mr Viner gets 400 new business cards at a total printing cost to the Commonwealth of $143. Again, that simply staggers the imagination given that-again, I am reliably informed-the cost of printing senators' business cards, which admittedly are not embossed, is about $35 for 500. So somehow we have a figure of $143 for the supply of 400 little cards. I do not know whether they are triple-embossed and overprinted in gold leaf with an opal impregnated in each one, but that is the only way expenditure such as this could possibly be chalked up. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this is essentially a trivial matter when one compares the total magnitude of cost in this case with the total cost we are talking about in these estimates. But somewhere along the line, someone has given a bum steer; that is the only way I can describe it. Either someone in the Department is simply fibbing in producing these figures or someone in turn outside, who is acting as the printing contractor to the Department, has struck the most naive and gullible collection of bureaucrats it has ever been his good fortune to find. Those sorts of figures just do not add up. One can criticise the amount of paper but that is a silly and probably a churlish thing to do. But one can certainly criticise, without being silly, churlish or inaccurate, the amount of money that has been spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter to which I draw attention, again on the cost of this ministerial change- over, is that I asked for a detailed breakup of the whole $12,000 that had been specifically mentioned as being the cost of stationery requisites for the Minister as a result of the changeover. In fact, only $9,742 of it is actually accounted for in the apparently overinflated ways I have mentioned. There is another residual item mentioned at the bottom of the page which just simply says: 'Miscellaneous office requisites'-$2,200. Goodness knows what they, in fact, amount to. Certainly there has been no attempt to disaggregate that or to explain why those miscellaneous office requisites are peculiarly attributable to the arrival on the scene of a new Minister, even one as pernickety and no doubt conscious of detail as Mr Viner undoubtedly is. They are the matters I wish to raise. I think they demand a much better answer, just in terms of the crude figures involved, than the Committee has so far been given from the Minister or the Department concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first matter raised by Senator Evans was the cut in the amount of money spent on Parliamentary Library acquisitions. I point out that that is an internal matter and it is for the Presiding Officers and the Joint House Department to determine what is done. From time to time the serial allocations must always be assessed for continued relevance. Some are cut out and some are added. I make no comment other than to say that that is the case. I turn firstly to this matter of the piece of paper which has been circulated and which Senator Evans diagnosed as being due either to the fibbing of public servants or to some outside contractor getting his break. That was his diagnosis, using his colourful phraseology. The Government Printer did the job; so an outside contractor did not get his break. I do not believe the Government Printer or his staff are fibbing. I believe they are at least as honest and have the same integrity as Senator Evans. I hope he shares that view. I am always worried about people who think that others have less integrity than themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want also to point out that the cost involves two things. It is the cost of paper as well as the printing. There would be the cost of paper, whether there was a new Minister or an old Minister. So, with great respect, there is a misrepresentation in Senator Evans's situation. Is he suggesting that in the future Ministers should not have paper at all? Every Minister will use some thousands of dollars on new bond paper every year. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I want to say is that all this has not been printed as yet. It will be printed as the year goes by. The cost is an estimate by the Government Printer of what will be the likely situation. If Senator Evans had some knowledge at all of printing, he would understand that small job runs involve a high expense because it is the initial setting up that involves the cost. For him to try to equate some small run with the initial expense is to fail to understand the most elementary principle of printing. If, in fact, a half a million copies were run off, of course, the cost per individual unit would not be as great. Therefore, quite clearly, when one has ministerial cards, which I assure Senator Evans are extremely spartan in their presentation and do not involve the opals that he so colourfully adorned his speech with, there is an initial cost. If one takes out of the $9,700 the cost of the paper that would be used anyhow, that would not be a cost involved with a new Minister. It simply would be the cost of the paper that bore on the top of it the name of a new Minister. That is a slight difference in analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, I am assured that the miscellaneous matters are involved simply in the change of office, the ordinary appurtenance of an office supplied to the Minister to equip the office as such. I have no doubt at all that the materials that were used by the previous Minister are now being used happily by him in the Department of Foreign Affairs. If one looks at this matter and cuts it down to size, one sees that the great bulk of it involves the cost of paper which would be used whether there were a new or an old Minister in the situation. The second cost is always there in the initial setup. There is a cost simply of setting up. Therefore, it always appears rather silly to be taken as the cost per unit. It is an estimate at this moment for the year. It may be less than this in the runoff. It is not a matter of public servants fibbing. It does not involve an outside contractor as such. In any case, as Senator Evans would know, there are specific rules and regulations for letting printing matter to outside contractors and they would have been so observed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) for that off the cuff reply to some suggestions from me which I thought would have required rather more detailed investigation before they could be so readily dismissed. The proof of the pudding so far as integrity is concerned is always in the eating and unless I get a better set of reasons why these costs are as they are than I have received from the Minister, I am afraid that for the moment I simply am not willing to accept the explanation that has been given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To take just one example, if it is the case that the business cards are fairly spartan, ordinary little documents comparable in character to those that we, as senators, carry around, I really think there needs to be some explanation of why on a run of 400 a figure of $143 can be specified in the notes whereas on the average run for each individual senator, which is 500 cards, the printing is done-again, I understand, by the Government Printer-for $35. I might have those figures wrong. They were given to me on the run just a short time ago when I sought to check them out. I am perfectly happy to eat humble pie if it should prove that I am wrong about this. But it seems to me that the figure I have mentioned of around $35 for this sort of thing is just intuitively more plausible than the figure that has been given by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly when we are talking about the letterhead, of course it is the case that the cost of the paper provides the most substantial bulk of these cost items. Of course it is the case that that is an entirely proper expenditure, although I would have thought, given the rate at which Ministers are changing over these days, that it might well be appropriate not to incur too large an expenditure at any one time in the course of the conduct of a department's business. Assuming that the runs are only short runs of, say, 10 reams at a time-which is not an assumption that we seem to be necessarily entitled to make, the way the figures are presented, but it may be that that is the way it worked out-why is it that there is something over $10 a ream difference in the amount that appears in the estimates from the amount which I know to be the cost for similar short run productions of senators' letterheads?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the amounts are small beer, but I did not take Senator Carrick to be critical of my raising the matter on that score alone. I simply make the point that when one sees figures of this kind thrown away it has all the appearance at the time-on material reflection it still seems to me to have the appearance-of simply, after the event, finding ways of attaching dollars to line items without any real resemblance to reality being involved in the breakup of that expenditure. If it cannot be done now-I imagine it is very difficult to provide these sorts of figures and further and better information on the run-at some appropriate stage I would welcome some better explanation of how these figures come to be as they are. </PARA>

The first item to which I refer appears under the heading of 'Parliamentary Departments'. I draw attention to the fact that the Committee's report, which was unanimous, drew attention to a matter which the Committee found disturbing-that is, that reductions in proposed expenditure were made by the Government without consultation with the Presiding Officers. It was suggested by the Committee that this 'was clearly in breach of well-established arrangements'. In effect, the Committee was saying that from the evidence available, both before it and the House of Representatives Estimates Committee A the Government, without consultation with the Presiding Officers, substantially reduced the proposed expenditure. The Committee considered that the failure to consult was in breach of well-established arrangements and was a matter for concern. The Committee went on to state:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The Committee referred in more detail to certain other matters in relation to the departments of the Parliament. I will deal with some of the other more detailed points later. On behalf of the Committee I think it would be appropriate for me to seek from the Minister, either now or at some later time, some response on behalf of the Government as to whether it is disputed that there is a well-established arrangement that there will be consultation with the presiding Officers in relation to the appropriations of the Parliament. If that is acknowledged, will the Government undertake that in future such well-established practice will be followed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the comments made by Senator Peter Rae and to compliment Estimates Committee A for drawing attention to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. The Estimates Committee expressed its grave concern at the unilateral imposition of government controls upon the Parliament and trusted that the report of the Select Committee would soon be debated at length. The Committee recommended that the Government give urgent consideration to the report's recommendations. Last week I postponed bringing forward the Select Committee report for consideration because the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) had assured me that he was to have an interdepartmental committee assessment of that report made available for his perusal by the end of last week. I understand that that paper has been presented and that it is the intention of Senator Carrick to bring it before the Cabinet for consideration and comment as soon as possible. At that time I gave an assurance to the Senate that I would bring on the matter for debate before the end of this current session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that the Government, as a matter of courtesy to that Committee, present its comments this week because it is rumoured that the House of Representatives will rise at the end of this week. I believe it is necessary to ask the Government to respond to this matter as a matter of urgency. For a number of years now senators and members on both sides of this Parliament have expressed the view that it is time for change in this important area. It is time that the Parliament of Australia asserted some influence on what happens with respect to appropriations that are to be applied for the effective running of this Parliament and also with respect to the staffing that is required to help us, as members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives, to do our work more efficiently having regard to the development of the committee system in this place. I would like to think that the Government would look at the report that has been presented by that Select Committee in the light of progress. The report provides the Parliament with an opportunity to adopt a gradual approach to this question. I would like the Government to respond to the suggestion of an early reply so that we can debate this matter this week. </PARA>

<PARA> At the Senate Estimates Committee A hearing of 21 September 1981 I undertook to provide additional information in response to questions raised by individual members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Senator Mulvihill raised the issue of Vietnamese refugees employed on strawberry picking at Toolangi in Victoria, following the publication of an article in the National Times in which allegations of worker exploitation were made. I undertook to ascertain whether a Federal or State award applied to the industry and employees in question. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. It has been determined that the 'Federal Fruit Growing Industry (Consolidated) Award 1976' has application to employees engaged in the strawberry picking industry in Victoria who are employed by employers bound by the award. However, as foreshadowed by me at the Committee hearing, the award is a 'closed award', i.e. it only applies to employees who are members of the employee organization respondent to the award. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Bureau has not been able to establish that any employer mentioned in the article is a respondent to the award. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. It appears likely to the Bureau that the employees concerned would be comprehended by the terms of the Victorian State 'Fruit Growers' Determination. This Determination applies to any person or persons engaged in the picking of fresh fruit and has common application to all employers in the industry concerned. It appears therefore, that the matter may fall within the jurisdiction of the Victorian State Department of Labour and Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Senator Mulvihill also enquired as to the level of award inspections undertaken during the last twelve months of employers with employees working at cleaning in Commonwealth buildings. He referred particularly to cleaners working in the Commonwealth Centre in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. I have ascertained this is an area to which no general federal award regulation applies in the States. Notwithstanding individual plant or industry awards that provide for cleaners, no cleaning industry award or awards covering the cleaning of Commonwealth buildings exist apart from in the Federal Territories. Both the Caretakers Cleaners and Liftdrivers (ACT) Award 1967 and the Cleaning Contractors (Hygiene and Pollution Control) Industry (Northern Territory) Award 1978 have been declared common rule by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Contractors covered by these awards are inspected in routine programmed inspections and as a result of the receipt of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Where no federal coverage exists, it appears that State awards may have application. For example in Victoria there exists the 'Cleaners' Determination and in New South Wales the 'Cleaning Contractors' Award. It is possible that the employment of cleaners at the Commonwealth Centre in Sydney is subject to the State award. As no federal award applies to these cleaners the Bureau has not been involved in the inspection of records relating to their employment. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Senator Evans asked for certain statistical information to be made available showing the number of inspections, the number of staff engaged in inspections, the number of breaches detected (or at least the percentage of breaches as a percentage of the number of inspections), the number of workers involved in such breach detections and the amount of dollar sums received (appropriately adjusted for inflation). Preferably, the information was to go back one or two years beyond the inception of the Industrial Relations Bureau.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. As I indicated to the Committee, the information requested, to the extent that it is available, is a matter of public record. I also alluded to certain changes in statistical definitions that may have occurred over the relevant periods and undertook to provide qualifications to the figures where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. The information as available is provided at Attachment 'A'. It will be noted that statistics on the number of staff engaged in inspections and the number of employees involved in breach detections are not included. The former was unavailable prior to the advent of the Bureau, and the latter has never been statistically collected. However, the total average number of inspectorial staff positions substantively filled has been provided. This figure includes the inspectoral staff positions allocated to award inspection and observance activities, staff training the development activities, and award information activities (including receiving complaints). While this gives the number of substantively filled positions, the number of staff on average actually available for these activities is a lesser figure due to staff absences on recreation leave, sick leave, long service leave, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Also, Attachment 'A' depicts the amounts of money recovered following the termination of monetary breaches over the relevant periods. The figures are solely in terms of the nominal dollar values recovered during the relevant period. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. Essentially, monetary recoveries made during a particular period are all those amounts paid to employees in that period, in respect of breaches which may have been committed up to six years prior to the termination of the breach. This situation arises from the provisions of section 119 (3) which allows courts to make orders for the payment to employees of the amount of underpayments accruing in the six years prior to the proceedings but provides that courts may not make orders for payment of amounts accruing prior to this period. Therefore, the actual composition of the money recovered figure-in terms of the period to which individual components of the total figure relate, and in terms of the actual size of these individual components-is unknown and uncertain. Consequently the application of an index (designed to remove the effects of inflation and which only relates to the period in which the recoveries are made) to that figure cannot give a true reflection of the 'real' money value of recoveries made. In essence this qualification is so severe as to make any attempted discounting for inflation (or change in average award wages) unrealistic and misleading. Accordingly it has not been attempted. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. Senator Bolkus sought information on the number of Bureau staff with migrant backgrounds and the languages spoken by Bureau staff. As indicated to the Committee the Bureau has conducted a survey of its staff which has provided this information. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Thirty-one Bureau staff including nine inspectorial staff were born overseas. Of these, nineteen including three inspectorial staff speak a foreign language. Languages spoken by these inspectors are Arabic, Polish, and Mandarin. The languages spoken by other staff born overseas are Italian, Czechoslovakian, Spanish, German, French, Armenian, Arabic, Turkish, Greek, Polish, Ukranian, Swahili, Dutch and Hindi. Fourteen staff who do not have migrant backgrounds, including three inspectors have claimed a knowledge of a second language. Languages spoken by this group are German, Malay, Indonesian, French, Dutch, Italian and Afrikaan. </PARA>

<PARA> 3. It is understood that in 1975-76 the number of inspections represented a count of the number of establishments inspected, but that in 1976-77 (before the creation of the Bureau) the basis was changed to a count of the number of awards inspected at individual establishments. Prior to 1980-81 it is understood that inspections were counted as such when all follow-up action (e.g. breach termination or prosecution action was completed) and the figures for each period did not necessarily relate to the actual inspections conducted in that period. In 1980-81 precise definitions of 'award inspections commenced' and 'award inspections completed' were adopted and rigorously applied, and completed inspections were counted as such on completion of each inspection and associated reports. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will still continue with the point I am making. An investigation carried out by the Industrial Relations Bureau showed that the people who were employed in the strawberry picking industry could be covered by a State award but not by a Federal award. The point I make is that perhaps there could be more liaison with the IRB as a Federal agency and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The crux of the problem is not the actual attitude of the employer to the employees; rather, it concerns what happens, for example, when a Vietnamese middle man is involved in situations such as have happened with Pakistani migrant workers in Canada and in one or two areas of France with guest worker Tunisians. Those situations concern how much such a person is deducting for commission when collecting pay on behalf of the workers. Bearing in mind the extreme detail supplied in this document, I will take this matter up when the Committee deals with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Rather than wait for some action from the Victorian State Department of Labour and Industry, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) might indicate whether any feedback has been given to Mr Macphee, being mindful of the article in the National Times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter I refer to, and in respect of which I will seek leave to incorporate a document not already in Estimates Committee A material, is a misunderstanding-perhaps that word should go in inverted commas-between Mr Conciliation Commissioner Walker and myself on a long-standing inquiry into alleged sexual harassment of female carriage cleaners in the New South Wales railway system. I took umbrage at the fact that although I raised this matter in June or July-the Senate resumed in August-there was no feedback as to what was happening. In my letter to Commissioner Walker I said, in the second paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me hasten to add I was not trying to influence any ultimate decision but to ascertain what progress had been made. </PARA>
<PARA>For my pains I got a lecture from Commissioner Walker when he brought down the decision. The man had the misfortune to be ill. If someone from his office had rung the office of Ian Viner and had let me know, I would have been more patient. I am so naive as to believe that, when one puts a question on notice in June or July, with all the modern office devices something surely could be received in August, without waiting for an ultimate decision in the matter. Without holding up the Committee, I ask for the letter that I wrote to Commissioner Walker, with Appendix B, to be incorporated in Hansard. It is dated 21 October. Commissioner Walker already has a copy. I do this as a defensive measure because another document relating to this case that went to Sir John Moore, to the Minister and to one or two other people was not very flattering to me. So this is a defensive measure. I ask that my letter to Commissioner Walker, with Appendix B, be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Comrade Commissioner,</PARA>
<PARA> With reference to your communication of 5th October, let me say at the outset the crux of our dispute is my 'right to know' as a Senator, which means in essence a reasonably prompt response to questions placed on notice. The fact that a question of this nature placed on the notice paper on the 12th June has not been answered until I raised the issue on 27th August, justified me complaining about the slow response. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me hasten to add I was not trying to influence any ultimate decision but to ascertain what progress had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> No, I wasn't on any recess overseas visit, consequently being in my Sydney office throughout the recess, it should have been a simple matter for someone to phone me from Minister Viner's office on what the state of the play was in regard to this case. </PARA>
<PARA> After all as a Senator who votes for large expenditure for the operation of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, I have a responsibility to see it operates efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw your attention to Appendix 'A', Extract from Senate Estimates Committee 'A', P. 331, 21 September, where Mr Keogh explained how Senators' questions are processed. </PARA>
<PARA> It's also significant that the honourable Ian Viner admitted to me in a letter that I should have received an earlier response. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to your annoyance at my remarks about your physical fitness. Although again it's pertinent to say during your sick leave surely your secretary could have phoned the Minister's office who in turn could have explained the cause of the delay. </PARA>
<PARA> Now might I point out that I attempted to apply the same physical standards to you as I do to myself. I entered the Senate in the 1965-66 era and never once have I been absent from Parliament due to illness. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, there have been times when I have been off-colour but having considerable fortitude I have battled on and seen the session out. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that you and I have a different life style and it's in that context I draw your attention to Appendix 'B' which is a certificate confirming my 30km Walk for Want earlier this year. On reflection it would be an excellent idea if in March 1982, together with your henchmen, Taylor and Donaldson, you joined me in such a walk. </PARA>
<PARA> No, I don't have a vendetta on Conciliation Commission since I have two men whose friendship I value-former C/C Jack Holmes, and current C/C Jack Heffernan. </PARA>
<PARA> My prime job in the Senate is to seek information that will further the cause of the working class and if some Federal officials of trade unions have forgotten that goal, I haven't. </PARA>
<PARA> The late President Kennedy said: ''A man does what he must irrespective of the consequences.'' I adhered to that code when I worked at the Chullora Work Sheds and still do as a Senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rather than allow the debate to run on for too long without referring to matters which have been raised by honourable senators, I thought I would intervene in the debate at this stage. Senator Rae drew the attention of the Committee of the Whole to the report to the Senate of Estimates Committee A which contains a couple of complaints, one with respect to a 3 per cent across the board cut on proposed expenditure and another in regard to the fact that further reductions in proposed expenditure were made by the Government without consultation with the Presiding Officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My advice in this matter is that, in accordance with the procedures for considering the Parliament's estimates, there were not negotiations, as such, between the Department of Finance and the parliamentary departments but rather discussions to clarify certain estimates. The Presiding Officers took into account the Government's budgetary guidelines involving a 3 per cent real reduction in certain administrative expense items in drawing up their initial estimates. But six bids across the five departments exceeded the guidelines and the Minister for Finance wrote to the Presiding Officers inviting them to review their bids with a view to bringing them within the guidelines or to seek exemption from them. In responding, the Presiding Officers held to their original estimates and the Government decided to grant a partial exemption from the 3 per cent real reduction for those items to allow the same amount of money in real terms. This decision enabled the Parliamentary Reporting Staff to receive the full amount of the bid previously in excess of the guidelines. The 3 per cent real reduction guideline and the same money in real terms were calculated after deducting non-recurring items from the 1980-81 expenditure base. </PARA>
<PARA> My advice is that there were no further reductions in the bids as suggested by the Commitee's report but it is true that, due to the tight timetable for Budget Cabinet and the difficulties in arranging discussions at a critical time due to the absence abroad of Mr Speaker and the changeover of the holder of the office of President of the Senate, there were no discussions further to the correspondence between the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and the Presiding Officers. If there is anything further to be added to those remarks, it will be after examination of the transcript of what Senator Rae had to say. I think that is in part a response to the point he has made. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Senator Jessop is concerned, I understood that the honourable senator was aware that the Government had not completed its consideration of the report to which he referred. Whilst it is the intention of the Government that there should be a debate on the report as Senator Jessop has suggested there should be, it is not possible for a final response to the views of the Committee expressed in that report to be put down in the Parliament this week. As I said before, I thought that had been made clear to Senator Jessop and I am sorry if there was any misunderstanding about it. As he said in his comments, however, that does not preclude any debate in this place by him or indeed by any other senator. Certainly I acknowledge the accuracy of those comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill raised a series of matters in regard to correspondence which he had incorporated in Hansard. I will ask the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) whether there is any response to those items of correspondence and let the honourable senator have an early reply. </PARA>

<PARA>As we all know that matter was supposed to be debated in the Senate last Thursday but I understand that, as a result of the Government giving an indication that it had established an interdepartmental committee on the matter and was considering the report of that committee, it was agreed by the Senate as a whole that the debate on the Senate Select Committee's report would be deferred for the time being.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intervene briefly to speak about a matter that I have raised previously; that is, the amount of office space that is available to this Parliament and the fact that the Senate passed a motion on 22 November 1979 requesting the Government to allocate West Block to the Parliament. West Block is inside the Parliamentary Triangle. When I was speaking about this matter a few days ago, Senator Missen intervened to ask whether the Senate had had any reply to the last part of the motion, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Government be requested to advise the Senate, during the first sitting week in 1980, of its attitude to the occupancy of West Block by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am informed that no advice was given to the Senate and that we have had no contact whatsoever from the Government. I feel that that is almost contempt of the Senate by the Government and that it is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I said also that it appears that this place is being set up for the benefit of bureaucrats and Ministers. My thoughts on that matter have been reinforced even more by the fact that the Senate was not advised of the action that the Government intended to take with regard to West Block, which I believe, after having some $4m-plus spent on it over the last year or two, was taken over by the Department of Administrative Services on Monday last. I understand that it is proposed, perhaps wisely, to accommodate the whole of that Department in that building. It makes me wonder what will happen to the parking area for the parliamentary staff. It certainly makes me annoyed that some provision was not made there for office space for people who have to work in this building. I believe that at least half of West Block should have been given to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can appreciate the frustration of Senator Townley when he says that Parliament is becoming a bureau for bureaucrats and Ministers. Much of that frustration may have arisen from the fact that he is one of the one-quarter in number of Government senators who are unable to obtain an audience with the relevant Ministers to discuss the problems that affect them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to discuss briefly a matter which was raised and followed up by Senator Jessop and Senator Peter Rae; that is, the disrespect shown by the Executive to the Parliament and to honourable members and senators. In doing so, I want to refer briefly to the Parliamentary Library's appropriations. During the Estimates Committee hearings it was discovered not only that the Parliamentary Library had suffered a cut in funding of three per cent in some aspects but also that in one item-division 104.2.02-the cut was $123,000, which was in fact a cut of 18 per cent. This cut was made without any consultation. It got a quick reaction from the President and Mr Speaker. In the papers annexed to our report there is correspondence from the President dated 12 August, in response to the Government's cutback, seeking an assurance that the $123,000 which was cut back unilaterally by the Government would be restored. As far as I can ascertain, there has been no response to this request. Such a massive cutback has led to the situation in which, in the course of the Estimates Committee hearings, the relevant Parliamentary Library officer had to admit that the Library's salvation lay in the Additional Estimates. At page 27 of Hansard of 15 September, relating to Estimates Committee A, Mr MacLean, Acting Parliamentary Librarian, said that the letter of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) had some very odd statements in it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been decided that the same real level of expenditure in 1980-81 would be permitted in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I must confess I find it difficult to understand a cut of 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only was the cut made but also it was attempted to be camouflaged in the context of correspondence from the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the Library's performance and function to which I would like to refer concerns the application of the Copyright Act. In the course of its deliberations, the Committee discovered that the Copyright Act is not being applied legally within the Parliament itself. That point came out in a number of instances on 15 September. In questioning, it was admitted by the Parliamentary Library officers that the Act was not being applied and that in fact advice was being sought from the Attorney-General's Department as to its application. On 21 September, on page 375 of Hansard of that day, Mr Greenwell from the Attorney-General's Department admitted that there may still be a technical infringement of the Act but that that was being looked at. The initial point of concern, of course, is that we have in application an Act which the Parliament itself finds difficulty in enforcing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that worries me about the evidence that was given with respect to the operation of the Act is that we were led to believe by the Parliamentary Library officers that advice was being sought at that stage. From further inquiries I have been led to believe-I hope wrongly-that advice had been sought and that advice was given that the Parliamentary Library was in fact acting illegally, even though it may have been a technical breach; that the procedure that had been adopted and that had been declared to be illegal was still being pursued; and that no further advice is being awaited from the Attorney-General's Department. Once again I support the sentiments of Senator Jessop, Senator Peter Rae and Senator Douglas McClelland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the tabling of the report of Estimates Committee A, mention was made of the need for more staff to service the Senate, especially the Senate committees. With this sentiment, I heartily agree. The report made reference, in the form of a comparison, to the amount available to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts and the amount expended by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I think the intention in making that comparison was to ensure that additional staff and funds would be allocated to that very worthwhile Senate committee. I wish to point out that the allocation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts covers the whole ambit of its expenditure, including payments for stationery, special advisory staff and travelling expenses et cetera are allocated in total to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and not charged to the general vote of the Senate. The amount which was allocated to the other committee of the Senate did not contain a provision for itemised expenditure. I just wish to assure the chamber that the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts is a very active committee within the Parliament and the amount which has been allocated to it is fully justifiable in terms of the output of that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. This evidences something in the nature of a problem. The Senate has developed a committee system and here we have a committee report but we are not allowed to speak to it at the time it is presented. If we cannot speak to it at the time that it is presented, there ought to be an opportunity for the Chairman, on behalf of that Committee, to give some lead in relation to the consideration of the matters raised by that Committee so that we have some sense of orderly progress. This afternoon a series of things has been raised, quite understandably, by various people in relation to the report before I, on behalf of Estimates Committee A, and any other member of the Committee have been able to explain it, and to add to whatever it was the Committee wanted to say. Clearly we have seen an example this afternoon, with Senator Watson talking about something the Committee did not say, or misunderstanding what it did say. It would have been helpful if I had had an opportunity to draw attention to the relevant part of the report and on behalf of the Committee to ask for some preference to be given to other members of the Committee to elaborate if they wished, before general questioning and debate took place. It is in that sense that I raise a point of order as to how we deal with the matters that are raised in the report as opposed to how we deal with other matters that any honourable senator is free to raise at any time, or how we deal with the situation where non-members of the Committee may wish to speak about matters that have been raised in the report itself.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I turn next to matters that were referred to in the report to the answer that has already been given by Senator Chaney, in which he impliedly acknowledged that there had been an established arrangement of consultation with the Presiding Officers, but that because of the urgency of getting the Budget completed, because there was a change in the presidency and because the Speaker was overseas, it was not possible for the further consultation to take place. If that is so, it amounts to an answer to the question that I asked, and that is that there is an acknowledgement that there is an established procedure which will be followed wherever possible in the future, and, if that is so, I think everybody can happily leave the matter. I would just like to clarify that that was the meaning of the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pass on-there having been some reference to one or two of the other parts of what has been said in the Committee's report-to page 3 and the reference to the Joint House Department. Some specific references were made there to consultancies, and I think they speak for themselves. Page 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the two Joint Committees administered by the Joint House Department, the proposed appropriation for the Public Accounts Committee in 1981-82 is $83,000-an increase of almost $18,000 over expenditure in 1980-81, while for the Public Works Committee the proposed expenditure is $60,000-a reduction of nearly $4,000 on the 1980-81 expenditure. Salary and overtime allowances for these two Committees are estimated to cost $186,000 and $86,500, respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Senator Watson would have confused everybody by suggesting that the Committee had overlooked the fact that those two figures are quite separate in the report and are identified separately. The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps inevitably, the Committee made rueful comparisons between the funds generously provided to these two Committees-particularly the Public Accounts Committee-and the relatively minimal amounts made available to the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees and Select Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the chamber-it is unfortunate that I am in effect replying to Senator Watson-to the fact that in no case was any specific reference made to a specific standing committee or a specific select committee, but rather to the whole of the Senate's committee system as opposed to the joint parliamentary committee system. I was drawing attention to the differing amounts which are made available, one to the joint system and the other to the Senate's own system of committees. The Committee went on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> It is of interest to note that the average expenditure of the eight Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and two Select Committees operating in 1980-81, was little more than $9,000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the average. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(Excluding salaries and allowances of staff), and the Committee was advised that the Department expects to be able to service Committees in 1981-82 within the provisions of a $117,000 vote (this . . . figure includes a proposed expenditure of $18,000 on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, which the Senate administers). </PARA>
<PARA>The position is that Estimates Committee A was there drawing attention to the fact that for the purposes of operating the Senate's entire committee system, leaving aside salaries and allowances, the amount for one joint committee was almost the total of the provision for the whole of the Senate's committee system. I believe that is a valid point. It may be relevant for Senator Watson to show how busy, industrious and effective the Public Accounts Committee has been. I do not challenge that it has been any of those things. Estimates Committee A was drawing attention to the need or to the recommendation to the Senate that consideration be given to a proper balance between relative resource provision. This is the point. It may be that some other committees could produce just as many reports or more reports and even more effective reports or sit more times to do something else if they had the sorts of resources which are made available to the joint committees. The question is: Does the Senate wish to continue to have a very large amount of resources made available to the joint committees in which it participates, an amount which far exceeds that made available for the totality of the rest of its domestic committee structure? It is not a matter of competition between the committees saying that one does a better job than another, and it is not an attack on the committees saying that any of them do an inadequate job. Estimates Committee A was pointing to what ought to be the real balance of the resources made available. That was the point that was being made. I wish that I had been able to make that clear before Senator Watson spoke, but I hope that I have made it clear now. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other matters were referred to in the Committee's report which I believe amount to this: There was some concern about the way in which the Joint House Department had prepared the explanatory material for information in relation to the presentation of the proposed appropriations, particularly in the light of the fact that the Estimates committees have, over a period, with the co-operation of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and with the co-operation of the Department of Finance and various other people involved, developed a system whereby it is possible to make comparisons and to be able to get a standardised form of presentation of the material whereby we are then able to cross-aggregate to get similar information provided by the various people seeking appropriations and able to compare and to follow through programs, or whatever it may be. It was regarded by Estimates Committee A, when it looked at the Joint House Department, that there was a difference which was of some relevance in the way in which the information had been presented and the way in which the Senate had been insisting that the rest of the departments, authorities and everybody else should present their information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee drew attention to some of the decisions that had been taken in the allocation of funds. At a time when cuts are being made it was pointed out that it seemed there were some rather extraordinary priorities being highlighted. I do not want to go into those; they are set out in the report. But the Committee compared the priorities that appeared there with the fact that substantial cuts were being made in books and periodicals and other items for the Parliamentary Library and whether we had our priorities right in the total allocation of funds. The Committee goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Owing, however, to the paucity of detail provided in the explanatory notes of the department, and to the limitation on the time available to the Committee to examine all matters in sufficient depth, the Committee did not consider that it was able to do justice to its examination of the department's proposed expenditure and operations. Committee is of the view that further examination of the department is required, and therefore recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Senate House Committee for inquiry and report:</PARA>
<PARA> The organisation, operation, functions and financial administration of the Joint House Department. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been suggested to me that as a matter of procedure I should, on behalf of the Committee, give notice that I shall move that the matter be referred to the Senate House Committee, that I will do so at the giving of notices of motion tomorrow and that at the same time I will set out the whole of the motion which would involve for the purpose of conducting such an inquiry the giving of some increased powers to the Senate House Committee which as an internal committee has been without the powers which are normally available to a standing committee or a select committee. In drawing the attention of honourable senators to that recommendation which was a unanimous recommendation from Estimates Committee A I have indicated that I will give notice of motion of my intention to move that that matter be referred to the Senate House Committee and that the motion will set out the terms for the constitution of the Committee so that it may conduct the inquiry. It has been suggested to me also that it may be appropriate if the President did not attempt to wear two hats in relation to this matter. He is normally a member of the Senate House Committee, but for the purposes of the specific reference perhaps it would be better if the President was not a member of the Committee but was able as one of the presiding officers to consider quite independently any report which is produced. That will be catered for in the proposed notice of motion which I will give tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Having referred to those matters which are all to do with the Parliament, I point out that other matters are raised in the report of Estimates Committee A. But I would like you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to invite this Committee of the Whole to deal first with the matters that are raised under that section headed 'Parliamentary Departments' before proceeding to the other parts of the report when perhaps I could have the opportunity to refer to one or two things in relation to the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that it is a matter of the honourable senators who are interested in that section of the report dealing with the Parliament being available and rising and perhaps those who wish to discuss some other matters holding back until it appears no one is rising to speak on matters relating to the Parliament. I would have thought there could have been an informal arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the sort of discussion that we have been having over the period I have been in charge of the chamber as Minister this afternoon does highlight the fact that some thought needs to be given to just what is it that we are doing with these Estimates committees and how we ought to deal with the results of them. It has certainly been my view-I speak now as a senator rather than as Minister in charge of the chamber-that Senate Estimates committees have admirably succeeded in opening up the minute detail of the Government's financial processes. Some interesting questions were raised by Senator Evans about items totalling $12,000 in a Budget which is of the order of $40 billion. That gives some idea of the sort of detail which we get down to but it does seem to me that there is some difficulty for us as a Parliament in dealing with these matters adequately if we try to deal with them not only in committee but also in this chamber which by definition has a limited time to deal with a great mass of detail. It is also extremely difficult if we re-run the reels of Estimates committees themselves for Government Ministers to give responses in a definite or satisfactory way, given that the range and the amount of detail are almost limitless and given that we bring before the Estimates committees a very large number of public servants who are available for very detailed questioning. Even they on occasion have to refer questions for subsequent answer. Indeed, Estimates Committee A has a whole booklet of written replies to questions which were asked during the hearings and which required follow up. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister who shortly will cease to be in charge of the Committee of the Whole and will leave it to my brother Senator Baume, I simply draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that I think there are very real difficulties. The great advance which Estimates committees have achieved is to expose, as I said, so much of the financial detail of Government to the Parliament and hence to the public. I think that is a notable achievement. To my mind that has not been followed up to the extent that the committees are then able to provide a funnel for important issues which ought then to be considered in this chamber, although of course on a quite ad hoc basis important matters are raised, not necessarily in sequence, and so on. Senator Peter Rae's appeal for us to direct our attention to the report of Estimates Committee A and other reports is, of course, a response-he is not responding to my concern-to a concern similar to the point which I have raised. But I make those comments because there is no discipline upon any of us as senators. We are free to rise and to address ourselves to any point, but it does seem to me that the value we get for the public, the Opposition and the Government is less than it would be if we had a slightly more orderly approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the report of Estimates Committee A in respect of the matters relating to the Parliament. In doing so I note the recommendation that was made by the Committee, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Senate House Committee for inquiry and report:</PARA>
<PARA> The organisation, operation, functions and financial administration of the Joint House Department. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that my colleagues from this side of the chamber, Senator Bolkus, Senator Evans and Senator Tate are members of Senate Estimates Committee A and therefore I assume they are signatories to that recommendation. I hope that my party will support the notice of motion which has been foreshadowed this afternoon by Senator Peter Rae, namely, to recommend to the Senate that the Senate House Committee should further investigate the matters set out by Estimates Committee A at page 5 of its report. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this matter briefly because I fear there may be forces at work attempting to expand the operations of the Joint House Department to embrace control of the Senate and House committee secretariats, control of all joint committee secretariats, control of the Parliamentary Library, control of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and eventually, I would fear, control of the Senate and also the House of Representatives. The plan might be gradually to combine all these functions under the control of the Joint House Department. In other words, I suggest that honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives have to be very wary about the growth of bureaucracy within the Parliament itself. Might I say at the outset that I commend my colleague, Senator Young, for the excellent work he is carrying out as President of the Senate to protect the rights and interests of members of this House. I know from my own knowledge, in the occupancy of the position that I hold for the time being, of the excellent work that is being done by the President on behalf of all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I fear that the proponents of any plan that might have been considered have sat down and thought what an attractive bureaucratic organisational chart such a proposal would make. Perhaps they could even see jobs in it for themselves or for others around the place. I say this because I am sure that no one with any respect for or any real knowledge and understanding of the functions of the two Houses of Parliament would support such a proposal, let alone advocate it. I fear that the type of consideration that is ensuing in respect of the report of Estimates Committee A on parliamentary appropriations shows vividly the gulf that has developed in this Parliament between the powers and responsibilities of the Executive, the crumbs that are thrown to the back bench members of the Parliament on both the Government and Opposition benches and the growth of bureaucracy that is occurring not only within the Public Service but also within the Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> As Deputy President, part of my responsibilities to the Senate include matters relating to Senate committees. The figures that are set out in the report of Senate Estimates Committee A are somewhat staggering. It rather staggered me to read in the report of figures relating to the two committees administered by the Joint House Department, namely, the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. I say at the outset to my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Georges that I do not for one moment disparage the excellent work they do as members of those committees on behalf of the Parliament. They do excellent work. But I point out that the committees have an appropriation for the operating expenses totalling $143,000 compared with an appropriation of only $117,000 for 11 Senate committees and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is under the control of the Senate. In addition, inquiries that I have made in my capacity as Chairman of Committees indicate that the staff of the Public Accounts Committee is soon to be increased to 14 and the staff of the Public Works Committee is to be increased to nine. I remind the Senate that generally speaking each Senate committee has a staff of a mere three. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will tell us and the Parliament that only a certain amount of the cake can be shared around. However, the Senate through its Estimates committees has a responsibility to examine the expenditure of parliamentary departments excluding, of course, the House of Representatives. It has a responsibility to examine the expenditure of parliamentary departments just as it has a responsibility to examine the expenditure of government departments. I venture to suggest from my reading of Senate Estimates committees' reports that all of the Senate Estimates committees have done an excellent job in consideration, study or investigation of various government departments. I suggest that the Senate must satisfy itself in respect of the departments over which it has control and, of course, also in respect of its own department, that the appropriations sought are justified and that the expenditure is being properly administered. It is apparent from the report of Senate Estimates Committee A that the members of the Committee may have uncovered matters of real concern to the Houses of the Parliament. For those reasons I trust that my party will support the foreshadowed notice of motion which has been mentioned by Senator Rae in his remarks this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reply to the remarks which have just been made by Senator McClelland. I regret that I was not clearer in my earlier exposition. The estimate of the Public Accounts Committee, which I think is of the order of $83,000, includes all expenses. It includes the cost of travel of staff and advisers and, because it is a joint committee, of members and senators. That amount also includes the cost of printing, stationery and all of those sorts of items. I think that Senator McClelland failed to recognise that these items are included as part of the Senate's general vote for its committees. I just wish to make that point because I would hate to think that we were not comparing apples with apples. We must include, when making comparisons, identical components of the aggregate. I think it is necessary to add up the total components. I just wish to draw the attention of the Senate to this matter. Apart from this matter, I concur with the remarks of both Senator McClelland and Senator Rae.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As an ex-member of Senate Estimates Committee A I want to compliment the Chairman and members of that Committee for the meat that is in its report which we are discussing this afternoon. I am glad that the Committee has recommended that the Senate House Committee inquire into and report on the organisation, operation, function and financial administration of the Joint House Department. This is something that has caused great concern over the years not only to me but also to other members of Estimates Committee A. I have expressed disappointment in this Parliament on many occasions. We have been advised by the Speaker of the other House that the house committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives have no powers whatsoever and that they function in an advisory capacity. This decision has caused a great deal of frustration among members of the Senate House Committee. I will not debate this matter now because I hope that when Senator Rae gives his notice of motion an opportunity will avail itself for us to make an input in respect of that motion. However, I am doubtful that that occasion will arise. Be that as it may, I will confine my remarks to repeating what is in the report of Senate Estimates Committee A. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this proposed reference is accepted in Committee of the Whole and by the Senate, a further motion relating to the proceedings and powers of the Committee would be required. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that these proceedings and powers of the Committee will be of a permanent nature so that both the Senate and House of Representatives house committees have permanent powers and laid down procedures. The minutes of the Senate House Committee-at least this was the case when I was a member of that Committee-are very sketchy. I have had a brief respite from service on that Committee but I have now been re-elected. As I said, when I was a member of the Committee the minutes were very sketchy. Nothing was taken down verbatim. Nothing was ever revealed about what was said by members of the Committee. As a result members of the Committee came in for very stringent criticism from members of parliament who said that we were not carrying out our duties. It was not possible to prove to other members that we were in fact doing our best under the restrictions placed upon us in view of the fact that we were operating only in an advisory capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago-I think it was last year-I suggested to then President Laucke that steps be taken to ensure that minutes of the house committees be circulated to all members of parliament so that they in fact can see what their elected members are doing. I hope that the Committee will agree with the proposal of Senate Committee A in this respect. I hope that its recommendation will be included in the Senate House Committee's terms of reference so that every member of parliament will be full aware of the deliberations and input of members who sit on these committees as their elected representatives. I do not intend to say any more than that on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I want to say a few words about the responsibilities of the various Senate Estimates committees as they are now set up. I was a member of Senate Estimates Committee A for a few years and during that time both the estimates for the Parliament and the Department of Administrative Services came under our scrutiny. For reasons best known to the Government the estimates for the Parliament and the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services have now been separated and are dealt with by two different Estimates committees. I think the reason for this is that members of Estimates Committee A were becoming very expert in asking questions on both the Department of Administrative Services and the Parliament. Both of these departments are very closely related in terms of their responsibilities to the Parliament and to members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney gave us a little lecture a while ago and said that we ought to have pursued most of these matters when they were being considered by the Estimates committees. He said that we could have got our answers at that time. I have complained on many occasions that because of the way in which Estimates committees are now structured it is impossible to get answers. If the Minister does not want to answer a question he says: 'Oh, well, that is a responsibility of another Estimates committee'. One just cannot get answers. I have made requests on numerous occasions that some system be devised whereby the whole expenditure for one department can be considered together so that we can get an answer. Senator Withers used to take great delight when he was Leader of the Government in this place in saying to me and other honourable senators: 'Well, that is not the responsibility of this department. You will have to seek the information elsewhere'. Only a few weeks ago, when I was asking questions during an Estimates committee meeting, he jocularly referred to the way in which he used to handle us. The situation is still the same. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Rae" NAMEID="0P7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator Rae</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What you mean is a full program evaluation across the board. Where it goes through a number of departments it cannot be undertaken by one committee. That is what it boils down to. You cannot follow something through.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; you cannot. It is necessary to run from one committee to another. At present we have eight Estimates committees. It is impossible for an honourable senator to do his duty on each of those committees properly if several of the committees are sitting on the one day. The problem that many honourable senators find themselves confronted with is that they cannot pursue the matters that they want to. One matter concerns the time I questioned the cost of the installation of a telephone for one of the Ministers. When I tried to ask that question in the examination of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I was told that the matter was the concern of the Department of Primary Industry. When I pursued the matter with that Department, I was given the runaround again. I will refer to that matter when we come to the Estimates for the Department of Primary Industry to see whether some of the answers to the questions that I raised are now available to me. I have not yet received those answers and I am very concerned that the Government cannot provide them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some mention has been made of the staffing of committees. That matter too is of concern particularly now with the different party representation of the Senate. When we want certain matters referred to select committees, we are told that there are not enough honourable senators to do the job. Furthermore, even if there were enough senators, there is not enough staff to carry out the work. That is of great concern to me. For example, I raised a matter in this Parliament before the winter recess. This was a matter I wanted referred to a Senate select committee. The Government would not accept that matter but I was of the belief that, when we had the numbers in the Senate, that select committee would be set up when we came back for the Budget session. I am now told that it is not possible to set the committee up because there is not enough staff to staff all the proposed Senate select committees. I think that inhibits the work of members of Parliament particularly when it concerns important issues. I thought that my issue was very important. It was not a matter I drew out of the hat at the last moment. Some years ago I had the matter referred to a Senate standing committee. It was not able to handle the matter as it should have. The committee suggested the matter go to the Ombudsman but, when it did, he was not able to handle the matter. No report was ever tabled. I then sought to have the matter referred to a select committee--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was steered off then and I have been steered off again this time. Senator Baume interjected to say that the matter could have been. When I raised the matter he said there was no need to do that because the matter was being handled. Events in the last week have proved that I was right and that the committee of inquiry should have examined what needed to be done. If it had certain people may not have been in the straits that they are now in. We may not have had very expensive court costs looming in front of us. Had the Senate taken on that job, it could have circumvented that. However, that is getting away from the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I want to say is that there ought to be sufficient staff available whenever a select committee is needed. Honourable senators should not be fobbed off with the argument that there is not enough staff available. Let us put the matter to the Senate. If the select committee is set up, it is the responsibility of the government of the day, whether it be the government of the present day or another government, to find sufficient staff to enable that committee to function. </PARA>
<PARA> On most occasions, Senate select committees do not take long to do their work. As a matter of fact we could have reserve staff set aside particularly for the manning of Senate select committees. At present if members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats can gain the support of the Independent senator, a proposed select committee can be set up. I hope that no select committee is ever set up just to satisfy the whim of some individual. Honourable senators ought to be required to give certain proof that the committee is required. There ought to be a special staffing arrangement so that, whenever a select committee needs to be set up, we have the staff to do the job instead of having to take staff away from the standing committees. Goodness knows, those committees are very restricted in their staffing arrangements. We have had the occasion in this Parliament when we have had to second staff from Senate standing committees to staff Estimates committees. Those staff have to do that work as well as try to do the other work of the standing committees with which they are normally fully occupied. I hope that the Government will take notice of what I am saying in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I refer to deals with the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. We all know what a magnificent job members of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff do. I have taken it on my own shoulders, by way of observation in the years I have been in the Senate, to note the extraordinary work done and the workload imposed on the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. We all know it is not an easy job running up and down the stairs from the time the Parliament commences each day until it finishes-sometimes the next day. I refer particularly to the male Hansard reporters and the way they have to be attired in a collar and tie to carry out their duty. It is all right for the female staff who can come in here with an open-necked blouse. Nobody objects to that. We have set the precedent in the Senate over the years that male honourable senators do not have to wear a necktie. I am very pleased about that. I said, both in a letter to ex-Senator Laucke and in a speech I made here when the Parliament opened, how grateful I was that he allowed honourable senators to appear here neatly attired in open-necked shirts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am putting the proposition to whoever is responsible-I do not know whether it is the Presiding Officers or the head of the Hansard staff-to look at the possibility of allowing male reporters to do their job in an open-necked shirt or in a safari suit, if they are neatly attired. They can do this when away on committee work; nobody objects. Their work is enhanced by the fact they are not frustrated by wearing a necktie. I make the plea to the powers that be that they give some consideration, particularly with summer coming on-perhaps it could be done by way of consultation-to getting some recommendations for some dress reform for male Hansard reporters. I will pursue that matter further, perhaps in the Joint House Committee. I do not know whether this is its responsibility or the responsibility of the Presiding Officers but I think reporters ought to be able to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just returned from a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Fiji attended by some 180 members of parliament. There was no restriction placed on any of those members in the plenary or the panel sessions as to the type of clothing those members of parliament had to wear. Very few members of parliament who took part in any of those sessions were strapped up in collar and tie. They were able to do their work in open-necked shirts or their national dress. I think it is much easier to work in such clothing. It is much easier for us as members of parliament to take that responsibility and suffer the consequences. Of course, the members of the Hansard staff are not in a position to get up and speak for themselves. On this occasion, I make that plea on their behalf. </PARA>

I remind him that the company itself called off the Ombudsman before he brought down his report and that it is quite competent for the company to go back to the Ombudsman. But, by taking away the complaint, it prevented the Ombudsman from putting in a report. If the honourable senator wants a report on the Ralkon situation, I suggest that he goes to the Ralkon people and asks them to reactivate the Ombudsman report. I believe the company may have pulled it off because it may have believed that the report may not have been positive to its case. I do not know that. I suggest that, if in fact it has no worries, it should go back to the Ombudsman and have the report reactivated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLaren also raised a matter concerning the fact that we have eight Estimates committees. He indicated that he thought this might have been done in some way to make the job of honourable senators more difficult. In fact, it makes the job of Ministers more difficult. This is not something that Ministers wanted to promote. We have six Ministers in the Senate and eight Estimates committees. It has taken a lot of work for Ministers to schedule their own attendance at committees. In fact, it was a response to requests from Government senators who felt that, as the committees were previously constituted, honourable senators had less of a chance to play a part and to make their recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take honourable senators through the departments reviewed by the Estimates committees. Honourable senators will find that the first standing committee listed alphabetically on the Notice Paper is Constitutional and Legal Affairs. They will notice that group A includes the Department of the Attorney-General. The second committee is Education and the Arts and group B includes the Department of Education, the Department of Communications and the Department of Home Affairs. The third standing committee listed alphabetically is Finance and Government Operations. Honourable senators will notice that group C includes the departments of Treasury and Finance and the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been attempted is to bring the Estimates Committees in some logical way into line with the standing committees. In terms of the needs of individual senators, that makes a lot of sense. It makes the job of Ministers more difficult. Certainly it has not been done in any way to try to make the job of honourable senators seeking information more difficult or to make their lives more difficult. I hope that my colleague, Senator Rae, might get up and confirm that that is the case. If honourable senators look at the alphabetical listing of standing committees and the listing of the eight groups of Estimates committees they will find that these follow each other. The honourable senators who make up the standing committees might now be on the relevant Estimates committees if their parties so appoint them. This enables them to look at the same areas. In fact, there might be shared expertise. I think as Senator Rae said earlier by way of interjection honourable senators may wish to follow matters through in a fairly organised fashion. </PARA>

Indeed, if this Committee wished to recommend a return to six committees insteady of eight, I would find that very interesting, but I am not acutally proposing it. I repeat that there are eight Estimates committees in an endeavour to meet the convenience of honourable senators and to try to align those committees with the standing committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to respond also to some points that were made about the views of the Executive concerning the Senate and Senate committees. To correct one misconception which I believe Senator McLaren expressed, there is already a House Committee of the Senate, established under Standing Order 35. It just happens that when it sits with the House Committee of the House of Representatives it becomes part of a joint committee. Therefore, it is not necessary to create such a committee; one exists already. I refer the honourable senators to the appropriate Standing Order. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Government has been moving consistently to try to restrict the size of the bureaucracy and to transfer powers and functions from government to the private sector where that is appropriate. At the same time, the Government has been pleased to see the expansion of the committee system. The power and prestige of the committees have been increasing. Far from trying to restrain that trend, the Government is pleased to see it. Committee reports attract better responses from this Government that they did from previous governments. Responses are now made regularly and, if possible, within six months. I point out that there are many inputs to government decision-making of which committee reports can well be one. It is not always easy to make decisions, not always possible to agree with the views of committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall, from the time when I was a committee chairman, that sometimes more than the mere addition of staff is required to make committees more effective. I recall at least one examination some time ago that was conducted of the functioning of the committee secretariat. I believe that it pointed up aspects of management which did require improvement. As a chairman I was very keen to see those comments, which related to evidence of slack time and uneven workload. These are matters, in addition to the question of extra staff, that when I was chairman I would have wanted to take on board. I am sure that when honourable senators speak of the need for more staff they do so on the understanding that the more efficient operation of staff must also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that staff ceilings have been a problem in the public sector. I can understand why honourable senators would want to raise the matter of staff ceilings. The ceilings required for the creation of positions on committees would be a matter that the President would want to take up. I understand that appropriate action to consider such ceilings and the needs of select committees is already under consideration and that the President is aware of the need for people to man the select committees that the Senate has appointed. I understand also that the President is endeavouring to examine the possibility of raising staff ceilings to prevent staffing problems from arising. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, I have no reason to disagree with many of the sentiments that have been expressed. I only mention that members of the Executive, most of whom have served on committees, are proud of the committee system and would want to see it prosper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to reply to Senator Baume, who endeavoured to castigate me in regard to two matters. In regard to there being eight Estimates committees he endeavoured to castigate or upbraid me by asserting that I had not scrutinised the Notice Paper with sufficient thoroughness. He stated, if I heard him aright, that the eight Estimates committees are practically identical with the eight standing committees. Upon examination, I find that that is not so. He also implied that it was the fault of the Australian Labor Party; that our nominations were not such as to ensure that the people on each of the committees would coincide. That is not the case either. We find that Government members also are to be found on different committees, so again Senator Baume's argument falls to the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I referred to the splitting of these committees-probably the Minister did not hear me-my argument was that some members of the Opposition had become so expert at Estimates committee hearings that they were an embarrassment to the Government. I believe that is why the estimates for the Parliament and those for the Department of Administrative Services were assigned to different committees. One could not then pursue concurrently the expenditures in the two departments, which, in many cases, are interwoven. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, I was particularly disappointed to hear the Minister mention the name of a company that I was careful not to mention. I remind him that I if I tried to raise it in the Parliament now he would say to me immediately that it was sub judice-before the court. Despite this, as a Minister he chose to try to belittle me and suggest that I had not advised people of the right way to go about things. I will say no more on the matter unless Senator Baume prefers to provoke me at some point before the court hands down its decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to try to assure Senator McLaren that, notwithstanding what might appear to be the situation concerning his point about the development of a degree of expertise, the re-organising of the structure of the Estimates committees and the attempt to parallel them so far as is possible-I emphasise 'so far as is possible'-with the standing committees was at the instigation not of the Executive. It followed a considerable amount of work by a group of honourable senators who were trying to see the Senate's committee system develop further and become more efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever the honourable senator may think-perhaps it could be the subject of a debate at another and more appropriate time-I assure him that I can affirm that it was not as a result of an Executive plot, that it was not at the instigation of Senator Peter Baume or anyone else in an attempt to try to break up the existing expertise. I like to think that it may prove eventually to have been a step forward, one that will make the system work more efficiently from a staffing point of view in particular and, I hope eventually, from a membership point of view. I hope that a greater and continuing expertise will be developed and available as a result of the combining of staff from the standing committees and the Estimates committees which will make the whole committee system more effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I wish to make concerns the comments of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney. He is not in the chamber at the present time, but I think it ought to be put on the record that the importance of the Committee of the Whole should not be diminished by the fact that Estimates committees have scrutinised the expenditure of the various departments. The Estimates committees were set up to scrutinise the Estimates carefully and to enable honourable senators to come into direct contact with public servants and to ask questions and receive answers directly from them. But in dividing up responsibility for that scrutiny between seven or eight Estimates committees it was never intended that the importance and responsibilities of the Committee of the Whole should be diminished. In fact, it was clearly recognised that honourable senators could not attend the hearings of all Estimates committees, especially as the hearings of at least two such committees are held at the one time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I refute what Senator Chaney suggested, or perhaps advised; namely, that we ought to truncate the proceedings of the Committee of the Whole. It is very important that the Committee of the Whole consider the Estimates and that it do so fairly quickly, examining them line by line, until we complete consideration of them. Many questions have been asked. Examination of the Estimates by the Committee of the Whole gives honourable senators who have not had an opportunity to attend certain Estimates committee hearings an opportunity to ask questions and to receive answers. For instance, I was not a member of the Committee in question at any stage but I was interested to hear in the debate this afternoon the proposition which you put, Mr Chairman; namely, that the responsibilities of the Joint House Department should encompass the administration of the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and that it ought to take upon itself-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Rae" NAMEID="0P7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that he did not support that proposition but I was very interested to hear his criticism of it. I heard for the first time that it was a possibility. I view such a proposition with horror, especially with regard to Hansard and the Library. But there are other areas of administration which are at present the responsibility of the President and which should remain so. I take it, Mr Chairman, from what you said, that the Senate would resist strongly any attempt to bring those areas under the responsibility of the Joint House Department. I can understand the Joint House Department being responsible for security measures and the attendants but it should not intrude into those areas which have a special significance and a special character. We have here an instance of a situation in which the Committee of the Whole can be made aware of a proposition and honourable senators can enter into debate on it and support or criticise it. I take it that the remarks made by Senator Chaney were his own opinion, based on the fact that he would like to see the program disposed of quickly. He is an ex-Government Whip and, of course, his purpose as Government Whip was to get the legislature to dispose of a program as quickly as possible. However, he should not impose his views arbitrarily upon the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I raise is the cost of operating the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I do not know whether the earlier reference to this matter was a criticism-perhaps I could be advised on that. I was quite surprised to get the impression that it was being suggested that, because the Senate committees were not receiving sufficient finance to enable them to operate effectively, we should look at another committee to see whether its expenditure could be reduced. The best way to deal with the problem is to look at the fact that the Public Accounts Committee is staffed effectively and it needs the staff which it has. It needs its budget in order to carry out its work effectively. If other Senate committees do not have sufficient funds, we ought to increase the budget for those committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish the honourable senator could explain that to me. For only some 18 months I have been a member of the Public Accounts Committee. I have been a member of various other Senate committees as well. The Public Accounts Committee meets regularly twice a week throughout the session and during the recess its workload is tremendous. In fact, the honourable senators who are members of the Committee find it very difficult to cope with the tremendous burden. The Public Accounts Committee is also the Committee which works very closely with the Auditor-General. Its work should not in any way be limited or truncated by budgetary requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with that. If that is the proposition, I have no argument with it. But if the proposition is that we should be critical of the budget of the Public Accounts Committee I disagree. We should not be critical of that; we should be critical of the fact that the other committees are not receiving sufficient funds to carry out their work as effectively as the Public Accounts Committee carries out its work. For instance, the Public Accounts Committee is again looking at a reference for which Senator Chaney's Department is still responsible; namely, an overpayment of $40m. The Committee investigated an overpayment of $135m. It is investigating all sorts of shortages revealed by the Auditor-General and any decision which affects the Committee's ability to work should be resisted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer once again to the financing of the Senate committees. The Senate committees, especially the standing committees and the select committees, perform a very effective function, as honourable senators will know. That is not self-adulation; that is a fact of life. Let us consider the situation of the Senate committee which is now called the Rae Committee. That Committee, over five years carried out an investigation into securities and exchange issues. If the investigation had been conducted by a royal commission it would have cost us $2m or $3m. Honourable senators might recall we had a Senate committee which looked at off-shore petroleum resources. It brought down a report and possibly cost the Senate $30,000 or $40,000, if that. The royal commission which covered almost the same area but which did not canvas the problem as well as the Senate Committee covered it cost the taxpayer $1.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Committee and the Parliament as a whole that the work of the Senate committees and the quality of the reports which emerge from them are such that the amount of money spent on them is negligible and should not come into question at all. Rather, we should be looking at funding the committees in such a way that their work is in no way diminished. If it costs $117,000 to fund the Public Accounts Committee, it is reasonable to expect that some of the Senate committees which have important references should be funded equally. Since the funding that the committees need is not taken up by travel expenses or, for that matter, fees for committee members, it follows that extra money would go to staffing the committees. I think it is absolutely necessary that when a Senate committee begins a specific inquiry it should be able to build up its staff by bringing in experts in the area which is being investigated. Otherwise the small amount of money that is spent is wasted. It is far better to spend three or four times the amount of money that is being spent at present and get a good result than it is to save money and get a poor result. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of that, I think the reports that come down from the Senate committees are valuable documents which have a continuing value in the area of research. I am supporting the propositions that are being brought forward to upgrade the support for Senate committees. If some rationalisation between the standing committees and the Estimates committees can be achieved and that leads to extra staffing and facilities, by all means we ought to expedite that. I would have liked to make one or two other criticisms but I think Senator McLaren covered them. It is quite comforting to hear Senator McLaren again. One realises that he has been missing. He is missing at the moment. Sitting here is like having a set of headphones on and the only voice coming through happens to be that of Senator McLaren. Nevertheless, this chamber missed him while he was away and certainly will not miss him if he happens to go away again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from the fact that no other honourable senator rose to speak that what honourable senators wished to be said in relation to the Parliament has been said. That being so, I pass on to drawing attention to one or two other parts of the report of Estimates Committee A. In relation to the Attorney-General's Department, the Committee expressed its enthusiasm for the fact that the Attorney-General's Department had responded to some suggestions and requests from the Committee in relation to the provision of information and had no further comment to make which it would seek to have the Senate take into account in relation to its consideration of those appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the Department of Industrial Relations, the Committee in its report referred to the fact that whilst it had previously expressed its concern about the extraordinary accurate estimating and about whether it was not an example of estimating and spending up to the amount of the estimate, we found that an inquiry into the estimating practices and control procedures of the Department and the Industrial Relations Bureau which had been conducted by the Department of Finance had shown that those practices and procedures were satisfactory. The Committee makes no further comment in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in respect of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs I wish to draw attention to the fact that the Committee found that it was confronted with a one-line appropriation in relation to the National Companies and Securities Commission. This matter arises as a result of the fact that that Commission is established under a ministerial council made up of Ministers of the Commonwealth and each of the States. There was a suggestion that it was not possible to provide to the Senate Estimates Committee and, therefore, to the Senate before it dealt with the appropriations any details at all of how the money sought would be expended. That matter was expressed as being one of some concern if it inevitably arises, as a result of the adoption of the Federal approach of a joint Commonwealth and State commission. If being accountable to everyone means being accountable to no one, that is a matter of some concern which this chamber may wish to take up if it finds that the position is repeated. I have reason to believe that it is not likely to be repeated and, therefore, I do not wish to pursue it in any further detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter to which I would like to draw attention is referred to on page 9 of the Committee's report. This matter was raised earlier by Senator McLaren and it has been raised by various honourable senators over the years. This is the problem which I would describe with the words 'program evaluation'. The fact is that in respect of a particular government program there are appropriations which appear in a number of different departments and in a number of different divisions within a department. It is very hard for anybody who is a member of one Estimates committee to be able to find out effectively the total costing of that program and whether the results of the program represent an effective use of the total amount of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion made by Estimates Committee A on the bottom half of page 9 is that it would appear that there is no reason why the explanatory notes should not be added to a little further. I hope that this at least could be pursued without a commitment being given at this stage unless, by some miracle, the advice of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) is such that it enables him to give a commitment. I hope the matter can be explored and that the explanatory notes could provide a cross-reference to other parts of a program so that anyone interested, including the members of the Committee receiving those explanatory notes, would be able to find where other parts of the program were provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in at least some cases, if not all, the internal working records of the Department, which are prepared at the same time as part of the total explanatory notes, contain that information so that no extra work ought to be necessary in providing the information as part of the explanatory notes. Estimates Committee A commends that thought and seeks a response in due course as to the practicality of that course being followed to enable a more effective program evaluation role to be fulfilled by Estimates committees and by the Senate. On behalf of Estimates Committee A, those are the matters to which I seek to draw attention and which arise out of the Committee's report. </PARA>

I heard Senator Townley earlier today make some reference to it. Mr Chairman, I know that you had some interest in that building.

Having looked at it, it is my view that, in conjunction with the Hotel Kurrajong, which has very considerable accommodation, it ought to be at least sufficient to accommodate all facilities for the Parliament and that the very unsatisfactory accommodation at the Hotel Canberra might be abandoned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the three requests for amendment to the estimates for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment which have been circulated in my name. The purpose of these requests is a simple one. It is to bring a series of separate grants to arts bodies back under the control of the Australia Council, the body set up by the Government to decide on such grants. There is no increase in the Budget outlays; it is just an overdue administrative straightening out. What has happened in recent years has been that various bodies-the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet, the Elizabethen Theatre Trust Orchestras and Artbank-have managed to bypass the Australia Council and get their funds direct from the Cabinet, despite frequent protests by the Australia Council. It is not difficult to see how this situation has come about. Many politicians and public servants fancy themselves as latter day Medicis. The trouble is that they are usually totally unqualified to make such critical artistic decisions. Besides, as they all eventually realise-some more slowly than others-it is terrible politics. For every friend one makes with a generous arts grant one makes 10 enemies who do not get what they think they should. That is bad politics in anyone's terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is for this reason, as well as the requirements of efficient arts administration, that we, in common with other countries, have adopted the so-called arm's length system in administering the arts. Under the arm's length system the Government decides the total amount available for the arts, appoints a body of experts to develop policies and decide on the actual distribution of grants between the many competing applicants and to take any resultant criticism. The Australia Council has been set up to perform this role. The Council was restructured last year to reduce its size to 14 members, the majority of whom must be arts practitioners, and to ensure that it had control over the activities and expenditures of the seven specialist boards, whose members are experts in their fields. But there had been a feeling that some of the boards were making idiosyncratic decisions. The new arrangements ensure that the Council is able to impose a coherent policy. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem simple to give the Australia Council whatever funds the Government thinks appropriate and leave the Council to get on with it. Of course, that would not please everyone. No one can possibly do that with arts grants, however lavish the funds. But at least the funds would be distributed by knowledgeable people, in accordance with a coherent policy, and there would be time for those making the decisions to consider the details of the competing demands and the consequences of their decisions and to detect padded budgets and so on. It is routine, of course, but it is time consuming. It must be done if our arts administration is to be efficient and fair. This is the way our system is supposed to work, but it is not the way it actually works. The authority of the Australia Council has been steadily eroded, a situation which is continued in these estimates. I have complained to successive Ministers year after year and have been fobbed off with some story such as: 'It is just a temporary situation; we are sorting it out'. I think that it is time to take a stand. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to individual items in the estimates, the first to be discussed is Art Bank, which is part of Division 330. Art Bank was established two years ago to co-ordinate all Commonwealth art lending activities and to acquire works of art for placement on hire in public places. Art Bank this year gets $425,000. Let us compare this with the Visual Arts Board, one of the seven boards of the Australia Council. One function of this board is also to commission and place works of art in public places as well as to support the acquisition and exhibition of works of art. It, not Cabinet, would surely be the most suitable body to decide how much of the available funds should be allocated to Art Bank. The same argument would apply to the Australian National Gallery, which this year will receive $10m for construction and $15m for administration and acquisition of works of art. I think that the Government, having made the decision to establish a national gallery and a national collection, is correct to fund its setting up directly. But once the gallery is finished and open, its administration costs and its grants for further acquisition should come under the Australia Council, to be considered by experts in balance with the other demands on the available funds for the arts as a whole. But that is a problem for the future. I do not suggest any immediate change to these National Gallery grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The votes that I think should be changed, and should be changed at once, are the allocations of $3.337m to the Australian Opera, $1.602m to the Australian Ballet Foundation and $2.740m to the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras. These are part of the Australia Council vote, but they are not under the control of the Australia Council. Cabinet decides how much these organisations get. The Australia Council has control over only its vote for administrative expenses and for an item entitled 'General Support for the Arts'. The trouble is that the Australia Council is assisting at least five other opera companies, at least 14 other dance groups and at least five other orchestras out of the vote under its control. Obviously there should be co-ordination between the grants. Equally obviously, there will not be a sensible result if arbitrary decisions about some of the companies are made by one body and the remainder by another-a sort of artistic competition in pinning the tail on the donkey. </PARA>
<PARA> Are the Cabinet decisions arbitrary? How does Cabinet decide the amounts? What Cabinet decided was that the flagships-a deplorable expression, by the way-the Opera, the Ballet and the Trust orchestras should receive the same amount in real terms as last year and the Australia Council should receive the same amount in money terms as last year for everyone else. This is, I suppose, a clear decision, although it is not a very sensible one. I do not suppose it is reasonable to expect the Cabinet, when dealing with an expenditure of $40 billion, to delve very deeply into the expenditure of a few millions or to consider the relative value of alternative uses of these funds. Cabinet just makes a broad brush decision and moves on to the next item, which is, of course, why such decisions should not be made by a busy Cabinet but should be delegated to a less busy expert body. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is, as I have said, that the Cabinet decision was not very sensible. The maintenance of the non-flagship arts funds at a constant money level does not work out that way, because the administrative costs of the Australia Council have to come out of these funds before they are distributed. These administrative costs have risen by 10 per cent this year. As a consequence, the funds available for distribution to arts bodies and individuals are down sharply, by 2.2 per cent. Of course, a drop of 2.2 per cent in money terms would mean a drop of at least 12 per cent in real terms. As the complaints start to come in to senators, I think they will realise how severe the cuts really are. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the 10 per cent increase for the three flagship companies-the amount needed to maintain their grants constant in real terms? At least one of these is very peculiar indeed. The Australia Council recommended that this maintenance of real value should apply to the Australian Opera but that the Australian Ballet should receive no increase in funding on the grounds that as it made a profit of $322,000 last year and has accumulated funds of $2.5m there was no justification for an increase in Government support. Yet the Ballet grant will go up when almost every other grant will go down. I emphasise that my remarks have nothing to do with the present problems of the Ballet, although these have been brewing for a long time. The impotence of the Government is ominous despite the fact that as the paymaster it should be able to impose its will. This emphasises the lack of an independent, informed intermediary which, using the privileges of the piper, could have headed off the problems of the Ballet before they reached the present crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> This direct Cabinet involvement is, as I said earlier, terrible politics. The Opera and Ballet are widely, though a little unfairly, regarded as Sydney and Melbourne companies. For the Government to increase their grants and to cut back on everyone else will cause great resentment. It may be the right decision but the question is who should make it. It is clearly in the Government's interests that such decision should be made, and should be known to be made, by an independent professional body. I am suggesting that all these grants should be collapsed into the single vote entitled 'General Support for the Arts' and distributed by the Australia Council at its discretion. In practice, there would not be much alteration for the flagship companies this coming year although some trimming should be possible in the Ballet grant to the benefit of other arts bodies. But major shifts are neither possible nor desirable, for expenditures are necessarily planned a long way in advance and major companies such as the Ballet and the Opera need some confidence that they will have reasonable maintenance of funding. I do not think the Cabinet is likely to be a better basis for this assurance than a professional body such as the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> What objections are there to what I propose? I have really heard only two. One is that the Australia Council would not support the flagship companies properly, that it would deliberately underfund them as a means of blackmailing the Government into making more funds available for the arts. I do not know who planted this idea, although I have my suspicions, but it is most insulting to the artistic integrity of the Australia Council. Since the 1980 reorganisation, all major changes in funding have to be made by the Council itself, so no one should fear a board running wild. I am sure that the Council is fully aware of the great national artistic asset represented by the Ballet and the Opera and the importance of funding them adequately. To be sure, the Council would look at their proposals with a more informed and critical eye than is possible for a busy and uninformed Cabinet. After all, that is what the Australia Council is for. But I am sure that the Australia Council would foster these two major world class companies. I cannot for the life of me imagine what the Government is worried about. After all, every member of the Australia Council and every member of every board of the Australian Council was appointed by this Government and the structure of responsibility was substantially modified in accordance with this Government's wishes. Why cannot they be trusted?</PARA>
<PARA> The second argument is that it would be somehow unfair not to increase the Australian Ballet's grant from the Government just because it is running at a profit. This reveals a very peculiar approach to the purpose of government support for the arts. I think that companies should certainly be encouraged to build up reserves to, say, 20 per cent of the annual operating costs-to deal with the unpredictabilities of being an arts entrepreneur. That has already been achieved by the Australian Ballet, generously. What has to be considered is the level of government support which is needed by the Australian Ballet and the relative artistic value of alternative uses of these funds. Different art forms have different cost structures and different possibilities of box office takings and commercial sponsorship. In my limited experience as an entrepreneur I have found classical ballet a very marketable product. Some would also say the Australian Ballet's commercial success has come in part from following the dancing equivalent of Nellie Melba's advice-'sing 'em muck'. But there is no doubt that it is also capable of performances which are superb by any standards. Nevertheless, it is clearly absurd for the Cabinet to override the Australia Council's advice that no increase in the Ballet's funding was justified and to award it a 10 per cent increase-that is, an additional $146,000. I cannot imagine what possible source of professional advice led Cabinet to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope my arguments will have persuaded most honourable senators and I hope also they have persuaded the Cabinet. To encourage Cabinet to make a sensible decision, I point out that what it is doing is flatly contradictory to the draft Federal platform of the Liberal Party of Australia. I should like to draw particular attention to this sentence from that platform:</PARA>
<PARA> Particular judgments should be made by those having specialist knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not have expressed it better myself. Sensible administration, proper development of the arts and the draft Federal platform of the Liberal Party all point in the same direction-the direction of these requests. I commend them to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must make some comments on the appropriations dealt with by Estimates Committee B and in particular I must respond to some of the points raised by Senator Hamer. It is not the intention of the Federal Opposition to support the requests for structural change in the appropriation described by Senator Hamer. This is not to say that we do not agree with many of the criticisms he has just enumerated with regard to the unhappy consequences of the particular form of the appropriation for the performing arts in this year's Budget. However, Senator Hamer's suggestion that all the funding should be brought back into one central fund and that the flagship companies-the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet and the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras-should compete for funding from the Australia Council in the same way as the other parts of the performing arts, mainly the boards of the Australia Council, is not a proposal we can support at this particular stage, because it does not address the fundamental reasons for the crisis in the performing arts that we have at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This crisis is a result not fundamentally of the way the appropriation has been organised but of the inadequacy of the appropriation itself and of the inadequacy of the various structures of administration which have been allowed to develop during the six years of Fraser Government administration of the arts. In the view of the Opposition, there is no point at this stage in trying to readjust the method by which the funding is disbursed between the boards of the Australia Council and the national companies if the overall allocation is as woefully inadequate as it is. There is no point at this stage in saying that the Australia Council should resume the very onerous and demanding task of administering the funding of the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet and the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras when the administration and the administrative structure of the Australia Council itself is a matter of some concern to the Opposition. So, at this stage, sympathetic as we are to many of the criticisms raised by Senator Hamer and sympathetic as we are to the view that there ought not to be special favoured treatment of national companies simply by virtue of their being national companies, we see no practical sense in supporting the requests that he has described. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear that we are very unhappy with the fact that the Cabinet has chosen to give what is perceived as being favoured treatment to the national companies while ensuring through its paltry appropriation to the Australia Council for general support of the arts, that the Australia Council boards have had to engage in a slashing exercise in regard to the assistance it gives to the various companies throughout Australia. In fact, one of the very unhappy consequences of the division between the Cabinet decision for the national companies and the Australia Council decision for everyone else has been the development of a very destructive rivalry between the supporters of the national companies and the supporters of the various other companies throughout Australia. That kind of rivalry and that kind of competition, I suggest, are quite destructive and unhealthy. It has led to what I believe to be unfair attacks on the national companies from those who feel their own companies are being damaged because of the favoured treatment of the national companies and it has led also to an unsympathetic approach to the problems of the smaller companies by people who are supporting the national companies. So it is altogether an unsatisfactory situation. The Federal Opposition sees no advantage in having national companies versus other companies, fighting each other. We want to see a coherent national arts policy adequately funded so as to ensure the maintenance of all artistically viable endeavours in this country, so as to ensure the assistance of innovation, the creation of new companies and the flourishing of new talent but at the same time the maintenance of the highest possible standards in our national companies. Of course, this coherent policy is exactly what is lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer has mentioned that the ability of the Australia Council to make artistic decisions has been drastically reduced by the decision of Cabinet to ignore the advice of the Council. He did not mention one other reduction in the Australia Council's ability to make choices; that is, the Cabinet decision to allocate $500,000 for an Arts Festival to coincide with the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane next year. That may or may not be a useful initiative in the arts, but it is the sort of decision on which, I agree with Senator Hamer, the judgment ought to have been an artistic one or one made by the expertise available within the Australia Council and not made as a grandstanding exercise by Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the real problems facing the performing arts today and causing a crisis in the performing arts today go much deeper than the method of appropriation. We have, as I speak, a crisis in theatre throughout Australia. The news of the Theatre Board's allocations to various theatre companies throughout Australia hit the media today. Those companies were informed of that today and I, and I presume many other senators, have been inundated with complaints about the number of companies which will go under or whose future will be jeopardised because of arbitrary across-the-board cuts which have nothing to do with the artistic viability of the companies and nothing to with the consumer demand for their services or public approval of their services but only to do with the Government's ideological attack on the public sector which says that there must be across-the-board cuts. We have that sort of crisis in the theatre, and I will go into that in some detail. We also have a situation in which the Australian Ballet, for a long time one of the proudest creations of the Australian arts scene, is on strike, and for very good reasons. We have the Australian Opera going into a massive retrenchment of permanent officers which, although it may lead to some sort of improvement in efficiency, is the sort of drastic action which is controversial, which causes people to become embittered and which causes the public confidence in the administration of the Australian Opera to be very badly shaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening as far as theatre is concerned. The Australian Council as a whole announced in a Press release on 8 October that there would be a shift in the allocation of money within the Council towards activities of initial creativity. That is a shift which in principle the Opposition would endorse but which in practice, because of the paltry sum that the Theatre Board has had to administer, has meant that many companies, including those engaged in initial creativity and innovative activity, have been severely cut. The Theatre Board has had to deal with a 10 per cent reduction in its own Budget. The amount that it has had to distribute has been less in dollar terms than it was last year, despite the fact that last year inflation reached a figure of 10 per cent. In fact, it has had only $5.4m to distribute this year. The Theatre Board had to set priorities and it decided that its priorities would be dance and young people's theatre, priorities which in principle we would endorse but which have led to a series of decisions which have given rise to my claim today that there is a crisis in Australian theatre. </PARA>
<PARA> Most major companies will suffer. The area of drama will bear the brunt of the funding reductions. Eight companies face the prospect of the cessation of all funding. They will receive no funds this year from the Theatre Board. Those companies are: The Australian Performing Group; the Brisbane Repertory; the Ensemble Theatre, New South Wales; the Hole in the Wall Theatre, Western Australia; PACT Theatre, New South Wales; the Stage Company, South Australia; the Theatre Works, Victoria; and the Why Not Theatre, Victoria. The funding of most other drama companies will be cut by a minimum of 10 per cent. The Marion Street Theatre and the Q Street Theatre are in that category. La Boite Theatre in Brisbane will lose all funding for its main season while retaining funds only for its youth activities. I would say that the approach to the La Boite Theatre demonstrates how the setting of priorities by the Theatre Board is simply not possible in the current economic climate. La Boite Theatre was engaged, and I am sure that Senator Georges can endorse this, in innovative theatre and would have, one would have thought, fulfilled the new criteria of the Theatre Board in that it was involved in the development of new talent, new ideas in theatre and so on. It was by no means what one could describe as an establishment theate company; yet it has lost all of its funds with the exception of its funds for youth theatre. The funds for the Nimrod Theatre will be reduced by 15 per cent. Other major State companies, including the Sydney Theatre Company and the Melbourne Theatre Company, face 20 per cent reductions in funds, as do most entrepreneurial organisations, including the Canberra Theatre Trust. So it seems that an establishment theatre providing conventional but very acceptable services year in and year out faces cuts and an innovative struggling company attempting to do something new in theatre also faces cuts. The cake is simply not large enough. That is why we are not persuaded that Senator Hamer's suggestions provide any real solution to the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> When we pass to the Australian Ballet we find an appalling situation. The dancers are on strike. They are on strike after years of frustration caused by poor administration and, I suggest, inappropriate appointments to the Board of the Australian Ballet by the Fraser Government. The dancers have had to endure working under substandard conditions. There have been stories in the media about being forced to perform when suffering injuries. But the most obnoxious feature of what has happened in the administration of the Australian Ballet recently is that an arbitration commission award establishing a certain wage level and certain conditions of performance for principal dancers has simply been set aside by the administrator. The administrator's response to the setting of an award by the arbitration commission has been simply to say: 'We will downgrade you so that you are no longer in the category that will attract this award'. Is it any wonder that the dancers finally felt that they had to go on strike to draw attention to their plight? Indeed, nothing else that they did, I think, would have attracted any attention, sympathetic or otherwise, from the Government, which in the case of the Australian Ballet seems to think that as it has, as Senator Hamer has pointed out, given it an increase in its funds, that is the end of the Government's responsibility and it really does not have any other responsibility towards the company. But it does. That is public money. That $2m is public money which is going to a national company provided for the benefit of the Australian public. The series of administrative crises that the Australian Ballet has experienced should have attracted the serious attention of the Government before today. We have seen two very talented administrators resign or forced to resign-Sir Robert Helpmann and Ms Anne Woolliams. Now we have this current crisis and we have silence from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to the Australian Opera, 22 permanent jobs have been cut back. Mr Patrick Veitch, the new General Manager-I think he is the eighth in 12 years-revealed that the company's operating deficit this financial year would be in excess of $700,000, which would bring its accumulated deficit to $1.2m. He said that if strong measures had not been taken immediately the company's deficit in 1982 would have been a further $1.2m. So 22 people who have been working for the Australian Opera are to be retrenched. This is a totally unsatisfactory situation. It seems to me that until the Government is prepared in the first instance to provide appropriate funding for the arts and in the second instance to make sure, in the spirit of public accountability, that those funds are being properly administered by competent boards and competent management, these crises will continue, standards will be reduced and the Australian public will suffer. I simply remind honourable senators that the allocations to the arts in the six years of office of the Fraser Government has been seriously reduced. They are now at a level of about 40 per cent lower than they were in the last Whitlam Budget. Arts funding is now down to 0.07 of total government outlays-a pathetic figure, the lowest of all time and, I believe, an absolutely pathetic response to the real need and the real desire on the part of the Australian public to have a thriving indigenous Australian culture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to comment at any length on the final point raised by Senator Ryan in her speech in relation to the industrial situation in the Australian Ballet, except to say that perhaps it points up to some extent the fact that the dancers and the administrator, in all that has led up to the cancelling of the Brisbane season of The Merry Widow with the consequent refunding of all tickets bought, and I understand that all shows were a sellout, have not had to have quite as close a consideration of their financial situation as one might have hoped they could. Other than that, all the things that Senator Ryan said prior to that I thought would have supported what Senator Hamer said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise to support briefly the points made by Senator Hamer. I shall not reiterate all the arguments because I thought he made them very capably. I suggest to Senator Ryan that perhaps the Opposition in due course might rethink its attitude toward support of the principle that Senator Hamer puts forward; namely, that the appropriations for the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera, the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust and Art Bank be part of the general funding for the Australia Council. As I understand it, the point that Senator Hamer strove to make, and I thought made very successfully, was that the present appropriation has put the Australia Council into a difficult position in relation to funding of certain artistic exercises. On the other hand, the positions of the four national companies have been guaranteed by the Government in the amounts given in the separate appropriations. There is a clear suggestion that the Australian Ballet may well not have needed as high an appropriation as it received under this separate appropriation. A judgment could have been made that certain other areas of Australia Council concern and other areas of funding could well have done with some additional money in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the benefits of what Senator Hamer suggests in relation to the structure of funding for our arts, in my view, is that it would allow greater flexibility. Senator Hamer said very properly that it is very desirable that artistic concerns make a profit. Some concerns are resigned to not making a profit, but ballet is a popular and profitable enterprise. It is not only the Australian Ballet that has that experience. Given that it has been able to run at a profit, we should all be pleased and welcome the fact that that may mean that the Ballet does not need quite the same level of public funding as it may have needed in other years. I do not conclude that that is necessarily so. Possibly the Ballet could put up a case for itself and say that for some reason it ought to be given preferential treatment over all the other areas of artistic concern with which the Australia Council has to concern itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Opposition can have it both ways in saying that it would not support this at this stage because its main criticism was of the overall level of funding. I suggest that under those circumstances there is all the more strength to the argument that the Australia Council should be making the decisions in the amounts that go to the Ballet, the Opera, the Theatre and to Art Bank. If there is a real concern about the overall level of funding, we should be very anxious to be sure that there is no feather-bedding in any area of artistic funding. We should be very anxious to ensure that those who do have a genuine claim either for extra money or just to maintain their present position can make it under genuine circumstances. I do not criticise the Ballet or the Opera. I can well understand that they would be very happy with their present position, but I agree with Senator Hamer that they should be put into the same category. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like briefly to take Senator Ryan to task over her reference to the Commonwealth arts festival which will be held in Brisbane next year to coincide with the Commonwealth Games. In fact this Commonwealth arts festival, which will be a unique artistic exercise in Australia, replaces a Queensland festival called Warana and is being administered by those who would normally administer Warana. It does not come into the same category at all of the other artistic grants. It is a once-off exercise, a unique opportunity and it does not fit into the overall artistic funding. It has a special claim to a special funding because it is a special, once only exercise. It also comes under other special arrangements which have nothing to do with the Australia Council, but have to do with arrangements that are carried on every year under the umbrella of Warana. Warana is forgoing its festival next year because there is a coincidence and an overlap in time and the administrators of that were very happy to take on the administration of the arts festival. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recent Warana festival those who have the principal responsibility on a Commonwealth basis for the arts festival next year came to witness the Warana festival and to talk to the administrators to see what sort of expertise they had and what sort of organisational infrastructure was there that would fit with what they aimed to do with this Commonwealth arts festival. It is a different exercise altogether. It is once-off and it does not in any sense fit into this category. I take Senator Ryan to task because her tongue slid over the words 'grandstanding exercise'. In fact it is an enormously exciting artistic exercise. </PARA>

That may, in itself, be very helpful and instructive in terms of some of the virtues of the Commonwealth.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, but it comes into the category of a special grant. The Government has decided, in response to a request, that this Commonwealth exercise will take place at the same time as the Games. It is not an Australia Council decision. It is a Government decision and a request that came from Commonwealth level. So the funding is done in that sense and it is not an exercise that will be repeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as the sadness, at least, that a great deal of Brisbane people feel about the cancelling of the Australian Ballet's season of The Merry Widow, there is also a great deal of sadness about the discontinuance of the general grant to Brisbane Repertory Theatre and the potential and very serious consequences for La Boite Theatre, which is well established in the Brisbane artistic community; a very active community. If anything, I think it points up some of the virtues of Senator Hamer's suggestion. The Australia Council has obviously had to face very difficult decisions and this is one of its decisions. It will be a great loss to Brisbane if the activities of the Brisbane Repertory are diminished significantly as a result of this decision. Brisbane people in particular will find it difficult to square that shortfall in funding in that area with the fact that it has been possible to cancel a booked-out ballet season and to embark on an entire refunding of the money paid in advance for those tickets. It just will not sit well in Brisbane and it points up the contrast. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not set out to be particularly critical of the Australian Ballet but it has been pointed out that it has very handsome reserves and that it made a very worthy and worthwhile profit last year. It is that inflexibility that Senator Hamer's amendment addressed, in my opinion, and it is that enhanced flexibility for the Australia Council for the future that I would like Senator Ryan and the Opposition to think about a little more in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with two matters under the heading of the Department of Communications. About 10 days ago Senator Peter Baume, on behalf of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), gave me an assurance that the question of the surface air lifted mail system-a concessional mail rate-applied to a host of European countries. There has been some concern at the exclusion of Yugoslavia. I did take this matter up with the Minister and I was told that Australia Post was ready and willing to include Yugoslavia in this mail concession ambit but that the initiative rested with the Yugoslav Government. In view of the interest in the Yugoslav community throughout Australia perhaps we can have some feedback on whether the Yugoslav Government has responded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two other matters I want to raise relate to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Firstly, I simply ask whether we can get a feedback from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to the assertions which were made in the Sydney Press, particularly in the Sydney Sun, that despite the achievements of both Federal and State governments in the acquisition of additional large tracts of land for proclamation as national parks, there appears to be no real research into the retention of appropriate varieties of eucalypt to provide an effective diet for the koala. In effect, the writer of the assertions was implying that we could have our national parks but if we do not overcome the diminishing numbers of a certain varity of eucalypt it could result in a quite dramatic increase in the mortality rate for koalas. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second matter I speak on behalf of Les Johnson, the honourable member for Hughes in the other place, and myself in relation to requests that were made to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, the Honourable Ian Wilson, about the alleged slaughter of seals on Montague Island. I think this matter is bound up in the question of State Government and Federal Government sovereignty over the island.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It somehow does not seem at all inappropriate that Senator Mulvihill took the opportunity to talk about the mortality rate of koalas and the slaughter of seals in between a number of honourable senators talking about a crisis in another Australian creature, the Australia Council. There seems to be a remarkable degree of accord in this place tonight, that indeed the arts in Australia are suffering from a crisis if they have not exactly reached threatened mortality. Unlike the Australian Labor Party I feel sympathetic enough towards Senator Hamer's concerns about the appropriation method to support his amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a little puzzled, having listened to Senator Ryan, why the ALP feels at this moment it cannot dredge up enough sympathy to support Senator Hamer. I understand from listening to Senator Ryan that the substance of her argument was: 'Yes, there is a crisis but the method of appropriation is only a part of that crisis and there is not much point in curing only part of the complaint'. I really would like to disagree with that because if the method of appropriation is causing part of the trouble-I agree with Senator Hamer that it is-then even if we amend the situation only a bit by curing that problem it is at least a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> No honourable senator in this chamber tonight-I do not think there would be many people in Australia either-would not be aware from reading the newspapers recently that the arts in Australia are in a parlous situation; that they are troubled; that they are at a crisis point and that part of the problem results from funding. Senator Ryan mentioned eight companies which will lose their grants altogether. I cannot speak for any company other than the Stage Company of South Australia which is the only South Australian one that will suffer from this decision. It seems to me unfortunate that the funding mechanism that is being used at the moment by the Federal Government is causing conflict between companies like the Stage Company. The Theatre Board is being forced into a position of making a decision on how to pass out the limited funds that it has while companies like the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras are getting a 10 per cent increase in a separate allocation. It must cause conflict. It must cause envy. It must cause some bitterness. So far as the Stage Company is concerned, it certainly is causing unemployment not simply because the Stage Company will go by the board but also because the South Australian Film Corporation depends to a very large extent on those people involved in the Stage Company for its productions. It seems to me too that the form of appropriation that is adopted in respect of the arts in Australia at the moment whereby the so-called flagship companies-I will not attribute that expression to anybody, Senator Hamer--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. The so-called flagship companies are funded separately from the others. That at least can raise the spectre of Government funding only with Government approval. So those major companies could be put in a position of having to restrain their innovation and limit the sorts of things that they produce, simply to make sure their funding continues. On the point of who makes the decision about the funding and where it is going, it seems that the most appropriate people to make the decisions should be the ones who know the most about the matter and I doubt whether anybody would disagree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general, I am in the position of being extremely sympathetic towards Senator Hamer's amendment, sympathetic to the point, unlike the ALP, of being quite prepared to accept the premise that all funding for the arts should go through the Australia Council, that funding should not be split into separate lines for separate favoured large companies and sympathetic to the point where not only do I accept that premise but I accept that amendment as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply clarify the position of the Australian Labor Party with regard to Senator Hamer's amendment and repeat, for the benefit of those honourable senators who did not pay close attention, my reason for not supporting the amendment at this stage. The reason for not supporting Senator Hamer's request at this stage that all the funding for all the performing arts in Australia should go back into one lot and be redistributed by the Australian Councl is that right now, given the crisis both in funding and in management in major companies and the crisis in funding for the smaller companies, such a step would not be constructive. We are merely being practical at this stage of decision-making within this Parliament and we are not prepared to support the request at a time when it would not have any practical, constructive outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not see that the various crises in the major companies and the national companies that have been described tonight would be resolved by the step which Senator Hamer suggests that we take. In fact, at this stage it is highly likely that even more chaos and more confusion would ensue but I must make it quite clear that I am not suggesting that we have a hard line attitude on this. Indeed, we would favour a system whereby the Australia Council made all the funding decisions. We would favour a situation where there was no single line grant to the separate national companies. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Hamer and Senator Martin, who also seems to support what Senator Hamer has to say, can go back to their own party room and argue the case before next year's Budget that there should be no single line appropriations for national companies, that all of the Federal Government allocation for the performing arts should go to the Australia Council for the Australia Council to decide and disperse, I believe we would have a very positive response to that decision. We do not support the current system of single line appropriations and the rest having to fight amongst themselves. I thought I made that quite clear. We cannot support Senator Hamer's amendment because it is not practically workable at this stage. We are not interested in stunts. But if, as I said, Senator Hamer, Senator Martin and any other Government senators who are inclined to argue against the single line grant are successful in their party room and we are presented next year with a Budget which gives all the arts funding to the Australia Council, I am of the view that my party would support such an administrative change. It is highly likely that when the first Hayden Government Budget is presented in this place we will find such an overall funding arrangement for the Australia Council. Our objection is merely to the stage of the debate at which this suggestion has been made and its inappropriateness because of the confusion and chaos facing the performing arts in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a couple of remarks about items which have been raised here tonight. I refer to the problems that the Theatre Board and theatre companies around Australia are facing in relation to funding. I take the point that Senator Ryan raised in relation to the overall funding. I think that this problem which is facing the arts in Australia has resulted from a number of concurrences, basically those to do with the dispersal of population and the allocation of funds to other items. It has therefore been extremely difficult for us to establish and develop within Australia a workable network of small theatre companies producing top quality work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is only in the last 10 to 15 years that we have developed here in Australia a capacity to put together and present plays of social comment in relation to our own culture through professional and high quality small theatre companies. I would like to draw attention to a particular theatre company in my own State-the La Boite Theatre or the Brisbane Repertory Theatre. This is a valuable theatre company in the Queensland scene because it has done an enormously good job in relation to youth theatre. I think it is well known in Brisbane that it has helped to provide Queensland with a basis for its professional companies as a result of the workshops it has conducted involving youth and teenage groups. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of actors and actresses who are currently working in major theatre companies and in film and television in the rest of Australia have come through theatre companies in Queensland. Probably there would be a much larger number per head of population than any other State. I think that the work that has been done by groups such as the repertory in Brisbane has contributed greatly to this. Unfortunately strictures in respect of giving major theatre companies large allocations has left very little room for the Australia Council to move. As a result, the Council almost inevitably has had to contact the various theatre companies not by way of written application but by telephone to tell them that no longer will they have amounts such as the one we are talking about here-that is a mere $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be extremely difficult to imagine any other such small amount having such a large adverse effect on a struggling area within our community as does this amount. The particular theatre I am talking about has provided a wide community variation in terms of the types of plays and presentations it puts on. This theatre also engages in certain other types of activities. Notably, from time to time it has given free performances to unemployed people, pensioners and student groups. This theatre has been innovative in this regard. I want to register my disappointment, and I believe that of a large number of electors in Queensland, that such an action has been taken in relation to one of our theatre companies. We hope that consideration will be given to looking at the types of allocations that have been presented to the major companies and to whether it might be possible to rearrange matters in such a way that a mere sum of $20,000 may be able to be provided to keep companies such as this not only in Queensland but also in other States operating and doing the effective community work that they have undertaken to date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on a different topic in group B. On a number of occasions in this place I have mentioned the number of post-graduate awards that have been made available by the Commonwealth Government. In particular, I made some remarks on this matter when the number was decreased by the present Government. I would like to point out this evening that some information that was given to us in Estimates Committee B suggests that the number of post-graduate awards that are being offered by the Government is still insufficient. In fact, the numbers of awards are fewer than they were five or six years ago. The information that was given to us in Estimates Committee B is that for 1981 there are 3,546 applicants for post-graduate awards. This number has been relatively constant over the last three years. In fact, in 1979, 3,725 people applied for post-graduate awards. In 1980 the number was 3,758 and in 1981 it was 3,546. Against these student numbers, which are up in the 3,000 mark-I imagine that almost invariably there would be those with either first class honours degrees or 2A honours-the number of post-graduate awards offered for 1981 and 1982 is 800. This means that fewer than one out of every four of these applicants will be able to receive an award. It is interesting to note that in 1975, the last year of the Labor Government, 900 post-graduate awards were offered by the Government. This number remained the same in the first year of the Fraser Government, but then there was a steady decline. The number declined in the following year to 800 and then declined to 700, remained at 700 for a further two years, increased to 800 and will remain steady at 800 for next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that, when the numbers were reduced to either 800 or 700, I commented on the reduction in this place to the then Minister for Education, Senator Carrick, who said that he realised that more awards should be made available and that when conditions improved more awards would be made available. The number of awards has been increased to 800, compared with the trough we had at 700 awards, but they are still not back to the original 900 as they were in 1975. I believe that at least 900 awards should be made available so that these people who apply for post-graduate awards have a much more reasonable chance. I have been away from the academic field for some time so I am not quite sure what the quality of a student's academic achievement has to be before he or she can obtain an award. It has been suggested to me that a person will not obtain an award for doctoral study unless that person has first class honours. Probably a number of people with good 2A honours would be able to profit from post-graduate awards to obtain a doctoral degree. Certainly not many of them will do so if the number of awards is kept at the present level. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Government that it has a look at the number of applications received for these types of awards and that it looks at the number of awards granted to see whether this can be increased. It will become even more important if legislation goes through this place-I hope it will not-to charge fees for those pursuing post-graduate awards. If we pass that legislation, a great number of students who would normally have gone on and who would not receive an award or scholarship of some kind will not go on and their further education will be lost to the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pass only a few remarks in relation to the cutting of Federal funds to the La Boite Repertory Theatre in Brisbane. I register in the Committee of the Whole my shock at the Government's action in the cutting of these funds. The decision of the Government to cut funds to the theatre, one would believe, is the only factor in the problems being suffered by the theatre. We need to realise that this theatre's service comes not only from the performances that it presents to the Brisbane public but from also its help in training young people engaged in the arts with experience, for example, as stage hands in the setting up of scenery and the painting of backdrops. The theatre also developed a very strong and able service to school children, to people trying to produce their own plays and trying to develop interest and some expertise in an art form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cutting of funds to this theatre is probably one of the most callous actions of this Government. I do not really believe that the Government or the people responsible for the cutting of these funds to the theatre would have any knowledge of the great way in which this small theatre gave service to the public of Queensland and to young people who wanted to be involved in the arts in that area. I only hope that the Government will in the future, before cutting funds to a theatre of this kind, at least investigate fully the attitudes of the theatre, the people who run the company and the service they provide not only to the community but also to the people involved in the arts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a small contribution on the matter raised by Senator Jones. I indicate to the Senate that the matter that we are speaking on in relation to La Boite Theatre is a significant one for Brisbane. I will read part of a comment in yesterday's Courier-Mail which indicated the strength of feeling about the cut in funds for La Boite. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Federal funds for La Boite Theatre axed</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Planned activities for next year of Brisbane's only theatre-in-the-round, La Boite Theatre, have been jeopardised following the axing in Federal Government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> A three-hour emergency meeting of the La Boite Theatre council last night decided on an immediate compaign to reinstate the funding. </PARA>
<PARA> A committee has been set up to co-ordinate lobbying in an effort to save the theatre. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that many honourable senators have been approached by the Theatre today in an effort to have funding continued for La Boite. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The $20,000 Federal Government funding for La Boite next year has been stopped by the Australia Council theatre board. </PARA>
<PARA>I will pass over part of the comments and read only the relevant sections. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>'A cut of $20,000 is disastrous. It means we cannot run as we are now . . . something will have to go.'</PARA>
<PARA> The 56-year-old theatre will still receive a grant from the Federal Government for its early childhood drama program which it runs with the State Education Department, but at 1981 levels. </PARA>
<PARA> It also will still receive its annual State Government grant of $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say that, without the funding, the theatre just cannot continue. I think that the most important part of the article in the Courier-Mail was the last two paragraphs which quoted David Rowbotham, the Courier-Mail theatre critic. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Courier-Mail theatre critic David Rowbotham, said last night that if it was only Federal Government funding that allowed La Boite to survive, then it was scandalous to cut it off. </PARA>
<PARA> 'This city would be infinitely poorer if La Boite were to close its doors . . . This would not be done to theatres which have been of such immense value to Brisbane for many years, long before the Australia Council came into existence. </PARA>
<PARA>Many honourable senators learned of the difficulty only last weekend. Some of us learned of it only on Monday when we read the article in the Courier-Mail. I point out that those of us who represent Queensland are quite concerned that this has happened to a significant theatre in Brisbane. This is a theatre which is a little different from many theatres but which probably cannot survive without the sort of funding that it had previously. If it is just a matter of $20,000 being made available to save this theatre, I do not see why it cannot be done. It is a matter of great importance. I ask the Federal Government to look at the problem carfully to see whether the funding can continue so that the theatre can continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a few matters which relate to the appropriations for the Department of Communications and which ultimately, I believe, will call for some rationalisation of policy. I begin by referring to the appropriation for multicultural broadcasting, which is of the order of $25m. I draw attention to the size of that appropriation compared with that for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which is something less than $240m. The Commission is, by common consensus, a fairly run down organisation at this stage of its career. I suppose that it was for that reason that some time ago the Government set up the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which, according to the appropriations, cost close to $1m, to examine the future of the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that, in looking at that future, the overall level of appropriations for various instrumentalities be taken into account. I believe that it is fair to say that the Special Broadcasting Service is providing a new, innovative and imaginative service in Australian television through Channel 0-28 in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney-a service which arguably is for middle-class, middle-brow Australians rather than for ethnic communities. This is a debate which must be determined in terms of the identity of Channel 0-28 as a television service. At least it is arguable that that is so, and when one is spending $25m on such a service and only $238m on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which provides a radio and television network, both regional and metropolitan, throughout Australia, there seems to be some discrepancy in the amounts of money that are being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the services provided by Channel 0-28 have brought a new chink of light into Australian television broadcasting, but the Special Broadcasting Service has a quite legitimate complaint about the extent to which those services are available. For example, it is argued on the basis for fairly empirical evidence that it has pretty low ratings. The Special Broadcasting Service would say at least that that followed from the poor reception available of Channel 0-28 programs in the Sydney metropolitan area, which would affect adversely the viewing of the service. The Service would also argue that it should have the facility to provide programs in Canberra and Wollongong. This can be done for a very small amount of money. I hope that the Government will give urgent consideration to providing those services as a matter of priority to those two cities, whose population has a relatively large ethnic component. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, I believe that in the long term governments cannot avoid the overall decision as to whether one is to have a national broadcasting service at a cost of $238m. In the words of the timid Australian Broadcasting Commission-a sort of mouse that roared Commission-that sum represents a cut of 22 per cent in government funding over the last five years. Five years ago the then Chairman of the Commission, Sir Henry Bland, described the funding of the ABC as being cut to the bone. Since then its funding has been cut still further. Nevertheless, we are still spending $238m on the ABC and a disproportionately large amount on multicultural broadcasting, particularly its television aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate nettle that has to be grasped, and I think that we were fairly close to grasping it when the legislation to establish an independent and multicultural broadcasting service was debated here, is whether those two services can be rationalised in some way to provide the services of Channel 0-28 to a much wider audience through the medium of a new national broadcasting service-a notion which stems from the Dix Committee's recommendations about the future of the current Australian Broadcasting Commission, recommendations which cost us the best part of $1m and concerning which there has been no response from the Government to date. In fact, the entire issue as to what should be done with the ABC as a result of the Dix Committee's report has tended to degenerate into an absurd argument as to whether the ABC should have commercial sponsorship of programs. Very little serious consideration has been given to the wider recommendations. I am most concerned that this Parliament approach the question of the future of multicultural broadcasting in Australia, and the future of the ABC, by looking to the provision of two national channels for television, one of which would embrace the current excellent services provided by the Special Broadcasting Service through the medium of Channel 0-28. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable argument about the question of the funding of the ABC. One of the saddest and most permanently unfortunate mistakes made by the last Labor Government-I was here at the time so that, insofar as there is a collective responsibility to be borne, I share it-was to abolish television licence fees in respect of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gratitude is not an electoral virtue for those sorts of things. There certainly was not much thanks for that decision by the Government. But one has to look at the question of alternative sources of funding for an organisation such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the national broadcasting service, which it is hoped will be set up consequent upon the recommendations made in the report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. If we have a national broadcasting service of that kind and are looking for new sources of funding, one of the ways to achieve that might be in having a second channel providing multicultural broadcasting of various kinds and other broadcasting of a more innovative nature than the ABC currently provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, in my view, very serious consideration has to be given to giving the Australian broadcasting system the right to operate subscription television in Australia. The reason for that is quite simple: The ABC is the one organisation in Australia which could provide subscription television services in both the cities and the country. Because of its capacity in terms of networking, it would be able to provide a much wider service, a much less segmented service, than could be provided by private entrepreneurs. Of course, the second aspect is that such service would provide revenue for the ABC and would support some of the more innovative programming which one would like to see embraced by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. So I think it is important, in looking at the appropriations for the Deparment of Communications, to look forward a bit and to see how some of those large items might be at least amalgamated in the interests of providing a better service to the community and, perhaps, a less costly service in overall terms by means of a process of rationalisation in the provision of government broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch on just two other aspects of the appropriations for the Deparment of Communications. The first is the grants which are made under these appropriations in support of public broadcasting. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the appropriation for that purpose in 1980-81 and in 1981-82 are the same, which means a decline in real terms in grants to the public broadcasting system. Admittedly, if one looks at the appropriations for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs one will find that some money is made available to public broadcasters for the provision of ethnic broadcasting programs on public broadcasting stations. That is to be commended. But the public broadcasting system in Australia is very much in its infancy. It is not in the interests of broadcasting, either commercial or national, and it certainly is not in the interests of listeners for the public broadcasting system to exist on a shoestring budget. </PARA>
<PARA> We have ludicrous situations such as the one we had in Melbourne a few months ago with the launching of a public appeal for radio 3RRR. That is a very popular public broadcasting station in Melbourne. The station would not have been able to continue to operate if that public appeal had not been undertaken and had not been successful. The public broadcasting sector should not be left in that situation. I think that governments should be concerned to ensure the independence of the public broadcasting sector and its viability. It should be quite independent of government on a day to day or budgetary basis from year to year. There is not much point in turning an established public broadcasting sector into a sort of broadcasting equivalent to the Victorian railways system right at the start of its career. It is not very good initiative from governments and it is not very imaginative. In a sense, I suppose it is a waste of money because if a service is provided and it is forced to operate on that basis, it is not a good service. It is an unsatisfactory advertisement for the activities of any government in Australia for it to be provided on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point on which I comment is the appropriation of approximately $3.5m for the regulation of broadcasting and television in Australia. If that sort of money is to be spent on the regulation of broadcasting and television in Australia, it is very desirable that it be spent on the basis that there is an understanding that there is a firm system of regulation, a system of regulation which is not changed by governments at the instigation of private proprietors in the media to suit their own interests. That is what happened in this Parliament in the rush last May or June to pass legislation and to alter the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act relating particularly in that case to ownership of the television station Channel 10 in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly arguable that the legislation which was passed by this Parliament before the numbers changed-that was the purpose of the rush-in essence was retrospective in its effects and it changed the law. Without going into all the refinements-they were very clever refinements-it changed the law retrospectively to help a particular individual or a particular company in relation to the ownership of that television station. I am not as it were bitching, if I might put it in those terms. I hope I am not taken up by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for using an unfortunate term. We are discussing Group B of the Estimates, not discrimination in terminology or anything like that. I am not upset about that decision so much as about the absence of principle involved in that decision; namely, that we can have a system of broadcasting regulation and, at the whim of a particular Minister, or a particular Prime Minister in that case, alter that law to suit a particular person. When that is done, government is becoming scandalous and is likely to be regarded with disrepute in the community, and rightly so. So if we are to have a system of regulation and if we are to pay $3.5m for it, the system ought to be an honest one and clear in its terminology and understanding so that people know where they are going. </PARA>

Those people on Thursday Island who will receive transmission are, of course, happy to receive it. But we have been given an indication that the effective transmission range from the transmitter on Thursday Island will be about 10 kilometres, which will mean that very few people other than those on Thursday Island and perhaps those on Horn Island, which is nearby, will receive television transmission. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, a number of islands in the Torres Strait will not receive that transmission. I mention in particular Bamaga which is situated on the tip of Cape York Peninsula. It is a fairly large settlement and it will not receive television transmission either. When I asked about this matter it was indicated to me that Bamaga and the islands in the Torres Strait may receive television transmission only when a further satellite is used and the transmission comes via the satellite to those settlements. One must realise that the settlement at Bamaga is fairly large and some of the settlements on the islands in the Torres Strait are large settlements too. They will not receive television transmission through Thursday Island. Those people are not happy about what happened there. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that I had two matters I wanted to raise so I will go on to the second matter which relates to the National Citizens Radio Association. I had to go to two different Estimates committee hearings to receive the full information I wanted about this Association and the grant it asked for. The NCRA, as the National Citizens Radio Association is called, asked for a grant through the Department of Communications. It had not received a grant-in-aid before. It was not sure earlier how to apply for this grant but it was given excellent help in its application through the Department of Communications. The National Citizens Radio Association was told that its application was not successful. In the Estimate Committee hearing dealing with the Department of Communications I asked what had happened in relation to this grant. I was told that the Department of Communications recommended that the grant be made but that the matter had to go to two other departments, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Finance. I eventually went to the committees which considered the estimates of those departments and was given some information. In particular, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We had a fairly general rule this year that when we looked at applications, we were not inclined to approve them for new organisations and we were also rather reluctant to increase the grants that had been given. In other words, it was a general rule of the same money wherever this could be sustained. If you look through the lists of grants that were approved, you will find evidence of that general rule that was used in determining the allocation of grants this year. A number of applications had been approved by the appropriate department and came to the inter-departmental committee and the committee of Ministers, but they were not all successful this year. </PARA>
<PARA>I passed this information on to the NCRA and it was satisfied that its application had received the same consideration as other similar applications. It advised me that in its submission to the Department of Communications it indicated that if a grant had been made available to assist the Association it could have ensured that more citizen band radio operators took out the necessary CB licences. This would be one of the projects that the NCRA would undertake. It would make sure that CB operators took out the licences they are required to have. Apparently many CB operators have not taken out such licences. Because of that, the NCRA argued that there would be no net cost to the Government. In fact, the Government may make a saving because of the money that would come in from the extra licences. </PARA>
<PARA> The submission to the Government probably stated the argument in greater depth than I have. I just point out that if this was the case perhaps the Government could look favourably on an application from the NCRA next year if, in fact, the activities of the NCRA in making more CB operators take out licences would save the Government money. Although I am probably transgressing what should be discussed in regard to another committee's operations at the moment, I mention that I asked in the second committee hearing I attended whether I could be given some estimate of the new applications made this year. From memory, I do not think I have been given that information. I certainly suggest that the application from the NCRA which will come again this year for a grant next year, be looked at in light of the arguments I have presented this evening. </PARA>

I asked about the costs involved. I am not sure of the exact answer which I received-I did not expect the matter to come up now-but I think something like 110 officers were mentioned and it was stated that the costs would be met by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

There is some information that I can give but I cannot at this stage, because of the nature of the accounts that are still being received, give a final account of the cost of the conference. I do have some estimated costs. The estimated cost to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is $12.32m with an expenditure of $10.55m this financial year. The Department of Housing and Construction estimate, for fitting out the venue of the meeting, is $1.7m.

It deals with the question which I put on notice on 9 June dealing with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Minister was a member of the now infamous razor gang. My question stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did the Review of Commonwealth Functions consider during its deliberations what cost savings could be achieved if Ministers were prevented from using VIP aircraft for business trips; in particular, would not great savings be made by banning such trips as were made by the Prime Minister to Armidale for the purpose of visiting relatives and to buy a bull for his property at Nareen as was reported in the Northern Daily Leader at Tamworth on Friday, 22 May 1981 and in the ABC programme P.M. on 21 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) What was the cost to the Australian taxpayer of that particular trip and can this information be made available to the Senate before the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill 1981 is debated in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I gave notice of that question on 9 June. During the hearing on 15 September of the Estimates Committee dealing with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-the Minister was in charge of that Committee-I asked the same question. The Minister's reply was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I will have to refer that question to the Prime Minister to obtain his response. We have no information here on it. </PARA>
<PARA>I further asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Could you expedite the reply so that I can have it before we debate the Appropriation Bills in the Committee of the Whole? I will be wanting to say something about that in view of the fact that it is the Government's policy to be very frugal in expenditure in all departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on the matter. I am advised that the visit to Armidale referred to in Senator McLaren's question was made en route to Townsville on official business. Any costs involved in the call at Armidale were, therefore, negligible. At Armidale the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) did spend some time talking with his son.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the proposed expenditure for the Treasury. One of the items that came up at the Estimates Committee hearing and on which we asked for further information concerned the Australian Taxation Office. We were looking at the staff cuts in the Taxation Office caused by the so-called razor gang. It was pointed out that the Taxation Office would have to cut back its staff numbers by 179 officers. We asked what the results of that would be on the Taxation Office and were informed that the main area where the cutbacks would occur was in the prosecutions branch. The answer we were given as to how much those cutbacks would save was, I think, in the vicinity of $1.5m. When we asked how much the Government would forgo in expenditure, we were given the answer of $70m. That was an answer off the top of the head from the officer here at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Office subsequently wrote back to the Committee with the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the Committee's meeting, you were informed that the estimated loss to revenue in 1981-82, as a consequence of expected reduction of 179 man-years in enforcement activity, was $70m. That figure, however, is incorrect and an estimated revenue loss of $46.8m would be more realistic if the reduction in the Taxation Office staff ceiling were to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that those staff members have not been removed yet and I think it is mainly the Taxation Office that is proposing to have the cutbacks in that particular area. It would be a very serious matter if the Taxation Office is allowed to remove 179 staff to save $1.5m and in turn forgo $46m in revenue. I am not sure what the motive behind the Taxation Office's actions is-whether it has decided on the prosecutions area mainly to bluff the Government into retaining its overall staff levels-but it has picked out the most vulnerable area. If this does occur, if the staff is removed from the enforcement area and we do forgo $46m, it is not just the revenue we forgo; the fact is that the public will lose whatever confidence it still has in the Taxation Office to distribute fairly the tax around the community. That confidence will disappear entirely. I am not sure whether the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) can add to the situation or whether any further investigation has been made of that. The point should be stressed that we cannot forgo that sort of income for a saving of $1.5m. The Taxation Office should not be allowed to do it. If staff cuts have to occur, if that is a Government direction, they really should occur in other areas of the Taxation Office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the Department of Administrative Services, I raise the situation of watchmen and cleaners who are employed by the Commonwealth around Australia whose future has been put in profound jeopardy by the razor gang decision to have these services performed by private contractors. It is not certain just how many people are caught up by this decision, which is of course being administered into effect by the Department of Administrative Services. If one takes the persons who are presently performing the dual function of watchmen-cleaners, I understand that around 160 men are involved nationally. If one adds the cleaners employed by the Commonwealth directly, I believe the figure is closer to something like 600 men. No doubt the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will enlighten me and enlighten the chamber if these figures are wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, what any figures of this kind tend to conceal are the human implications for those people involved, most of whom who are, in this instance, middle-aged or older and will find it enormously difficult to get any job elsewhere if they are thrown out in the cold, as is now proposed by the Government. Those who are permanent employees-they represent only a proportion of the total-will become eligible for some transitional income support under the operations of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and retirement) Act if they cannot be provided with employment elsewhere by the Commonwealth, which seems probable. But that transitional payment under the CE(RR) Act is only for a limited period and it will be sacrificed by these employees completely if they take the other option which may be open to them in some cases of accepting employment if they are offered it by the private contractors in question because if they accept that latter option they will find themselves subject to the sack at a matter of a week or so's notice and, in the process will lose any entitlement to redundancy or severance pay that they might otherwise have accumulated. So a dreadful dilemma in that respect faces the permanent employees. </PARA>
<PARA> An even more miserable prospect faces that very large class of watchmen and cleaners who are in fact temporary employees. In many instances they have had that temporary status for many years-10, 15 or even 20 years in some case. The situation of temporary employees, as I understand it, is that, if the Commonwealth cannot or will not provide employment for them elsewhere within the system-and it seems overwhelmingly likely the case that this will be so-their only prospect of solace, not eligible as they are to the benefit of CE(RR) Act redundancy payments, will be if they are taken on the the staffs of the private contractors concerned. Again there is no certainty whatsoever that that will in fact happen. </PARA>
<PARA> So the threat posed by the Government decision-it is a decision that has been made; there are no ifs or buts about it-is a very real one and it is important that, if a decision like this, affecting the livelihood of some hundreds of people around Australia, is to be made, it be justified by some overriding public policy concern that least there will be some substantial saving to the taxpayer. However, it is amply clear that the Government has no such rationale for this decision. Here, as elsewhere, it is simply an ideological matter. This problem of the watchmen-cleaners is one that has been taken up by others of my colleagues. It has been taken up by Senator Ryan in the context of the Australian Capital territory employees concerned. It has been taken up by my learned colleague Senator Mulvihill in the context of the watchmen-cleaners employed in the parliamentary offices in Sydney. I understand it has been taken up also by Senator Coates in relation to Tasmanian employees. </PARA>

I was on the point of mentioning the fact that the Melbourne group of watchmen-cleaners have been the subject of representations not only by Labor Party members-myself and Senator Robert Ray-but also by all the other parliamentary occupants of that building, 400 Flinders Street, Melbourne, namely, Senator Alan Missen, Senator John Siddons, Senator David Hamer and Mr Andrew Peacock, the honourable member for Kooyong.

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Re: Parliamentary Offices,400 Flinders Street,Melbourne, Vic. </PARA>
<PARA> The undersigned Members and Senators, having our electoral offices at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices, 400 Flinders Street, Melbourne, are writing to express our concern and dismay at the advice given to the watchmen/cleaners of this building last Monday, 12 October, 1981, that their services are to be terminated with effect from 18 December, 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> This action was taken without any consultation with the Members of Parliament with offices in the building, despite a specific request from Senator Evans on 6 July, 1981 that consultation and discussions take place prior to any action to dismiss staff. </PARA>
<PARA> We have received no guarantee or communications on two particular items of conern:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Whether the Government can guarantee that if private contract cleaners are introduced they will have appropriate security clearance, as do the present cleaners; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The future arrangements concerning access to the building. The prospect of the building being closed at any stage of the night or on weekend is clearly not acceptable, and the option of private keys to members and their staff has drawbacks also. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also received no information on the costs or savings of the proposed transfer to private contract cleaners which would enable us to make an informal judgement on the wisdom of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> More generally we would wish to register our protest at the decision to dismiss the present watchmen cleaners in the first place. The men and women concerned have, by and large, done an excellent job, in many cases over years of service, and it is scant reward for their loyalty and dedication that they are now unceremoniously told to find other employment. </PARA>
<PARA> While most of them would, if dismissed, receive continuation of income for a period of months following their dismissal, many would not, because of age, health or other factors, be able to find other jobs easily or at all. We understand that, notwithstanding the obligation of the Public Service Board under Section 11 of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 to take reasonable steps to redeploy Commonwealth employees, none of the employees in this question has been offered alternative employment within the Commonwealth Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not satisfied of the adequacy of either:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the steps taken by the Public Service Board to redeploy those watchmen/cleaners eligible for redeployment; or</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the provision for continuation of income and employment to be made in respect of both temporary and permanent employees. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these reasons, we request in the strongest terms the decision to dismiss these employees be reconsidered. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>ALAN MISSEN Senator for Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>ANDREW PEACOCK Member for Kooyong</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the sending of that letter, a discussion was arranged with the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) on the evening of 15 October in order, it was hoped, to get some answers. Let me simply record that the occasion, which was attended by Senator Missen on behalf of the Liberal Party members in Customs House, by Senator Siddons on behalf of himself and Senator Chipp, and by myself, was not one that it gives me any great pleasure to recall. I think it is perhaps worth putting on record just what the nature of the Minister's reaction was to the various sentiments that we had expressed in a very open and bipartisan, in fact, tripartisan way on behalf of these employees. In the first place Mr Newman acknowledged that no comparative cost analysis had been undertaken of private contractors as compared with public employees. The Minister said that he expected the cost would be less if it went into the private sector, but he did not know whether it would be less. What was unstated but came through perfectly loud and clear was that he did not care whether it was less or not because what was involved here, as elsewhere in the razor gang exercises as we have been told over and over again, was a matter of principle and philosophy and not one that was necessarily going to be resolved in terms of cash benefit to the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing that the Minister said was that he acknowledged that private contractors would not be required to take on any of the displaced workers. He said that the successful private contractor or contractors in the different locations would be briefed that they were expected to take on appropriate workers but that they were under no obligation to do so. (Quorum formed). The third matter that the Minister communicated to us was that he had no information readily available as to whether the employees in question, about whom we are making representations-namely, those of the old Customs House in Melbourne-were either permanent or temporary or what ages they were, these, of course, being crucial considerations if one if determining or trying to assess their future employment prospects. The Minister made it clear that this had not been taken into account in any way by the Commonwealth or himself in implementing the razor gang decision. He went on to say that to the extent that elderly or middle-aged watchmen-cleaners would be likely to be replaced by younger men and possibly women employed by the contractor, this would be a good thing because it would improve the security of the building. This is the kind of mentality and attitude with which one is dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation of Senator Missen, Senator Siddons and myself was further told that the Minister would give no guarantee of any kind about the extent to which permanent employees in the category in question would be absorbed elsewhere within the Public Service under the operation of the redeployment provisions of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. The only thing that he did say in this respect was that he saw it as being unlikely that it would be practicable in all cases for these people to be absorbed elsewhere. He then had no explanation at all for the absence of any promised consultation with the members and senators involved about the new arrangements for access to the building and the securing of it if the present system were changed-an undertaking to have consultations which had been made by the Minister to me and others sometime previously. I acknowledge that when pressed on the matter as far as security and access to the building were concerned he did say that the existing 24 hour service was proposed to be continued under the new arrangements. It will be interesting to see whether that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, when pressed the Minister said that he had consulted with the unions involved by way of writing to the Federal Secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, telling him of the new arrangements and including within that correspondence the fact that if certain employees were not continued in employment by the Commonwealth, they would get certain protection under the CE(RR) Act. He did not, however, tell us what the response of the union had been to that particular ex post facto mode of consultation. In fact, I have been led to believe subsequently-although I have not had an opportunity to communicate with the Federal officer of the union-that the Minister has been approached on at least two occasions by union representatives in Canberra on attempted exercises in trying to see him, organised through the honourable member for Canberra, Mrs Kelly, and has on both occasions refused to see the union delegates in question. The Minister has now gone overseas and made it perfectly clear that he is not interested in talking to anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the kind of reaction one gets from this Government. I think it is a little case study in itself of the way in which the razor gang is working out in practice. It may be that overall it is the case that the razor gang exercise has been a bit of a damp squib; that it has not carved off the millions of dollars that perhaps we were led to anticipate it would carve off the national Budget when the razor gang cuts were first mooted. Nonetheless, the cuts that have been applied work very savagely in respect of particular individuals and in the case that I am talking about many individuals who have served their nation and, in many instances, us parliamentarians, long and hard and in a very dedicated fashion over a long period. I find it very difficult now to know what more can be done on behalf of these people. Representations are made and arguments are put at the highest level. In making such representations and in putting such arguments one is treated with little short of contempt from the Ministers concerned. It can scarcely be wondered at if, in return, the Minister in question and indeed the Government of which he is a part, is regarded with an appropriate response by those whom he and the Government treats in this way. I think it has been a disgraceful episode and I hope that the Minister will be in a position tonight to tell us that this matter will be the subject of some further reconsideration by the Government, particularly in the event that it should prove to be the case that when the tenders are all in from these various private contractors around the place that the cost savings involved, if any, are not likely to be very substantial. If in fact, there is really no significant saving for the taxpayer involved in these particular changes, which might make them defensible from at least one point of view, I urge that at least by reference if not by the more humane criteria that I have been seeking to articulate, then at least by that colder, harder, commercial criterion the Government will reconsider this decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer briefly to the Australian Electoral Office, a body for which I have a very high regard. During the hearings of the Senate Estimates Committee I asked a series of questions. In one of them I asked for an estimated cost of counting elections right out. In other words, at the moment only in those seats where there is not an absolute majority are preferences actually cast and we can determine what is an accurate preferred vote. My suggestion at the Committee hearing was for the Electoral Office in every seat throughout Australia-the whole 125-actually to distribute preferences until the two remaining candidates are left. The idea of that is that we would get an accurate review Australia-wide of the level of support for the two major parties contesting that election. At the moment all the estimates are based on the Mackerras model of two-party preferred vote and various guesstimates are made for what happened in 1954, what happened in 1961 and 1969 as to which party in fact won. But if the Electoral Office did as is done in South Australia and actually allocated preferences right out, we would have a situation in which we would know Australia-wide what is the total support for the two major parties. I rather naively suggested to Electoral Office officials that in fact it would probably cost $1,200 Australia-wide. However, their reponse was a little more generous than that in terms of cost. I quote the response:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office is required in terms of the current legislation to continue the scrutiny of the votes until one candidate has an absolute majority. If that is established on the count of first preference votes or as a result of the distribution of only one excluded candidate's preferences, no distribution or further distribution is prescribed. To proceed further might therefore require an amendment to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if distribution of all preferences was to be undertaken in accordance with the steps set out in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Australian Electoral Office estimates that this would take approximately 350 man hours per Division. This estimate is based on the re-examination of ballot papers at a rate of 200 per hour plus a time component for the opening of the sealed parcels and individual envelopes which contain the ballot papers for each candidate from each counting centre. </PARA>
<PARA> At a salary cost of say $7 per hour, the cost for each Division would be in the order of $2,450. </PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed). The response continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This is only an average because the number of electors voting in each Division varies considerably and the number of candidates varies from Division to Division. </PARA>
<PARA> At the October 1980 Federal Election the results in 85 Divisions were determined on the basis of the count of first preference votes. Of the other 40 Divisions, the final result in 39 was obtained only after a full distribution of all preferences and in the remaining Division after a partial distribution. At the estimated average cost of $2,450 per Division the cost of completing preference distributions in the 1980 election would have been in excess of $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA>My initial naive estimate of $1,200 skyrocketed to $200,000. In actual fact, I am not particularly happy with the reply from the Electoral Office. It contains many assumptions that anyone who has ever been involved in counting would automatically dismiss. For a start, in any recheck of the votes you do not average 200 votes an hour. I have had occasion to be scrutineering when a certain official did average 200 votes an hour and he was never rehired by the Electoral Office. The best persons to count the votes are bank tellers who like to play poker. Such people are the quickest and the most efficient. I estimate that around 400 to 500 votes an hour is a more realistic estimate. However, my real question related only to the distribution of minor party preferences. So there is no need to recount the major party votes. That is not done at present in seats where preferences are not distributed. I see no reason why it should when we actually distribute preferences of minor parties in those seats where there is an absolute majority. It might be argued that there will be inaccuracies, but those inaccuracies already exist. The votes in those seats where there is an absolute majority on election night are never recounted. If they were inaccurate they will remain inaccurate. I maintain that the distribution of minor party votes is a matter of opening only those envelopes of the minor candidates. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Mulvihill" NAMEID="GM7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably 15 per cent. I know that Senator Mulvihill has had a lot more experience in scrutineering than I and I will appreciate his comments on this in a moment. But I would imagine that at the most the figure would be 15 per cent per seat. Having watched many of the Federal counts I would estimate that there would be no more than 10 man hours work, and at $7 an hour it would be $70 a division. This would also solve one of the great questions, namely, who in fact did the best Australia-wide, especially in a close count.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise concerns a question that was asked by my colleague Senator McLaren about the comparative costs of deposits. This cost has not been altered since 1965. The Electoral Office undertook to deliver to the Committee what the new costs would be on current prices. I would just like to read very quickly two paragraphs of what was said by the Electoral Office. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1965 deposits for House of Representatives candidates were increased from $50 to $100 and Senate candidates from $50 to $200. </PARA>
<PARA> The current House of Representatives deposit of $100 represented approximately 176% of average weekly earnings when first introduced in 1965 and now represents approximately 35% of average weekly earnings. The current Senate deposit of $200 represents approximately 352% of average weekly earnings when introduced and now represents approximately 70% of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite apparent from those figures that if the level of deposit that was set in 1965 by the Liberal Party was an accurate one, the current level of deposit is absolutely abysmal. This even has an effect on the estimates in as much as at the moment the informal vote in Australian Senate elections is upwards of 11 per cent-in Victoria and New South Wales it is down to about 9 per cent with a range of percentages for the rest of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major costs in any Federal election is in fact the scrutiny of Senate ballot papers. Anyone who has been involved in Federal elections will realise what a long and tedious task that is. The fact that the deposit has remained at its current level has encouraged not only the minority parties-and it is their right to contest elections-but also certain malicious people to encourage other people to nominate for a Senate election in the hope that a higher informal vote will accrue. Figures calculated on a percentage of current average weekly earnings would be something like $800 for the House of Representatives and $1,500 for the Senate. I am not suggesting that we necessarily have to set the figures that high but I should think we should set them at a realistic level based on a percentage of average weekly earnings as was the case in 1965. But the practice has changed since then. </PARA>
<PARA> I also indicate that the Electoral Office is operating under what I think is an absolutely outmoded electoral Act, an electoral Act that has not been altered substantially. Attempts were made during 1972 to 1975 to modernise that Act. But because certain features were unacceptable to the then Opposition all of the changes to the legislation were defeated in this place. I understand, and I think we were given some sort of indication, that some committee reports relating to electoral matters were coming. I understand that Halley's comet is also coming. I am wondering which will arrive first-the new electoral Bill or Halley's comet. I suspect it will be the latter. There is need for the Electoral Office to operate under a modern updated electoral Act so that it can run efficiently and its finances can be allocated properly. It is no use having an electoral Act in the 1980s that exists mainly to deal with the problems of the 1930s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to associate you, Mr Chairman, Senator Childs, Representative Les McMahon and Senator Gietzelt with the lucid exposition that was made by Senator Evans about the plight that faces watchmen and cleaning staff at most of the central offices in the various States. I know that Senator John Coates has raised this matter in respect of Tasmania. I know that it has also been supported to the full by Senator Robert Ray. I think this has been a very poor exercise in industrial relations. Even at this eleventh hour I hope that the Government will come forward with something positive. I know, speaking of the Sydney scene, that most of the men employed in this work saw service either in the Australian Defence Force or in the allied armies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter to which I wish to refer is in the ambit of the Department of Administrative Services. For well over 12 months I have been seeking some positive response about when the Moore Park engineers depot will be vacated by the Army to enable this site to be included in what is perhaps a vision splendid, a new sports stadium for Sydney which would encompass Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2, the Sports Ground and, of course, the engineers depot which is adjacent to or near the other two grounds. Lance Barnard when Minister for Defence undertook that this exodus would occur. I know that it was visualised that facilities for this branch of the Army would be made available at Singleton. I simply say that it is time the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) was able to provide me with an answer as to when this evacuation will take place. </PARA>

The matter raised concerned staff authorisations to Senator Harradine and, I think, also the Australian Democrats. But Senator Harradine is the one who concerns me here. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle claimed that the Government decision to provide a ministerial officer grade 1 to Senator Harradine was in conformity with the precedent established by the Whitlam Government in 1974. She stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In August 1974 Prime Minister Whitlam approved an assistant private secretary position for Senator Townley, then an independent senator. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Townley showed us when he raised this matter this afternoon and read the relevant correspondence, in fact, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was misleading Estimates Committee C when she made that claim. I have a number of questions to ask relevant to this item. I hope we get more truthful answers this time than Estimates Committee C was able to obtain on 21 September. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: Who made the arrangements for appointing an additional staff member at MO 1 level to Senator Harradine's staff? Was it Senator Carrick, Mr Newman, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or somebody else? After that question has been dealt with, I ask: Who communicated the relevant decision to the honourable senators concerned-Senator Harradine in particular and probably the Australian Democrats, although I am not so sure about them. Indeed, was it the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) who communicated the decision to Senator Harradine that that staff appointment had been approved? If so, what on earth was Mr Sinclair doing communicating a decision for which he had absolutely no ministerial responsibility for a House of which he was not a member? Why, if Mr Sinclair did in fact communicate that decision to Senator Harradine, was it not communicated by the Government Leader in this House or at least by the relevant Minister, Mr Newman? We hear a great deal from assorted Liberal and National Country Party senators about the alleged independence of this House and about its being an alleged States House. If that claim is to be taken seriously, why was Senator Carrick by-passed when this appointment was made? Why did Senator Carrick have no say in the decision to make this appointment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in a whole host of misleading and inaccurate answers which she has supplied to the Senate over the years, in particular when she was Minister for Social Security, has always prefaced those misleading answers with the words: 'I am advised that'. The concept of ministerial responsibility, of having to accept responsibility for allegedly inaccurate advice, certainly for a series of inaccurate statements made in the Senate and in the Estimates Committee, apparently completely eludes Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. For Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, as for the Prime Minister she serves, the concept of ministerial responsibility is dead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take up Senator Townley's point. He stated today, and repeated tonight, that in 1974 he was granted approval for the appointment of a research assistant without travel rights. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle claimed on 21 September that Mr Whitlam approved the appointment of an assistant private secretary for Senator Townley, who was then an independent senator. The staff member was not to be an assistant private secretary. That is the first error. The second false claim is that the appointment followed the precedent. Senator Harradine did not receive approval for the appointment of an assistant private secretary; it was for a ministerial officer grade I. I am not certain of the difference in salary, but the salary of one is roughly double that of the other. The question arises-and the chamber is entitled to know the answer-as to why Senator Harradine was treated so favourably and as to why the Minister, knowingly or otherwise, misled Estimates Committee C on 21 September. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw it because I have no way of establishing for certain that she did. The record does show that the information which Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle supplied to the Committee was not correct. That is beyond dispute. We are grateful to Senator Townley, in one of the few useful contributions he has made to debates since he has been a member of the Senate, for disclosing this afternoon that that answer by the Minister was inaccurate. I observe again that it is by no means the first occasion on which this Minister has given to the Senate information which is not accurate. It is always carefully prefaced by the phrase 'I am advised that'. If she keeps getting false advice it is about time she changed her advisers. The Senate certainly should not put up with continually being fed inaccurate information by this Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the other questions, I do not believe that the information I requested cannot be obtained. Presumably the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) is still in the building. He manages to turn up every time we call a division to adjourn the House, which should have adjourned almost an hour ago. All that is required for the major part of my question to be answered is for Senator Carrick to come into the chamber and tell us whether he made the decision to grant these extraordinary privileges to Senator Harradine and whether he communicated that decision to Senator Harradine when it was made. It is not necessary to ask some nameless and faceless bureaucrat whether that happened. All we need is for Senator Carrick to come in here and tell us whether he had anything to do with it. If he did not have anything to do with it, why did he not? Is this not supposed to be an independent House? We hear a great deal of rhetoric and humbug from an assortment of the people who populate the benches across the aisles. Why does not the Leader of the Government in the Senate have some input about who receives staff and special privileges. Was this some sleazy backroom deal arranged by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) in the House of Representatives and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to bypass their own leadership in the Senate, to bypass the responsible Minister, and provide special privilege for Senator Harradine for reasons which one does not have to be particularly perspicacious to determine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the remarks that have been made from the Government side of the chamber in particular, I think the record should be put straight. It now appears that Senator Walsh is being blamed for having raised this matter in the first place. The chamber should be made aware that the honourable senator who raised the matter in the Estimates committee meetings was not a member of the Australian Labor Party but in fact Senator Bjelke-Petersen. Her question is recorded at page 491 of the proceedings of 21 September. It was she who first queried the allocation of extra staff to Senator Harradine and the extra amount of money that it was to cost. It is evident that Government supporters are endeavouring to lay all the blame on Senator Walsh for raising this matter about Senator Harradine being provided with an extra staff member. We now know, having read Hansard, that what Senator Walsh is saying is absolutely correct; that in fact Senator Harradine was not provided with a staff member of the same classification as the staff member of Senator Townley. That is in Hansard and if honourable senators who were not in the chamber wish further proof of it they may read Hansard tomorrow and see what Senator Townley said. He stated tonight that he was supplied with a research officer.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Guilfoyle and Senator Baume are trying to lay the blame solely on the shoulders of Senator Walsh when, in fact, the matter was raised in the first instance by Senator Bjelke-Petersen, a supporter of the Government. She has expressed concern about the actions of the Government in giving special favours to Senator Harradine. One would not need more than one guess as to why these special privileges are offered when one looks at the composition of the Senate. There is no reason why the Government should try to lay the blame on Senator Walsh because there is disquiet in the Government's own ranks concerning what it is doing. According to the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal, every member of the Senate is entitled to an extra staff member as soon as the necessary accommodation can be provided. The Government was quickly able to provide the additional accommodation to house an extra staff member for Senator Harradine, who is only a recent addition to this chamber, having been here some six years, but it was not able to find extra staff for honourable senators who have been here for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>

When we look through the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services we find that the Government provides a backup staff for its back bench members. That has been admitted and is to be found in Hansard. Staff is provided to do the work of the Government back bench party committees, yet that privilege is not extended to members of the Opposition; we have to do our own work. We find the Government trying to curry favour with Senator Harradine because it expects that he will vote with it on some essential issues and thus giving him an extra staff member at an enormous rate of pay.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult to elicit facts from this Government, but one fact which we were able to demonstrate then was that Senator Carrick was still in the building; indeed, he is in this chamber. I repeat that there is absolutely no reason why the Government cannot answer at least some of the questions I have put to it and which the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, has dodged. What this Government clearly intends to do is to cover up this issue as it has covered up the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal for the last two years, hoping to sneak these Bills through this chamber on the promise of supplying information later on, information which either will not be supplied at all or will be supplied some time after the Government has got the Parliament up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Carrick is in the chamber now and I again put the question: Did Senator Carrick authorise or take any part in the decision authorising this additional staff member for Senator Harradine, this extraordinarily generous provision of staff for Senator Harradine, for reasons that are not very difficult to determine? Did he communicate that decision to Senator Harradine or was the decision communicated by none other than our old friend, Mr Sinclair, who had apparently, from the information so far available, in company with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and with or without Senator Harradine, cooked up some sleazy backroom deal under which Senator Harradine would be treated more favourably than any other Independent had ever been treated before? The Government has tried to brush it away in the first instance by saying 'Well, we are only doing for Senator Harradine what the Whitlam Government did for another Tasmanian Independent senator in 1974', an alibi that Senator Townley himself blew out this afternoon. At least some of the questions I put to the Minister can be answered and I ask the Government to answer those questions which concern Senator Carrick. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans raised a matter in regard to the employment of watchmen and cleaners. A number of other honourable senators expressed an interest in this matter. The total number of staff involved in this decision is 145. The majority of them are in Canberra. I understand that between 10 and 15 staff members are in Melbourne. The employment of cleaners and watchmen is being considered as a part of the arrangements for contracting out the work undertaken by those staff members. Tenders have been invited and are being studied. The successful contractors are being encouraged to employ as many of the present staff as possible. Where existing permanent and temporary staff cannot be replaced with a contractor they will be assured of continued Commonwealth employment for a period of up to 12 months, depending on age and length of service-I understand that it varies up to a period of 12 months. If after this period has expired employees cannot be placed at their existing pay rate or at a lower classification, they will be considered as surplus staff in accordance with the normal Public Service arrangements for this sort of situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Evans mentioned consultations with staff associations. I understand that this is a matter of continuing representation by the staff associations. It ought to be said that every effort is being made and will be made to place the staff if and tenders are put in and tenders are accepted which would result in the displacement of staff. I am aware of the interest of a number of honourable senators in this matter. I will refer again to the appropriate Minister the representations that have been made by those honourable senators on behalf of existing staff who may be affected by this decision. The pleas that were made on their behalf will be taken into account as far as is possible in dealing with the situation. I thank those honourable senators for bringing forward the matter in the way in which they did. I will see that it has the attention of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray raised matters relating to the Australian Electoral Office. I do not know whether I am able to offer him any information at this time. If any further information arises from the matters raised by him I will see that he is advised. </PARA>
<PARA> One further matter was raised by Senator Walsh relating to the staff of Senator Harradine and others. I draw to the attention of the committee information additional to that given by the Department of Administrative Services which is found on page 492 of the Hansard. I draw attention to the answer that was given relating to the staff of Senator Townley. Those honourable senators who have that Senate information would be aware of that additional answer, which was forwarded to Senate Estimates Committee C on 13 October. Those who read fairly the comments that were made by Senator Walsh will see that every effort was made to give information to the Committee, going back to 1974, with regard to the staffing of people who did not belong to the major political parties. This information was given certainly without any intent on my part to withhold information, to mislead honourable senators or to give inaccurate information. It honourable senators read the Estimates Committee report of 21 September, the discussion and information that was given by the officers who were in attendance at the Senate Committee hearing and their availability for further questions at any time that any member of the Committee wished to raise any matter with them would become clear. I draw attention to that additional information which was forwarded to the Committee on 13 October, which information is in the hands of those honourable senators who wish to consider this item. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know of any other matters that the Committee wishes to raise. As the Committee has come to a decision tonight not to take votes it may be competent that I move that the Committee report progress. It seems to me absurd to continue in the way that we are doing. If the Committee is not disposed to pass the votes of Senate Estimates Committee C at this time I would be prepared to move that the Committee report progress and seek leave to sit again. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) I am informed by the Law Reform Commission, that, following the publication in November 1980 of its discussion paper, 'Aboriginal Customary Law-Recognition?', two representatives of the Commission have this year conducted extensive public hearings and meetings in each State, the Northern Territory and Canberra. In order to facilitate consultation with Aboriginal women, one of these representatives was a woman. The Commission had cassette tapes and written transcriptions prepared in plain English which outlined the essential points of the discussion paper. Translations of the plain English version were also made in Warlpiri, Gupapuyngu and Pitjantjatjara. There are two tapes, one for men and one for women, which were widely circulated to Aboriginal communities before the public meetings. Locations of meetings were carefully chosen to enable Aboriginal people to attend without excessive travel. The Commission's consultations are continuing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) There are no provisions in the Health Insurance Act or the National Health Act which preclude any patient, with or without hospital and/or medical insurance, from having doctor of choice in a public hospital. Where a hospital inpatient chooses a private doctor he/she is required by the public hospital (State Government) to meet the charges, on a fee-for-service basis, for the medical services provided and the appropriate level of public hospital accommodation charge. Such medical charges are met through medical insurance or directly out of the patient's own pocket.</PARA>
<PARA> Doctors employed by a public hospital, whether on a salaried, sessional or contractual basis, are allocated by the hospital to patients choosing to be treated by hospital doctors. Where a patient exercising the right to doctor of choice chooses a hospital doctor who has a right of private practice, charges on a fee-for-service basis are raised by or on account of that doctor. Hospital doctors without right of private practice are allocated by the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Senator Peter Baume's statement was made in the context of the new health insurance arrangements which commenced on 1 September 1981. Senator Peter Baume was pointing out that hospital only insurance does not provide coverage for the medical charges associated with making a choice of doctor. These must either be covered by medical insurance or out of the patient's own pocket. Senator Peter Baume's statement was aimed at bringing attention to misunderstandings which might arise in the minds of some Australians that they might be able to take hospital insurance only and also choose their doctor to treat them in hospital without having to meet the fee-for-service medical charges involved in one way or another.</PARA>
