<PARA> Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the Australian people as a downright lie.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Basically, the reason for my confusion was, as Senator Button will know, that he asked about the 'Leader of the Opposition in the Senate'. I was not in a position to refer to criteria regarding the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is, as I understand it, that the Prime Minister in his then capacity in July 1975 made statements regarding integrity. Those statements have been adhered to and will continue to be adhered to. The unfortunate circumstances relating to the Royal Commission of Inquiry on Matters in Relation to Electoral Redistribution are known to the Senate and I do not think they are to be canvassed. The findings of the Royal Commission are known and therefore the matter is one on which the Senate is fully informed. I do not wish to comment any further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services to a recent report by the Secretary of the Victorian Police Association, Inspector Tom Rippon, alleging that the number of police officers who have left the Victorian Police Force because of ill health has increased more than twenty-fold in the last 20 years and that more than 80 per cent of the retirements were related directly to job stress. Is the Minister aware of any similar situation existing in the Australian Federal Police and, if such a situation does exist, what steps are being taken to combat it? If such a condition of extreme job stress is not apparent at present what, if any, programs with suitable back-up services can be introduced to ensure that this condition is kept to a minimum?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At present there is considerable interest in the matter of stress as it relates to people in various areas, including those holding office in the Parliament and in the Public Service. I am aware that the number of retirements from the Commonwealth Public Service came under notice within the last four or five years. Observations were made then about the increasing number of retirements due to invalidity, and about the different incidences of retirements as between regions. The important matter raised by Senator Bonner is one that has been under attention for some time but not in any organised way. I am not aware of the remarks of Inspector Tom Rippon concerning the Victorian Police; nor am I aware of the basis on which he states that retirements due to invalidity have increased by 20 times. I will refer the question to the Minister for Administrative Services and seek an answer to the matters raised by Senator Bonner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<QUESTION PAGE="844" SPEAKER="Colston Sen M.A." NAMEID="PF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Treasurer to a motion passed by the House of Representatives last Tuesday. That motion recommended that the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act be amended to take into account election funding when examining relativities between the States for revenue sharing. It also recommended that the Federal Government investigate the possibility of immediately reducing general revenue grants to States which adopt election funding by amounts equal to those spent by State governments for the funding of political parties. The intention of the motion was to deprive the State of New South Wales of Commonwealth funding because of that State's public funding of elections. I ask the Minister whether, in view of this expression of opinion by the House of Representatives, the Government has considered amending the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to take into account taxpayers' funding of private legal expenses incurred by Ministers of the Crown? If so, will Queensland residents be penalised if the Queensland Government pays the private legal costs of a Queensland Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not given any consideration to the matter raised by Senator Colston. I am not aware of the resolution that was passed in the House of Representatives regarding funding of political parties or of a recommendation to the Commonwealth Grants Commission relating to that matter. Neither has any consideration been given to whether grants to States ought to be adjusted if legal expenses are paid for Ministers, former Ministers or former Prime Ministers. Those matters do not warrant comment at this time because no consideration has been given to them by the Government. Nor would I suggest that there is great substance in the suggestions that have been made. However, I will take note of the question and perhaps, if some consideration is given to it, will advise the Senate accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the Minister to the current strike in the central Queensland coal fields which is now in its third month. Will the Minister advise the decrease in the coal tonnages because of the strike and the effect that decrease could be having on our export markets? Will the Minister advise also how many other people employed on the coal fields have been stood down because of the strike action by members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and what amount has been lost in wages by those workers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the current strike affecting seven mines in the central Queensland coal fields, which has been going on for some time and which is of concern to the Government, has caused great disruption to production and future exports. I understand that the strike is being caused by one union, the AMWSU, and has led to the stand-down of a number of members of other unions. Last week in the House of Representatives the Deputy Prime Minister responded to a question from the Leader of the Opposition and made the point that if the Opposition was concerned about helping Australian export industries it might play a more constructive role in endeavouring to improve our industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been advised that the loss of production caused by the dispute will prevent the shipment of some 2.5 million tonnes of export coal, with a consequent loss in export revenue of $125m. Furthermore, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments either have forgone or will forgo some $54m in lost taxes, duties and so on, even if the strike ends immediately, and the wage loss to industry employees is now in excess of $4m. The dispute was before the Coal Industry Tribunal late last week. A further hearing before the Tribunal was to have taken place on Friday. I have no up to date information on the outcome of that inquiry. I do not have information either on the precise number of employees stood down, which I think was part of the question asked by the honourable senator. I will seek advice on the position following the Friday meeting of the Coal Industry Tribunal and also try to get the precise figures for the honourable senator.</PARA>

<PARA> The Federal Government is considering restricting the operations of the State Governments and their government insurance offices in the general insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is to discuss with the general insurance industry whether it wishes to see restrictions placed on the operations of State Governments in setting workers' compensation and compulsory third party insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA>Is the report correct? If so, what are the reasons for the Government wishing to place restrictions on State governments participating in the writing of insurance? Is the Minister aware that the South Australian State Government Insurance Commission does not set the premiums for third party insurance in that State, but that the premiums are in fact set by the Third Party Insurance Premiums Committee, which is chaired by Mr Justice Sangster, whose reputation for impartiality is second to none? Finally, is the Minister aware that all private insurance companies opted out of writing third party compulsory insurance in South Australia of their own volition and not at the direction of the State Government?</PARA>

Severe petrol restrictions are pending in New South Wales also. What has been the outcome of yesterday's statements by the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware that both communities have tabled proposals relating to problems facing Cyprus at recent sessions of the intercommunal talks. It would be inappropriate for the Government to comment on these proposals when they are being discussed by the two communities at the talks. The Government continues to believe that any lasting settlement of the Cyprus question can be reached only by taking into account the legitimate interests and concerns of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. The intercommunal talks provide the most appropriate forum for these concerns to be taken into account. As the intercommunal talks are continuing, it remains to be seen how the United Nations General Assembly will handle the Cyprus question this year. It will be recalled that last year consideration of the Cyprus item was deferred in view of the recommencement of the intercommunal talks.

The fact is that in the weeks immediately ahead we are going to have in Australia one of the most significant world conferences. It is a fact that there is a risk of violence and therefore there is a need for extraordinary police precautions to safeguard against that violence. If, indeed, in any exercises some police had been injured that would be sad. But the exercises are part of the process of keeping the law and keeping the peace in a country where we abhor violence.

In view of the Government's inaction in that the Government has failed to honour its promise to have a debate in the Senate on this issue and has failed to implement the provisions of the Bowen report other than in a private arrangement between the Prime Minister and his Ministers, will the Government now take into account the expressed wish of the people of New South Wales and perhaps consider having a referendum on the issue?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is in the process of having discussions at this moment to extend those provisions to members of Parliament. I take it from Senator Button's question that, in fact, the Opposition will support the Bowen Committee. We will be bringing into this Parliament in due course recommendations for the implementation, for members as distinct from Ministers, of the remaining provisions of the Bowen Committee report.

I refer to that part of the Minister's answer which suggests that the Fraser Government was responsible for initiating the concept of public disclosure of members' private interests. I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that in 1974 the Labor Government set up a joint party committee of this Parliament in relation to the disclosure of members' private interests?

Can the Minister confirm that to this stage the response to these invitations has been disappointing? If there are CYSS participants who are unable to take up Government sponsored employment training opportunities for reasons of lack of self-confidence and personal motivation, are they not equally unlikely, for the same reasons, to avail themselves of the offered formal interviews at CES centres? Therefore, is the Minister prepared to consider altering the current arrangements to allow such interviews by the Commonwealth Employment Service to take place at CYSS project centres in an informal atmosphere?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Has the Government's attention been drawn to the recent Australian Council of Trade Unions decision concerning the export live sheep industry, which last year involved 5.6 million sheep and produced approximately $163m? Has account been taken of the effects of such a decision on unions other than the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union? I refer to the Australian Workers Union and its loss of 4 million or 5 million sheep a year for shearing, and the Transport Workers Union, which is involved in carting, and so on. If the decision were to be implemented, is any information available which would indicate that there is a payable market for the extra quantity of carcass meat suggested, or would it be expected to result in a substitution of live sheep from other countries? With the current lower slaughter numbers and the reduced throughput per slaughterman per day, what number of extra slaughtermen is it envisaged that the carrying out of this very dubious proposal may produce, as against the jobs it would cost?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator raised in his question matters which have been subject to some debate around Australia for some years now. The creation of fresh markets for Australian beasts through live export has been of great satisfaction to primary producers because it has provided markets to them in circumstances where markets otherwise might not have been available. I suppose the honourable senator's question relates to the most recent round of matters which have been raised. The Government's attention has been drawn to the ACTU resolution requesting the Government to restrict live sheep exports to a one for one, live sheep to mutton carcass ratio to all market countries. I think that advice was received direct from the ACTU, but as yet the Government has not received any advice from the ACTU as to how that resolution might be implemented. Just last month, prior to that decision, the Minister for Primary Industry met with an ACTU delegation led by the ACTU President, Mr Cliff Dolan. Following an undertaking given at that time, he will give a detailed response to the issues that the delegation raised with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the other points raised by the honourable senator in his question are concerned, it would be understood by him, I think, that freshly killed meats are still preferred by the majority of the population in our main market area, the Middle East. Also, the market for chilled and frozen lamb, beef and buffalo meat, and especially for poultry, has expanded significantly. Any move to restrict live sheep supplies may well result in a net loss for Australia as Middle East markets move to alternative meat or livestock supplies from other countries. World mutton markets are not currently buoyant and it is likely that any additional mutton available would have a depressing effect on the whole market, including sheep prices.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also raised the question of jobs in the industry. As far as that is concerned, the live sheep trade has generated new jobs in transport, shearing, manufacture of pellet fodder and preparation of sheep for export. Restriction of live sheep exports would result in loss of jobs in these areas, with no guarantee of a corresponding increase in jobs in meatworks.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible by action in Australia to dictate what form of meat will be imported by countries to which we are able to export. For that reason it is not a matter of the Government simply making decisions as to ratios or anything else. It is a matter of responding in the most sensible way possible to the markets which are available to our primary producers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed; I accept that I am a good judge because the theatre that faces me indulges in histrionics every day. The fact is that, as demonstrated by such things as reports from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, this Government has so much put Australia first that we are pacesetters in the development of economic stability. That has been recognised by objective arbiters from abroad. If Senator Elstob had wanted to read further in the Shell company statement he would have seen that there was an undertaking by Shell to pay heavy regard to Australian participation in further developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have established the Foreign Investment Review Board. It has set a minimum standard of 50 per cent Australian equity and participation in resources development. That in itself is highly significant and we have maintained it. We propose to go on maintaining it. We are attracting very considerable Australian investment. By the whole of our approaches, whether to nationals or multinationals, we are endeavouring to ensure that the development of Australia increases the real standard of living of Australians. In a year in which inflation ran at 8.8 per cent, the increase in average real wages ran at over 14 per cent. Therefore, there was a real increase in real wages for most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of industry and its protection is one that is under review by this Government. I am astonished at this question because from time to time I have heard Labor senators and Labor members seek lower protection. Who more than the Australian Labor Party would stand convicted of lower protection? It was the Whitlam Government which cut tariffs 25 per cent across the board and, in a space of six months, put 110,000 people out of employment. It is a strange question to be put to this Government by a member of a party which cut tariffs arbitrarily and brutally disemployed people in Australia. I have to say to Senator Elstob: 'Physician, cure thyself'.</PARA>

Professor Walsh is a Fellow of the Academy of Sciences and an eminent academician. He has been Dean of the Faculty of Medicine for some years. He is a professor of human genetics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Finniss River land claim is one of the most complex claims heard to date in the Northern Territory. The Commissioner's report indicates that there would be very wide detriment if the Commissioner's recommendations were acted upon. I think he recommended grants of land totalling about 40 per cent of the land claim. When I tabled this report in the Senate just before Parliament rose for the winter recess, I indicated that I would allow a two-month period to elapse to allow any legal challenges to be mounted against the Commissioner's report. I indicated also that I would defer any decision until I knew whether there were to be any legal challenges. The reason no decisions have been made by me so far is that, firstly, I had to allow that two-month period to elapse; secondly, I can advise the honourable senator that I have now been told that legal challenges are to be made against the Commissioner's ruling. The first challenge to be made is against the Commissioner's ruling that grazing licences do not constitute an alienation of land. A challenge is to be made also against the Commissioner's view that questions of detriment play no part in the recommendations for the granting of land. In view of the fact that legal challenges are pending and in view of undertakings which I have given previously, I have not been able to make any decisions on the Finniss River land claim report. In accordance with my earlier undertaking I will not make any decisions so long as the legal actions are proceeding expeditiously or, in fact, until the legal challenges are resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that the policy initiative of the Government was to establish centres of excellence in universities. In other words, the decision was restricted to universities. I want to pay tribute to institutes such as SAIT, the South Australian Institute of Technology, for the significance of their work. In general, a distinction between universities and colleges, but not a hard and fast one, is that universities pursue both primary and applied research whereas colleges basically are engaged in the dissemination of knowledge, although it is true that significant research is done in a number of places. I would think that it was on the basis of that dichotomy that the original decision was made, but I do not know and I will seek out the information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will ask the Minister concerned whether my statements and recollections are correct and whether there were any other considerations. I state emphatically that there is no intention to cast any kind of slur on college institutions, particularly what are called the Directors of Central Institutes of Technology colleges, which include the South Australian Institute of Technology. Having had close personal association with the college, I know it to be doing fine work, including some original work. I will refer the question to the Minister and seek further information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Does the feasibility study for a uranium enrichment plant presently being conducted by a group representing Peko-Wallsend Ltd, Western Mining Corporation Ltd, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present study relates basically to whether Australia would have the competence to carry out a uranium enrichment process; that is, to take yellow cake and enrich it. The study also seeks the best existing technology-whether a particular type of centrifuge, gaseous diffusion or chemical exchange-and, consistent with and related to that, whether there are markets available in the world for enriched uranium. The Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia has said basically that Australia has the capacity to carry out such a process and that there will be markets beyond 1990. It is seeking to determine the best technologies and shortly will make a recommendation as to the preferred technology holder. As to the question of a social impact statement, the Ranger uranium inquiry looked at the whole question of uranium. A considerable volume of knowledge exists throughout the world about the enrichment process. A number of plants already exist. If a decision were made in Australia to set up a uranium enrichment process, two undertakings would be necessary once the location had been determined-an environmental impact statement and, associated with that, a social impact statement. This is fundamentally a technology and marketing situation and a measurement of Australia's capacity in that regard. Once the report is to hand, which should be at some time next year, if a decision is made to pursue it, the question of the location of such a plant will come into consideration, and all of the necessary protective mechanisms will be put into effect. I am bound to say that there is available to us a considerable body of expert evidence on the whole of the nuclear cycle and that great experience exists around the world on the enrichment of uranium.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, both in his capacity as Minister for National Development and Energy, and as the representative of the Prime Minister. It refers to the proposed referendum to be held in Tasmania in connection with electricity supply. Can the Minister tell the Senate whether there has been any approach to the Government by Tasmania about the possibility of Tasmania's importing electricity from the State of Victoria? Also, has there been any progress in relation to the formation in the south-east of Victoria of a grid for the mutual supply of electricity from one State to another?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will know, some time ago the Commonwealth Government set up what is now known as the Zeidler Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generating and the Sharing of Power Resources in south-east Australia, under the chairmanship of a distinguished Australian, Sir David Zeidler. It comprised representatives of the four south-eastern Australian States-New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. The basic terms of reference involved the feasibility and desirability of a power grid which would permit power sharing as between those States. Clearly one undertaking would be a cable under Bass Strait. I hope the report will be available in the immediate weeks ahead. There have been discussions with Tasmania. Assuming there were such a cable, Tasmania could take part by obtaining its base supply from the mainland and using its peak load, in conjunction with the peak load of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, to increase the total usage. As the honourable senator will know, it is essential to be able to deliver the highest load that may occur in the worst season of demand. Hydro-electricity, whether it be in the Snowy or Tasmania, has an ability to augment peak loads with electricity at its cheapest because the water power is turned on only when it is needed; it is not wasted at times of base load.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been discussions between the States. I do not wish to comment further until the report comes out. I am hopeful that the report will indicate the desirability of a grid. My tentative view is that in the long run there will be a necessity for the linking of the four States and, indeed, perhaps the fifth State. Such linking is a fairly common practice in Europe. It makes sense as there is no need to have huge base loads if there is a capacity to meet peak loads. The Institution of Engineers Australia has suggested that such a grid would make sense, but as a report is reasonably in prospect in the near future I hesitate to make further comment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that this matter arose when, by accident, a radioactive measuring device which contained the radioactive material caesium 137 was inadvertently put into scrap and placed into a melting furnace in Singapore, therefore contaminating the furnace, including the furnace walls. There had been some difficulties with regard to this matter. My understanding is that the employees of Western Mining Corporation have now agreed to a suggestion that the material, when returned to Australia, should be buried in a concrete-lined vault situated some five miles out of Kambalda. That is subject, of course, to State authority. I report that the Australian Radiation Laboratory of the Commonwealth Department of Health has made exhaustive tests of the material and its storage in Singapore. It has made recommendations on the material's cartage and has concluded that the storage and cartage of the material would be perfectly safe and without detrimental effect to humans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 26 August 1981 the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for investigation and report the Government's decision to sell the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. These decisions were announced in the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The procedures for disposing of the factories have already been commenced by the Government. It is abundantly clear that if the decisions are to be reviewed, then the review should take place immediately. To delay a review would unnecessarily prolong the state of uncertainty in which all those people affected by the decisions find themselves. The Committee and indeed all honourable senators are aware of the high degree of concern over the decision felt by those affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic statement I wish to make to the Senate today is that the Committee is unable to undertake an inquiry into the decision at this time because of the pressure of the work load with which we are already faced. As you are aware, Mr President, since October 1977, the Committee has had the responsibility for the continuing oversight of the financial and administrative affairs or undertakings of Commonwealth statutory authorities generaly. We have produced four reports on this subject and a fifth is currently in an advanced draft stage. A considerable amount of work remains to be done on the fifth report before it can be presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are a large number of other matters currently referred to the Committee, primarily involving late annual reports which have been presented by authorities and some follow-up inquiries arising from Estimates committees. The Committee's investigations into these late annual reports can involve varying degrees of activity but can sometimes be a very substantial undertaking as they are sometimes merely a surface indication of very deep structural or operational problems. For example, our investigations of the late reports presented by the Australian Wheat Board have involved the Committee in a full scale inquiry into that authority's accounting system and its accountability. The Wheat Board's financial statements are still subject to qualification by the Auditor-General and consequently require the Committee's attention. In addition to these current references the Committee has in recent months been preparing for several major future inquiries on the completion of the current inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Committee were to commence an inquiry into the sale of the factories, the work involved would be substantial. We could expect submissions from all parties involved; that is, the Department, the factories themselves, factory employees, local interest groups in Coburg and Bendigo and any private enterprise groups interested in the purchase of the factories. A large number of public hearings would be involved and a visit to the factories by the Committee would be essential. Therefore, if the Committee were to commence this inquiry it would fully occupy us until well into early 1982. We would therefore have to postpone work on all other references until then. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons the Committee does not see its way clear to commence an immediate inquiry into the Government's decision to sell the factories but reiterates that any such inquiry should be conducted as a matter of urgency. If the Senate is of the opinion that the matter should be pursued, then to enable it to be conducted expeditiously it may wish to consider the establishment of a small select committee which could report in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA> (d) the composition and powers of the Select Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this motion has been well canvassed in the Senate in the last two or three weeks. It was canvassed first when the Senate referred the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. The Committee, having met and considered that reference, concluded and was properly led to conclude, first of all that it might be appropriate to establish a select committee if the Senate was of that opinion, and secondly, that any inquiry conducted by the select committee should be conducted expeditiously. It is a matter of public notoriety that the proposed sale of the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo and the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg is a matter of Government decision. The purpose of this proposed inquiry by the Senate is not so much to say whether we agree or disagree with that decision but to deal with the vast range of indecisions which have arisen since the handing down of the report of the ministerial Review of Commonwealth Functions, which started this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I illustrate this point by reference to the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo, with which I am personally fairly familiar. The Ordnance Factory employs some 600 people, of whom in excess of 200 are tradesmen. It employs quite a large number of apprentices. There is great concern about the ramifications of the decision to sell the Ordnance Factory amongst not only the work force at the factory but also the people of Bendigo generally. As in any town of that size, the employment ramifications of an industry of that size for the whole town are significant. For example, the Bendigo Ordnance Factory trains close to 100 apprentices a year. Those apprentices are trained not only for the purposes of the factory itself but also to some extent for the benefit of the industry generally in Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the decision of the ministerial Review of Commonwealth Functions there has been great concern amongst the employees of the factory and generally in Bendigo in relation to this issue. Without embarking upon any ideological discussion of the desirability of the sale or otherwise at this stage, there are two, to use that dreadful word, scenarios: Firstly, the factory is sold; or secondly, it is not sold. If it is sold the very strong impression amongst people at the Ordnance Factory, and indeed amongst businessmen who have shown some interest in the factory, is that it is likely to be sold as an asset-stripping exercise. The consequences for the economy of the city of Bendigo if that takes place are very extensive. There is a lot of concern about the future employment prospects, if that takes place, of the people currently employed at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming, on the other hand, that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is not sold, then there is considerable concern that because of the cloud, as it were, that has been over its future for some time it will be less successful than it has been in the past in tendering for various engineering works. There is also a very big question about continuity of government work for the Ordnance Factory. So, with either possibility, there is concern about the impact on the economy of Bendigo in respect of the future of that factory. Sold or not sold, similar concerns now arise. It is those matters in particular which it is hoped that a Senate select committee would inquire into in the hope of relieving some of the concern which exists in a city such as Bendigo. I use that as an illustration of the importance of establishing this committee and the important function which a select committee of the Senate can perform in relation to a very real economic and social problem for that city. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense different considerations arise in relation to the clothing factory at Coburg but they are still factors relating to the generation of uncertainty about future employment, the operations of that factory in terms of its defence significance, and so on. But the basic question again relating to uncertainty is the question of future employment. It is for those reasons that I commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be opposing this motion for reasons which are, in general, in accord with the views expressed in the statement put down by Senator Peter Rae with respect to the problems of delaying the review and thus unnecessarily prolonging a state of uncertainty. That is reflected in the comments that Senator Peter Rae has just made to the Senate on the views of the local member for the area. At the same time, the problem which the Senate faces is one which is worth noting, that is, just how much committee activity the Senate can undertake at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations might be thought to be the most appropriate Senate vehicle for this sort of exercise. But, as has been pointed out by the Committee, through its Chairman, in fact it has a work load which precludes it undertaking the work in the time that everyone agrees is appropriate, namely, as soon as possible. I have little doubt that similar problems are faced by other Senate committees. If we look at the back of the Notice Paper we find that we now have seven standing committees of the Senate, eight legislative and general purpose standing committees, eight estimates committees, three joint statutory committees and three joint committees. I think that totals 29 committees. When we consider the number of senators who are not members of the front bench of either side of the Senate, we start to realise that senators are carrying extremely heavy loads. I think that that brings out the point that there are limits on the ability of this chamber to pursue every issue of policy and every question of fact which may be of concern to honourable senators. I suggest that that is a matter which all of us in this place are going to have to bear in mind in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties that the Senate will have is meeting what the Government would regard as a critical part of this motion, the requirement to report within a limited time. I think it is common ground around the chamber that that is desirable, and that is the reason why the Opposition, as I understand it with the support of the Australian Democrats, has proposed an inquiry which is rather shorter than the normal Senate committee inquiry. But it remains for us to find a number of senators from various parts of the chamber who will be able to give this matter the attention that will be required in the very short time that is made available by this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Government, again in common with something said by Senator Button when he spoke to the motion a short time ago, that the sale of these properties is a matter of government decision. The decision has been taken and it is the Government's wish to proceed with the sale of those operations. The proposal for a Senate committee inquiry apparently has induced some uncertainty and some greater sense of concern in the community in which these factories operate. For that reason the Government agrees that it is desirable that the matter should be disposed of promptly. We support the appointment of a select committee on that basis and its reporting to the Senate by the first sitting day in November. Any failure to do that would exacerbate problems which were acknowledged by the Senate Committee on Finance and Government Operations, and which were acknowledged by the Opposition in putting forward this resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill 1981 is a machinery Bill and one which seeks to implement the professed policy of conservative governments, which was announced in 1960-that is some 21 years ago-to bring about a more relevant relationship between the costs of running the air industry in Australia by applying the principle of the user pays and of cost recovery to such an extent that the taxpayers of our country would not be required to subsidise heavily the air industry. This is a machinery Bill and as such the Opposition, having adopted a consistent attitude to amendments to air navigation charges over the years, does not intend to oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is designed to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952 which prescribes the charges payable in respect of the use by aircraft of aerodromes, air route and airway facilities, meteorological services and search and rescue services which are maintained, operated or provided by the Commonwealth. The purpose of the Bill is to vary the rates of air navigation charges payable for aircraft operating in all sectors of the aviation industry. It is a step in the direction which ought to be supported, and is being supported, by all parties in the Senate. This piece of legislation has been on and off the legislative program for the last several weeks. One can understand, therefore, the decision of the Government to bring the legislation forward today because it is proposed that the new charges be effective from 1 October which is not much more than a week away. </PARA>
<PARA> The variations proposed in the rate of air navigation charges are to reduce the rates applicable to the international sector by 5 per cent; to increase the rates applicable to the domestic airline sector by 12 1/2 per cent; to increase the rates applicable to the regional airline sector by 25 per cent, and to increase the rates applicable to general aviation sectors by 20 per cent. If these proposals are acceptable to the Parliament-I am sure they will be, having read the debates which have taken place in the House of Representatives-it is estimated that revenue to be earned by the Commonwealth from air navigation charges in 1981-82 will, together with payments made in that year for 1980-81 operations, total $115.76m. This compares with the $95.89m received from air navigation charges in the preceding year, 1980-81. Further, the levels of increase proposed for the domestic airlines should have a minimal effect on air fares as they should increase airlines costs by about one per cent for regional airlines and by about 0.5 per cent for domestic trunk airlines. The impact on total costs faced by general aviation operators in that area is also expected to be minimal, although one could imagine that in some sense there will be further criticism by a number of airline operators about the proposed increased charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might be reminded that the Liberal-National Country Party Government projected in 1961 that there was a need to adopt a policy. The Government subsequently did so in its 1961 Budget for the eventual full recovery of the costs properly attributable to the air transport industry for providing and maintaining the aviation infrastructure. We are aware that in succeeding years the whole infrastructure of the airline industry has increased dramatically in terms of both construction costs and the maintenance of those new facilities. We now have an air industry which is comparable with-some will say it is better than-any other airline industry in the world. As the Australian Labor Party has said on so many occasions, I think it is proper that the general taxpayer should not be called upon to subsidise the airline industry any longer. It is a major industry and it is capable of sustaining itself. It is a very profitable industry for the main airline operators. It is very profitable from the point of view of the international airlines. It is proper, therefore, that they should pay the substantive part of the costs involved in maintaining the airline infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> Full recovery of attributable costs was first achieved in 1975-76 in respect of the international sector. While this sector has continued to be fully recovered, the rates of air navigation charges for international operations have not been varied since 1 December 1976. Further, in the 1980-81 Budget, the Government announced that overrecovery in this area should be credited to the cost recovery program and applied to the development of the aviation infrastructure generally. The Government has decided that there should be a reduction of 5 per cent in the rate of air navigation charges for international operators effective also from the date to which I referred earlier-that is, 1 October 1981. While there will be overrecovery in this sector, the Government reaffirms its 1980-81 decision on the treatment to be afforded overrecovery from this sector of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted also that the Australian charges for international operations compare more than favourably with those imposed overseas when the comparison is made on the same basis. I think we are entitled to say that the international operators have very little to complain about in relation to the way in which successive Australian governments have endeavoured to adopt a rational attitude in respect of international charges. Australia, unlike most overseas countries, imposes a composite fee which covers landing fees, parking fees, terminal air traffic control, en-route aids and services, et cetera. Overseas, these elements are often the subject of separate charges, which can be raised by different authorities, and in some cases they may vary accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that in the 1981 airlines agreement, the Australian National Airlines Commission and the companies recognised that the Commonwealth is entitled to recover fully its infrastructure costs. That is progress, having regard to the complaints that were received years ago when governments generally set about in a bipartisan fashion to put the operations of the airlines on such a basis that the taxpayers would not be subsidising the industry. Both airlines agreed to facilitate the implementation of measures designed to achieve this objective. Their agreement was subject to the proviso that, allowing for minor variations between the years, the Commonwealth did not seek to recover more than 100 per cent of its costs. Moreover, to achieve this objective, the agreement does not limit the level of air navigation charges which the Government may impose. Of course, one has to say that the Commonwealth, in the years that it has accepted responsibility for the airline industry, has outlaid tremendous capital costs in developing the infrastructure which now makes the industry such an important part of our whole economy. The decision taken by government to increase the rates of air navigation charges for the domestic trunk airline sector by 12 1/2 per cent is in accord with the agreement and should result in a recovery rate approaching 100 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government decided that there would be no change in the level of air navigation charges for both the regional airline and general aviation sectors. These charges, however, were to be reviewed in the light of the study of the general aviation sector. As honourable senators will know, the Government has not accepted the cost recovery recommendations made by that study, although the rate of charges will continue to be reviewed annually. The Government has decided to increase air navigation charges by 25 per cent and 20 per cent for the regional airline and general aviation sectors respectively. These rates of increase should result in similar rates of recovery in those sectors to those achieved in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I seek leave, with the assistance of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the cost recovery rates in total for the years 1970-71 to 1979-80, I remind the Senate that in 1974 the then Minister for Transport, as a member of the Labor Party, sought to increase cost recovery rates generally. I remind honourable senators that in 1970-71 the rate was only 49.4 per cent from all sectors and that for the year 1974-75 the Labor Party Transport Minister, Mr Charles Jones, moved to increase that rate to achieve a recovery of 54.8 per cent so that the deficit for that year, which was a charge to the taxpayers, would be $65m. Mr Jones did not get the support of the Opposition Liberal and Country parties whose supporters were quite critical of Mr Jones's attempts to implement what in fact was a policy initiated by the conservative Government in 1961. In the House of Representatives every legislative trick in the book was pulled to create difficulties for the Labor Government in 1975. It is interesting to note the Mr Nixon, who is now under some difficulties in explaining away his lack of administrative capacity as Minister for Primary Industry, was the prime culprit in that debate. One can only say that in 1974 the conservatives were dragging the chain in respect of this very principle on which they expect, and are willingly receiving, the support of the Opposition concerning this legislation. It seems to me that if we support the principle so strongly exhibited by the Menzies administration in 1961 that the airline industry should stand on its own feet and that we should move from the very low participation by the various sectors of the airline industry in contributing to the cost of the infrastructure, it is hard to understand why such a negative attitude was taken by Mr Nixon in that period. I suppose we can only say it was part of the obstruction and the difficulties that the conservatives applied generally during the three years of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. Certainly we do not propose to take a dog in the manger attitude on this legislation by adopting a negative position because we support the principle that the charges should be commensurate with the cost of maintaining the airline industry properly, rationally and on a basis which is not a cost to revenue, a cost to the taxpayers of this country. The Opposition supports the legislation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the cost recovery rates for the various sectors of the civil aviation industry for the years 1970-71 to 1979-80. The table was prepared by the appropriate authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill. I believe there are some serious anomalies in the way these new charges have been brought into effect but because there is a deadline of 1 October for this legislation I will not be opposing it. However, I ask the Government to consider seriously the remarks I shall make with a view to considering this matter again when the charges come before the Government for further changes. The anomalies, as I perceive them, are based on both the reports of the Holcroft Inquiry-the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares-and the Price Waterhouse Associates report on air fare charges. Both of those reports stressed that the charges made to airline tickets should be based as closely as possible to the actual costs incurred. Both Senator Gietzelt and I agree that cost recovery should be a policy adopted by this Government. I support the user pays principle, that is, the person who flies should be the one who pays the cost. As a corollary, I believe the airline industry should have some say in the way these charges are set, and that is the basis of my problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From a study of the way in which these air navigation charges have been determined I have found that a passenger who flies direct from Perth to Sydney or from Perth to Melbourne pays the same air navigation charge amount as the person who flies the same route but whose plane lands in Adelaide. To me that seems to be contrary to the spirit of the quite specific recommendations as set out in the reports of both Holcroft and Price Waterhouse Associates. If an aeroplane does not land in Adelaide on its way to Melbourne or Sydney there is no way that it could incur the costs that an aeroplane which lands in Adelaide would incur. I think the Government has been in error in applying these sorts of increases across the board without taking these matters into consideration. I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, will in reply give me some assurance that the Government will consider this matter when the air navigation charges are next reviewed by it so that I can be confident this matter will be looked at again. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise is not totally relevant to the Bill before the Senate but this is probably the only opportunity I will have to make this point. I have had a very close look at the Price Waterhouse Associates report of July 1981 which I guess was mainly a report in response to the Holcroft report. After a close study of the Price Waterhouse report I found it to be full of anomalies. I trust that the Government will be establishing the independent air fares committee very soon and that when that committee is established -I believe we have had an undertaking from the Government that any future increase in air travelling costs will be decided by that committee-it will look very closely at the Price Waterhouse Associates report. It is full of qualifications. I find it quite astounding that, having regard to the number of qualifications contained in that report, the inquiry did reach the conclusions that are set out in the report. I urge the Government in the first instance to work with all possible speed to establish the independent air fares committee. When that committee is established I expect that it will treat that Price Waterhouse report with a great deal of suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the matter that concerns me is that the increases in the air navigation charges have been applied across the board although both the Holcroft report and the Price Waterhouse report underlined the need for the charges to be as closely as possible allocated under the user pays system. I have illustrated my concern by drawing attention to the fact that if a plane flies direct from Sydney to Perth or Melbourne to Perth and does not land in Adelaide the air navigation charges factor is charged as though that plane did land in Adelaide. That is my main concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take up too much of the time of the Senate on the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill 1981, but as a South Australian I feel it is incumbent on me to make some statement on air navigation charges. As anybody who has visited South Australia, and certainly anybody who resides there, knows it is a large State with a vast area inaccessible by ordinary trunk route aircraft facilities. South Australia's outback areas depend for access very largely on the general aviation industry, and it is to this section of the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill that I will pay particular attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned that neither the Government nor the Opposition appears to see any problems inherent in increasing charges on the general aviation industry in Australia. It was indicated in the Budget that the charges will go up. That they are not going up more is due only to the fact that the General Aviation Association (Australia) and other organisations involved in the general aviation industry protested most strongly to the Government when they became aware of the size of the increases intended to be made under the general aviation report. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Bill is attacking those least able to pay and those who are doing most to develop the Australian outback and other inaccessible areas. It also seems to me that the Government's attitude, in its user pays argument in relation to airlines, and general aviation in particular, is inconsistent with its attitude to subsidies in other areas. For instance, the Commonwealth has given considerable assistance for the development of transport networks in remote areas and for the provision of all-weather road and rail links to remote areas. It is funding national highways and developmental roads in the Northern Territory to the tune of $21.1m, of which $12.3m is earmarked for national highways and developmental roads and $6.9m for local roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Railway transport in remote areas has also been funded to a great extent by the Commonwealth Government. For instance, it is providing $140m for the recently constructed Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway, while the proposed construction of the links from Alice Springs to Darwin and Adelaide to Crystal Brook is also receiving attention on the grounds that they will provide faster and more reliable rail travel. The Government is quite prepared to accept that the provision of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway is hard to justify on purely economic grounds and that although there are important defence reasons for its construction, the line really is regarded as a way to breathe new life and new opportunities into communities along the railway route. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also paid substantial subsidies to offset the losses incurred in the operations of the Australian National Railways, to the tune of $58.1m in 1979-80. It also provides subsidies to the operators of developmental air services. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his election speech promised to continue such support for aviation services to remote areas. I wonder just how consistent this promise is with the increase in general aviation charges in particular and other regional air charges in general. Apparently, the Government also promised to expand its capital works program in respect of aviation facilities, particularly a $400m program to upgrade aviation facilities at Cairns, Darwin, Townsville and Norfolk Island, in addition to several metropolitan areas. One wonders therefore whether the introduction of increased air navigation charges is being used as a means, however minor, of offsetting some of the costs of this program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fallacy to assume that the majority of people involved in general aviation are wealthy doctors or farmers who therefore can afford, as other groups in the community may not be able to do, to pay the extra charges for air navigation requirements. The Government says it is imposing these charges to offset the cost of certain equipment used by aircraft at aerodromes, between aerodromes, and so on. I contend that in fact the majority of people involved in the general aviation industry have neither any interest in nor use for some of the sophisticated devices the costs of which are being put forward by the Government as the reason behind these increased charges. It is also interesting to note that things such as beacons in many other countries of the world are funded from the defence allocation, something which this country does not seem to consider necessary. Instead, the Government applies the brunt of the burden to an industry which is vitally essential to States such as South Australia and Queensland where, as I said earlier, a vast area is isolated and inaccessible by anything other than, for example, charter aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The highest proportion of users of the general aviation sector of the aviation industry are primary and rural producers; for instance, people associated with or dependent on crop dusting or tuna spotting, whose livelihoods could very well be affected by the increase in the charges. I am surprised that the National Country Party, which alleges that one of its main interests is the welfare of country people, should not be hopping mad at the increases-however slight some people may think they are-in air navigation charges for the general aviation industry. The 20 per cent increase this year may seem much less than the 604 per cent increase over five years envisaged earlier on, but it is nevertheless an increase which can be ill-afforded by a substantial part of the general aviation industry. When compared to the 12 1/2 per cent increase in the rate now to be applied to the domestic airlines sector, I suggest that it is nothing if not a direct gift to Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines at the expense of the rural sector of the general aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Areas such as South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia will not be aided in any substantial way by the fact that regional airline sectors are expected to pay rates increased by 25 per cent. I and my party are deeply concerned at the potential loss that could occur in the general aviation industry, an industry which employs over 5,500 people and which could find itself in straitened circumstances with the application of this increase. I take this opportunity to say how disappointed we are that the other parties are apparently going to combine to pass the legislation, leaving us in an extreme minority in opposing it. We feel that the needs of the agricultural and fishing industries and of people in isolated areas will not be served at all well by the increases proposed under the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill 1981. We feel that the isolation of many people in remote areas will only be increased and that the costs added to those employed or acting as employers in the general aviation industry will not be able to be borne by many of them. Perhaps it may seem to certain members of the Labor Party that it will not hurt if a specialist doctor is not able to fly from one side of South Australia to another to attend to patients, that after all it is only his practice that will suffer, and that if his costs go up that is unfortunate. However, I suggest that the patient too will suffer as a result. It may be of no interest to some honourable senators that small farmers who rely very much on the use of charter and commuter services and so on will be hard done by. It is of considerable concern to us that this is the case, and I am afraid that I can see nothing at all to commend in this Bill of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest, and indeed with some agreement, to the remarks of the previous speaker, Senator Haines. However, if the people who use the airline system are not to pay and if, according to remarks of Opposition members on the sales tax legislation, we are to reduce the Government's taxation sources, I wonder where we will be at the end of the day. Over a period the policy that the user pays has been adopted in the airline system. The burden has been spread, deliberately, unevenly across the airline system. General aviation, the charter operators and the regionals have borne lower costs than could have been attributed to them. I welcome that and think it is fair enough. The international operators have borne higher costs than should have been attributed to them and that fact has been reflected in this legislation. There is to be a slight reduction in the air navigation charges that they pay. I doubt very much whether the domestic airline operators would accept the suggestion made by Senator Haines that they are being subsidised by the general aviation sector of the market. I think one could buy an argument with them on that basis at any time of the day, and indeed also with those who use domestic airlines, because air navigation charges are reflected in the fare structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to express a bit of concern, having spent some time as a member of the Government and, as one interested in transport, in participating in a review of the general aviation study, at the way in which charges have been attributed. It is history now that quite a few of us took exception to the report and indeed thought it was basically unfair. We put to the Government the case that it should not be proceeded with at this time. The Government accepted that case. Consequently we did not see massive increases which would have been an impost on the general aviation sector. I accept that there is a problem in the attribution of costs, but a far deeper look into the matter is needed to ensure that there is fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept what Senator Haines has said; that a large section of the general aviation market, and some of the charter operators, do not have a great need all of the time, or even most of the time, for the navigational aids that are around the countryside. However, a lot of the aircraft coming on to the general market have at least, as well as an automatic direction finder, distance-measuring equipment. Quite a few of the later ones have VOR-very high frequency omnidirectional radio-range equipment-which means that they can use the navigational aids, particularly if they go into controlled air space. Still, it must be said that a lot of the aircraft moving around in the inland areas of Australia do not use navigational aids to a great extent and certainly not most of the time. Consideration should be taken of the fact that such aircraft are often used privately or on station properties in order to keep mustering camps going or in flying from one property to another in the every day course of business. Their pilots have very little use for navagational aids. That should be considered when imposing air navigation charges. Also, the way in which the Department of Transport has attributed those costs should be examined. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that worries me, as indeed it worries the whole aviation industry, is that we have no measurement of the efficiency of the Department of Transport. It would be no news to anybody that a lot of us are concerned about the fact that when the Department of Civil Aviation was absorbed into the Department of Transport the level of efficiency slipped. Indeed many people-and I would be one-would like to see the Department of Civil Aviation re-formed as a separate department, so that it could handle the peculiarities within the airline system operating in Australia today. We do not have a measurement of efficiencies. The people we ask to pay these charges-the aircraft owners and users-are paying they think, with some justification, into a bottomless pit by a process over which they have no control whatsoever. We have not had a good look at the internal efficiency of the Department. That should be done in order to ensure that people are obtaining the best value for the dollars that are spent. We cannot expect users to pay endlessly into this bottomless pit without being given any indication that their money is being well spent. They have a legitimate complaint, one that I accept. It is about time this matter was looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have a problem, not experienced in other countries, caused by our small population. I have mentioned it before and no doubt will mention it again. Not only have we a small population but also our population is so situated around the country that we have high costs. In Queensland we have a smaller population than does Sydney or Melbourne yet we have nine jet airports which operate every day of the week, at a not insignificant cost. In addition, we have numerous airports that are up to F27 standards, and all of the others that are used every day of the week by general aviation. The operation and maintenance of those airports does not come cheaply. Yet, as I have said before, we have such a small population over which to spread the costs. Therefore, it is all the more essential that money be spent wisely and that we have a good look at the efficiency of the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity presented by the debate on this Bill to comment briefly on some of the statements that have been made in Brisbane about the curfew. It must be said that many people, in order to grandstand or for their own political advantage, have raised a lot of controversy in Brisbane about aircraft that are capable of flying outside the curfew coming onto the market. By that I mean that such aircraft meet the requirements of the United States Federal Aviation Administration's regulations, as set out in paragraph 36, and also the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annexe 16 on noise abatement procedures and the allowable noise from aircraft, be it fly-over lateral or take-off noise. The Airbus meets any criteria laid down in the world, particularly those of the FAA and the ICAO. We are not sure about the Boeing 767 as only a prototype is being flown, but it is equipped with engines similar to those of the Airbus-derivatives of the General Electric CF6. Therefore, there is no reason why we cannot expect it to meet the same noise criteria. Yet we have had in Brisbane a nauseating exercise to whip up people's emotions about what will happen if the new aircraft are allowed to fly between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. The only way in which we can possibly keep air fares at a reasonable level is to obtain maximum utilisation of our aircraft. Our airlines buy aircraft which meet all the noise criteria set down by world bodies, yet the aim of this nauseating whipping up of people's emotions is to prevent those aircraft from doing precisely what they were designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> If Trans Australia Airlines is not operating its five Airbuses between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. we will have $300m worth of aircraft, that could be flying and raising revenue, sitting instead on the ground because of this ridiculous campaign. The same will be true of the five Boeing 767 aircraft when they are put into operation. It is pretty hard to put a cost on the loss in their case because Ansett Airlines of Australia bought them as part of a package, but we are looking at possibly $235m or $250m worth of aircraft-half a billion dollars worth of aircraft in all-sitting on the ground between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. because of ridiculous complaints by people seeking short term political advantage. I venture to say that if a decibel meter reading were taken in Brisbane on either Nudgee Road or Kingsford-Smith Drive when an Airbus or a Boeing 767 was flying over on approach or take-off, the noise level would not register if a truck-of which there are many on those roads-were also passing at the time. There are many of them because both roads lead to industrial parts of Brisbane. What I am saying is that more traffic noise around that airport would be generated by heavy trucks going about their ordinary work than would be generated by either of those aircraft in their normal duties. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, there would be no reason, other than extreme wind conditions, why during the hours of darkness the aircraft could not come in over Moreton Bay in Brisbane and over Botany Bay in Sydney. As I said, for the sake of short term political advantage the campaign to which I referred has been whipped up. The sooner the Government bites the bullet on this and gets use out of those aircraft so that we can keep our air fares as low as possible and the airlines can have a proper return on their investment the better off we will be. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate, including the Opposition, for its support of the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill. I acknowledge some of the points made during the debate. Senator Gietzelt made one or two points in relation to the recovery rate of charges and increases in charges over the years. He was right in acknowledging the fact that each year the rate of increase has risen. I suppose that in general terms that reflects the gradual development and growth of the industry over the years. In the early 1960s and the late 1950s one might have described the industry as being in its infancy. We can expect the industry as it develops to be in a stronger position and more able to meet the charges. Applying a rough rule of thumb, I think it is fair to say that the operations of the airlines and their continuing growth each year justify the approach to cost recovery that has been adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Thomas, during his remarks-I was glad to learn that he is not opposing the legislation-acknowledged that fundamentally this legislation follows the user pays principle. He asked when the independent inquiry into air fares would be established. I understand that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) announced yesterday that within the next two to three weeks an announcement would be made concerning the establishment of a committee to inquire into air fares. Senator Thomas mentioned also in his general comments on difficulties concerning air fares the Price Waterhouse Associates report and, in particular, the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. The Minister has announced that the Government will refer both the Holcroft report and the Price Waterhouse report to the independent air fares committee, when it is established, to consider when it conducts its first cost allocation review. Of course, those reports reflect different philosophies. No doubt the issues to which Senator Thomas addressed himself will be picked up and discussed by that committee at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular matter Senator Thomas mentioned was the system whereby the charges applying to flights between Perth and Melbourne-I think he mentioned also flights between Perth and Sydney-include a loading for navigation costs incurred around Adelaide; that is, that part of the costs incurred in relation to air navigation services in Adelaide is incorporated in the total costs for those routes. I think Senator Thomas will acknowledge that, notwithstanding the fact that aircraft flying direct between Perth and Melbourne and Perth and Sydney do not land in Adelaide, they have contact with navigational aids in Adelaide. Consequently, charges for that service should be part of the costs incurred in running those flights. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines addressed her remarks most particularly to the general aviation sector. One or two points need to be made in respect of that area. She argued that general aviation, because of its unique operation in outback areas and the services it provides in farming areas and certain developing areas of Australia, ought to be given special consideration in respect of air navigation charges. I think it is fair to say that that has been taken into account by the Government in assessing its approach and, indeed, the figures stand up to examination. Total air navigation costs within Australia amount to $262.2m and the general aviation sector's estimated share of those costs is $102.6m. I understand that has been calculated on the basis of a formula which has been agreed upon by the industry and the Government. On that calculation, general aviation's total share of air navigation costs is about 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge that recovery of air navigation charges in the general aviation sector in 1980 was only of the order of 16.4 per cent. Accordingly, there has been a very substantial under-recovery in the general aviation sector's share of costs compared with the charges made to the industry generally. That is a very fair point to make in relation to Senator Haines's remarks. Furthermore, no increases have been made in the charges incurred during 1980. The last increase in respect of general aviation occurred in 1979. Since that time there has been an increase in the consumer price index of approximately 20 per cent. I repeat that those costs are allocated according to use of facilities and they are based on principles with which the industry, including the general aviation sector, has in general terms agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collard showed his usual grasp of problems and of the difficulties within the air travel industry. He brought to our attention some significant problems with which he is closely associated. His remarks were very valuable and the Government notes the points he made, particularly those in relation to noise at Brisbane Airport. We acknowledge that a great deal of scaremongering about that problem is carried on in various places. The Government thanks the Senate for its support of the legislation and wishes the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are debating the first reading stage of this legislation I take the opportunity to reply to some of the comments made by Senator Messner in answer to an interjection made by me in the course of his reply to a question asked by Senator Foreman. Senator Messner is reported on page 499 of Senate Hansard of 8 September as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that Senator Foreman would recognise that the roots of the housing problem in South Australia do not stem from the imposition of any sales tax on building materials. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we know the present ills do not stem from those sales tax impositions as yet because, if the Government has its way, they will not be imposed until 1 January next year. Then we will really feel the adverse effects which will compound the problems which are being experienced in the building industry in South Australia at present. I interjected on Senator Messner and said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, they stem from the administration-or the maladministration-of the Tonkin Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Messner said:</PARA>
<PARA> They certainly stem from the Dunstan and Corcoran governments in South Australia for many years previous. Senator McLaren would have to acknowledge that, as I know he is already fully aware of this problem. We all know that the major difficulties in housing in South Australia occurred in the period 1977-78 due to the very poor planning policies of the Dunstan Labor Government in South Australia at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>They were Senator Messner's words. Of course, he has learned a good lesson from Senator Carrick over the years in this place because every time this Government runs into problems Senator Carrick parrots the old saying: 'Oh well, it was the fault of the Whitlam Government'. The Tonkin Government has been in office in South Australia for two years and things are getting worse and worse in every avenue one looks at, as I will explain in the course of my remarks. It ill becomes Senator Messner to try to get Mr Tonkin off the hook by blaming a previous administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Sibraa says that if we were to go to an election in South Australia now the Liberal Party would be annihilated just as it was in New South Wales last Saturday. It is clearly evident that the general electors in the Commonwealth are fed up to the back teeth with the maladministration of Liberal governments. The South Australian Government will get its answer. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating because the people of South Australia are suffering. The people in New South Wales were not willing to overturn the Wran Government and opt for a government which could not manage the country's affairs. We have no better illustration of the way in which Australia as a whole is being mismanaged by the present Government than what is happening today in the other chamber where three Ministers are under severe attack from the Opposition for the way in which they have been carrying on and meddling in the affairs of the nation. They have clearly shown that they do not have the capabilities to run the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal particularly with the situation in South Australia. I remind Senator Messner that on 14 November 1979 during a speech I made on income tax legislation I warned the Senate and everybody else who cared to take any notice of the very things that are happening now under the Tonkin Liberal Government. It is again a case, as I often say in this chamber, of people being forewarned but not taking any notice. The Tonkin Government's chickens have come home to roost because it has made many promises which it has not been able to fulfil. I refer to a speech which is reported at page 2279 of Hansard of 14 November in which I quoted from an article which appeared in the local Adelaide Press. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia's business establishment will today close its anti-Labor election campaign after spending $100,000, according to figures from the Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The article, which was written for the Australian by its economist, Des Keegan, continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole campaign was prepared by Ogilvy and Mather, the multinational advertising group. </PARA>
<PARA> Its sponsors were the Chamber of Commerce and Industry SA Inc., the Master Builders Association of SA Inc., the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of SA Region, the Retail Traders Association of SA Inc., the South Australian Chamber of Commerce Inc., and the South Australian Employers Federation Inc. The organisations set out to spend $100,000, with the help of a multinational advertising company, to discredit, the Corcoran Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>What do we find? A large full page advertisement appeared in the Advertiser just the other day. It was paid for by anonymous people and points out all the good things that the Premier of South Australia has done. These people are so proud of Mr Tonkin that they were not prepared to put their names to the advertisement. However, these people were prepared to put their names to the advertisement which was designed to get rid of the Corcoran Labor Government. The South Australian Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that there is no substance in many of these things that are being claimed. The advertisement is headed 'A few timely reminders that the record is solidly impressive.' The advertisement then displays a photograph of Premier Tonkin, no doubt sitting up in the Cabinet room in the State administration building in Adelaide. The Premier must have allowed someone into his office to take this photograph of him. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Two great years of steady achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>But when we look at the bottom of the page to find out who organised the advertisement we find the words:</PARA>
<PARA> This message prepared and paid for by a large group of proud, confident South Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>How proud they are! They are like people who do not sign their names to letters they send to newspaper editors. That is how proud they are. Mr Tonkin must be very worried. I heard one comment on a news service in South Australia that he would take some action against these people because they used an unauthorised photograph. But I have seen nothing in the printed media that he is complaining about this. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now draw the attention of the Senate to some of the things claimed in the advertisement.The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA>February 1980</PARA>
<PARA> Government establishes the State Development Council to advise on potential investment in the State. </PARA>
<PARA>To set up that Council the State Government had to knock over the industry assistance organisation which had beeen operating for years with great benefit to industry in South Australia. The Government threw this organisation out the door because it was the brainchild of the Dunstan Government and established something else in its place. That is nothing to be proud of because this change is not achieving anything. The Nationwide program pointed out last night that people are leaving South Australia in their thousands because small businesses are going broke and there are no jobs for young people. As a result people are flooding out of the State. Of course, Mr Tonkin said that if he were elected he would establish the State development council to stop the exodus of South Australian citizens from South Australia. But he has done the reverse. He has increased that exodus and people are leaving in their droves. The advertisement also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>March 1980</PARA>
<PARA> Government re-organises London Agent-General's Office, placing greater emphasis on trade and investment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a complete failure because South Australia would be booming if there were a greater emphasis on trade and investment. But, of course, business people are leaving the State in their thousands. So the Agent-General's Office is costing South Australian taxpayers money but it is doing absolutely nothing for us. Further on, the advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA>May 1980</PARA>
<PARA> Roxby Downs $50m exploratory shaft and feasibility studies. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing yet has eventuated from those studies. Those promises are all pie in the sky. They are all promises that have not eventuated. They will not eventuate before Mr Tonkin is thrown onto the scrap heap, as Mr McDonald was last Saturday. The advertisement also states:</PARA>
<PARA>July 1980</PARA>
<PARA>This is another magnificent thing the Tonkin Government did-</PARA>
<PARA> Monarto land to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA>What is going to happen when the Monarto land is sold? Labor will want that land to settle people when it is returned to office in late 1982 or early 1983. We will have to buy it back at an enormous price because Mr Tonkin is going to give it away to his friends as he has done with a lot of the land in the Land Commission which was set up by the Dunstan Government with the support of the Whitlam Government. The advertisement also states:</PARA>
<PARA>October 1980</PARA>
<PARA> Agreement reached on granting of Land Rights to the Pitjantjatjara people. </PARA>
<PARA>Who introduced that legislation into the Parliament? It was none other than a Labor government under Mr Dunstan. Mr Tonkin has the temerity to claim that it is his legislation. All the legislation was prepared and ready to go through and all he did was put it through the Parliament. He cannot lay any legitimate claim to initiating that legislation. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Joint Federal/State investigation into development potential of the Iron Triangle Area. </PARA>
<PARA>What has been found? What is there to boast about in looking at the development potential? We all know what the potential is. Mr Tonkin's friends have not said in this advertisement that the Fraser Liberal Government closed down the most viable and the greatest employer of labour at Whyalla-the shipyards. The Government let it go to rack and ruin and now Mr Tonkin is boasting about what he is doing for industry and investment in the Iron Triangle. The advertisement also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Government takes court action to oppose Irrigation Licences on N.S.W. rivers in an attempt to preserve River Murray water quality. </PARA>
<PARA>What a lot of nonsense! I have not had time to read the article appearing in today's Advertiser or to digest its contents properly. That point is completely rebutted by the New South Wales Minister responsible for the inquiry New South Wales has had. We all know what happened to the last Liberal Premier in South Australia when he ran an election campaign on the issue of water. He was annihilated. That was Mr Hall. He negotiated the Dartmouth agreement. There is nothing in the agreement about water quality for South Australia. All it mentioned was quantity. Recently I asked Senator Carrick: On how many occasions has South Australia not received its water entitlement since the signing of the River Murray Waters Agreement? Senator Carrick answered that it has been on only one occasion-in the season of 1944-45. So we have almost always received our water entitlement even if the quality is not all that it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I took the opportunity of bringing from South Australia on behalf of the Mobilong Rotary Club two cartons of River Murray water. I sent them around Parliament House. I hope that every member of parliament got a sample. I have heard all sorts of remarks since about the use the water was put to. I hope that this initiative of the Mobilong Rotary Club will at last get this Government off its backside and make it do something about the quality of the River. In the short time we were in government we set up the River Murray working party to look at the quality of the River Murray water. What has the Government done about that since? It has brought legislation into this Parliament providing for the expenditure of $200,000 over five years on water resources. From the last figures I looked at-and the time has nearly expired-about $130,000 of that money has still not been expended. What is the Government doing? It is doing absolutely nothing. In order for the Government to spend that money the States have to come to the party on a dollar for dollar basis. If they are not prepared to put a dollar in they get nothing from the Federal Government. I am reliably informed that the Government that has taken most advantage of that legislation by doing something about water quality is the New South Wales Labor Government. It is far ahead of the government of any other State. I have to admit that it is far ahead of the Government of my State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not my intention to talk about the River Murray today because it is a subject on its own. The only reason I have referred to it is that Mr Tonkin is claiming as one of his great achievements that he has taken court action to oppose irrigation licences on New South Wales rivers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has anything the New South Wales Labor Government or any other government does got to do with South Australia? I add for Senator Thomas's information that he ought to have a look-I am sure he has-at the report of the River Murray working party and read the remarks of the previous Liberal Government in New South Wales. He will find the same recommendations and the same things being advocated as the Wran Labor Government has carried out. There has been no change. There has been only a change in government, but no change of policy. The point is that under the Commonwealth Constitution no State can interfere with another State's rights in relation to water. It is up to each State to look after its own water rights. I can well imagine what would happen if the river ran the other way, from South Australia. We in South Australia would be getting criticisms from the New South Wales or Victorian governments saying that we were not giving those States good quality water. They would be told: 'Mind your own business. You are getting your entitlement under the River Murray Waters Agreement and that is what you will get'. That is what we have always received in South Australia. Talking about quality, it took the initiative of the Whitlam and Dunstan Labor governments to set up the filtration plants in Adelaide. Under previous Liberal governments we had terrible water. At least a big percentage of the people now living in Adelaide and using reticulated water have good quality water through the initiative and the moneys provided by the Whitlam and Dunstan governments. The advertisement goes on to refer to November 1980. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government establishes the Italian Earthquake Relief Fund to assist victims of the devastation in Italy. The Government donated $45,000 to the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>Any government would do that in a time of disaster. One has only to cast one's mind back to the cyclone in Darwin. What did the Labor Government do? We provided all the money that was required to rehabilitate Darwin. I hate to think what the situation would have been if we had had a penny-pinching Liberal government in office in Canberra. Half of Darwin would still be in ruins. Yet this man's nameless supporters are claiming that he has done wonders for the State because he has given away $45,000 of the taxpayers' money. Of course, any other government would have done that and would not have boasted about it in a full-page advertisement like this. The people who put in this advertisement were no doubt put up to it by Mr Tonkin, but he does not want to own them. The advertisement goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> State Government granted powers to appeal against lenient court sentences. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody objects to that. That is nothing wonderful. We amended legislation on legal matters all the time we were in government. People have to remember that during the reign of office of any Labor government in South Australia Labor never had the numbers in the Legislative Council. Much of our very good legislation which would have been of benefit to the South Australian citizens was rejected, amended or mutilated in some fashion by the Liberal dominated Council. The same applies to our legislation introduced in this place between 1972 and 1975. It was mutilated, rejected and let to lie in the Parliament for months on end. The present Government would not even debate the legislation. Yet we are accused of not doing these things in South Australia. The opinion polls now show a different picture from what this advertisement states. It refers to March 1981, after mentioning the same matter under the heading of October 1980, and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation ratifying the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Agreement approved by State Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Labor Party started that too. In the main it was its legislation. It introduced it. I could go on talking about these things but the matter I am concerned about is that a State Premier has to resort to a method such as this-using anonymous people to put advertisements in a newspaper. Why does he not have the courage to put his name to the advertisement? We know that the advertisement was put in that newspaper in answer to the advertisement put in a few days previously by the Australian Labor Party in that State. The Australian Labor Party had the courage to put its name to all the terrible things it said Mr Tonkin was doing. We were not afraid. We did not want to hide behind anonymity in our advertisement. We were quite prepared to stand up to take responsibility for the placing of the advertisement in the newspaper. I refer to the advertisement which brought forth this anonymous advertisement. That advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A birthday message for the Tonkin Government . . . two wasted years. </PARA>
<PARA>The anonymous advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Two Great Years of steady achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>We have hit the nail on the head in referring to two wasted years. The people of South Australia realise that. Our advertisement goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago the Liberals promised to 'get South Australia moving again'. The Liberals promised to create more jobs . . .</PARA>
<PARA> But now we have the worst unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I point that out on most Wednesdays in the Senate when I give a notice of motion. Unfortunately, we have the highest unemployment of any State. We have a greater exodus of citizens from our State than any other State. Our advertisement goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals promised to slash taxation . . .</PARA>
<PARA> But now we have massive increases in State charges, including electricity, water, sewerage, hospital bills plus bus, tram and train fares. </PARA>
<PARA>Why has Mr Tonkin had to do all those things? Because he made a rash promise at election time that he would abolish succession duties and gift tax. He now finds himself down the drain to the tune of about $30m because of the promises we admit that he honoured. But who did they benefit? Only the people in the wealthy, capitalistic section of South Australia. They are the people who benefited from those promises he has honoured. Who is paying the piper? The pensioners, the unemployed, every person who has to ride on a bus, every person who has to pay rent, every person who switches on an electric light and every person who uses water, whether to drink, to wash or to do laundry. They are the unfortunate people who are paying the piper for the promises made by a Liberal Government to satisfy the wishes of its wealthy friends. We then say in our advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals promised to get business on its feet . . .</PARA>
<PARA> But now we have record business bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer anyone who is interested to some of the statements put out by Mr Hurford, the honourable member for Adelaide, who is our spokesman on business affairs. He lists figures put out by the statisticians-not our people-demonstrating that South Australia has had a record number of bankruptcies in the last two years under the Liberal Tonkin Government. We further go on in the advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals promised to improve health and education . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But they've scrapped free hospital care, and school cutbacks threaten our greatest resource, our children. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Liberals have never had any consideration for the health of the nation or for those people who cannot afford to pay. We know how they have scrapped the Medibank scheme. After many promises by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that Medibank would not be interfered with, it no longer exists. We cannot take notice of any promise that a Liberal might make to try to win office. The proof of the pudding is in the eating; the promises are never carried out. So far as the schools are concerned, we know that the State Minister of Education in South Australia is in diabolical trouble. Even under the last South Australian Budget, another 300 teachers will be sacked. That, if nothing else, is a fair admission that young people are leaving the State. The Minister uses the argument, when we complain about the situation, that the children are not there to fill the schools. Why are they not there? It is because their mums and dads have had to leave the State and seek jobs elsewhere. That is all because of the maladministration of the Tonkin Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We know now that there is no free hospitalisation in South Australia. The present Minister of Health, Jennifer Adamson, has scrapped the agreement, which should have run until 1985, entered into by the Whitlam and Dunstan governments to safeguard the interests of people in South Australia who could not afford to pay costly hospital bills. That agreement has gone by the board, and everyone now is forced to join a private health insurance organisation because they cannot afford to pay the hospital fees. That is another broken promise. The advertisement then says:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor left office with a healthy Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> Now State finances are in a mess. Even Dr Tonkin has been forced to admit that South Australia is 'sick'. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are his own words. I have a cutting from the Australian newspaper of 9 September in which he states that, and we also have transcripts of radio interviews he did in which he admitted that the State is sick. Who caused the sickness? It was no one else but Dr Tonkin. Last Wednesday I gave notice of a motion stating that the only way we can cure this sickness is for Mr Tonkin to abdicate and call in a team of specialists to treat the patient, led by none other than the capable administrator, Mr John Bannon, the Leader of the Opposition. The sooner these specialists are cadled in the sooner the patient, South Australia, will get out of its sick bed and return to a better economy. This advertisement was printed before the Budget came down; the situation is even worse now. We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Today Dr Tonkin will deliver his black birthday Budget. Make sure there are no more unhappy returns. </PARA>
<PARA>I assure Senator Messner that, despite the fact that he joins with his leader in this place in trying to allocate blame for all the ills, whether ills brought about by the Federal Administration or by the Tonkin Administration, that will not get him off the hook in South Australia the next time we have an election. If Senator Messner has any clout at all or any pull with Mr Tonkin, in the interests of all who live in South Australia he ought to go to Mr Tonkin and say that he is aware of those facts and that Senator McLaren has really emphasised the point that the State is sick. I agree with Mr Tonkin. Let him go to the people and let the electors decide so that we in South Australia can get a dose of the proper medicine. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing to which I wish to refer concerns the high unemployment figures, and I want to direct some criticism at the daily Press on this matter. During the meeting of the Estimates committee, I think yesterday, we discussed the estimates for the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I asked the Bureau whether it could put out a Press release, authorised by it giving the facts about unemployment. I will refer only to South Australia because that is the State in which I am vitally interested. In publishing the unemployment figures for the month of August, on Friday, 11 September, the Canberra Times says that South Australia had an increase in unemployment of 1,200. However, if we look at the Liberal bible in South Australia to see how the Liberals interpret the ABS figures, under the by-line of Brett Bayly, we find the headline 'Fewer jobless than last year'. Bayly goes on to say that there were 100 fewer jobless, 100 fewer persons seeking employment in South Australia, in August of this year than there were last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I got quite upset about that and I rang the Australian Bureau of Statistics to ask for an explanation. The chap I spoke to said: 'Senator, unfortunately they are both right'. The ABS figures, which were printed in the Canberra Times, gave two monthly figures for those people seeking full time employment, with 1,200 more people seeking full time employment in South Australia during August than there were in July. There was a decrease of 100 when the two figures were lumped together, as Brett Bayly did. He did not explain that he had lumped the two together-I do not blame him; it was probably the editor of the paper who tinkered with his statement-and that those seeking part time employment were added to those seeking full time employment. Any sensible person knows that those registered for part time employment must have some other form of income. They might be on superannuation or on a pension, or they might be housewives whose husbands have jobs. They cannot really be classed as people who are legitimately unemployed; that is, breadwinners who are seeking jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I raise every year in the consideration of the estimates for the Bureau of Statistics is that, because of the way the Bureau compiles its figures, those figures are most misleading. They are the figures this Government chooses to use as the legitimate figures because it has done away with publishing the figures compiled by the Commonwealth Employment Service, that is, the actual number of people who are registered as unemployed. How does the ABS compile its figures? It compiles them by doing random sample tests. An interviewer will knock on a door and ask the person who comes to the door to answer a certain number of questions. If the person questioned admits that he or she was employed for one hour of any one week, that person is not classed as being unemployed. That is why we get a fictitious figure. The actual unemployment figures for Australia, particularly in my own State, are much higher than some of the published figures. Unfortunately, that is how these figures are arrived at by this Fraser Government, whose policies Mr Tonkin boasted he fully supported during the 1979 election campaign. I will bet that many times he has rued the day he admitted that in his policy speech. I do not have much time for the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), and my estimation of him drops every time I hear him give an interpretation of unemployment figures. I have never heard anyone manipulate figures to suit his own cause better than Mr Viner can. He is a past master at it, and that is about the only thing at which he is a past master. He cannot find jobs for young people. </PARA>

There will be a long wake, but not too many people on this side of the chamber will be worrying about that. No matter who is put in their places to do the jobs they have been trying to do, they could not do a worse job. No three who could be picked from the back bench of the Liberal Party could do a worse job than that done by the three Ministers who are under attack today. As I said when the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations report on Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd was tabled the other day, had the Whitlam Government been in power Mr Whitlam would not have dilly-dallied, trying to protect those Ministers. He would have acted immediately and they would have been axed. That is not the case with Mr Fraser. He is propped up by the National Country Party and he is dead scared, scared out of his wits, about bringing down the axe on the two National Country Party Ministers involved. He might have second thoughts about that after the New South Wales election results are known and Mr Punch overthrows the Liberal Party leader as the official Leader of the Opposition. Then, I am afraid, a lot of the fluff will hit the fan and there will be trouble for the Liberal Party, particularly in this sphere. The Party has trouble in the other States, and it will get worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning back to the full-page advertisement that appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser recently, Mr Bannon has posed the question: Who paid for that advertisement? We want to know who paid for it. We know who paid for the political advertisements which appeared prior to the election in 1975. Those people, although they were quite wrong in what they said, at least had the courage to admit who they were when they published those advertisements. But the people who published this advertisement, trying to prop up Mr Tonkin, do not have the courage of their convictions. People who write anonymous letters or insert anonymous advertisements in the papers should never be given any credence. We know that a lot of the advertisements that we saw previously were authorised by Mr Buick of Kangaroo Island. I am assured by a pretty reliable source from there that Mr Buick did not have the money to pay for these advertisements. Perhaps when we get back into government we may be able to have an inquiry to see who in fact paid for those advertisements. It certainly was not Mr Buick. We might be able to find out who paid for the big advertisement which appeared in today's paper and whether the State emblem has been misused by a group of anonymous people trying to prop up a sick Premier who is leading a sick State. They are not my words; they are the words that the Premier is quoted as saying in the newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA> In the speech that I made on 14 November 1979 I predicted quite a number of things that would happen under the Tonkin administration. I will not take up the time of the Senate this afternoon by reading them. In that speech I quoted a lot of statistics. They were not my figures. They were figures which had been compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I would recommend to Senator Messner that he have a look at them. After he has read that speech and analysed those statistics, perhaps next time he is asked a question in the Senate, or I interject, he might curb his tongue and not try to blame the Corcoran Government for the ills of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the second time that Senator Messner has been caught out. A couple of years ago, in reply to one of the reports that I put out on a regular basis, I received a letter from him complaining that the figures that I quoted were not correct. It took Senator Messner three months to write to me after he had received my report. I took just three minutes to reply to him. I gave him the source of my figures. Where did those figures come from? They came from the Liberal Government Budget which was put down in this chamber. I have not had another letter from Senator Messner saying that my figures were wrong. I do not know who did his research. I take it he did it himself, because he is a qualified accountant. When I received his reply I was somewhat startled to think that my research may have been off the beam. I had another look and I saw that we got all the figures out of the Budget Papers. I wrote and told Senator Messner that and he has never again said that any of my figures are crook. I am sure that when he reads this speech he will not be able to say that my quotations today are crook. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again I have brought to the attention of the Senate the problems that exist in South Australia. I have explained that it is high time that the present incumbent of the office of Premier in South Australia stood down and allowed the State to be run by the team of experts who ran it successfully for 10 years, and who will do so again. I hope that I do not have to speak about this matter again until my notices of motion come up for debate. We will deal with them individually. At that stage I will give details of all of the ills which exist in the State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise one other matter. I intended to raise this matter in the adjournment debate but now that this legislation has been introduced out of the blue I will take this opportunity of raising it. I refer to the railway system in South Australia. I have stood up many times and criticised the Australian National Railways. I still refer to it as the Australian National Railways, despite the fact that the Commissioners, in their wisdom, engaged a firm of consultants, at a cost of $409,000, who advised them to change the name, to drop the name 'railways'. Unless a photograph of a freight car or a locomotive is included in advertisements nobody knows what the words 'Australian National' mean. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very disturbed to read in the Advertiser of Tuesday, 15 September, an article by Stuart Innes headed 'More private rail systems predicted'. That prediction was made at a seminar by Mr D. P. Smith, chief engineer of Australian National Railways. If we do away with government-owned and run railways and hand them over to Australian enterprise, it will be a sad day for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I can well remember during the war years when I was in Western Australia in the Army. There was a private railway from Midlands to Walkaway. Running on it was what was known as the square wheeled train. There was never any guarantee that it would reach its destination. It was a dilapidated old train run by private enterprise. Senator Coleman, a Western Australian, would know of that train. I had to travel on that train on many occasions. I tell the Senate now that one could not get a wink of sleep on it. That is what will happen to our railways. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that I want to raise now is one which was brought to my attention today by the president of the Save the Victor Harbour Railway Committee, Mr Tillbrook. He rang me today. He is very concerned that Australian National Railways are about to dispose of 19 of the 25 steel carriages known as steel cars that are left in the State. They are used mainly on the Victor Harbour line to go to Barossa Valley when seminars and conventions are held. They attract a lot of revenue by way of tourist money. Australian National Railways, for some reason, have decided to dispose of 19 of these cars. There will be only six left in South Australia. One will be stationed at Mount Gambier, one at Port Pirie of Port August and four will be left in Adelaide. A promise was made some time ago to Mr Dean Harvey, president of the Railway Historical Society, that the Society would be allowed to buy six of these cars for about $2,500. The Railway Historical Society was going to restore them. Australian National could afford to pay $409,000 to consultants to recommend that the word 'railways' be dropped from the logo so I suggest that it can afford to give these six cars to the Railway Historical Society in South Australia so that some railway history can be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that respresentations on this matter have been made to the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt. He has acknowledged that he has a letter in regard to this matter on his desk asking that these cars be not sold and that the Historical Society be allowed to purchase six of them. The disturbing thing is that information has come through to the people in Victor Harbour that some private entrepreneur in Victoria made an initial offer of about $10,000 each to buy 19 of these cars in a job lot. When he was told that the sale might be negotiated he dropped his offer to $7,500 per car. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to jeopardise the chances of the Historical Society or the Save the Victor Harbour Railway Committee retaining these cars. I hope that Senator Messner, as a true South Australian, will make some representation to Mr Hunt's office this afternoon. He should ask Mr Hunt to give urgent consideration to the request on his desk to sell at least six of these cars to the Railway Historical Society. I have said that they ought to be donated. We in South Australia should be able to preserve something of our heritage. Most of our heritage is disappearing over the borders on two feet today because of the maladminisration of the State. I put that suggestion to Senator Messner. I know that he will not answer most of the points that I have raised today but I ask him in all sincerity, as one South Australian to another, to speak to Mr Hunt to see what can be done to help these people who are trying to preserve some little part of South Australia's heritage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my speech by reading one paragraph of the Budget Speech delivered in this place on 18 August 1981. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory apply to a narrower range of instruments and transactions than those in the States. Moreover, most of the rates applying in the Territory have not been altered since they were introduced in 1969 and are generally lower than those in the States. Accordingly, we have decided to bring the range and levels of Australian Capital Territory stamp duties more into line with those of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>In passing I would say that to some extent I would not regard that as a satisfactory basis for running any enterprise, but there are some other matters which flow from it if in fact that is the criterion for government in the Australian Capital Territory. The same principles should apply in other places. I look forward to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) bringing in the appropriate amendments to legislation which will enable this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1961, which in the entitlement states:</PARA>
<PARA> An Act to grant Financial Assistance to the States in relation to the provision of certain Home Care and other Welfare Services by States, Local Governing Bodies and Community Welfare Organizations</PARA>
<PARA>Under the definition of 'home care service' it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . means a service in the nature of housekeeping or other domestic assistance to persons in their homes;</PARA>
<PARA>Section 5 of the Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Part, the Minister may, at the request of a participating State, approve a scheme conducted, or to be conducted, by the State, a local governing body, a community welfare organization or a joint body for the provision of a home care service wholly or mainly for aged persons in respect of which that State proposes to incur expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>We have an emergency housekeeper service in the Australian Capital Territory which provides an excellent service to this community and which is funded from the community welfare grant to the extent of $246,000 a year. If we were to share, as we ought to be able to share, and as is outlined in the statement I quoted from the Budget, this Act should be amended to include not only States but also the Australian Capital Territory so it can participate in these grants for the purpose of at least financing some of its emergency housekeeper service. Section 8 of the States Grants (Home Care) Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of this Part, the Minister may, at the request of a participating State, approve a project for-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the provision of an approved welfare service-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) by a senior citizens' centre;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Australian Capital Territory is not included and thus senior citizens centres in the Australian Capital Territory cannot share as those in the States do. We are not asking for anything special for the Australian Capital Territory. Given that all things are to be equal under the Australian Capital Territory stamp duty legislation, we are merely asking that they be equal under the States Grants (Home Care) Act. But that is not all; it does not end there. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there was some publicity and certainly a great deal of joy in the community because the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), together with the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), had reinstated a group apprenticeship scheme. The Master Builders Association of the Australian Capital Territory will now be able to run an apprenticeship scheme which is very necessary in the Territory. An amount of $45,000 has been allocated to that scheme for the current year. Given the contribution to similar schemes in the States, that is a very worthwhile donation. It is a scheme, as I said, which already exists in the States. But at least Victoria and New South Wales provide a rebate on the payroll tax that the Master Builders Association would have to pay on the money that it pays by way of wages to the apprentices under the scheme. I ask the Treasurer: What about the Australian Capital Territory? Why can the Master Builders Association in the Australian Capital Territory not receive the same benefits so that the money for apprentices in this area can be used particularly for that purpose?</PARA>
<PARA> All this leads me to say that the reference to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for a study of the finances of the Australian Capital Territory is not only overdue; it is urgent. What contribution should the Commonwealth make to the municipal finances of the Australian Capital Territory? What areas of the Australian Capital Territory are truly national, what areas are of a State nature and what are local government areas? The Canberra Development Board was criticised recently by a member in another place. Mr Lusher said that the Commonwealth ought not to be spending money on promoting the Board. That is nonsense. The Federal Government in this area is spending money that would be spent by a State government in any other place but the Australian Capital Territory. Certainly in Mr Lusher's State of New South Wales considerable sums of money are spent by the State Government promoting the State and attracting business and industry to it. We merely ask that we have a fair share of money for the same purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> To a large extent the costs we are paying for in the Australian Capital Territory have been caused by the fact that the city has been planned for a population much larger than at present. That is not unreasonable, but it is a factor that needs to be taken into account when assessing the sorts of matters that the Grants Commission, I hope, will look at quite soon. </PARA>
<PARA> It was stated recently that the ACT is a tax haven. That assertion is not factually sustainable. It may have been in this one small area of stamp duty which has now been corrected. But in other respects it is not and, in fact, the position is quite the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is known that the Commonwealth does not pay rates, not only in the ACT but anywhere. But the impact of that fact here is much greater than in other places. I understand that ratable property in the ACT is approximately 25 per cent of the total. I gather the Fremantle City Council was particularly upset two or three years ago when it found that its ratable property amounted to only 51 per cent of its total land. In addition to the national capital being designed for a much larger population than now exists-which means that we are paying for some facilities not being fully utilised-the works and services which have been developed here are, to a great extent; developed to a much higher standard than might have been the case but for the fact that this is the national capital and a place that we would hope that all Australians would be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens to the 2 per cent of income tax for local government which is collected from the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory but not paid to any municipal authority in the Australian Capital Territory? Approximately $3m is paid by the Commonwealth towards its share of what constitutes the municipal accounts but no accounting is made for this 2 per cent of income tax which we do not receive. In addition, local government gets money in some instances from its State. It can sell land and it collects the rates from its area. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other areas in which the ACT is dealt with differently from the States. For some reason the price of petrol is higher in Canberra than in Queanbeyan, which is only a very short distance away. When air fares went up, I think in April this year, as a result of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, fares with respect to Canbrra went up by 38 per cent. It is not with any pride that I relate that there was laughter on both sides of the House at that event when the national increase was only 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the rates in Canberra are calculated in a manner different from that of the States in that the pricing of land for rating purposes in Canberra includes the cost of head works whereas in the States the cost of head works is included in the rate structure. In a sense, one might say that in the Australian Capital Territory the costs of the head works are paid for twice. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not asking for any special payments to be made to Canberra but, given the quotation that I started my remarks with today-that stamp duties should be more in line with those of the States-I ask the Government to see that other adjustments are made to legislation, to see that at least these few matters I have mentioned today are also brought 'into line' with those of the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a number of issues in this first reading debate on money Bills. Most of them relate to Aboriginal affairs. I raise these matters in response to a directive that has been issued in Western Australia by the Minister for Police and Traffic, and Minister for Community Welfare, a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) relating to a film about Aboriginal land rights in Australia and, of course, another item in a recent issue of the Sunday Times relating to research which it is now no longer possible to carry out because of a directive by the Western Australian Minister, Mr Hassell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer also to the situation that arises in respect of pastoral leaseholds in the north of Western Australia. Information which I have been given leads me to believe that a large number of white station holders are in fact ripping off the Australian taxpayer by Aboriginal communities which are living and working on their stations being paid only the unemployment benefit. I want to touch on the latest directive by the Western Australian Minister for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell, which was reported on in the Sunday Times on 2 August. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> One historian claims he now cannot research the infamous Flying Foam Massacre of 1868-</PARA>
<PARA>That, incidentally, occurred in the Kimberleys in Western Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>in which more than 60 Aboriginals including children were allegedly killed by white settlers. </PARA>
<PARA> A new security restriction affects records held by the Community Welfare Department, the Aboriginal Affairs planning Authority, and the former Native Welfare Department. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new policy, people seeking access to these records have to identify themselves, give their reason for seeking access, and provide the names of three referees. </PARA>
<PARA> Conditional approval is required for access to CWD records less than 30 years of age, but no clearance is necessary for files older than 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the conditions for seeking access apply in both cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The department says the security clampdown is necessary because some documents could cause embarrassment to living people or their families. The aim is to protect the privacy of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the researchers said that she failed to see how an event in the 1890s could embarrass the government of the day or living people. One of those who was anxious to see those closed files is an anthropologist and an artist who often paints Aboriginal figures. She spent three years researching Aboriginal traditions in the south-west and last year she found that the files of the Community Welfare Department had been closed. According to the newspaper article she said:</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to seek access for my on-going research program. Their letters gave no reason for the ban and my work was delayed for six months. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, I think you will agree that it is a tragedy when researchers find that information exists but is not made available to them. It means that their time and resources have been wasted. As this researcher has said, for up to three years she has been researching this matter and now finds that she can no longer have access to those files. I think it is rather sad that it is presumed that we will cause embarrassment to living people. I wonder how much embarrassment can be caused. A person is not his or her father's or mother's keeper. I do not believe that people would start pointing fingers and say: 'This is what your family did'. If they did, is a person to be held responsible for what his or her family did?</PARA>
<PARA> Recently a film was shown in Parliament House. The Parliamentary Library was able to obtain for me the film entitled On Sacred Ground. At the beginning of that film, the narrator who was obviously Aboriginal says that he comes from a very prominent Western Australia family. I do not think his family would have been embarrassed by having seen that film. I do not think other families would have been caused any embarrassment if they had read in someone's research paper that their forebears had been responsible for doing certain things. It does not mean that they are responsible. It simply means that their forebears were not as enlighted or as intelligent, or that perhaps they lived in a more violent period. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the withholding of information indicates the attitude of the Western Australian Government and its fear that people will be able to pinpoint the attitudes that are expressed by the Government in a number of insidious ways. As the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is coming up we find an awful lot of avenues for matters to be put under the carpet and hidden behind wardrobe doors. We are embarrassed because we do not necessarily treat in a proper manner the people of this country, the original Australians who happen to have skin of a colour different from our own. We are a little petrified that people all over the world may become aware of this if we speak out. </PARA>
<PARA> In one of those directives which came from the Minister for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell, he instructed his Director of the Department of Community Welfare, Mr Keith Maine, that all officers of the Community Welfare Department were to have no dealings whatsoever with the Kimberley Land Council, that it was not a recognised body. It seems to me a rather peculiar circumstance, given that we have recently had a World Council of Churches investigation into the treatment of Aborigines and given that the Western Australian Government refused to meet with the WCC and was very scathing in its remarks about the members of the World Council of Churches, that the Minister should pick this time to issue a further directive that could only antagnise an already dangerous situation as far as the Aboriginal people in Western Australia were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may not be aware of the fact that the Kimberley Land Council receives neither State nor Federal Government funding. It has never requested State Government funding and it has never requested Federal Government funding. It is funded by the World Council of Churches. It has made no secret of that fact. It is funded also by other human rights organisations. It has not made any secret of that fact either. The fact that it does not have either State or Federal funding does not mean that it is not representative of the people in the Kimberley. I do not know of one community in the Kimberley that is not associated with the Kimberley Land Council. Of course, I am referring to Aboriginal communities. The Kimberley Land Council has been extremely successful in a number of areas. I suppose that the definition of success depends entirely on the interpretation of the person who is using the word. I would say that the Council has been extremely successful in bringing to the attention of the people of Australia the abhorrent situation that arose in relation to Noonkanbah. It seems quite incredible for me to be standing in this place and speaking about Noonkanbah when one appreciates that although the situation occurred only a short time ago people appear to have forgotten what it was all about. I am curious about some of the things which Mr Hassell put in his directive and why he put them there. To me it is an invitation to have a fairly large and a fairly rapid turnover of members of the Community Welfare Department. For instance, Mr Hassell said:</PARA>
<PARA> If some officers cannot accept that it is their duty to carry out policy decisions of the government of the day, then they are free to tender their resignations and these will be accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is the responsibility of the officers of the Department of Community Welfare to deliver welfare services apolitically. </PARA>
<PARA>If a situation arose where an Aboriginal community in Western Australia determined that the Kimberley Land Council was truly representative of that community and asked it to approach the Community Welfare Department for assistance, it could be refused that assistance by the officers of the Department given the directive that has been issued by the Minister for Community Welfare. It appears to me that it is a rather arrogant reminder that most of those people who service the community through the Community Welfare Department should adopt an apolitical stance. I imagine that the nature of their tasks would be fairly widespread. In view of the isolation and remoteness of some parts of the Kimberleys it may not necessarily be opportune for them to obtain a directive from their immediate superior and it may be necessary for them to make decisions which could, under that directive, be seen to be political rather than apolitical. If one were to disagree or raise problems associated with a directive such as this it could be said to be political, but to agree silently to whatever the Minister demands could be seen to be apolitical. If the Minister's directive were carried out to the letter it could stop those officers of the Community Welfare Department from doing their job either apolitically or even properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that I wanted to speak about a situation that exists on some of the pastoral stations. I intend to raise it now but because time for debate this afternoon is limited I will in continuation at a later stage go into it in more depth. In this chamber on 10 September I said in the second reading debate on the Western Australian Aboriginals (Right to Electoral Enrolment) Bill introduced by my colleage Senator Peter Walsh that there had been an occasion when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) was in the Kimberley region in the north of Western Australia where I had seen things that either he determined he would not see or he deliberately did not make time to go to see. I raised one issue that related to people at Halls Creek who were from the Nicholson Downs station. I mentioned that at the time I went there some 35 to 40 people, including young children and a couple of babies, had one canvas fly for shelter and were having a 40-gallon drum of fresh water delivered to them by the shire each day. Whilst attempts had been made to provide them with other shelter this had not been forthcoming from the various departments. I questioned the fact that while the Minister had been in the area he had not gone to see them. </PARA>
<PARA> It now appears that those people have moved to Ringers Soak where, honourable senators might recall, members of the community from Gordon Downs were sent last year because the white pastoral owner decided it was time for them to move off his leasehold. I went to see the people from Nicholson Downs. I was very disturbed at what I was told. For many years they had been working as station hands-stock hands on the station. They had not been paid wages but they had all been in receipt of unemployment cheques. There was on the station a store managed by the leaseholder or the manager in place of the landholder and their cheques were actually kept and the amount of money for the goods that were purchased was deducted from them. It seemed a little strange to me that at no time was any money left over to be handed to the people. One of the complainants informed me that he had received a cheque from the Department of Social Security for something like $1,000 and that the station manager had suggested to him that he did not want him to be carrying around that amount of money and that he would keep it on his behalf. The complainant did purchase some goods from the store-he admits to that-but when he went back to get his money he was told there was no money left in his account. </PARA>
<PARA> They are very serious accusations and I suggest in view of those and other complaints that have been received, not only by me but also by other members of parliament over many years, that if station owners in the north of Western Australia, and similarly in the Northern Territory and Queensland, are in actual fact using Aboriginal labour as stock hands and station hands and not paying the people cash money then there is good cause for some form of investigation. I really do not care whether the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs accepts the responsibility. But I do make the point that it is essential, given these latest circumstances, that an investigation take place fairly soon. We have seen the investigations that have taken place in other sections of our community. We have seen the investigations involving a group of Greek people in Sydney not so very long ago when it was thought they were defrauding the Department of Social Security; and this is exactly the same circumstance. There is no difference between the allegations that are being made now and the allegations that were made then. If in actual fact fraud against the Government has been taking place then it is time that the Department exposed that fraud and advised, simply by announcing that there will be an investigation, those landholders that in actual fact the Government is not prepared to use taxpayers' money as a form of providing cheap labour for pastoralists in any part of Australia. Mr Acting Deputy President, given the time I now seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has advised me that the Tribunal has had no formal notification from 3RRR in Melbourne of the station's financial situation since 30 August 1980. As far as the station's 'performance as measured by its popularity and new subscriptions', the Tribunal is in no position to assess this as 3RRR in the McNair Anderson Audience Measurement Survey Data, is included in the category 'Other Stations', and is therefore not singularly identifiable.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Home Affairs and Environment has advised me that the Commonwealth Government's commitment to assist with the development of an international standard motor racing circuit is part of its International Standard Sports Facilities (ISSF) Program. The aim of the Program is to encourage the States and Territories to construct a range of sporting facilities to give our athletes the opportunity to train and compete on a similar basis to their overseas counterparts and enable Australia to be more successful in attracting international competitors. Over the next three years the Commonwealth will provide $25m on a $ for $ basis with the States and Territories for the construction of these facilities.</PARA>

<PARA> My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, follows somewhat a question asked earlier by Senator Jessop. Has the Government examined the possibility of establishing a list of essential services throughout this country, particularly those in the area of the Public Service, in which workers would not have the right to strike until all alternatives have been fully examined? If not, will the Government study that suggestion?</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> All States and the Northern Territory were invited to participate in the operation of the Program of Aids for Disabled People (PADP) on the same basis, namely, in addition to meeting the cost of aids, the Commonwealth would provide a 15 per cent loading on the cost of aids issued as a handling charge.</PARA>
<PARA> The 15 per cent loading was included in the allocation of $176,000 which, as announced on 8 June 1981, was Victoria's share of the $700,000 allocated to PADP in 1980-81. It is also included in the 1981-82 allocation of $600,000 to Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2795) Senator Townley asked me, as Minister for Social Security, the following question without notice concerning the overseas payment of pensions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Minister able to say how much the Australian Government pays overseas by way of pensions to people living overseas and how much is received into Australia on the reciprocal basis?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As pensions are taxable in Australia, will the Minister consider taxing any pensions that are sent overseas at least at the base tax rate so that, if people are working and living in another country, they are not better off than Australian pensioners?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Finally, is this whole matter of reciprocity of pensions being examined?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The expenditure overseas on pensions was $47.78m in 1980-81. This figure includes amounts paid under general portability provisions and under reciprocal agreements to Australian residents in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It represents payments made to pensioners who left Australia permanently as well as payments to persons who are residing overseas on a temporary basis. It should be noted however that no record is available in respect of people overseas whose pensions continue to be paid in Australia by, for example, credit to a bank account.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics relating to the value of overseas pensions brought to Australia by immigrants are not available. However, using information on income from overseas pensions supplied by pensioners, it is estimated that some 70,000 social security pensioners were also in receipt of overseas pensions at September 1980. The value of such overseas pensions was estimated to be in the order of $65 million in a full year. Of the pensioners receiving overseas pensions, some 58,000 had their overseas pension treated as income for pension purposes and some 12,000 benefiting under the reciprocal agreement on social security between Australia and Britain had their overseas pension directly deducted from the Australian pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Treasurer has advised that the present position is that pensions (other than exempt pensions) derived by non-residents from sources in Australia, are subject to tax in Australia, except where Australia has a comprehensive double taxation agreement with the country in which the non-resident resides which provides for the taxation of pensions in the country of residence of the recipient and exemption in the country of source.</PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia, like most if not all other countries, taxes non-residents only on income from sources in Australia, so that if the pension is the non-resident's only income from an Australian source, and the amount of the pension is below the level at which tax becomes payable in Australia ($4,195 for the 1981-82 income year), no Australian tax will be payable by the non-resident.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, overseas pensioners would generally be liable to tax on the Australian pension in their home country, and so the question of whether they are better off from a tax viewpoint than Australian pensioners will depend on the tax laws of the country in which they reside, as well as on any other income they derive.</PARA>
<PARA> It will be appreciated from the foregoing that existing double taxation agreements which give sole taxing rights to the country in which the pensioner resides would prevent the adoption of the Senator's suggestion in relation to the countries concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Adoption of the suggestion in relation to other countries would involve some significant changes in taxation of income flowing from Australia to non-residents. For example, it would mean taxing invalid pensions paid to persons under age pension age who reside overseas, while those paid to residents of Australia are exempt. It would also mean that a non-resident pensioner would be taxed on an Australian pension even though his or her total Australian income is below the tax threshold, whereas another non-resident deriving an equivalent amount of salary or wages, or rents, from sources in Australia, would not be subject to tax here.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding these comments, arrangements have been made to have the suggestion noted for consideration on the next occasion when this general issue is being considered.</PARA>
