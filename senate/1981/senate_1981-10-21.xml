<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taking the last part of the question first, the answer is no. The Government was to have allocated some $3m to soil conservation but in the in globo picture of a Budget it was decided that the money should be spent by the States on State conservation; so the States themselves will pursue it. The fact is that the protection and ownership of land is essentially within the States' sovereignty and the major soil conservation work has always been regarded as a State matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that a study was done some years ago. As to whether the details set out by Senator Button are as he says I am unable to recall from memory. It is true that the preservation of the topsoil of land against erosion is one of the major responsibilities that we have in respect of our heritage. It is abundantly true that the primary responsibility for the preservation of land, and one which should be enforced by the States, rests with the owner of the land. In fact what is necessary for good conservation lies in good farming practices and good animal husbandry. It is true that Crown land can contribute to degradation and that must, of course, be the responsibility of the Government that is responsible for that Crown land. I accept the significance of soil conservation. That has been accepted by the States over the years. Basic State programs for soil conservation do exist. Very good tax concessions are in existence, and they have been for years, as incentives to individual farmers to undertake soil conservation. I suggest that the responsibility of the individual should be emphasised.</PARA>

If what I say now is different from what the Budget does, I will inform Senator Button, but my understanding is that an absorption of the order of $3m was taken into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that I saw the actual report. But the demands in Australia for infrastructure for the very many national development enterprises that are foreshadowed will, of course, exceed the capacity of the nation as a whole to fulfil. The pressure upon borrowing programs, be they public borrowing programs or borrowing programs of enterprise, will be such that the competition for money, men and materials will not allow all the infrastructure to be done. Of course, if the competition were intense it would heat the economy and put up inflation and interest rates. The Commonwealth has an infrastructure program in relation to the States. The States themselves before Loan Council meetings put up their priorities and there are discussions at Loan Council upon the priorities of infrastructure. They mainly concern power stations. They concern such matters as power stations and pipelines. In order to keep the public borrowing down, in order to keep the Commonwealth and the States from competing and overheating industry, there is a need for commerce and industry to undertake a considerable amount of infrastructure. I would need to know in detail about the particular infrastructure to be able to comment at all but, in general, there will be competition. Those who read this morning the editorial in the Australian Financial Review will have noted that that journal commented that there was a very significant expansion of investment development and resources development in Australia and, therefore, a pressure upon resources. That will reflect upon the infrastructure demands.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to an article in today's Australian in which Qantas Airways Ltd pilots are reported as saying that they may refuse to fly into Wellington, New Zealand, until they receive assurances that bureaucrats in the cockpit will not interfere with the captain's authority during flights. The article explained how on a Brisbane to Wellington flight recently a Department of Transport senior examiner of airmen forced a Qantas captain to divert to Sydney because of a minor hydraulic pump fault. The captain protested that it was an allowable deficiency which would not have affected the safety of the flight. However, it was stated, the captain was threatened with loss of licence if he did not do what the bureaucrat told him. I ask: Is the Minister able to report to the Senate on whether that article is factual? If so, what disciplinary action was taken against that officer? How on earth can a bureaucrat who flies a simulator for a few hours a year as well as spending a few hours flying Jumbo aircraft, at great expense to the Australian taxpayer, be allowed to tell the captain of an aircraft who flies hundreds of hours a year how he will control the aircraft? Finally, will the Minister ask the Minister for Transport to take a fresh look at the matter of how much money should be spent on training examiners of airmen because surely this example points to the fact that the examiners should spend less time spending taxpayers' money flying and more time studying handling procedures before they again interfere with a flight, at great cost to Qantas, and perhaps cause a partial strike, again at great cost to that carrier?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Sibraa would reflect, the fact is that, if one wants to put in position synthetic crude projects so that Australia is ready when oil production falls off in the world and is not available, one needs to inject the stimuli that would make the synthetic crude cost effective with oil. My comment then was very clear. It was that the Rundle partners had said that the primary reason that they had set about the oil shale project was that our import parity pricing, as projected, would make it cost effective with synthetic crudes. That was a correct statement then; it remained a correct statement; and it was the reflection of the partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Happily, in the period that has followed, the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been persuaded to stabilise reasonably the price of oil in the world so that, contrary to the predictions of the Australian Labor Party and Mr Keating in particular, the price of oil in real terms fell in the last year. As a result of that, two things are happening. There are those who feel that, for the time being, some kind of alteration should be made of lead time in the production of synthetic crudes. That is a matter of judgment on their part. There are those who say that, since the extrapolation of the price of OPEC is not as steep as before, the cost effectiveness may not at this time be real. Lest anyone should misunderstand this, let me make it perfectly clear. The world is using oil at twice the rate it is finding it. There is an inevitability that the world will run short of oil in the decades ahead. Equally, despite the knockers and Jeremiahs, there will be an essential need to put in place the synthetic crudes, be they from shale or coal or at least in the early stages to put in place the technology and pilot plants so that, when we need to replace the oil, we can do so.</PARA>
<PARA> Happily, if we go on finding more oil in Australia and if we can keep the level of 67 per cent or 70 per cent self-sufficiency extended for some years-well, we may do that now for some years ahead-we push the need for synthetic crudes further into the next decade. That ought to be good news and not news for the knockers. The answer therefore is that what was said in August was true. The world pricing of oil is the stimulus for synthetics. Quite apart from my saying so, the International Energy Agency, with the voice of 21 nations, has said that the imperative need for an energy policy to do all the things that are necessary, including encouraging synthetic crudes, is to cost oil at its world price. That is precisely what I said in August last year.</PARA>

I do have some information in respect of the matter he raised but I am unable to help him with some of the particulars. It is true that the Mineral Transporter did collide with another vessel at the anchorage off Port Kembla on 10 July this year. Apparently, marine surveyors of the Department of Transport did examine the vessel for structural damage and its general condition at that stage. Since then it has been delayed in Sydney due to industrial action to force the ship owner to carry out repairs in Australia. However, agreement has now been reached for major repairs to be made overseas. Temporary repairs are being carried out in Sydney to enable the vessel to sail. The routine inspection of the Mineral Transporter discovered some 70 defects, mainly in lifesaving and fire appliances. Many were due to rust and other kinds of deterioration. Those defects will be required to be fixed before the vessel leaves Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Commonwealth Government wrote to the Premiers of all States in September last year seeking their co-operation in consultations between governments and industry groups 'on the question of mining and petroleum exploration on land involving Aboriginal interests'. To that extent there has been some Commonwealth action. Since then there have been discussions with mining and petroleum industry organisations on what might be achieved. I have also sought the views of the National Aboriginal Conference for any opinions it might have on the same matter. Officers of the Government are considering whether it is possible to prepare a document for discussion with all interests involved.

I thought that was a very helpful statement. I am sure that officers will be paying a great deal of attention to the document issued by APEA and to any similar document on policy issued by the Australian Mining Industry Council in its deliberations. Having said all that, I am trying to make the point that the kind of co-operative help which might have been very effective at the time of Noonkanbah is what we are seeking to bring about.

Many questions have been asked in the Senate on this subject and I have given a number of answers to them over a period. I have made it clear over and over again that the Commonwealth was most desirous of obtaining a reference of power in this area, that four States-Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia-were considering making that offer and that the only States that had stood out were Queensland and Western Australia. I have been negotiating, to the extent that the Commonwealth has any say in the matter at all, with those States to obtain this reference. But the reference of power has to be made in the terms of an agreement which the States want to enter into with the Commonwealth. There has not yet been a final determination of that agreement. I do not want to go into details of disputes or differences between States. There have been differences between Victoria and New South Wales as to the terms of the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer her to the debate on the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) in the Senate last night, at which time I raised the issue of a letter from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Perth to a Mr Pidcock stating that magazines and newspapers purchased by subscription were to be subjected to sales tax which would be payable at the post office each time a magazine was received.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I recall Senator Coleman's raising this matter in the debate last night. I did undertake to get some information for her urgently. I am able to advise that the Commissioner of Taxation is taking urgent action to correct the advice that was given to Mr Pidcock in the letter dated 9 October to which Senator Coleman referred last night. I also gave the honourable senator last night advice that I received from the officers who were present in the chamber. I will now repeat that advice, which will clarify the matter that the honourable senator has raised. She quoted advice, received by a taxpayer from the Australian Taxation Office in Perth, which stated that sales tax would be payable at the Post Office each time one received a magazine. There are a number of points which I must clarify for the honourable senator and anyone else who is interested in the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The advice that was given by the Australian Taxation Office in Perth, concerning the application, from 1 January 1982, of the proposed sales tax on magazines, books and so on is unfortunately not correct as far as individual magazines imported by Australian subscribers are concerned. Goods, including magazines and books, sent from overseas to Australians will, basically, be subject under the proposed measures to a tax of 2.5 per cent, but may qualify for an overriding exemption from sales tax that is contained in item 145 of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. That exemption is a long-standing one and applies to imported goods entering Australia which are classified for customs purposes as being of insubstantial value. 'Insubstantial value', for customs purposes, means that the value for duty of the goods does not exceed $250 or, alternatively, that the tax and duty payable do not exceed $5. Accordingly, in the ordinary case of a person who makes an individual subscription to an overseas magazine that is received through the mail from the overseas publisher, no sales tax will be payable. As I said last night, the information given to Senator Coleman's constituent is not correct and the Commissioner will be taking urgent action to correct it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple answer is that the earlier estimate was for a full financial year. The Budget statement is for that part of the financial year, the second half, that can be accommodated in the Budget. A great deal of controversy has arisen in regard to the number of students involved. A great deal of the discussion in this place has indicated that there would be a wide impact upon students. Recently I received from the President of the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations an estimate that, of approximately 21,500 students who might be expected to enrol for second qualifications next year, some 17,631 would be exempt from paying fees. In other words, as I said some months ago in this place, a very large number would be exempt. On those figures supplied by FAUSA some 3,800, out of 21,500, would be obliged to pay fees. FAUSA even states that that figure may include an over-estimate of 10 per cent to 20 per cent. FAUSA has provided its analysis of the figure and I have asked the Department of Education to comment on it. I make the point, as I have previously, that a significant number of students will not be affected by the fee requirement. The strict answer to Senator Martin is that the first amount, $8m, was in respect of a full year and that the second, $4m, was in respect of the half year dealt with in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to a recent statement that increased tax concessions for manufacturing industries may be introduced to compensate for tariff cuts. Is this statement notice to the manufacturing sector that further tariff reductions are imminent? Is it still the Government's resolve to maintain a viable manufacturing sector in Australia? Is this statement the most appropriate means of achieving viability? Does the Minister believe that the leaders of manufacturing companies are satisfied by this statement? Can the Minister explain how continuing loss of market share or loss of market itself can be offset by tax concessions?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, let me say that it is the Government's objective to maintain and, indeed, to expand a viable manufacturing industry in Australia. There has been a growth of resource development industries. Those industries plus the service industries will demand more manufacturing industries operating at a higher level of technology to service them. Equally, the best possible stimulus for manufacturing in Australia is so to dispose our inflation-our general costs-by contrast with our trading partners, particularly our Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development partners, that we have a trading advantage. I remind Senator Watson that some seven years ago we had been virtually traded out of world trade because of soaring interest rates. The best incentive that can be given to manufacturing is the pressure down on inflation and interest rates in Australia, and that is the thrust of the Budget itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to any tariff reductions, the honourable senator is aware that there is a tariff review. The Government has made no decisions at all. The Government has indicated quite clearly that any tariff reductions that might occur in Australia would be in a very gradual condition. Australia has brought about tariff reduction over the years and has nothing to be ashamed of by comparison with many of our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the tax incentives, I am not aware of where the Government would rate them in terms of their application by contrast, or in comparison, or in parallel with tariff reductions. I suggest to the honourable senator that first of all we direct all our attention to an economy whose cost efficiency by way of inflation is such that it allows us to trade viably. It is one of the exciting things in this country that quite a number of our industries are now so cost competitive that they are going off-shore and they are competing favourably in those countries. That is a very healthy sign indeed. As to the remainder of the question, I suggest we bide our time until we come forward with the review of tariffs and whatever incentives should go with them. But I stress that it is our aim that we should have in Australia a viable and growing manufacturing industry.</PARA>

Is this not a rather simplistic and short-sighted approach for the Treasurer to be taking, especially in view of the likely impact of such a change of policy on the manufacturing industry work force? Is the Minister aware that if motor vehicle industry quotas are abolished and tariffs reduced, Australia would be flooded with Japanese imports and the Australian car manufacturing industry could be wiped out? Is the Minister also aware of a study by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research which shows that if tariff levels were reduced by 7 1/2 per cent and import quotas doubled to 20 per cent, over 51,000 jobs throughout the economy would be lost in just the first three years of such a policy change? I should point out that this study also indicates that lowering of taraffs would have only a minimal effect on the inflation rate and that any possible benefits would be swamped by the downturn in manufacturing industry. Can the Minister indicate when the Government is likely to reach a decision on future protection levels for the motor vehicle industry, or is the Government unable to do so because of conflict within the coalition parties over this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>

I have not seen the remarks that were attributed to the Treasurer in some report and which apparently was referred to in an earlier question. The honourable senator's description of them as simplistic and short-sighted leads me to think that they were either misreported or misunderstood by the honourable senator. The Government has a record of a very careful approach to tariff matters. The Government indicated in its response to the Crawford report-the report of the Study Group on Structural Adjustment-the general approach which it would adopt.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will ensure that the reports and so on referred to by the honourable senator in his question are drawn to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I can assure him that the area about which he is concerned-namely, the motor industry-will be given the most careful attention by the Government. I am not in a position to predict when decisions will be made. I will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is able to give some indication.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer that question one must first of all keep in mind that two years ago the generally accepted thesis regarding our oil reserves, based on Bass Strait as our main supplier, plus Barrow Island and Moonie, was that, whereas we were 67 per cent self-sufficient then, we would drop to 50 per cent self-sufficiency by 1985, to 40 per cent by 1990 and to 10 per cent or 20 per cent by the turn of the century. That would have been a very gloomy situation. That estimate was supported by the Bureau of Mineral Resources and other objective observers. The impact of our import parity pricing policy, particularly for new oil, has been such that what were sub-economic pools before have been developed and brought into being and there has been an upgrading of our reserves, so much so that the last forecast put out by my Department some months ago showed a more healthy response. Indeed, it showed that the production of synthetics would be slid down further in lead time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been an upgrading. I do not want to be too optimistic because the fact is that, whatever supplies we have, we will run out of oil in decades ahead, whether it be two, three, four or five decades. The fact is that nobody believes that we will strike a bonanza in Australia. The BMR and others believe that we will find a number of small and modest deposits that will help us. Our aim is to find as many as we can as quickly as we can. Exploration has speeded up very rapidly in that regard. There is great interest in the Cooper Basin at this moment. Although there are encouraging signs at the Strzlecki well and other wells, at the moment there is not a proven oil field. The fact that the Cooper Basin pipeline to Whyalla will be bringing down something like 35,000 barrels of liquid a day by January 1983 does add to our forecast. The answer is yes. We have upgraded the situation. We hope to be even more optimistic for the future. But, against that, there should be no complacency in Australia because inevitably we will need substitutes for indigenous oil in the decades ahead.</PARA>

In fact, there is a very healthy level of investment in this country at the moment, and that healthy level, on the last figures I saw, is continuing. It is, of course, a matter of concern to the Government when projects do not go ahead.

In general terms, the examiner's part in the surveillance of revenue passenger flights is not any kind of command role.</PARA></TALK.START>

I also inform the Senate that AUSTPAC uses an entirely new technology for data transmission, which is different from the old DATEL system. In this new system the cost of the transmission component is much lower than that for STD traffic. This explains why there is a different charging rate for AUSTPAC compared with STD.

What I am complaining about is that having stated that the Australian Democrats spokesman on social security, Senator Haines, made a particular statement the article went on to refer to me in every other case by using the male personal pronoun. I take strong exception to this, not because I have any disregard for men. In fact, some of my best friends are men. However, I would like to make the point that I feel that some correction needs to be made to the impression engendered-pardon the pun-I presume in readers of the Sydney Morning Herald that I am male, furthermore, that I may be thinking of becoming a male or that overnight I did become male.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is raised today because of the uncertainty and the anxiety which currently exists for those involved in children's services in this country. This anxiety and uncertainty arises out of speculation from statements by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), from statements by various Government members and from the leaking of the so-called Spender report on this matter. It is appropriate, I believe, in Child Care Week that we discuss this subject and hopefully, we can have a clarifying statement from the Minister concerned, Senator Chaney. If we achieve nothing more than that and create some sort of certainty in the minds of the people involved in children's services as to their future, I think we will have justified raising this matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Parliament's involvement in children's services arises largely out of the Child Care Act of 1972 which was introduced by Sir Phillip Lynch, the then Minister for Labour and National Service and now, ironically, the leader of the razor gang, the very group which is determined to cut Commonwealth involvement in areas such as this. The aims of that Act were to provide good quality child care to a wide cross-section of children in the community. I believe there is now a concern that this aim has been neglected by the present Government. Since 1975 the total amount spent on the program has diminished in real terms. Had the $75m which was allocated by the Government in that year been indexed to retain its value it would have been now in excess of $110m rather than the approximately $80m which it is. I do not argue for such an increase but the figures demonstrate the restrictions of the program since those days in 1975 and reflect the strains on those operating under the present funding system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us have had representations from family day care groups and child care groups which have had to cut staff, restrict entries and restrict the quality of their care. The Act was designed to provide Federal money to develop a program of children's services and to increase the quality and quantity of child care for children under school age. This dual stress on quality and quantity was repeated throughout the second reading speech of Sir Phillip Lynch in 1971. The quality was to be guaranteed by funding existing and future services with qualified staff who could provide children with appropriate development and social activities rather than just minding them. Quantity was to be provided through capital and recurrent grants being made available to non-profit organisations which were prepared to run such services. </PARA>
<PARA> One can quote some of the words of Sir Phillip Lynch as to why the Commonwealth felt that it should have become involved at the time and why the Act was introduced in the way it was. I quote from page 2289 of Hansard of 10 October of that time. Sir Phillip, referring to the surveys that had been done, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they reveal that child care facilities had not kept pace with the rapid growth in the female labour force during the 1960s-</PARA>
<PARA>I think one could reflect on whether they have in the 1970s-</PARA>
<PARA>And that, as a consequence, existing child care facilities were inadequate, qualitatively and quantitively, for the growing numbers of children needing them. Not only were there too few centres but in many cases the provision was only for child minding and not for the quality of child care appropriate to the educational, emotional and developmental needs of the young children involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the scheme is to meet this existing problem-to help the children of working and other parents insofar as they are deprived of proper child care either because good quality facilities are not available or because the cost is presently too high. The scheme is not intended either to encourage or discourage mothers from entering paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA>From some of the statements one hears these days one wonders whether the changes are not designed to try to force women out of paid employment. A third and quite separate tier of funding was to be provided to ensure that children who could not afford the ordinary level of fees could have their fees subsidised. This was designed to reduce fees below the rate which was then the market rate for care. That 1972 market rate was established in centres which had little or no trained staff and barely met the minimum standards of State authorities. As the then Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . child care which was beneficial to the child's overall development was prohibitively costly for the large body of parents, and secondly, that the childminding arrangements that most parents could afford fell far short of the quality that was required in the interests of child welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the assumption at the time was that the 1972 Act would provide nearly all children with the subsidy needed to ensure that their parents could afford the necessary quality of care and that, in addition, subsidies would allow access to those children who needed additional help on the basis of economic need. This is a total contradiction of the concept in the present Minister's proposal that parents should pay the real cost of care and that only the very needy-presumably a very limited group in view of this Government's definition of 'needy'-should be eligible for any form of subsidy. Why the current Minister and the current Government should assume that in 1981 parents can afford the full cost of quality care when his predecessor recognised in 1972 that they could not I really cannot imagine, particularly in these difficult economic times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's commitment to quality care in the time since that Act was introduced has actually raised the overall costs of care with greater professional costs for trained staff and higher salaries for untrained staff. These, together with the requirements of the Child Care Act, would put unsubsidised quality care out of the reach of almost all people. Only the very wealthy could afford it. The benefit of having subsidised care of the type we have had has been that the 60,000 or more children in community-based services have received the quality of care that they deserve and that, in most cases, they could afford. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the worst aspects of the proposed changes in the program that have been floated or put around in recent days is, I believe and most people involved in the area believe, that they could do nothing to alleviate the real problems in child care. The proposals, as we have seen and heard of them from various Government spokesmen, tinker with the payment system, trying to redistribute subsidies amongst existing services and children. They ignore the very real problem, that there is still insufficient provision of child care spaces in the community. The Minister himself has just sent letters of rejection to more than 500 applicants for new services under the program. Although all of them were not necessarily for child care, the Minister has admitted that $5m worth of high priority services ready for funding were amongst those that were rejected. Recommendation of the funding of these centres was made by Mr Spender and his committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing services in the public and private sector generally are not meeting the needs in new areas and low income areas, particularly in regard to children under the age of three years. Although many services have been established through the Office of Child Care in areas of high need over the last five years, they are still inadequate to meet the needs of these areas. We all know about them. We have heard of the service in Penrith, New South Wales, which has 50 places and some 200 or 300 children on the waiting list. In Marrickville, New South Wales, 125 are on the waiting list, 70 of whom are two-year-olds. The need is no respecter of area or class. A centre in Lane Cove in Sydney has 120 children on the waiting list and another in Ryde has 80 children on the waiting list. We know that family day care schemes in Canberra and Sydney have had to close their books because they could not cope with the demand and others have had to cut down on the qualified staff and the co-ordinating staff they have, so affecting the efficiency of their organisations. Some schemes are handling the equivalent of over 150 full time children, although the schemes are designed for 100 children. In every State-including my own, Tasmania-there is a desperate need for care in low income housing areas and in some of the newly-developed areas. All of us know of and have received correspondence about people who have worked to get schemes off the ground but who cannot do so, and about other schemes which have had to close. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem that the Government ought to be facing is the provision of services for those whose access is limited by the unavailability of services, rather than maintaining that the problem is largely one of fees charged. The lack of services affects both the comfortably off and the desperately poor. The level of care provided for the women with children under school age who are in paid work is inadequate. All of us know that if we add to them the women who are studying, the women who are sick, the men who take the responsibility for the care of children and the women who need time to themselves there is an unmet demand for care in this area. The bulk of children using some form of centre-based care or care supervised through, say, the family day care scheme use these schemes for less than 20 hours a week. Only half of those using care outside the family for more than 30 hours a week are in some form of formal, supervised care. Many are still cared for through informal arrangements and often by a mixture of care systems unless they can get access to some stable form of care. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received reports and correspondence from people pointing out the real difficulties. I have heard from a woman who is involved in the child care area, who knows how the system operates, who is professionally qualified and who is sufficiently well off to pay for child care. She has pointed out the problems which have arisen in New South Wales where, for example, there were only 403 children under two years of age in centres in the whole of the State in 1980. She is exactly the sort of woman who should be able to use the system, who should be able to cope with the problems. However, with a child who is now nearly two and a half years old, she went through six changes of care within a period of just over 12 months. Finally she managed to find a place in a centre. Her problems and the problems of her child must be being repeated in thousands of other cases, often with less happy endings. The issue for her, her husband and her child was not cost as she could afford to pay; it was the lack of stable care arrangements and the lack of opportunity to get into such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the response of the Government, from what we have heard, is either indifference or a lack of realisation of what is going on. One can interpret Cabinet's refusal to allocate the $5m proposed by the Spender report only as a reflection of this. These were high priority, needed programs and one can report such a response only as indifference. However, this indifference does not extend just to the Cabinet and the matter of expending a small amount of money, such as that $5m. When one looks at the remarks and the actions of the Minister in the last few weeks one can understand how the level of anxiety and concern in the users and providers of child care has risen. </PARA>
<PARA> His statement on Budget spending started this process. He forestalled an expected rush on the Office of Child Care by anxious applicants by pointing out that this year's funding would allow for little or no new project spending; the money was already spent. However, at the end he stated that he was looking at the imposition of a common means test aimed at making parents pay the full cost of care. This was surrounded by the usual rhetoric about making sure taxpayers' money went to those most in need. It sounded innocuous except for the business of the real cost. People became more sensitive to the Minister's statements and the Press releases which were going out. They sought advice on what was meant by the real cost. Then letters went out to the existing programs funded by the Office, reminding them of their obligations under the Child Care Act to give priority access to certain groups and to use funding to reduce the fees of the needy with other parents making a significant contribution towards the cost of care. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems bizarre that the Government that removed the economic needs category of subsidy in 1977, as part of the funding of child care centres, should remind the centres of their obligation to offer such subsidies themselves. It was in the original Child Care Act. It was quite clear that economic need was a basis for additional funds being made available to the centres. This ensured that subsidising these fees did not necessarily draw money away from the main program or from the special subsidies for migrants who might put additional demands on a centre's staffing. However, with the withdrawal of the Health Insurance Act in 1976, which removed the definition used in the Child Care Act of 'disadvantaged', this section of the Act was made inoperable. So we have the situation that the Government which claims to care for the needy does not specifically subsidise them in centre-based care and now asks centres to rearrange their funding so they can apply the fee subsidies on the basis of need. This the centres do, claiming for instance the lone parents subsidy for a wealthy lone parent and using the amount to subsidise the fees of, say, a handicapped mother. This has added to the confusion and difficulties of these people. Is all the Government funding designed for the needy or is the Government partly funding the quality component of the services, as proposed by Sir Phillip Lynch?</PARA>
<PARA> To return to the actions of the current Minister and the confusion and difficulties they are causing, the letter sent to the administrators of schemes, reminding them of the present obligations and conditions, had a final paragraph or two which confirmed the anxieties raised in the earlier Press releases. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Child Care is currently reviewing the funding arrangements for centre based and family based day care, and examining the possibility of introducing standardised means tests . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Government has carefully considered all the options, and reached decisions, the Minister will make an announcement concerning the new policy approaches. </PARA>
<PARA>These suggested major policy changes had serious implications and caused concern to those who were providing the care. Then the final factor entered into the discussion. The Minister had earlier this year asked Mr Spender, a back bencher in the House of Representatives, to chair an internal review of the Children's Services Program. The other members of the committee were in fact public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> The report went to the Minister around June this year. Since then news of the review has leaked out to various groups in the community whose anxiety had already been raised by the questions asked. Then copies of the report began to appear all over the States in this country. The media obviously have it and many community groups have it. It seems that only members of parliament and some public servants are refused access to this report, even when they attend meetings with community groups which obviously have copies of it and obviously are quoting from copies. This situation, I suggest, is absurd. The Minister should table the report and, if he is unwilling to do so, I will certainly table the terms of reference and the recommendations of the report--</PARA>

<PARA> The report contains many recommendations which cause concern. One recommendation which causes concern is, of course, the matter of the standardised means test determined by the Department of Social Security. It relates to the introduction of a common means test administered by the Department which in fact would provide or some people paying the full fee and some people paying a reduced fee. This has caused considerable anxiety because of the possibility, if the means test is strict, as most means tests introduced by the Government are, of people on ordinary wages and in ordinary circumstances being in difficulties. We will end up with a situation of child care on a very low level for the poor, the rich being able to afford their own child care and in between others having to fight their own way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason and other reasons which will be brought forward by Senator Giles that we have raised this matter today. We seek some clarification from the Minister and the Government of just where they are going so that we can remove this anxiety from the people concerned in the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the bringing of this matter of public importance before the Senate during Child Care Week. I agree that the matter of children's services is of wide public interest and I think some discussion of it can help to clarify some doubts which exist in the community. In the same way I welcomed the questions which were asked with respect to this program in Senate Estimates Committee G. But that of course is a slightly less public forum than the chamber itself, particularly on a broadcast day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is perhaps an element or two of both the debate today and the public debate which has preceded it which I regret. At least part of the debate seems to have been designed to raise the level of concern rather than to clarify matters or to raise serious questions. Indeed at times I feel that one is in danger of being 'damned if you do and damned if you don't'. I get almost eloquent pleas from my opposite number, Senator Grimes, in favour of open government and putting the facts on the table. But there is very little incentive to do so when one does try to make the facts clear and then has the position represented in a way which casts it in a quite peculiar light. Let me refer very quickly to the statement which I issued at Budget time, very much in the interests of presenting a position which would be clear to the many people who are interested in this matter. That statement has already been referred to in debate by Senator Grimes. I made it quite clear what level of funding would be available, what the level of increase was and that there was little or no ability to fund new services, given that level of funding. I thought it was right that the large number of applicants with outstanding applications with the Department should have a very clear indication of the fact that they were unlikely to get funding in this financial year. I followed that up by actually notifying them of that individually. I was trying to make the position as clear as possible. I went on again to point out as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In line with the Government's overall welfare policy of directing assistance to those in greatest need, the Government will examine the development of a common means test for all day care services supported through the children's services program. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government will examine the development of a common means tests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the Press release I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Child Care will consult with Government supported day care service sponsors in the development of the means test. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought those words made it quite clear that no policy decision had been taken with respect to that matter and that there would be a process of consultation before the Government moved towards decison making in this area. I therefore regret that in the interests of open government and free and fair debate on these matters Senator Grimes issued a Press release on 22 September in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney's announcement of the introduction of a standardised means test incorporating the full cost of care for users of child care services, has caused deep concern . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that puts an emphasis which does not accurately reflect the statement I made in which I said that the Government would be considering this matter. Senator Grimes went on later in the Press release to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Such groups-</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the groups which are interested-</PARA>
<PARA> Must be consulted prior to announcements being made and provided with such guarantees of funding levels which will allow them to have confidence in the services they offer. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the Senate that the Press release I issued expressly drew attention to the fact that I proposed, through the Office of Child Care, to follow consultations. I also draw attention in my initial Press release, that is the Budget Press release, to these words:</PARA>
<PARA> The objective of a common means test would be to replace the existing range of means tests and fee scales and to assist parents who, because of low incomes, would otherwise be unable to meet all or part of child care costs. </PARA>
<PARA>I have tried to make it fairly clear that I have not made a decision in these matters. I am examining what I regard to be serious questions as to what is the proper level of contribution. I have, through the Department, tried to gather information which will enable the Government to make a sensible decision. I suggest that the statements which have been made both in the Press release that I have quoted and other statements which I have seen reported and of which I have seen copies rather gild the lily. I am very pleased to have the chance to make the position clear. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to see difficulties and uncertainties in an area which I regard as important. I will endeavour to illustrate, in the brief time which is available in these debates on matters of public importance, the basic approach of the Government. I will draw attention to the fact that I have outlined that basic approach in a number of public forums, both personally and in speeches approved by me and delivered by the head of the Office of Child Care on my behalf. Where there are areas that the Government is examining with a view to ascertaining whether there should be a policy change, I have made that public and known so that people may have a chance to contribute in the way that they are currently contributing. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there is a dilemma here. If one takes that relatively open approach the fact is that we will get a sense of uncertainty and concern on the part of some of the users. The alternative, of course, is to proceed secretly and make decisions and simply announce them so that nobody has a chance to be concerned. That is not the course which I have followed since I became Minister for Social Security. It is not a course which I would like to follow, and I trust that my opposite number in the Opposition will not in the end force me into a position which I regard as a less than desirable approach to the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that in this debate it has been acknowledged that it was the Liberal Government, under Mr McMahon, which introduced the Child Care Act. I adopt the words of Sir Phillip Lynch when he introduced the Child Care Bill in 1972. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the development of child day care facilities of good quality throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>That remains a view or an ambition to which I would subscribe. The fact of the matter is that since the introduction of that legislation there has been a very great increase in the amount of child care facilities available and many would say that there has been a very considerable increase in the quality of child care services available. I do not want to spend time putting a lot of statistics on the record but I point out that in 1970 there were estimated to be 560 child care centres operating throughout Australia with a total capacity of 14,000 places and in 1980 the child care survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that 90,500 children were using child care centres. That is a very considerable expansion. It is an expansion which has very largely occurred, as I will show in a moment, under Liberal governments. I would have thought that it provided some earnest of our intentions in this area. The fact that I have raised difficulties which I see in the existing program I make no apology for. I do not believe that they should be used to suggest that we are not concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Not long after the passage of the Child Care Bill of 1972, we had an election. I acknowledge that the incoming Government paid some attention to this area of activity and increased considerably the expenditure in regard to it. Unfortunately, I believe most people would say in retrospect that it did over concentrate on pre-schools. I note that Senator Grimes, in a recent speech, did acknowledge this when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We made some mistakes when we introduced the Children's Services Program. We allowed ourselves to become captives of various vocal groups who pushed their own barrows, in particular the people committed to the extension of single purpose services offering pre-school education rather than care. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that, in retrospect, it would now be a widely held view that the emphasis on pre-schools from 1972 to 1975 was mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in 1976, when the Fraser Government came to office, it took a rather different approach. It took the approach that it should change the emphasis to providing for child care rather than pre-school care. In statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that was made clear when the Office of Child Care was established under the present encumbent, Marie Coleman, who had served the previous Government on the Social Welfare Commission. In a statement on 20 May, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The important point is the priority the Government is giving to the provision of child care within the overall program. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Many children from needy families have not only been without the advantages of pre-school education but too often without the benefits of basic adequate care. It is essential to concentrate the Government's resources in areas of greatest need and the Government wishes to give greater emphasis to child care for children of needy families in the development of the Childrens Services Program. </PARA>
<PARA> In what I have said over the last few months I have not been saying anything very radical. I have been reaffirming the fundamental objectives established by the Government in 1976. When I ask my Department to send letters to child care organisations reminding them of the social and welfare objectives of the Government in this program, I make no apology for so doing. I am sorry if it causes people to be worried. It is proper that in the expenditure of a very large amount of the taxpayers' money we should as far as possible direct our attention to objectives which are defined by government. </PARA>
<PARA> I again draw the attention of honourable senators briefly to the fact that in 1976 and 1977 my predecessor, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, went to some pains to put on the public record the fact that we were concerned to establish social priorities. We said that we wanted people such as the children of single parents, the children of Aboriginals, the children of ethnic parents, who had a particular social need for child care, to have priority of access. That was defined years ago and I am doing no more at the moment than reaffirming those objectives and trying to ensure that they are pursued by those whom we fund. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to those people who are, in a direct economic sense, unable to afford the cost of services, we indicated in those early years of the Fraser Government-and I affirm it now-that we believe that, where one has to share available moneys, priority should be given to those who would not, without the assistance of their fellow taxpayers from whom the money comes, be able to have access to services. Again, I make no apology for that. I would have thought that the social priorities of the Government in this program would have been welcomed by the Opposition. Recently I opened a child care centre in a Labor electorate. The Labor member did point out to the audience with great fairness that the present Government had shown a proper concern for social priorities. A great number of these centres are in Labor electorates where, as he pointed out, the greater needs often arise. I am very pleased that we have avoided a situation in which money has gone where the votes are, rather than where the need is. If I have a prediction about this program and its risk in the future, it is that, like most areas of social welfare, there will be a great temptation for governments, of whatever colour, to put the money where the votes are rather than where the welfare needs are. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that any understanding of the Government's position could be complete without an examination of the figures of recent years. I am aware that many people in the field would like to see additional expenditure made. I am aware, as a member of the Government, that funds are not unlimited. But I suggest that, when honourable senators examine the funding for the Children's Services Program from 1973-74 to the present, it will become clear to them that the Government has placed great emphasis on the expansion of child care services as against the emphasis placed by the previous Government on pre-school services. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to seek leave of the Senate to incorporate a table in Hansard. I have shown it to Senator Grimes. It makes clear that, in 1974-75, $37m was spent by the Government on pre-schools and some $8m in round terms on other services. Some 81 per cent of funding was devoted to pre-schools and some 18 per cent to other services. In 1980-81, the figures are $31m for pre-schools and $42m, almost $43m, on other services. The shift in emphasis is revealed by the fact that 42 per cent was spent on pre-schools and 57 per cent on other services. It is interesting to see the change in the level of funding for other services-from just over $8m in 1974-75 to $42,850,000 in 1980-81. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I am concerned that in this area of the development of policy there should be a clear public understanding of the position. As I said earlier, I regret it if people in the field feel uncertain about the Government's intention. Therefore, I propose to refer very briefly to a couple of statements that I have made publicly-as it happens through the mouth of a public servant, at my request. The speeches had my personal approval before they were delivered. I refer first to a statement made in Victoria at the opening of the Curzon Street Child Care Centre when, after dealing with figures such as I have just mentioned, I pointed out that all of the increases in funding this year were in the non-pre-school area. I went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Increasingly, though, the Commonwealth has concentrated its assistance on meeting the child care needs of low income families, single parent families, disabled children, migrants, Aboriginals and children in isolated areas, and has developed a policy of priority of access for child care facilities which it funds. These services are asked to give priority to children in special need of care, for example to children whose mother is under stress because of ill-health, to children of single parent families and to other children where the need for child care is likely to be particularly high. Child care services funded by the Commonwealth are asked to monitor their enrolments constantly to ensure that these priority groups are the ones that they do indeed serve. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say, through the mouth of Marie Coleman:</PARA>
<PARA> Alongside this policy of priority of access, the Commonwealth also has a policy that its child care subsidies should be directed, as far as possible, to ensure that assistance with the cost of child care is directed to those parents in economic need. All Commonwealth funded child care services are expected to apply a sliding fee scale and to ensure that those parents who can afford to pay make a significant contribution to the full cost of providing the service. </PARA>
<PARA> While we believe that child care facilities should be readily available to meet the needs of Australian families, we also believe that those who can afford to pay for such services should do so while those on lower incomes should not be disadvantaged in relation to access to child care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not mind the Opposition stating that we should spend more in this and other fields. That is a legitimate approach. It is a complaint that a party which believes that higher levels of taxation or larger deficits are possible is entitled to take but I ask members of the Opposition to acknowledge the basic fairness of this Government's policy objectives. I would have thought that, if one had in this chamber an honest debate in which people really spoke their minds, there would be widespread support for the social priorities established there. Because of the suggestion that we are in some way trying to keep these things under cover, I propose to table that speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to what I had to say to the Australian Capital Territory Family Day Care Association, although again not in person. Family day care is an area in which expressions of concern have been made to me. I understand that concern given that subsidy rates have not changed for some years. But in that speech I indicated our commitment to the maintenance of a healthy family day care network in Australia. I have referred to the very substantial expansion of those programs under the present Government and to the fact that family day care represents overall a very cost-effective way of providing child care. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps most significantly, I went on to make it quite clear again that family day care should not be regarded as under attack. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Child Care within my Department is currently collecting up-to-date information on the present cost structures of family day care schemes, their pricing practices and the types of means tests they apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope to have the results of these investigations available to me by the end of this year. I will then ensure that there is consideration of the level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say-this is the last quote that I will use:</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the outcome of that review process, it is important to bear in mind that the Government's basic priorities in the child care area remain the same as they were when it first came to office nearly six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, because I do not have time to quote all of the speech, I table that document. The importance of proper care for Australian children is not something which ought to be the subject of debate in this chamber. Rather, I think we should be directing our attention to the best means of achieving that proper level of care. Because I am a member of the Government, unlike Senator Grimes I have to take some cognisance of the fact that there are limits on the amount of expenditure that can be made in any year. I assure the Senate that the Government proposes to ensure as best it can that it will direct the available resources to the priorities which I have outlined and that it will examine the funding position of child care in the light of the information which it is at present gathering with a view to ensuring that there can be a maintenance of the child care health situation in Australia to which people of modest means and people of high social need have access and that to the extent there are limits on government funds, which there must be, funds will be directed with these priorities in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a spirit of ecumenicalism we would like to offer our contribution to a debate which we believe certainly has a place in the Senate, namely the difficulties and uncertainty caused by the Government's policies in the area of children's services. In relation to the specific question of means tests of which standardisation in theory has a superficial appeal, we would like to point out that this could lead to flagrant inequities which can be avoided at present where each community centre sets its own income levels which reflect the realities of that community. As an example, if the current income levels in use for eligibility for disadvantaged status in health care were used, a couple with two dependent children and with a household income of $210 per week might be ineligible for the highest level of assistance in respect of child care whereas such a family in Mount Newman would be amongst the poorest in a community where the cost of living is astronomical. We have every confidence that the inquiries being conducted by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) at the moment will lead to decisions based on the best possible information available. We hope to see some built-in provision for special circumstances such as the ones I have just mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, we might also ask, apropos means testing as a principle, whether child care is welfare or whether it is a community service such as education. I also point out that children in private schools are all supported by the Federal Government regardless of parental means, regardless of whether the parents are able to pay. It has been recently suggested that the Minister is being urged to implement a new proposal as a result of pressure from commercial interests. In fact, $300,000 has been allocated to a pilot study which is being planned. We are unaware of any approaches from the clients of commercial centres or from parents who might be described as potential clients excluded from usage by prohibitive costs. On the contrary, our experience is that, given a choice, parents opt for the quality which is synonymous with community child care. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the commercial sector takes its role seriously and maintains high standards. Some child care centres are run as proprietors' hobbies. They have working proprietors who expect a return from their investment which is a little more than wages and a modest profit. Some authorities estimate that a charge of $100 per child per week would be required to maintain high standards and return a sizable profit. The position is analagous with that in many private nursing homes where the proprietor or lessee who is also the matron or administrator places his or her professional competence and integrity on the line and is not primarily interested in an impressive return on capital. This happy state of affairs where a high standard is maintained does occur. But in too many instances the provision of a government subsidy is simply an open invitation to those with capital to invest with no concern at all for the quality of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies with chains of nursing homes have rapidly established themselves within the industry and as formidable lobby groups. I might add that the home-grown variety is not necessarily preferable to the imported or transnational one. I do not intend my comments to be taken as a blanket condemnation of private nursing homes or of privately run child care centres. Some provide a high standard of care and invariably that standard is reflected in good industrial relations. There is, however, a regrettable tendency among the less scrupulous to circumvent regulations and standards in order to increase their profits despite the best efforts of overworked and understaffed inspectorates which simply cannot eliminate these practices. It is impossible, in addition, to enforce industrial awards while so many young women particularly are prepared to accept any job under almost any conditions. The hazards of essential services on the cheap were further demonstrated when funds were made available for homeless persons initially some years ago and private profit organisations, as distinct from charitable or community groups, sought to accommodate homeless males in one instance of which I know and made a submission for a rental of $1,000 per month which was in fact the mortgage repayment on a very valuable piece of real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Care of the very young or of any vulnerable group is much too important to be left, even in part, to the vagaries of the private enterprise group in our community and, at worst, the exploitation of private enterprise. Family day care cost to the consumer is largely the same as or just a little less than the average cost of day care. To my knowledge it is $30 to $35 per week. To the extent that it is the genuine choice of consumers, there may be a case for a decent subsidy to provide a proper return to a woman-this could also apply to a man-who cares for, say, five children in her own home. Perhaps two of the children are her own. At present she receives considerably less than the minimum wage for a job which is intensely demanding in every aspect and in every sense of the word. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure to utilise child care centres in some cases, particularly in less affluent areas is, I suggest, closely associated with a lack of access to employment for women in those areas. Where the mothers are more affluent they tend to be better educated, more mobile and more likely to have jobs. They are also likely to have their own transport and a real choice of child care centres from which to choose. Less fortunate women-the majority-are limited to the work available close to their homes, for which they will probably be paid less than $5 per hour, and a part time job of 16 hours which is the average for part time jobs in Australia at present. This is barely enough to cover the cost of placing two children in commercial care. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most disappointing to discover that the Minister apparently is prepared to accept advice which can only lead to deteriorating standards of care and employment rather than seeking to ensure the funding philosophy which would see an accelerated expansion of and accessibility to good quality community care. To point up my remarks I would like to draw attention to a report in today's West Australian in which the State Minister for Community Welfare states:</PARA>
<PARA>'We must strike a proper balance between the needs of developing children and the economic realities of day care', Mr Hassell said. 'If staff-child ratios are too high or staff qualifications are too demanding, private day care will cease'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government thought that there were many experienced mothers capable of playing a part in child day care, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> They needed no academic qualifications to work successfully in this field, provided that there was skilled guidance. </PARA>
<PARA>I am greatly concerned at the possibility of a State government in this case looking at providing child care on the cheap with untrained workers. I am not implying that the people are unskilled workers, as he has, but rather people who are not specifically trained for this very demanding and very valuable field of activity. It seems to indicate once again that the work that women customarily do is being undervalued and that the Government, if it is possibly able to do so, will provide these services-which are generally accepted as essential, as the Minister for Social Security acknowledged today-at a far lower-priority than they should attract from Government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance that has been raised today by the Opposition is so broad that it has allowed the Opposition's imagination to run wild. We have just had a pretty good example of that from Senator Giles who made all sorts of suggestions such as the one that the most disadvantaged people in the community will be paying fees. She was talking about women on low incomes and women with part time jobs not being able to meet the means tested fees that the Government supposedly will apply. Whenever the Opposition claims that the difficulties and uncertainties in these areas are caused by Government policies and they bring them forward for discussion as matters of public importance, we can see immediately who is causing the uncertainties and who is whipping up the concern in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes made a speech on 17 October in which he claimed that the total amount spent on the Children's Services Program had diminished considerably in real value since 1977. He said that had the $75m that the Australian Labor Party had allocated to this program been indexed the Government would now be spending $110m instead of the $80m that it has allocated this year. He claimed today that he was not asking for this sort of expenditure but he did not say what sort he was asking for. Certainly the inference is that an amount similar to the amount of $110m should be put up. In other words, governments should go on spending and spending, never having a review and never having a look to see whether the amount is justified. They should go on handing out money at the level which is indexed to the figure allocated some six or seven years ago. I guess that is the philosophy of a big spending government. It is the philosophy of the Labor Party that got us into so much trouble in those three dark years for overspending and it is nothing more than we should expect from the present supporters of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest amount of money spent on children's services is in the area of the provision of day care facilities. Both Senator Grimes and Senator Giles stuck to that area and I intend to do so too. There are two subsidised systems in this area. There is the centralised system under which mothers bring their cildren to a centre that is subsidised by the Commonwealth Government or paid for by other agencies. The mothers leave their children there for a full day if they are a working mother or for a few hours if the mother just needs a few hours to herself. There is also the family day care system under which individual women look after children in their own home. They apply to the Federal Government for a subsidy under the special needs area that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to explain the centralised system. In 1970, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has already said, there were only 560 centres in Australia catering for 14,000 children. Forty of those centres were assisted by some organisation such as a State government or a local government. There was no Commonwealth contribution at all. In 1972 the then government bought into this area and the Budget allocation for the centralised system was $2.49m. The allocation now is $42.85m. I really do not believe that Senator Grimes or Senator Giles can possibly say that enough money is not being spent in this area. There has been a considerable increase. In the period between 1970 and 1980 the number of centres has increased from 560 to 1,350 and they are now looking after 90,000 children. Of that number of centres, 518 have Commonwealth aid and 813 are privately run. The rest are run by the States and non-profit organisations. We have come a long way in the provision of these services since 1970. The main problem associated with the 518 Government subsidised centres is that just costs are not being applied to the mothers using them. The Commonwealth subsidises these centres and each centre sets its own rates depending on the costs and services. The rates vary considerably. Frankly, the fees vary so much from State to State and from centre to centre that there is simply no justice in the present system. We have been told that some mothers are paying $80 per week and others are paying $45 a week. There is also quite a large range in the rates which apply to those who are categorised as disadvantaged and who get an extra subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the Government has been very clear, as the Minister has said. From the beginning he has said that the money should go to those mothers who are not only most in need but also who cannot afford to pay. Broadly speaking, this involves the children of lone parents; children whose both parents are in the work force and on low incomes; children from ethnic minority groups; children who are in isolated circumstances; children with a physical, intellectual or emotional handicap and so on. There is a long list of the sorts of children who are in need. I believe that the Minister has incorporated that list in Hansard. The Government has spelled out its priorities very clearly to all centres. Yet, as I said, depending on which State people live in and which centres their children go to, the fees charged by the centres vary widely. Consequently, the Government has decided that we need to review and thrash out some of the problems in this area. So we will have a year of consolidation and review to see just what is happening, where the gaps are and to enable consultation-as the Minister very clearly stated in his speech-with all the people working in this area. We know that access for some of the more disadvantaged groups is very difficult as there is no child care centre in their area. We have to look at access and make sure that those in real need are able to get a subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have suggested that a common means test for parents ought to be looked at. Naturally, that would put more emphasis on those in need. There is no method of subsidising a mother attending the 813 private enterprise centres I mentioned just a minute ago even though the mother may be in real need. This is also an area that has to be looked at. I noticed that in an answer to one of the questions asked by Senator Grimes during an Estimates committee meeting the Minister suggested that a pilot scheme be established. Senator Giles has left the chamber, but I gather she must have got that matter very confused because there is no scheme presently in action and there is no intention of setting up such a scheme immediately. It is being looked at. I am particularly interested in this pilot project. If private enterprise decides to set up a child care centre in a certain area because it believes there is a need in that area, let it set it up. If mothers who fit into the Government guidelines I mentioned a little earlier come to the centres the Government could subsidise those mothers. I believe that this is the way we can make the taxpayer's dollar go a lot further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill, I was asked a question and you are wasting valuable minutes. I believe that the question Senator Thomas asked me is crucial to the matter. I am quite sure that Senator Mulvihill would agree with me. I am talking about the mother in real need who has to go out to work to support her family, the single mother or the mother whose husband is unemployed or has a very low income. For a thousand reasons women have to go out and seek a job. I believe that those women on low incomes, whose total family income is low, justifiably should be subsidised by the taxpayer. The woman who just wants to go out to work and whose husband is well able to support the family comfortably has every justification for going out to work but she must not ask the taxpayer to subsidise the care of her child. I believe that Senator Mulvihill and I would be in accord in this area. As I explained earlier, the subsidy to the family day care centre is about $400 a child per annum, whereas the subsidy at big centres that the Commonwealth subsidises averages $1,100 a child per annum. That is a tremendous difference. I believe that this points up what is happening. Parents who can well afford to pay the full cost of the care of their children are not being asked to pay the full cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that we have to remember that the prime responsibility for looking after children is with the parents. Senator Giles put it as a question-she did not really say that she came down on that side but the inference certainly was there-that child care should be looked at as a community service, not as welfare, that it should be looked at in the same way as education. I think that is an appalling suggestion. Since when should any mother give up the responsibility of looking after her child? Why should the community take on the responsibility of looking after a child of mine that I am well able to look after and capable of paying for? I think that is the sort of big brother concept that the whole of Australia would shrink from. Every mother worth her salt would shrink from that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to remember that it is not the responsibility of the community to look after and bring up children; it is the responsibility of the community to help the mother who is financially unable to bring up or at risk in bringing up her child in the best possible way. I suppose this gets back to the fact that the Government and the Opposition have different philosophies. The Government's philosophy is that the responsibility for children is still with the family, the parents; that governments do not interfere unless the need is really there. The Opposition's philosophy, so clearly expressed by Senator Giles, is that the responsibility for looking after and caring for children could be part of a community service, such as education. It is nothing of the sort. The community has to realise that that is one of the the basic differences in philosophy between the Opposition and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing a matter of public importance about the difficulties and uncertainty caused by the Government's policies in the area of children's services. Specifically we are looking at these matters in relation to the direction of funding, the criteria used and the consequences of these matters, rather than the amount of funding which is actually provided, since, as Senator Grimes pointed out at the beginning of his contribution, we were not planning on debating the differences that could have occurred had indexing applied from the introduction of the Act. Like Senator Walters and other speakers, I will follow Senator Grime's lead in limiting my comments almost exclusively to child care centres and not take in the broader aspect of other things in the community relating to children's services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been pointed out by earlier speakers that Government expenditure on children's services in the community will rise in the coming year. However, as will be apparent to anyone who looks at the breakdown, only in the vicinity of $6m is really available to be distributed among a range of projects required in the area of children's services. As Senator Grimes noted earlier, this has led to a situation in which new programs are not being accepted for funding and furthermore, in which existing services are not able to be expanded or extended. This in turn means that a large number of parents in the community whose children require the services of child care centres are not able to have their needs met. The fact that some centres that I know of in South Australia have waiting lists of something like 20 to 30 children is an indication that there is a growing pool of people in the community who require, for one reason or another, the services of child care centres. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Walters pointed out towards the end of her comments, a lot of the people who require these services require them not because they want to go off and play tennis or squash or to get a spot of relief from their children, although as a mother of two rather lively children I acknowledge that we sometimes need that relief, but because they have definite financial needs to meet. Putting their children in a child care facility of some sort helps them solve that problem. The Government must be aware of this trend in society. It must be aware of the increasing needs of some lone income parent families or dual income parent families for child care facilities, particularly in view of the fact that, apparently in New South Wales, the Department of Social Security actively sought submissions from community councils asking them to outline their needs. Unfortunately it would appear that those submissions have been overlooked, ignored or, for some other reason, not been able to be satisfied. The New South Wales position though is not as bad as I understand the Victorian position is where, I believe, there have been cuts in the vicinity of 10 per cent in real terms for children's services other than pre-school services. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads us to another major problem. What happens in an area like children's services either when funds are cut-which, of course, has not occurred across Australia in this particular case-or where increased needs are not met? The answer is that something has to give. The something that gives is usually staffing, quantity of services or quality of services. All three of those elements cannot be met at the same time if the belt has to be tightened in the particular child care centre suffering from a dearth of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the assertion of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that the present Government is concerned about the quality of children's services in Australia. He is known to be a compassionate man. He is known to be concerned about these areas as well as about a whole range of other areas in social services. I repeat a comment that I made the other day: We all know that there is only so much money and it cannot be spent the way we would all like it to be. Nevertheless, I am still concerned that the present policies are working against the Minister's avowed commitment which I have just said I accept and certainly share, as do we all in this place. The fact as that the more services that are cut back, the more the quality suffers and the fewer the children who can be accommodated. That is a simple fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The cut-backs will also affect employment in the area. Children's services are high labour intensive areas and as a general rule, very high employers of women. It disturbs me that one of the direct consequences of insufficient funds will be a decrease in employment in the area and in particular a decrease in women's employment. Heaven only knows, women have a limited number of employment opportunities in areas in which they have access to employment. To have one of their traditional areas cut back is something which bothers me.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has made the point that it is the taxpayer who ultimately pays for funding of services such as child care services and other forms of social service, and this, of course, is so. Yet I repeat that the present situation seems to be operating against his intention and certainly is not helping the position that the taxpayer is in. Reduced employment due to staffing means fewer people able to earn incomes; therefore, fewer people are able to pay taxes. Decreased staffing and decreased provision of facilities mean that particularly those people from two income families who require the services of child care centres will have to rethink their position. In many cases one of those incomes will have to be forgone either because the facilities are no longer available or because the families concerned cannot afford the increased costs. Either way, taxes again will not be able to be picked up by the Government. So it is a rather circular sort of situation. </PARA>
<PARA> At least some of these problems, I suggest, could be solved if the criteria used for subsidising parents of children in child care centres were narrowed so that lower income earners took priority. This was a point that Senator Walters took up and discussed at some length towards the end of the comments that she made. I was pleased to note that the Minister earlier on, in answer to Senator Grimes, asserted that low income earners were going to be the priority area in funding children's services. However, it does seem to be a point that has so far been lost to the community generally and to the children's services area in particular; otherwise there would not be the uncertainty in that area. Whatever else we feel about the quantity of funding, the directions in which that funding is going and the effectiveness of the funding, the simple fact remains that there is uncertainty in the area of children's services. Whether it ought to be there and whether it is a communications problem are irrelevant. The problem is still there. I therefore hope Senator Chaney's assertion will go some way to alleviating the uncertainty in that regard. In concluding, I ask the Minister two questions, if that is not out of order at this point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was rather counting on that to get an answer to the questions. I feel that the Minister's bolt has been shot anyway in regard to recent events in Western Australia and that my lattering comments cannot do him any more harm. The first question is: Can he give any indication of when or whether the present Act is likely to be revised and whether it is likely to contain provisions for constant review and updating? I ask the question not to be frivolous or to try to worm policy decisions out of the Minister but because organisations like the National Council of Women and the South Australian Children's Services Council, among others in the community, have sent copies of submissions to me that they have either made or are planning to make in regard to the updating of that Act. They, like the Minister and all the rest of us in the Senate, are concerned at the need for quality children's services in Australia and see the updating of that Act as one way of providing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question that I direct to the Minister for his consideration, if not actually for his answer, relates to the special problems facing the disabled child in the community. Again this is something that Senator Walters raised. It seems appropriate in the International Year of Disabled Persons to ask the Minister whether he would consider making an additional subsidy available to disabled children attending or wanting to attend child care centres. The Minister must be aware-I think every parent would be-that ordinary offspring are hard enough to handle. They require a large amount of our time, a great deal of our attention and a lot of tender, loving care. Child care centres which do all of this in loco parentis, as it were, attempt to provide those services. The staffing requirements for a disabled child in a child care centre are quite different and much more strenuous than those applying to a child who is not disabled. This is particularly true, as Senator Walters mentioned, of the intellectually disabled child. Mothers of these children are particularly needful of some relief; yet, for a variety of reasons, they are the very people who are least likely to get it, either because they cannot come up with the extra costs involved or because, as child care centres need to cut their staffing, they are loth to accept either intellectually or physically disabled children-however much they would like to-into the centres since almost entirely a one-to-one caring situation is required for these people. I ask the Minister, if he manages to get through that rambling tirade, whether he would consider appropriating an additional subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that anyone in this chamber is anything but concerned that quality and sufficient children's services be provided in this country. What we are doing on this side of the House is asking that those in most need have their needs met first and that, above all, the Child Care Act, which was introduced by a Liberal government nearly 10 years ago to provide for this, be updated to take into account the changing social needs of the 1980s. I do not think that is too much to ask. We are not, as Senator Walters suggested, asking for money to be spent for the heck of it. We are asking that those funds which are available be spent according to the major needs of the community and that the criteria be regularly reviewed so that they remain relevant to changing social needs. Only in that way can the commitment of the Minister and the commitment of all of us in this chamber be achieved. I do not think that even Senator Walters would argue with the sense and the inherent justice of that desire. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance relates to the difficulties and uncertainty caused by the Government's policies in the area of children's services. All of the previous speakers in the debate seemed more or less to address themselves to the matter of child care centres and day care facilities. I think there are very many more aspects of this subject of children's services. I feel it is rather appropriate that I take the opportunity of speaking today because I have been involved in the sphere of looking after children for many years, firstly as a mother and now as a grandmother. I think it is quite appropriate that I have this opportunity of saying something on the matter which is before the Senate this evening. I have been given the honour of becoming the chairwoman of the Save the Children Fund next year. I consider that to be a very important task and one which I was very happy to accept. I feel there is a great need to help children right throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is particularly relevant during this Child Care Week that we spare a thought for all those millions of children around the world who are the innocent victims of starvation, homelessness, cruelty and war, and whose only hope for survival rests with the generosity of governments, such as our own, and with concerned individuals throughout the world. It is important that we, as parents, teachers, the community, governments and government agencies, work together towards providing our children with the financial, moral, spiritual and educational support which is fundamental to their proper development. I have always held the view that the family remains the best way of caring for Australian children and for guiding them to adulthood. The family unit provides the ultimate loving environment which is so much an integral part of a stable and stimulating upbringing for our children. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in these times of strict economic policies, the financial burdens and pressures on the average Australian family are enormous and sometimes unbearable. Often it is necessary for the mother to continue in the work force, to supplement the family income and to help cover the basic costs of living. In fact, with the increasing number of women who are finding it necessary to continue in the work force after having their children, the demand for child care services in the community is extremely high. It makes one wonder whether, in fact, a reduction in the burden on the Australian family, perhaps through less taxes, would help to lessen the demand on the child care services which are provided by the Government. Actually, the Government is looking at the question of how to meet the demands of families in the greatest economic need while at the same time providing for those in greatest social need. I agree with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that the obligation to look after children should rest primarily with the parents and the Government should be moving to provide assistance in circumstances where parents cannot afford child care. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind the Senate that it is not only the children of working parents who are assisted through the Government's Children's Services Program. I heard Senator Walters speak of some of the ways in which they are helped. The children of lone parents, children from ethnic minorities, children who have physical, intellectual or emotional handicaps, those who are at risk because of maltreatment or whose family is likely to break down, children from poor families and even those who live in isolated areas-there are many of them scattered throughout the far parts of Queensland-all have to be helped through our Government's Children's Services Program. I can think of other ways in which children are helped. Children are assisted through the work done for handicapped children, through the programs which the Government helps to sponsor, and the work done for spastics. It was only on Monday that I had the opportunity of meeting the entrants in the Miss Queensland contest who were working very hard indeed for spastic children. They are helped by our Government. The funds that are raised are subsidised in that way. Many other people work for children in need. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981-82 Budget saw an allocation of $80.1m specifically to the Children's Services Program. That is an increase of $6.07m over the expenditure on the program in the previous year. Of this, $33.09m will be provided to the States and the Northern Territory as a contribution to pre-school education. An amount of $47m will be available to assist a range of services for children and families. This tells me of a caring government attitude. This is something that we should emphasise. This caring attitude is seen by the vast amount of money that our Government is willing to make available for this work. The Federal Government's involvement in child care services has been designed to respond to local community initiatives because the Government believes that members of local communities are the best people to know what sort of services they need. They give those services the kind of support that helps to make them a success and the whole community receives a worthwhile return for its tax outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the provision of services for groups with special needs assumes a top priority. This means that children of low income families and single parents, disabled and Aboriginal children$ the children of migrants and children living in remote and isolated areas are top of the list. To cater for the requirements of such groups is of great importance to the Government. The enrolments under all child care services which are funded under the Children's Services Program are monitored constantly to ensure that this policy of priority of access is maintained. In conjunction with this, the Government also operates a policy of priority for those in particular financial need. Financial assistance which is made available through the Children's Services Program must be channelled as a first priority to those in the greatest economic need. Schemes which cater for so many children in economic need that they use up their available pool of grants for this purpose are entitled to apply for extra funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 10 or so years that the children's services program has been operational, the number of child care centres operating throughout Australia has increased dramatically. In 1970 there were estimated to be about 560 child care centres operating throughout Australia with a total capacity of 14,000 places. Only 40 of these received assistance from State or local authorities. There was no Commonwealth contribution to child care. However, in October 1980, there were some 1,350 centres operating, of which about 520 received Commonwealth Government assistance, and a further 163 were Commonwealth supported family day care schemes. I believe that further Commonwealth supported services have come into operation since then. The actual administration of the children's services program involves a mixture of funding directly to organisations and funding through the States. In this way, therefore, it is designed to be a joint Federal-State effort, ensuring the best possible services for those in the community who need the most help. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Queensland is concerned, our Department of Welfare Services, under the direction of the Minister, Terry White, provides an excellent range of services for children. The Department of Children's Services, which is within the Department of Welfare Services, has a budget of $24.6m for 1981-82 and has 32 offices located throughout our State. I thought honourable senators would be interested to know some of the work they are doing in Queensland. They include a crisis care service, child protection services, early childhood services, adoption, fostering, social aunts and uncles programs-that sounds rather interesting to me-care for children away from their families through children's homes, family group homes, hostels et cetera, and juvenile correction. As at 30 June 1980 4,526 children were in the care of the Director of the Department of Children's Services, although this represents only a proportion of the children with which the Department's officers were involved. Through the various programs undertaken by the Department about 11,300 children are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators can see that the Queensland Government is doing its bit to care for our children in Queensland. Seven joint Commonwealth-State programs are being conducted in Queensland at present. One of them is the family support services program which is run through the Office of Child Care. The Commonwealth has allocated $316,713 to this program. The youth services program has been allocated $153,580. There is also a very interesting program of school vacation care in which grants are made to community groups offering a wide range of activities in caring programs for those children who would normally be unsupervised during school holidays. These are children of working parents or a single parent who works and other children in disadvantaged circumstances such as those who are handicapped, Aboriginal and newly arrived migrants. An average of 53 projects are funded each school holiday period throughout the State. Funding is provided by our caring Commonwealth Government. During 1981-82 $183,000 has been made available for a program such as this. A grant of $108,000 has been made available for child care in women's refuges. This work, of course, is concerned with the care of children. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Year of the Child special projects are still going on. Our Government is conducting a children's week in Queensland and the Commonwealth Government has given $2,000 for this work. Grants for disabled children were spoken about earlier. As a contribution to the International Year of the Disabled, Commonwealth funds totalling $29,711 were made available in this year to assist 26 organisations concerned with disabled children and their families. I believe that the Federal Government and the Government in Queensland are working together in the area of children's services to ensure that the best possible assistance is given to those in our community who are least able to help themselves-our children. I am very pleased to be able to say that the close working relationship between the two governments is to the advantage of our children in need. I only hope that this continues so that our future citizens of Australia are given every possible opportunity to equip themselves for the future. The Australian Labor Party is very good at criticising and whingeing but let us not be too upset by that because that is what it is all about. Much progress has been made--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Judges' Pensions Act 1968, which replaced similar Acts of 1948, 1956, 1958 and 1961, provides for pensions to be payable to Federal judges and certain other judges for whom the Commonwealth is responsible. The 1981-82 estimate for these pensions is $1.14m, not in itself a large sum. Nonetheless some quite important questions of principle are raised by this amending Bill. The judges covered by the legislation are either judges or former judges of the following courts: The High Court of Australia; the Federal Court of Australia; presidential members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; presidential members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and certain other Commonwealth tribunals; judges of the Family Court of Australia; judges of the Australian Capital Territory and other Territory Supreme Courts; and also Papua New Guinea Supreme Court judges if appointed before 1 December 1973. Of those courts or bodies which are no longer in operation or in full operation, the scope of the legislation also extends to the Australian Industrial Court; the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; and the Federal Court of Bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The object of the Bill before us is to clear up various anomalies and to make various improvements in the administration of, and entitlements under, the judicial pensions scheme and, in particular, to introduce a pro rata entitlement for judges who retire from their positions after less than 10 years in office. There is a preliminary consideration which needs to be adverted to right at the outset in considering the terms of this Bill, although it is a matter which has continued without change in the text of this Bill. That underlying matter is the non-contributory nature of the present judicial pensions scheme-a characteristic, it must be acknowledged at the outset, however, that is shared with the pensions schemes for judges in all the States of this country as well as, of course, in a good deal of the private sector. As the system operates at the moment judges do not pay any contribution at all for the very substantial pensions they receive upon retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation at present is that a judge who retires after serving for not less than 10 years is entitled to a pension equal to 60 per cent of what is described in the Bill as the 'appropriate current judicial salary' which, in most cases, is the salary which he or she would have received if he or she had not retired. That is obviously a very generous provision. It is all the more generous because, obviously, of its non-contributory nature. As the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) admitted in his second reading speech, a non-contributory pension scheme is unusual in public employment, although it is not at all unusual in the private sector. Nonetheless, the Attorney made a quite spirited defence-I suppose that would be putting it rather strongly for the Attorney; of the non-contributory nature of the pension by reference to comparisons with the private sector and also by reference to two points of view, which he described as principle and pragmatic considerations, concerned with the political and financial independence respectively of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the first point made by the Attorney goes to the question of the continued independence of the judiciary and its immunity from temptation by way of financial inducements in the form of ex gratia payments from the Executive upon retirement or, as is increasingly common, the prospect of having part time jobs to do under the patronage of the Executive after retirement. The idea is that, if we can provide sufficiently well and comfortably for judges upon their retirement, to that extent we are contributing to the maintenance of the integrity and independence of the judiciary from Executive blandishments of this kind. That is a familiar and ancient justification; it remains to be seen whether it stands up in present day circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The other more practical inducement for the non-contributory and generous pension schemes provided for judges that was referred to by the Attorney is the one that judges, by and large, were earning prior to their elevation to the Bench very substantial incomes in their professional careers at the Bar-very often two, three, four or more times the income they can expect to get while on the Bench. Hitherto, I suppose, it has been thought that the honour and glory associated with appointment to judicial office did much to compensate for that financial disadvantage by way of income, but perhaps the slings and arrows that are increasingly being meted out to judicial officers make the honour, not to mention the glory, rather less obvious than it used to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it has been known to happen even in this Parliament. It is a welcome development that judges are less immune from criticism, and fairly robust criticism on occasions, as far as their judicial performance is concerned. That is a view I have always adopted. But one of the considerations associated with that is that it is necessary to offer something by way of inducement-perhaps increasingly these days-for judges to accept judicial office; maybe not much by way of inducement when one talks about the High Court and the higher reaches of the Federal Court and so on but, given the large number of Federal judicial appointments now being made, it is arguably necessary to be able to offer some financial compensation for the income loss that will usually be experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Traditionally it has been argued, reasonably plausibly, that it is necessary in this context to make very generous provision for judicial pensions. But notwithstanding the Attorney's defence of the status quo by arguments along these lines, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I propose to give some thought to the question whether there should be a change in the basis of the Judges' pensions scheme by making pension rights depend in part upon a contribution being made by the Judges from their salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>That, in the Attorney's mind, is something for the future. However, we of the Opposition are inclined to believe that that is a subject which ought to be of concern here and now, in the present. Regrettably, there is nothing in this Bill to deal in any way with this rather fundamental issue about the basis of the whole pension scheme in question. We believe there should be such a provision and that does seem to be a view which we share on this occasion with the Australian Democrats, not to mention Don Cameron and one or two other fairly lively dissidents in the Government's ranks on this issue, as demonstrated in the House of Representatives debate a few days ago. We of the Australian Labor Party do not believe that it is really possible to draft a contributory pension scheme for judges, or anybody else, on the run, particularly in the period of less than a week we have had to deal with this Bill since its introduction, although it seems that such was, at least at one stage, an aspiration contemplated by the Australian Democrats. We note that they are proposing to circulate for discussion a suggested contributory pension scheme based on the not ungenerous scheme that we have for ourselves as parliamentarians. But rather than endeavouring to deal in this debate or in any other debate on this legislation with the kinds of amendments that might be necessary to get a rational and acceptable pension scheme introduced on a contributory basis, we believe that the sensible way through this issue-this has been discussed between all the parties in this chamber-is to put on record a second reading amendment expressing the Senate's support for a serious investigation of a contributory basis for such a pension scheme in the future. Such a second reading amendment will be formally moved later in this debate by Senator Haines and I indicate now that the Opposition will support it for the reasons I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matters specifically raised in this Bill. There are four which require comment. The first is the proposed new pro rata provision, the second is the change in the salary reference points by which the pensions are calculated, the third is the new provision made for the children of judges and the final one is the question of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The question of pro rata pensions is the one that engendered all the excitement when this matter was debated in the other place. The provision made in the Bill which is before the Senate is for judges who retire after a period of less than 10 years in the job but after serving for not less than six years to get a pro rata entitlement of the pension that they would otherwise get, calculated on the basis of 0.5 per cent of current salary for each completed month they have been in office up to a maximum of 60 per cent of that salary. The reason for the introduction of a pro rata provision of this kind in the legislation is related to the introduction, following the 1977 constitutional amendment, of a compulsory retiring age for Federal judges-70 years in the case of High Court judges and all other Federal judges unless the Parliament otherwise provides. The Parliament has otherwise provided in the case of Family Court judges, for whom the retiring age is now 65 years, and for presidential members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for whom, equally, there is an age of 65 years now set. </PARA>
<PARA> There were judges who, by virtue of this new compulsory retiring age provision, would have missed out on a pension had the existing 10 years threshold rules continued to operate-notably Mr Justice McGregor of the Withers royal commission fame and Mr Justice Gibson of the Family Court. Representations were made in respect of these two gentlemen by Mr Lionel Bowen of the Labor Party, and it is in response to those representations that the Government, although dragging its heels, appears primarily to have responded in the initial draft of this Bill, the one introduced into the House of Representatives, which set a seven-year threshold for the entitlement to the pro rata pension in question, being a period sufficient to accommodate the two judges I have mentioned who were thought, apparently, to be the only ones affected by the introduction of the new compulsory retiring age. The trouble was however, that one judge was left out of contemplation. That was poor old Mr Justice Marks of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission who needed a six-year threshold period to be set in order for him to be covered if he was to collect a pension before he was compulsorily retired under the new provisions. This ever-obliging Government responded in the House of Representatives with an amendment reducing the threshold period from seven years to six years in order to accommodate Mr Justice Marks. That amendment was the subject of a good deal of criticism in the debate which occurred in the House of Representatives, both by the Opposition and also by individual government members, particularly Mr Don Cameron. </PARA>

Let me make it clear, however, that the Opposition reaction in the House of Representatives to the Government's amendment, which was rather sprung upon our members in that House, was based on a belief that Mr Justice Marks's position may indeed have been the subject of an explicit promise made by Mr Street, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, at the time of Mr Justice Marks's appointment which, if indeed it were the case, would raise serious questions of ethics and principles of the kind which were adverted to by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Lionel Bowen, in that chamber.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not these days, and not in this chamber; I acknowledge that, Attorney. But subsequently Mr Bowen was informed by Mr Street, as indeed he then got up to tell the chamber, that Mr Street had, in his own words, made no such promise or no such deal with Mr Justice Marks, and as a result of that assurance which has been put on the record by Mr Street, we in the Opposition in the Senate where the issue is before us again for debate are not disposed to press the point, to press the opposition, that is, to the threshold now being set of six years rather than seven years. We have acknowledged, by virtue of the representations that we have publicly made on behalf of judges who missed out on pensions because of the introduction of the new compulsory retiring age, that there is nothing necessarily obnoxious about making particular legislative provision for specified individuals who find themselves on the receiving end of some disadvantage as a result of a change in public policy for good public policy reasons. There is no reason in principle against such an exercise, provided that there is some other independent justification for the provision in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We note in this respect that in all those States where there is provision for pro rata entitlement by judges to pensions for periods of service less than 10 years or some large equivalent thereof the most common provision is either five or six years service for people to become eligible for pensions. Against that sort of standard, which appears to be the norm in the States, the proposed six-year threshhold set in this legislation is not perhaps objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter dealt with in the Bill is the question of the change in the salary reference points for the operation of the pension scheme, a matter dealt with by clause 3 of the Bill which makes certain amendments to the definition of 'appropriate current judicial salary'. Clause 3 (1) of the Bill makes appropriate changes to the titles of senior judges in Papua New Guinea in conformity with changes which have taken place in that country since independence. Obviously we make no objection to that essential updating exercise. Clause 3 (2), however, is rather closer to home insofar as it amends this same definition, that is, of 'appropriate current judicial salary' in section 4 of the principal Act, so as to base the pensions and pension entitlements which are presently based on the salaries payable in the Australian Industrial Court and the Federal Court of Bankruptcy on, now, salaries payable to judges of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> To that extent these changes are not opposed. They make perfectly sensible accommodations to take account of the transfer of functions of those former courts to the new Federal Court. Federal Court salaries will continue to increase under the control of the Remuneration Tribunal and it is appropriate that the continuing pensions should be linked to these salaries rather than to the salaries of courts which have either actually, or for all practical purposes virtually, disappeared. However, there is one particular point which I think should now be brought out when one is considering salary relativities between these various federal courts, new and old. In his second reading speech the Attorney says that these amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will also have the effect of restoring, for pension purposes, the relativity that existed until 1977 between Judges of the Australian Industrial Court and Presidential Members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>So far, so good. That in itself is reasonable enough. But what is not said is that there is now a different relativity, that which existed between the Family Court judges and the Federal Court judges in respect of their salaries, which has not been maintained. That, I believe, is the subject of quite legitimate grievance on the part of the Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1976 the Government introduced a Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill in relation to which, in the course of the second reading speech, the then Minister for Administrative Services said:</PARA>
<PARA> The rates of salaries and allowances of judges of the Family Court, which are at present prescribed in the Family Law Act 1975, have fallen behind the rates for judges of other Federal courts of comparable status. This has occurred largely because the Family Law Bill occupied so much of the time of both Houses during its passage through Parliament last year. </PARA>
<PARA>A little further down the page the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The rates proposed for the Chief Judge and for senior judges of the Family Court are equivalent to the rates for the Chief Judge and the judges respectively of the Australian Industrial Court. The proposed rate for ordinary judges of the Family Court-at which level the majority of judges are being appointed-is $5,000 less than that for senior judges. </PARA>
<PARA>The point was further made that:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important both to the judges already appointed and for the appointment of further judges that the salary increases provided for in this Bill be made, and made as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1976, then, a new catch-up relativity was established between the Chief Judge and senior judges of the Family Court and the Chief Judge and the judges respectively, of the Australian Industrial Court. What has happened since then is that these salary relativities have once again got substantially out of line. That is indicated by the 1981-82 Estimates. The Chief Judge of the Federal Court is now getting $73,000 whereas the Chief Judge of the Family Court is now getting $67,000. So the Federal Court, which has become the successor to the old Australian Industrial Court, has now leapt ahead in terms of the relative entitlement of the Family Court judges. The senior judges of the Family Court are getting $59,000 compared with ordinary judges of the Federal Court who get $67,000. Ordinary judges of the Family Court are getting $55,000 compared with an equivalent notional figure for the Federal Court of $62,000. That, I think is a matter that does and ought to cause some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney, in his response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, was in fact full of praise for the judges of the Family Court. He said, with a great deal of enthusiasm:</PARA>
<PARA> The Judges of that Court have been selected, not only for their expertise in family law, but also for their suitability as judges in the very sensitive area in which they work. It is regrettable that so many people seem to misunderstand and devalue that work. </PARA>
<PARA>If he is serious about the problem that is being felt in some quarters of a devaluation in the status of Family Court judges, in the view of the Opposition and certainly in my own view, he ought to do something to restore the relativities between Family Court judges and other Federal Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only by that means, given the regrettable extent to which status, prestige and professional worth tend to be measured in dollars and cents, that within the legal profession at large and among the opinion makers of this community, the true worth and capacity of the Family Court judges will be recognised. A pension Bill is not an occasion on which to pursue this point beyond merely referring to it. Obviously, it will need to be the subject of further and different legislation, perhaps in the context of the Family Law Bills which are now before the Senate. But the existence before us now of a pension Bill based, as the pensions in it are, upon salaries set at the Federal Court level, is an occasion to draw attention to that particular relativity problem, which I fear has been rather too long neglected. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining matters dealt with in the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill can be much more briskly disposed of. The next matter concerns the provision made for the children of judges in the event, in the first place, that a particular judge dies or retires. Under the present Act, the widow, or widower, as the case may be, receives an actual sum of $208 per annum or $4 a week in respect of each eligible child-an eligible child being a child under the age of 16 or a dependent student up to the age of 25. The dollar figure and the Bill, in respect of the entitlement of those children, substitutes for that dollar figure a percentage of the pension that would have been payable to the deceased judge had he lived. This represents a reasonable improvement. Although the percentages in question-12 1/2 per cent for one eligible child, 25 per cent for two eligible children and 37 1/2 per cent for three or more eligible children-of the pension otherwise payable are undoubtedly generous both by Public Service pension standards and general pension standards, they are not out of line with the reasonable expectations of high level professionals of the kind that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter provided for, as far as judicial pensions are concerned, in respect of children concerns the children of deceased judges, in situations where there is no surviving spouse. Again, the dollar figures provided in the 1968 legislation have become devalued and outdated by the passage of inflationary time, especially in the last five years, when inflation has continued unabated despite all the protestations and professed intentions of this Government to the contrary. Under those circumstances, the dollar figures are manifestly inadequate. The percentages proposed-45 per cent for one eligible child, ranging up to a full 100 per cent-of the pension that would be payable where there are four or more eligible children seem to the Opposition to be quite reasonable, particularly insofar as they parallel exactly the Public Service orphan pensions which prevail elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter, with which I can deal in a sentence or so, relates to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A welcome provision has been inserted to ensure that application for review of pension decisions may be made under a number of heads to that Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The key question which emerges from all these miscellaneous and often detailed and complex provisions is the basic underlying question whether judges, alone in the public sector, should continue to receive non-contributory pensions. On that score, I have made clear the view of the Opposition that times have changed and that the justifications advanced in the past have not the same force and credibility that traditionally, perhaps, they have seemed to possess. On this matter, as we have indicated, the Labor Party will support the second reading amendment that will be moved formally by the Australian Democrats after the suspension of the sitting for dinner. </PARA>
<PARA> On all the other matters dealt with in the Bill some of which have been controversial in other places, our position is to accept the terms of the Bill as they are now before us and not to oppose them now or at the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in rising to support the Government on this Bill. I would like to say a few words in line with the thoughts of Senator Evans. This Bill deals with the provision of superannuation or, more accurately, the payment of a pension to judges employed by the Commonwealth. My concern is, firstly, one for equity within the community-that people who are employed in the public sector should have equivalent status in the eyes of the Commonwealth with its employees. Secondly, and more importantly, my concern is that people in private industry who provide the backbone of the economic development and strength of this country should have the opportunity to provide for themselves by an adequate superannuation fund. I believe that people should be encouraged to provide for their own retirement and needs. I do not believe that it is the duty of the Government to provide for everyone in the community. It is far more effective and economical if such provision is made by people during their working lives. Indeed, that is the philosophy of the party that I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to this Bill, we are not discussing the degree of remuneration that Federal judges enjoy. By and large it is fair enough and is subject to review by various remuneration tribunals on an annual basis. I must say in passing that I am always amused by the great seriousness with which the legal profession takes the matter of its remuneration, which it seems to think puts it at a level that is above that of anyone else in the community. My mind goes back to the four tortuous years that I spent learning French as a schoolboy. One of the fables that we used to translate was that of La Fontaine about the oyster. Two Frenchmen were walking along a beach and found an oyster. They had a great argument over who had found it and eventually submitted it to arbitration. The judge ruled in favour of himself and ate the oyster. I rather think that, where salaries and conditions are concerned, times have not changed much for the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that interests me is the non-contributory nature of the scheme. That is why I described it as a pension. It is not a superannuation scheme at all because the generally accepted definition of such a scheme is that you provide some of your salary towards it. When we had only four judges employed by the Commonwealth, it was probably fair enough that judges made no contribution to such a scheme; but nowadays, when they are adequately rewarded, it is a different matter. I support completely the view that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) expressed in his second reading speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The independence of the judiciary from the parties to litigation is absolutely fundamental. It is of the utmost importance that a Judge should not, by reason of financial inducement or financial pressure, be thought to be in a position where he may be influenced by a particular party to litigation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I support that statement without reservation but believe that, with the present level of judges' remuneration, and in the light of current community attitudes, it is quite reasonable to expect judges to support their own superannuation scheme by making some contribution from their salaries. Indeed, I am heartened by that part of the second reading speech of the Minister in which, recognising this, he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I propose to give some thought to the question whether there should be a change in the basis of the Judge's pensions scheme by making pension rights depend in part upon a contribution being made by the Judges from their salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to add a little reinforcement to the Attorney-General's thinking on this point. The fact that in most States judges make no contribution at all to their superannuation scheme is a complete irrelevance. We are the Commonwealth and can decide what terms we set. We have subtle ways, I would imagine, through the income tax law and so on, of influencing the States. I would think that there would be ways of getting over the superannuation scheme of the States without too much trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the exceptional terms of the Bill relates to the widows and children of judges. They deal with a point of very real importance. As a father of four children I think about what would happen to them if something happened to me. It seems to me that the Bill has gone a little astray in perspective in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that people who earn very high salaries at the Bar have to take a cut in salary if they become judges. It is argued that their families have to be provided for in the event of their death. That is fair enough, but let us think about what would happen if they died when they were at the Bar. I think the situation in that case would probably be worse in that the superannuation schemes that are available to them are not as good as the superannuation scheme that would be available to them if they were in Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to move on very briefly to the subject of private superannuation schemes in this country because I think this is an area of great concern. We need to allow the private sector to provide for itself. However, at present it is quite simply not able to do so under the income tax law. It is not possible for people working in the private sector to provide adequately for their retirement. The starting point in cleaning up this matter is the income tax legislation. However, Parliament has a responsibility to look at the superannuation schemes that apply to politicians and members of the Public Service. I believe that parliamentary superannuation schemes should be better than those available to public servants or people in private industry. We want people who have established themselves in their own profession to come into this Parliament. Ideally they should come here in mid-life and contribute a number of years to the service of this nation. A career in politics is one of the most unpredictable careers on earth. All of us who come here accept that, wide-eyed and fully conscious of the risks we take. I do not think that one can make a case that we should participate in precisely the same superannuation schemes that are available to the rest of the members of the community who serve a lifetime. This would not be appropriate in view of the risks involved and the calibre of the people we want to attract. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in establishing a superannuation scheme which is better than any other scheme we should define the terms by which it is better. We should be able to codify or quantify how much better we think that scheme should be. This information should be open to public perusal. There should not be any concern in the eyes of members of the public as to the formula that led to the derivation of that scheme. Once we have put our house in order we can look at schemes in the public sector which I think by and large are far too generous. They are schemes which private industry simply cannot match. I do not believe that the types of pension and superannuation schemes that apply to State and Federal public servants and to officers of public and statutory authorities could be funded by private enterprise. I do not think these schemes have been actuarially costed. This is one of the great nightmares that lie ahead for future Federal and State Treasurers. I do not propose to go into this matter in great detail at present. However, I think it is wrong that we legislate in such a way that the private sector cannot provide for itself in the way that the public sector can. I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill. </PARA>

At an appropriate time during the rest of my comments I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an amendment which has been suggested by the Democrats and which has been circulated for discussion purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few remarks about the history of this Bill. It has, as everyone is aware, attracted a lot of publicity in the last few days apparently, it would seem, because certain members of the Opposition in the lower House have a tendency to run off at the mouth before checking on their facts. When they have the facts presented to them, they are in the unfortunate predicament of having to resile from some of their comments. That is a habit that members of the Australian Labor Party appear to be getting themselves into lately. It is unfortunate that in doing so they attracted some unnecessary and undue publicity for one particular judge. I would hate to think that they did this with any malice intended. It is unfortunate that initially the Government made an error by inserting the word 'seven' instead of 'six' in the relevant clause of the Bill. It was even more unfortunate that the Opposition in the lower House turned this into some sort of vendetta against Mr Justice Marks. It has, however, had one interesting and fairly useful result, and that is that the whole matter of judges' pensions, and for that matter other peoples pensions, has raised before the public a number of questions about anomalies and so on relating to judges' pensions and the other prerequisites of their office, particularly in relation to Federal judges vis-a-vis State judges. </PARA>

On the 17th of this month the Australian carried a story in which it was said that the Premier of Queensland was critical of this legislation.

<PARA>The point this pensioner is making is that there appears to be one standard for 'ordinary people' and another for a higher class of people. I would also like to refer to another discrepancy which has occurred in the last week, and that is the inconsistency on the part of both the Government and the Opposition in their attitudes to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment Bill which was before the Senate last Wednesday night. That night the Australian Labor Party moved an amendment to cover special cases. The Attorney then said that Senator Mason's argument that you should not move for special case consideration for superannuation purposes was put at least as well as he could put it, or words to that effect. Yet the very next morning the Government introduced what was apparently a piece of special case legislation and the Opposition opposed it. It would appear that in this instance the inconsistencies are anywhere but with my party. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has caused a great deal of interest because, as I said, it does point out the anomalies that exist amongst pension schemes for judges and those schemes which apply to everybody else. I agree that the courts need the best possible judges, although even when they get them they never seem to be able to agree amongst themselves. Sometimes they are forced to take a drop in salary. Nevertheless we do not believe that judges or for that matter their lesser brethren, lawyers, should receive any special consideration.

In fact, that is the purpose of the amendment I have moved to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. In doing this I have, as I said earlier, circulated for discussion purposes only details of a possible way of achieving it; that is, to consider judges, whose salaries are set by the same tribunal as those of members of parliament, in the same light as members of parliament when it comes to organising their superannuation scheme. The circulated document which honourable senators have before them tonight sets out a suggested scheme working on just that basis. It argues that the contribution rate of a judge who has held office for less than 10 years should be 11 1/2 per cent of the monthly amount of his salary, which is, in fact, what members of parliament contribute towards their own not ungenerous scheme, and that the contribution rate of a judge who has held office for more than 10 years should drop to 5 3/4 per cent of the monthly amount of his salary. Again, that is consistent with the varying amounts that members of parliament contribute according to the years they have been in office.

Furthermore, since there is within the parliamentary superannuation scheme provision for certain moneys to be paid to a member of parliament if, for one reason or another, he does not see out the prescribed period before being entitled to a pension, I have included in this suggested amendment something similar for judges; that is:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The same provision applies to a member of parliament who involuntarily leaves the service, if I can put it that way, before his or her time for getting a pension has arrived. However, I stress that this is only a suggestion. There must be other ways of approaching the task of arriving at some legislation that will make the judges' pension scheme a contributory one. It should also be possible to compare judges with senior public servants or, if the Government sees fit, to come up with some unique piece of legislation pertaining only to judges. However, it would seem appropriate to me that it be based on some existing precedent. I have selected one of those precedents. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no intention on the part of the Australian Democrats to oppose the amendment by the Government to lower the qualifying period for pro rata pensions from seven years to six years. I accept, as the Opposition now does, that it was not introduced specifically to pay off or satisfy a promise to a particular judge, that it was a genuine mistake on the part of the Federal Government. I am pleased to know that it is prepared to admit that it makes mistakes since it has a penchant for directing such accusations at everybody else-my party in particular.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I think I can manage to keep myself together. I would not agree with what Senator Haines said about Senator Evans making a long-winded speech tonight. In fact, I thought his speech was relatively to the point and was very moderate. I am sorry to see the lack of a unity ticket between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party spreading even to the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill. Nevertheless, I will say a few words about the argument raised because I think some ought to be replied to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans pointed out at the beginning of this debate that underlying the debate was some suggestion in regard to the non-contributory nature of judges' pensions. In fact, that has crept into the argument publicly and in respect of the debate that has taken place in both chambers. But, of course, this Bill is not about that. Non-contributory pensions have been in existence for some time. As is pointed out in the document which Senator Haines incorporated in Hansard tonight, there are non-contributory judges' pensions in practically all the States of Australia. That has been the tradition in regard to judicial pensions for some considerable time. My colleague Senator MacGibbon expressed the view that perhaps we should influence the States to change their view. I am amazed at the audacity of Senator MacGibbon, who comes from Queensland, in suggesting that the Commonwealth could persuade the State of Queensland to change its legislation in regard to its judges. I think we have to accept that the principle of non-contributory judges' pensions has been adopted for many years. I recognise that the Attorney-General has said that he will give some thought to the possibility of such pensions being made contributory. I will express some arguments as to why this should not be so. I certainly agree that it is a matter that ought to be looked at. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Haines" NAMEID="1H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator Haines</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even with the present compulsory retirement age, you still maintain it should not be contributory?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say even more strongly with the compulsory retirement age. Judges are different from people from most other walks of life. Persons who become Federal judges are generally persons who have been barristers for some years, who have established substantial practices in many cases, and who in the latter part of their professional lives become judges. They are not in the situation that one finds with many people in so many other walks of life who are for many years contributing to a contributory scheme. In this case judges will be expected to contribute for a much lesser period. The relative age at which people become judges is one reason. There is a lesser period in which they may serve, as we have introduced a compulsory retirement age of 70 years for most Federal judges and 65 years in the case of judges of the Family Court of Australia. There is a limited period in which judges will be expected to contribute either a substantial amount or a nominal amount. If the amount is nominal there is no reason why such a provision should be brought in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, we know that, if the Commonwealth is to obtain the services of judges of considerable eminence in their profession, it must get people who will give up a great deal of their practice and present income to become judges. Therefore, I think it is necessary that the judges be paid an equivalently reasonably high salary. To expect them now to give back part of that salary by way of the contribution suggested will, I think, make it more difficult for people to be persuaded to go on to the Bench. It is a fact that there is competition between the Commonwealth and the States to retain the best calibre for the Bench. In my opinion the Commonwealth ought to have the best calibre. Quite often in recent years we have seen that State judges are paid more than Commonwealth judges. I am not sure the difference is so accentuated at present, but until recent years the Chief Justice of Queensland was, I think, receiving more than the Chief Justice of Australia. The judges of Queensland are generally paid at a much higher rate than Federal judges. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it is natural that people will not very often be persuaded to leave their residences in a State where their friends, families and associations are, to go interstate, either to a court or a position that requires them to travel and where they will find the conditions are not so pleasant. Consequently, if the Commonwealth is to compete in obtaining the services of the best and most qualified lawyers in this country for the Bench, it must take into account the comparison of the conditions between the States. If all the States except Tasmania are in the process of providing non-contributory pensions, it would make things very difficult if the Commonwealth were to change its mind on this and force a contribution from judges. These are the arguments. By all means let us have a look at the whole situation, but I will take a great deal of convincing before I am persuaded that the Commonwealth ought to change its present conditions for judges. </PARA>
<PARA> There was not very much criticism, either in Senator Evans's speech or in any other debate in this chamber, of the provision in regard to the six years pro rata. In another place there has been some criticism of this provision by one of our more vocal back benchers and by the Labor spokesman on this matter. To my mind the provision is a reasonable one. It is true that the position of one judge, Mr Justice Marks-who I understand is a very popular and able judge and who is very much welcome to the Bench-was not included in the first provision and so the period was reduced to six years. But, as honourable senators know, most of the States have a five-year provision; so it is not as though this is a matter of considerable importance. I think it important that the Government acknowledged that there had been an oversight in regard to that particular judge and that it should make the provision that covers him also in these ranks. This is certainly the best way of doing it. A provision ought to be inserted in the statute. It should not be done, as I suppose it could have been, by some ex gratia payment or some other means whereby one could have made some contribution to take into account the situation. That is a very undesirable way to deal with the financial position of judges in this country. It should be done in the statutes of the country and not by ex gratia payments on the part of governments. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise the fact that we have recently imposed the restriction on judges of a younger retiring age. As one who advocated that action and was glad to see it come into operation, I note that it has the effect, particularly in regard to the Family Court, that in the early years of the operation of that court it has not been so easy, with the new judicial system and the new system of family law operating, to obtain the services of people greatly experienced in that area unless one selects some judges who are perhaps a little older than the average age of appointment. There have been cases where lawyers nearer the end of their careers have been appointed to that Bench. This step is welcomed. It has added to the field from which the Attorney-General has been able to appoint judges. But, at the same time, we should ensure, by the passage of this legislation, that such judges are not dealt with unjustly by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of his speech, Senator Evans referred to the relativities between the salaries of judges, one of the aspects dealt with in this Bill. The salaries of New Guinea judges have been linked to those of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. That comparison will be made. Senator Evans pointed out that the Family Court judges have not yet been treated on the same basis. I hope that will happen. Legislation amending the Family Law Act is yet to be debated in this Parliament. I would be surprised if, in the course of debating that legislation, this anomoly were not satisfactorily resolved. I think it is a matter of injustice at present that the basis on which Family Court judges salaries are determined is salaries of judges of the Australian Industrial Court, a court which is going out of existence, and not the Federal Court of Australia which has been brought in to replace it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say very much about what my colleague Senator MacGibbon said. He was making a case in respect of the contributory nature of pensions. Of course, this is a pension. It is described as a pension and that is an argument which I think we will hear more of at another time. I am pleased that Senator Haines incorporated the table which sets out the position in respect of judges in the States. I believe that she is right to point out that there should be no invidious distinction dealing with an individual judge. I think it is clear now that this Parliament will not do that. I suggest to Senator Haines that this Bill is not about the contribution or otherwise that is made. That is not the subject at this time. I believe that the various provisions that are made in this Bill are ones that desirably improve the situation of judges' pensions. A number of the provisions are well overdue and it is desirable that they should be incorporated now in the substantial legislation. For these reasons, I strongly support the legislation. </PARA>

However, I will say one or two things about that in my remarks. Certainly the level of debate in this chamber, as we normally expect to find, has been of a greatly superior nature to that in the other place. That is how it should be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret to say that I think members of parliament are well below that. I was a little surprised to find that Cabinet Ministers were a little higher in the pecking order than I expected them to be, but that is by the way. The fact is-I am trying to deal with the matter seriously-that both Federal and State judges in Australia are held in very high esteem. It is pleasing that they should be because the work they do and the role they play in the community is of the greatest importance. That is why I say that any subject which is dealt with in this chamber and which involves aspects of the judiciary or terms of service is of great importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not propose to describe this measure again. The details have been set out in my second reading speech and have been repeated to a large extent by Senator Evans in his speech. However, I do want to emphasise-I do not know whether this came across clearly-that the proposal for a pro rata pension which is contained in the legislation applies only where a judge is required to retire compulsorily before he or she has served a period of 10 years. This follows the constitutional amendment of 1977 which requires judges of the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia to retire at 70 years of age and judges of the Family Court of Australia to retire at 65 years. As a result of parliamentary enactment unrelated to the constitution, the deputy presidents-that is, the judicial members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-are also required to retire at 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The judges' pension scheme has been based, as indeed was the Public Service pension scheme, on a minimum of 10 years' service. Judges will still have to serve 10 years before qualifying for a pension. Indeed, they have to be over 60 years of age before they can qualify except in one case which this Bill proposes, that is, where they are forced to retire at 70 years as a result of constitutional amendment, they will be entitled to a pro rata pension provided they have served for six years. I do not think that this provision came out clearly in the debate, high though the level of the debate has been. I want to reiterate that the provision is applied only when judges are compulsorily retired before they have been able to serve the 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a bit of potted history about this measure, but I am afraid that it has not been entirely accurate. Certainly, Senator Evans's contribution to the history of the matter was totally inaccurate. I do not blame him for that because it arose out of some outlandish claims made by his opposite number in the House of Representatives, Mr Lionel Bowen, who claimed that he was the first person to raise the matter of pro rata pensions which he did, he said, in 1979. I do not doubt that he did. But the fact is, as I explained in the Senate on 8 March 1979 in answer to a question from former Senator Cavanagh, that in February 1978 the Government had decided upon certain amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act, which included the proposal for the pro rata pension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is revealed in this answer, I indicated in October 1977, when I offered Mr Justice McGregor an appointment to the Federal Court, that I believed this was a necessary result of the constitutional amendment which had been passed in July 1977. Those proposals were, in fact, formulated by me in 1978 and were similar to the State schemes. I proposed that there would be a similar scheme to that which applies in the States where the qualifying period for a pro rata pension-this is the case in three States-is five years. It was always my view that we should be on all fours with the States and there should be a five-year minimum qualifying period. As was also revealed in the answer to the question, I did run, probably not surprisingly, into some political difficulties in getting that legislation into the Parliament. It is only this year that the matter has been reactivated. In view of the difficulties which had arisen earlier, I decided that it might perhaps mollify certain opponents of the measure if a longer qualifying period were selected. Seven years was thought to be adequate but then we ran into a problem, which has now become well known, in relation to one judge. The proposed period is now six years. However, I want to emphasise that in my opinion, and in conformity with the States, there is a very sound case for the period being five years, but that is by the way. I only mention that because the history of the matter has been raised here. I hope that has put the record straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans mentioned the question of relativities between judges of the Family Court, the Federal Court and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I can assure him and the Senate-Senator Missen also raised the matter-that this has given me a good deal of concern. I have taken up the matter with the Remuneration Tribunal in the last two years in the hope that the Tribunal might rectify the position. I believe the Family Court judges have a very sound case, particularly some of the senior judges who were appointed at the commencement of the Family Court. They were given very specific undertakings and accepted appointment on the basis that legislation would provide clear relativity. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the policy of the Government that the remuneration of judges, as is the case with members of parliament, senior public servants and so on, should be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and not by legislative fiat. Up until now I have been endeavouring to rectify the problem in accordance with that policy. But as we now are left with the problem, I realise that it will probably only be possible to rectify it by legislation. I hope-the Government has not yet made any firm decisions on the matter so I cannot announce them-that by the time we come to debate the Family Law Amendment Bill next year I will have some proposals. </PARA>

I hope I will have some additional proposals to make in relation to this matter. Obviously, the majority of the Family Court judges would not be on par with the Federal Court judges. They never were. There have always been two categories of Family Court judges-the senior judges and the others. It was only the senior judges who had, at one time, relativity. I have been discussing this matter particularly with the Chief Judge. I have had discussions with other judges of the Court. I am well aware of the problem and I hope that next year I will have some proposals which will solve it. I think I have really covered all the matters regarding the Bill that I wanted to raise. However, Senator Haines on behalf of the Australian Democrats has moved an amendment stating:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>', but the Senate is of the opinion that the establishment of a contributory superannuation scheme for judges should be investigated.'</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans has indicated his support for that amendment and so has Senator MacGibbon who sits on this side. Indeed, Senator Missen has supported the investigation of the matter. I have already indicated in the second reading speech that I propose to look at the matter. It has been in other places and in another place before our debate took place today. I have certainly been giving the matter some thought. Indeed, I have, in fact, had some preliminary discussions about it with the Chief Judge of the Family Court quite recently. I have not pursued the matter with other judges as yet but I have certainly asked officers of my Department to investigate it immediately. I have no problem whatever in supporting, on behalf of the Government, the amendment Senator Haines has moved. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have given in the second reading speech I think there are a lot of arguments against a contributory scheme. I do not want to indicate for one minute that I will be readily accepting it. I think there are major arguments against it. I think there are major problems in its path, not the least of which is the Constitution. There is a very specific provision in the Constitution about judicial remuneration and there are limitations on the ability of the Parliament to diminish judicial remuneration. </PARA>

The position is that there are many difficulties and there are not many precedents for such a scheme. In fact, as Senator Haines has recognised, there is only the Tasmanian scheme in Australia. We want to look at what happens in Britain and the United States as well as in Australia. I propose to have the investigation and to put down a discussion paper in the Parliament as soon as it has been completed. We can then have a basis for public debate about the matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The primary objective of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to introduce new provisions for the valuation of imported goods for Customs duty purposes. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill and I will spend only a few minutes explaining why. New valuation procedures contained in the Bill are designed to give effect to the agreement on the implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I simply hope that the Government, in attaching itself to GATT again in this way, will demonstrate through its senior Ministers slightly more appreciation of the nature of those obligations than seems to have been the case in other contexts in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Presently, Customs valuation is based on what is known as the Brussels Definition of Value-the BDV-which provides for the valuation of imported goods on an essentially notional basis by comparing each actual transaction with an ideal transaction in which all the circumstances conform with an entirely open market or an arms length situation. The proposed new system differs from the present one in that it is a positive system, using the actual prices and charges paid to arrive at a dutiable value for Customs purposes. The primary new method of valuation contained in this legislation is the actual transaction value, that in turn being measured by the free-on-board price actually payable for imported goods when they are sold for export to the country of importation-in this case Australia-after certain defined adjustments have been made to that price. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, however, the transaction value of the imported goods cannot be used as the basis for valuation there is a whole sequence of five alternative methods of valuation provided in the legislation. If these methods fail to establish a value for Customs purposes there is a provision in the agreement which is reflected in the legislation in proposed new sub-section 157 (8) for the Comptroller-General of Customs to determine the value. The legislative package, quite complicated as it is, nonetheless appears to be exactly in acordance with the Customs valuation code agreed to at the Tokyo round of GATT. The Australian Labor Party sees a potential disadvantage in the new valuation system to the extent that it could certainly involve greater administrative burdens upon importers who have to adapt to these new procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> But we nonetheless support the Bill because of three even more obvious advantages. In the first place the valuation system proposed is internationally agreed and therefore not only contributes, by virtue of that international agreement, to the promotion of trade between nations but also ensures that there is not a proliferation of different valuation systems operating in the major trading nations which, to the extent that this happens, can of course result in a number of unfair valuation methods being applied as artificial barriers to trade. The second advantage of the new system is that it is clearly going to be capable of easier administration by the Collector of Customs. Thirdly-I suppose this relates to the second point-it is an objective rather than subjective measurement of value. </PARA>
<PARA> We do, of course, have some concern that any changes to the valuation system should not result in a reduction of tariffs by stealth following from the fact that any method of valuation that artificially lowers the valuation at which goods are assessed will lower thereby the actual duty payable on them and can produce a situation accordingly of lowering the tariff payable. In this respect we accept the Government's assurances, clearly made in the other place by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) and to some extent in the second reading speech, that the new code will be closely monitored, that it will not have any widespread consequences for the level of tariff assistance and that the Industries Assistance Commission or the Temporary Assistance Authority will investigate if any problems do arise. It is clear that many members of the Government parties believe that the tariffs should be cut, either as an article of almost biblical faith or at least as a response to the massive capital inflow we are experiencing, one hopes temporarily. But, as our spokesman on industry and commerce, Mr Chris Hurford, and others of us have repeatedly said, we reject the notion that Australian manufacturing industry should be dismantled to make way for that inflow. That is to get the priorities totally end-about. In the situation before us tonight, however, I do not want to embark upon a major discussion in any way of--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes this reforming measure. It is very pleasing to see that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has returned to the chamber. He will be able to go overseas tomorrow with his reputation untarnished as one of the reforming Attorneys that this Commonwealth has produced. It may surprise people to hear that commendation falling from the lips of an Opposition senator, but this is a reforming measure of some significance. I speak of the Bill entitled 'A Bill for an Act relating to Domicile'. On the surface it seems to be a very dry and technical subject. The domicile there referred to is not the simple matrimonial home but is a legal concept, a sort of link word, which bridges the distance between a person and a system of law. It links any particular Australian to a system of law which might determine his or her matrimonial status, capacity to make wills or whatever. This measure was decided upon within the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I understand that similar legislation has been passed or introduced into all the other Australian parliaments, both State and Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it has been introduced into that Parliament, according to the Attorney's second reading speech. The point is that we are concerned with establishing rules governing questions arising in relation to laws of the Commonwealth and in relation to certain Territories, such as the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay. We are here making a law which will override or exclude any competing law passed by any State parliament or put forward by any State or Territory court within Australia or, indeed, overseas. In other words, we are acting as an Australian parliament in order to make clear what the law of domicile shall be for the future in Australia. The mere fact that this has been agreed upon by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General might lead some cynics to conclude that in fact we are dealing with law of a very dull and technical kind. I repeat that, though the title of the Bill might suggest such, we are dealing here with a reforming Bill of a sweeping and fundamental kind because it overturns some six centuries of common law whereby the domicile of a wife always followed that of her husband.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been the case, as far as my research has been able to discover, since Bracton's day and certainly since the thirteenth century that a wife's domicile always slavishly followed that of her husband for the purpose of determining what jurisdiction she should go to in relation to matrimonial affairs or her capacity to make wills or dispose of personal property. One uses the words 'slavishly followed that of her husband' quite deliberately. They are apt words because there was a situation of servitude of the wife to the husband. That grew, of course, out of the concept that upon marriage the husband and wife were one. But there was always then the rider that the one was the husband. The law of unity was always in favour of the husband. The Bill asserts the independent integrity of the woman in a marriage situation insofar as she can make an independent choice of the law of domicile which will govern the jurisdiction to which she might resort in the case of marital breakdown or deal with the making of a will or whatever situation occurs in that type of personal law. </PARA>
<PARA> We are engaged in a quite important project. The Bill generalises a position which has been reached under the Family Law Act already within federal parliamentary statutes. It makes general this particular principle of abolishing the dependence of the wife on the husband for her legal status before the courts. It must be the right principle to abolish that particular aspect of servitude which has lingered over the centuries. From now on the wife's own choice of residence will determine the correct jurisdiction for the determination of matters relating to her personal property or status. I give some examples that come to mind. If a couple were married in the United Kingdom, migrated to Australia, marital discord ensued and the husband went to the United States, under the common law rules the woman might well find that rather than the law of Australia governing the dissolution of the marriage the law of the United States, where she has never set foot, would determine the matter because her domicile would be that of her husband. That situation has been overcome in the Family Law Act and now, in a more general way, is being overcome in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation goes further than that and brings the law of domicile into a more realistic relationship to the present situation within Australian society in a whole range of matters. As one would expect with a principle of common law which was developed six centuries ago, it sits very awkwardly with the type of society which has evolved in Australia. Let me give some examples. Our population is characterised by high mobility where people move from States to State. At present, if a migrant came to Australia and perhaps worked in the construction industry and moved around from State to State it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for a court to determine in which State of Australia that person had his domicile for the purpose of deciding under which State law relating to wills or the passing of property, if that person died without making a will, the matter should be governed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes it clear in clause 11 that a person who moves around within the Australian Federation from State to State in a way which makes it difficult to determine that the person has formed a settled intention to reside indefinitely in any one State rather than another is to be regarded as domiciled in the State with which he has, for the time being, the closest connection. In that way many of the difficulties which apparently are of a technical nature but of a very real nature are overcome. I have already given the example of a construction worker who moves from State to State in the course of seeking employment and who finds it impossible to ascertain under which State law he should make his will. This legislation very neatly deals with that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also enables a person of the age of 18 or over to acquire an independent domicile; that is, an intention to reside in a particular place independent of that of the parents of the person who has attained 18 years of age. This merely brings the law into harmony with the social mores in Australia which say that a person who attains 18 years of age has, for all purposes relating to participation in democratic life or for the purpose of accepting legal responsibilities and liabilities, attained that status. It occurred to me that perhaps the age ought to be 16 years because a female who is 16 or 17 years of age has the right to marry quite independently of judicial or parental permission. That does not apply to the male, but it certainly applies to the female. It is a fact that the Bill is drawn in a way which permits a married person under 18 to acquire a domicile of choice quite independently of the parents, and in the case of the wife, now, even of the husband, although commonly the domicile will of course be that of the husband where the married couple lives together. But why the Bill has not been drafted in a way which allows a domicile of choice, an independent domicile, to be acquired by an Australian on attaining the age of 16 years seems to me to be somewhat odd when, as I say, a female certainly can attain a married status without any judicial or parental intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, having said that, it is good to see within the legislation a recognition of the fact that on attaining 18 years of age, as in the exercise of all other democratic and legal rights, a person ought to be able to acquire a domicile of choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That depends on the various State or Territory jurisdictions. To be honest I would not know what the overall answer is for Australia. Perhaps the Attorney-General will enlighten us on that point when he replies. I thank the honourable senator for raising that important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The importance of the Bill in relation to that aspect is that of course the 17 year old boy leaving Tasmania to go to Victoria to undertake his apprenticeship is not, under this legislation, able to acquire a domicile of choice in Victoria. If the law there were more favourably drafted in a way which would enable him to exercise greater legal rights in Victoria than Tasmania he would not be able to take advantage of that, say, in relation to the making of a will. Let us presume that in Tasmania a person below the age of 18 could not make a will, but in Victoria a person between the ages of 16 and 18 could. On going to Victoria, under this Bill an apprentice would not be able to take advantage of the Victorian law, which seems to me to be somewhat odd. That is the point I was trying to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also recognises another less pleasing feature of Australian life but it is a reality of Australian life that where one has growing numbers of couples who are separated or divorced and the custody of children is awarded to only one of the parents naturally, then, it is clearly inappropriate that the common law rules should apply whereby the domicile of the father is automatically the domicile of the child or, to put it the other way, that the domicile of the child is automatically the domicile of the father even though that child may be living with the mother in her residence. This Bill makes it very clear that the child should have the domicile of the parent with whom he or she has his or her permanent home. That is a straight-forward common-sense amendment which is to be welcomed. The Bill also makes it clear that an adopted child is now to be treated by the law in every respect as if he had been born to the adopter or the adopting parents. Accordingly the domicile of an adopted child under 18 years of age will be determined as if he were the legitimate child of his adopted parents or parent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the central reforming task of this Bill. It generalises those steps already taken under the Family Law Act. It places a married woman in the same position as any other Australian citizen or Australian resident of mature age and sound mind. It enables her to acquire a domicile of choice independent of that of her husband. If, for example, a couple were separated and the wife moved, say, to South Australia-the husband remaining in Victoria-under the common law, the State which governed the making of a will by that woman would be that of Victoria. Now the law relating to that matter will be that of South Australia. In other words, it will be the law of the place where she has taken up residence and evinced some intention to remain indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> In placing a woman in the same position as all other citizens, one removes that constraint of servility, that slavish dependence upon the husband, which has been a carry-over of the common law attitude of six centuries ago, whereby the husband and wife were one, but the husband was 'the one'. The legislation recognises the independent personality and integrity of the female partner in a marriage relationship, in a fairly technical area of our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the technical matter of intention-if I may just conclude on this note-the Bill does change slightly the common law. As I recall it, the common law generally required that an intention to reside permanently be evinced. Whilst that was modified-a modification that was somewhat accepted-so that if one evinced an intention to reside indefinitely in a place that was sufficient, the Bill makes it very clear that that will be sufficient intention, coupled with evidence of residence. That requirement is not as easy to satisfy as might appear. For example, if a Tasmanian moves to the north west of Western Australia with the intention of working there for six years in order to save money and return to Tasmania, having made his fortune up in the Pilbara, the question is: Has that person evinced an intention to live indefinitely in Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> If I may give a more difficult example, a refugee may come to Australia with an intention in the back of his mind that, if political conditions in the country from which he has fled permit, he will return, given favourable conditions in his homeland. Has such a person, in coming to Australia, formed such a frame of mind that one could say there had been an acquisition by him of Australia as a domicile of choice? In that situation, are the Vietnamese refugees able to take advantage of our system of law. Or, if there is an intention on their part to return to Vietnam if conditions prove favourable, are they still bound in matters relating to their marriages, and perhaps the making of wills, by Vietamese law? That is just a matter of interest, involving a difficult matter of evidence which might come before the courts in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the Bill. We believe that, despite its rather dry and technical appearance, it is part of a very fundamental reform of our legal processes which does recognise the independent personality of women, in particular those women who are married but do not want to be totally and automatically subservient in their legal relationship to the legal status of their husband. For that reason, the Opposition welcomes the Bill and wishes it a speedy passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are debating tonight the Domicile Bill 1981 and the Domicile (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1981, the major measure, of course, being the former. This is a particularly sensible and not insignificant piece of legislation, both for women and for children, as Senator Tate has already mentioned, since it ends a number of outdated provisions relating to the domicile of certain groups of women and children in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is particularly important for women, of course, since it now enshrines in law a woman's right to independent domicile from her husband. It gives her in effect a choice with regard to domicile that did not exist previously. In fact, it is depressing to know that, for some 600 years, a wife's domicile was determined wholly and solely by that of her husband. It is, contrary to what Senator Tate maintains, exciting to note that, in his second reading speech the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) makes this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly no longer appropriate that a wife's domicile should automatically be the same as that of her husband. </PARA>
<PARA>I heartily endorse that statement and, in doing so, have the support of the rest of my party. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, this Bill now removes the stigma of chattlehood from married women-a state to which Senator Tate referred as a form of slavery. The law finally has managed to catch up with some aspects of twentieth century social moves and the Attorney-General is to be applauded for that. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, it is interesting to note that some years ago the then Premier of South Australia, Don Dunstan, and his second wife, asserted their rights to retain not only their own names after marriage but also to independence of domicile. They argued that they were individuals and, furthermore, independent units; that they operated better in that way; and that they had the right to behave and to be treated as independent units. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not seem to matter to most people whether the domicile is down the street, in the next suburb, in another city or in another State or country. The principle of independence surely is what counts. I forget offhand now just how close their home bases were but the point they made is a valid one. It is enshrined on a more general basis in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clause which grants 18-year-olds the right to independent domicile is a similarly sensible one, bearing in mind other modern laws which Senator Tate mentioned, on the legal voting age in particular, and the age at which males, if not females, can be married. Senator Tate raised an interesting point about women being entitled to marry, without parental or court interference, at the age of 16. However, I do not share his apparent opinion that that justifies dropping the age to 16 for everybody, since the marital situation is covered separately. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, it seems to me that the Bill ends a number of very discriminatory practices, not the least of which is that of defining a child's domicile according to the marital status of the parents. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, made this further point:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the common law rules relating to domicile, a child born in wedlock aquires the domicile of his father while an illegitimate child has the domicile of the mother. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to make the further statement:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate--</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate, certainly not in this day and age-</PARA>
<PARA>that a child should automatically have the domicile of one parent if the parents are separated and the child is in fact permanently living with the other parent. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Bill provides that in such a situation the child has the domicile of the parent with whom he-or, I presume, she-has his or her principal home. That is an infinitely more sensible arrangement than has applied previously. In fact, in its entirety, this is a sensible Bill, a modern Bill, one which accepts that common law should come under scrutiny according to changing social needs and be amended, where necessary. I commend the Attorney-General for bringing the Bill forward at this time and support, and in fact applaud, the measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to what Senator Haines said, I do not commend the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) for bringing this legislation forward at this time. The reason for that, without canvassing the merits or otherwise of the Bill, is that I understood the package of Bills listed under Notices of Motion on the Senate Notice Paper of Tuesday, 20 October, would be left to lie on the table for wide consideration by the community and for debate in the next session of Parliament. The Attorney-General gave five notices of motion. Notice of Motion No. 1 seeks leave to introduce a Bill for an Act to amend the Family Law Act 1981. Notice of Motion No. 2 seeks leave to introduce a Bill for an Act to amend the Maintenance Orders (Commonwealth Officers) Act 1966. Notice of Motion No. 3 seeks leave to introduce a Bill for an Act to amend the Migration Act 1958. Notice of Motion No. 4 seeks leave to introduce a Bill for an Act relating to domicile. Notice of Motion No. 5 seeks leave to introduce a Bill for an Act to amend the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975 in consequence of the enactment of the Domicile Act 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, many of the matters and clauses that are contained in the Domicile Bill are quite sensible. I am a bit concerned about the glib phrase 'modern social attitudes'-whatever they are-used in the Minister's second reading speech. That type of phrase was used by the previous Attorney-General, former Senator Murphy, in respect of the Family Law Act and the liberalisation of family law in Australia. Quite frankly-and I make no bones about this-the 'liberalisation' of the Family Law Act in Australia has inflicted untold cruelty and misery on many thousands of Australian women particularly in respect of the no fault aspect of that legislation. Many of us have received representations from women in great distress because their husbands had simply opted out of their responsibilities by using the period of separation as a precondition for divorce. </PARA>

What right does she have under this piece of legislation? What right does this legislation give to a woman, in the event of a divorce being forced upon her by reason of separation under the Family Law Act, in respect of an entitlement to the cut up of the property of both domiciles? These are the sorts of things that ought to be given consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate dealt with the definition of 'independent domicile'. He also dealt with the definition of 'domicile' in respect of the part of the union. This is the first time I have heard Australia, or any part of Australia, referred to as the union. I suppose that is fair enough. Those matters seem to be eminently sensible. However, as I said, I believe the legislation before us is part of a group of measures relating to family law and marriage matters and that we would be given time to consider the legislation. I frankly admit that I have not had time to study the legislation in the manner I would have liked. I hope that the Attorney-General takes cognisance of that and at least allows the legislation to lay on the table for some further period. Unless he can provide the Senate with some indication as to why this piece of legislation ought to be pushed through this session he ought to follow this course. I am concerned about the possible ramifications of this Bill. I hope that the Minister will understand that and allow the Bill, if possible, to lay on the table for some further period, as he has allowed the other Bills to lay on the table, so as to allow wide ranging public debate and consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not kidding; that is right. It has taken many years for this legislation to come to light. The fact of the matter is that-this may be of some assurance to Senator Harradine who is concerned about the haste of the measure-it is certainly not a measure that has been dreamt up by me and introduced into this place overnight. It is the result of very lengthy consideration by all the State Attorneys-General. In fact, it has been going on for so long that many more Attorneys than the existing ones have had a finger in the pie. Finally agreement was reached some time ago and each of us undertook to introduce and pass, if we could, this measure in our own parliaments. In fact, the Commonwealth is lagging behind in this exercise at this stage because similar legislation has been passed in all the other States except, I think, Western Australia, although it has been introduced into the Western Australian Parliament. I think this is the last of the parliaments in which legislation has been introduced. There is a certain urgency about it because I had undertaken to get this introduced and I had hoped to get it through the Parliament as soon as possible so that we would be able to get the benefits of uniformity. That is the reason why it is being pressed on with during this session. It has been categorised by the Government in its program as being legislation for passage this session. I am sorry it has been rushed on a little earlier than it would othewise have been, Senator Harradine, but because I am going overseas at the end of this week I wanted to get the measure through before I left. However, it has still got to be introduced and debated in another place and before that occurs there will be time for any last minute consideration which the honourable senator or anybody else wishes to give it. However, the matters which have been introduced here, I think, have been overwhelmingly supported by the Senate. I doubt very much whether, after all the consideration and the widespread support it has had in this place, any problems are likely to be found with the legislation by delaying its passage through this Parliament any longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I introduced the five different Bills into the Senate yesterday, notice of which had been given last Thursday, I placed before the Senate a specific motion to make clear what the family law package of legislation was. Those Bills are listed in that package. They are listed quite separately on the Notice Paper. There was a separate motion which made up the package of the two domicile Bills. So I fail to see how there could be any misunderstanding created by me that it was ever intended that this domicile package would be part of the family law package. However, I am sorry if that misunderstanding has occurred but I do not think the Senate should hold up the passage of this legislation which, as I have said, is widely supported in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the particular matter that is worrying Senator Harradine-he asked what effect the new provisions might have on a wife who had been deserted by her husband who had gone to another country. He asked what effect that would have on her maintenance and custody rights and so on. I can assure Senator Harradine that it will have no effect whatsoever in reducing her rights whatever they may be under any Australian laws. In fact, the provisions might assist her as she does retain her Australian domicile even though her husband may have gone somewhere else and acquired another domicile. Insofar as domicile may be relevant to the determination of those rights about which the honourable senator is concerned, the wife would retain her Australian domicile in whatever State of Australia her domicile may be. So I really do not think the honourable senator need be concerned about those sorts of matters. If there are any other particular concerns that the honourable senator would like to make known to me I will have them checked out before the Bills are passed through the House of Representatives. I hope the Bills will have a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to clause 8 of the Domicile Bill. I would like to take up the matter that I raised earlier concerning the fact, which is welcomed, that under this Bill a person is capable of having an independent domicile if the has attained the age of 18 years or he is or has at any time been married and not otherwise. I raised the point that a 16-year-old or a 17-year-old female can marry without the consent of either parent or any particular court. It seems to me that certainly within that sphere of law there is a recognition of the independent status of females of 16 or 17 years of age. I am wondering why it ought not to be recognised in this Bill that a young Australian person of 16 or 17 ought to be able to acquire an independent domicile. We live in a society in which young people do leave home perhaps at the conclusion of their high school education; upon taking up employment or seeking employment; because of marital stress or family breakdown; or for any other reason and they are not residing with their parents in the parental home or with either parent if indeed the parents are separated. In that situation where a 16-year-old or 17-year-old Australian is living in a State other than that in which the parents live, why should not that person be able to acquire an independent domicile? It would seem to me to be in harmony with that feature of Australian life to which I have drawn attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the matter raised by Senator Tate is that this is a uniform Bill and it was the decision of all the Attorneys that this provision of 18 years of age rather than any earlier age for a female should be the one adopted. I would not want to change that unless there was some overwhelming reason. In any event, I would not change it here before raising the matter again with the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, and I am sure the honourable senator would not want me to do that. It would throw the whole thing back into confusion. The capacity of a female to marry at an age earlier than 18 years is a specific provision of the Marriage Act. Here we are dealing with general provisions, whereas that is a specific provision. I think that really is a rather special case. Uniformly in Australia 18 years has now been selected as the age of majority, as against the former age of 21 years. For the purposes of the domicile legislation, I think we should adopt the same general rule.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) mentioned in his reply at the second reading stage of the Bill that the rights of people under quite a number of laws will be affected by this Bill. I found the second reading speech to be inadequate as to details of what laws of the Commonwealth would be affected by this legislation being passed. As a corollary to that I ask: Were the Parliament not to pass this Bill at this stage, what effect would that have? In other words, what pieces of legislation would be affected? Would it affect only the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act in the Federal jurisdiction? As I understand it, matters relating to wills and so on are matters of State law?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot give the chamber a schedule of all the Acts of the Commonwealth that refer to domicile. Wherever the word 'domicile' appears in legislation and there is not a special definition of it, the Domicile Bill will apply. A good example is the Income Tax Assessment Act, which defines 'resident' or 'resident of Australia' as a person who resides in Australia and includes a person whose domicile is in Australia. The word 'domicile' there will be interpreted in accordance with the Domicile Act. Certainly the laws relating to the making of wills, marriages and so on tend to have specific provisions about age rather than talk about domicile.

We have said that we will join in passing this uniform legislation so that throughout Australia, in both Federal and State jurisdictions, the word 'domicile' has the same meaning. I really am anxious to keep faith with the States. As Senator Evans has said, it has been a long process in reaching this agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes Amendment Bill 1981 makes a number of important and innovative changes to the law governing the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders. Commonwealth offenders are those who commit offences under the laws of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. Indeed, to the extent that it seeks to implement progressive reforms in the sentencing area, we welcome it. But the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will be relieved nonetheless to hear that we have not entirely changed our spots and we certainly do not support the Bill unreservedly. There are a number of matters in respect of which we will be moving amendments at the Committee stage; one or two of those matters I will foreshadow towards the end of this speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill must be seen in the context of the Australian Law Reform Commission report on which most of it is based. As the Attorney indicated in his second reading speech, the question of the sentencing of Federal offenders was the subject of a reference to the Law Reform Commission on 11 August 1978. The Commission, led in this instance, as usual, by Mr Justice Kirby, who was assisted in the context of this reference by Professor Duncan Chappell, an internationally known criminologist, completed a hefty 636-page interim report in January 1980, following the usual very intensive consultative procedure. Not only did the Law Reform Commission engage in widespread consultation, public hearings and so on around the country with written submissions and the appointment of specialist consultants, but also it conducted a number of special surveys of judges, magistrates, prosecutors, Federal prisoners and public opinion generally which produced a quite unique body of survey material which the Commission was able to utilise and which constitutes a good deal of the bulk of this very bulky Law Reform Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was tabled in the Federal Parliament on 21 May 1980. It contained two draft Bills as well as 129 specific recommendations. Most of them were of a final kind but a number of them were expressed to be of an exploratory, tentative or interim character. Indeed, the Commission indicated that this was very much an interim report and that much of the subject matter of it should be the subject of community debate plus further attention by the Commission before it would be shaped up in the form of legislative recommendations. But the Commission did specify two steps in particular as being urgent. This is contained in the report tabled in May 1980. It was in respect of those two matters that the Commission supplied draft legislation to concentrate the mind of the Government. The two matters were, firstly, the establishment of an adequate Commonwealth victims compensation scheme and, secondly, provisions to give guidance in the use of imprisonment in the case of convicted Federal offenders and also to facilitate the use of non-custodial sentencing options where appropriate for persons convicted of offences against Commonwealth law. It is now October 1981 and I suppose we should be grateful that only 17 months have elapsed since the report was tabled and that at least one of the two urgent steps has been taken in this Bill, that is, the provisions in this Bill relating to the sentencing of Federal offenders and non-custodial options and the pecuniary penalties associated with fining. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter recommended as urgent, the crimes compensation machinery for Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory jurisdictions, remains, so far as the Government's intentions are concerned, quite an unknown quantity. It is a serious indictment, as one is obliged to say so often, of this Government-which promised, I seem to recall, in August 1979 that legislation was to be drafted in respect of this matter-that two years later we still have not got anything at all. The urgent step which has, albeit tardily and finally, been taken is that, as I said, concerning the sentencing of Federal offenders. It must, however, be said that this Bill goes further than the Law Reform Commission draft Bill in a number of respects and it does implement a number of the other ALRC recommendations which were not set up in legislative form and which were expressed to be not as urgent as others. I suppose this is what in the mind of the Attorney-General justifies the 17-month delay in the introduction of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, before dealing with the most important specific provisions of the Bill, I think it is important to draw attention to the general recommendations of the Commission about sentencing reform. At the outset, I think I should read the Principles of Punishment which are articulated by the Commission in its Summary of Recommendations 1, 2 and 3, based on paragraphs 66 and 67 of the report. First of all, it expressed the general rationale of punishment in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> No single rationale of punishment can or should predominate in guiding reform of Commonwealth laws concerning sentencing. Punishment may, in varying degrees, take into account elements such as deterrence, the denunciation of abhorrent behaviour, the reinforcement of community moral and ethical values and, perhaps with less confidence than in the past and within limits required by just deserts, reformation of the offender and his restoration to society. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Punishment for persons convicted of Federal offences should, as far as possible, be certain, consistent and proportional to the gravity of the crime for which the offender is being sentenced. The principle of economy in the imposition of punishment, which limits the amount of punishment imposed to the minimum necessary to achieve community objectives, should also be observed. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, and finally, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> So far as is consistent with social protection, preference should be given to the use of non-custodial sentencing options and the use of such options should be facilitated by reform of Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the philosophy which guides the recommendations of the Commission and which seems, within certain limitations which it is necessary to deal with later, guides the philosophy of the Government in accepting those recommendations. It is important to note also that the Commission placed particular emphasis on uniform treatment of Federal offenders when it said, in recommendation 16 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth laws should implement the principle that offenders against the laws of the Commonwealth should be treated as uniformly as possible throughout Australia. Commonwealth laws and procedures which hinder the achievement of uniformity should be changed to bring them into accord with this principle even if doing so results, for a time, in differences in the way in which Commonwealth and local offenders are treated within a State or Territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Might I simply say that the Opposition endorses very strongly that principle as being an essential requirement of a fair and equal criminal justice system. I add that to aid in the achievement of uniformity and consistency the Law Reform Commission did make some quite specific recommendations, the status of which in the Government's mind again we remain quite uncertain about. Rather than canvassing those matters in any detail now, might I simply seek leave to incorporate in Hansard these recommendations under the three headings: Firstly, Sentencing Council of Australia; secondly, Sentencing Guidelines; and, thirdly, Machinery to Achieve Uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Sentencing Council of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> 21. Establishment. A new and authoritative body should be established by the Commonwealth with the mandate not only to gather information about the existing sentencing practices of the courts as they concern Federal offences and offenders but also to review these sentencing practices, and in the light of the review to issue guidelines for judicial officers involved in the sentencing of Federal offenders. The body which should conduct the review and disseminate guidelines, as well as perform a number of other functions, is the Sentencing Council of Australia. Such a national Sentencing Council should be established by legislation. There is undoubted power in the Commonwealth to establish such a Council and it should do so by legislation without delay. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 441)</PARA>
<PARA> 24. Functions. The functions of the Sentencing Council should be provided for in Commonwealth legislation and should include in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> The review of present sentencing practices concerning Federal offences and offenders and the development of non-mandatory sentencing guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 185, 190, 446, 448)</PARA>
<PARA> The review of present charging and prosecution practices as they affect Federal offences and offenders and the development of policy guidelines in regard to these practices, including plea negotiations affecting Federal offenders. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 105, 126, 451)</PARA>
<PARA> The review of existing statutory penalties provided in Commonwealth law concerning Federal offences. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 194, 428, 452)</PARA>
<PARA> The monitoring of minimum standards for the treatment of Federal prisoners and offenders in State and Territory institutions and otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 257, 453)</PARA>
<PARA> The development of guidelines in relation to parole, including, if parole is abolished, the consequential changes to sentencing practices relating to Federal offenders. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 340, 350, 450)</PARA>
<PARA> The provision of various services to judicial officers including the development of studies in sentencing and the supply of detailed statistics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Sentencing Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA> 25. Study of Sentencing Practices and Development of Guidelines. The Sentencing Council should initiate a study of sentencing practices throughout Australia affecting offences and offenders. Based on this study, the Council should develop and disseminate to all judicial officers involved in the sentencing of Federal offenders in Australia detailed information on Federal criminal matters, including a set of broad guidelines indicating the range of penalties that might be applied for specific categories of Federal offences and offenders. These guidelines should not be prescriptive, but should be intended and designed to assist rather than coerce the exercise of judicial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 446)</PARA>
<PARA>(c) Machinery to Achieve Uniformity</PARA>
<PARA> 60. General Approach. Greater guidance should be given to judicial officers sentencing convicted Federal offenders. A more scientific and principled approach should be adopted which retains the best elements of judicial independence and discretion but incorporates institutions, information and procedures which encourage rationality, consistency, publicity and general uniformity of punishment for like offences. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 402)</PARA>
<PARA> 61. Three Targets of Reform. Three broad areas of reform are required to guide judicial discretion in a way which will lead to a reduction in disparities in the sentencing of offenders convicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth whilst not removing a proper degree of judicial discretion in sentencing. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of more appropriate and consistent penalties in legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of a new right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia in Federal criminal matters; and</PARA>
<PARA> the establishment of a Sentencing Council to review existing sentencing practices and to publish sentencing guidelines and statistical and other data for the guidance of judicial officers who sentence convicted Federal offenders in Australia (see rec. 21 above). </PARA>
<PARA> 65. Appeals to the Federal Court of Australia. If uniform and consistent national principles of punishment for Federal offences and offenders are to be attained by the traditional method of appeal court review there should be a court, below the High Court of Australia, which reviews Federal sentences. This court should be the Federal Court of Australia, which already has a limited criminal jurisdiction in specialised areas and more generally hears appeals against the conviction and sentence from Territorial courts. The Federal Court should also hear appeals brought against conviction and sentence from decisions of the various State Supreme Courts and intermediate courts in the case of persons convicted and sentenced of offences against laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 435)</PARA>
<PARA> 66. Power to Transfer to State Courts. The Federal Court should be empowered to transfer a case to a State Supreme Court if it considers that the case would more appropriately and conveniently be dealt with by the State Court. The exercise of such a transfer would ensure avoidance of unwarranted multiple hearings or any abuse of the appeals process, particularly in the case of conviction for both Federal and State offences. </PARA>
<PARA>(Para. 439)</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These recommendations are clearly all in themselves major reforms. They are all reforms which are eminently capable of implementation. The key point-this is one that the Opposition wants to emphasise-is that sentencing reform cannot be achieved piecemeal. If the objectives of uniformity, consistency and priority to non-custodial sentences are really to be achieved, the other parts of the Law Reform Commission package must be pressed vigorously. They do not involve great expense. They do not involve dislocation of the existing system. They are essential if any reforms in this area are to be effective. If the process stops, as I fear it might, with this particular Bill, the efforts of the Law Reform Commission will, to a very large extent, have been wasted. Then the recommendations of the Commission that this whole subject be an occasion for a major national debate on sentencing issues and criminology generally will be rendered nugatory. I would appreciate it if the Attorney-General, in his reply on this second reading debate, would give a fairly precise indication of what exactly his intentions are so far as these various mooted complementary reforms are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two further reforms which I have not mentioned but which were also the subject of the Law Reform Commission's proposals and which do form part of its overall approach to sentencing law and procedures. Again, rather than canvassing these matters in nauseous detail at this stage might I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the relevant extracts from the Law Reform Commission report, this time under two headings: Firstly, Parole Abolition or Reform, and, secondly, Reform of Prison Conditions and Prisoner Grievance Procedures. I seek leave accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Parole abolition or reform</PARA>
<PARA> A second major proposal of this report relates to the abolition of parole. Parole probably originated in a humane endeavour to modify harsh aspects of punishment, to encourage good conduct in prison and to afford the prisoner a hope of restoration to society. Unfortunately, in practice, parole causes deeply felt and, in many cases justifiably resented injustices. Parole has many failings. The chief of these are:</PARA>
<PARA> it promotes indeterminance and uncertainty in criminal punishment;</PARA>
<PARA> it is founded on the unacceptable assumption that conduct in society can be safely predicted at all and, specifically, can be predicted on the basis of conduct in prison;</PARA>
<PARA> its proceedings are conducted in secrecy and parole decisions, which affect the liberty of individuals are unreviewable; and</PARA>
<PARA> it is a 'charade'. The spectacle of a long sentence of imprisonment no longer deceives the community which knows that the offender will serve a much shorter period in prison before being released on parole. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all the defective systems of parole in Australia, the Commonwealth's system is the most defective. The current administration procedures are too complicated. The system is not even uniform in its application in different parts of Australia. No subject has caused more bitter resentment and criticism on the part of prisoners than the operation of the current system for the parole and licensing of Federal prisoners in Australia. Much of this criticism is justified. The preferable course is to abolish parole for Federal prisoners and to return to a system by which judges impose sentences which are actually meant to be served, less standard and uniform remissions for good behaviour and industry. It must be frankly acknowledged that the abolition of parole is not without difficulties and that careful adjustments to the sentencing system will have to be made. Attention is called to these. </PARA>
<PARA> If the proposal that parole be abolished is not accepted or if its acceptance is delayed for a time, urgent steps are needed radically to reform parole for Federal prisoners. These steps include:</PARA>
<PARA> amendments to the language of the Commonwealth Prisoners Act so that it applies, in terms, uniformly throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> introduction of standard non-parole periods and remissions for Federal prisoners;</PARA>
<PARA> the giving of reasons for the refusal of parole;</PARA>
<PARA> prisoner access to records considered by parole authorities, save in exceptional and defined circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> prisoner participation and representation in parole hearings affecting his liberty;</PARA>
<PARA> the nomination of an identified Commonwealth officer responsible for providing parole information to prisoners and their families;</PARA>
<PARA> the publication of parole guidelines for release decisions; and</PARA>
<PARA> the creation of a Commonwealth Parole Board to replace current procedures by which parole decisions are recommended to the Governor-General by a busy Federal Minister, the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Prison Conditions and Grievances</PARA>
<PARA> The fifth major area of attention in this report relates to the disparities and inequalities that arise from the differing standards in State prisons where, under present arrangements, Federal prisoners in Australia are kept. The standards differ from State to State and within particular States. Many Australian prisons in which Federal prisoners are kept do not meet internationally agreed and nationally suggested minimum standards. Loss of liberty necessarily involves many deprivations and inconveniences. Deprivation of liberty is the most serious punishment we have left to mark society's disapproval of crime and to punish an offender. But it is not appropriate to add to the loss of liberty inhumane, degrading or substandard conditions. That these exist to any degree is a rebuke to Australia as a civilised, confident and relatively prosperous country. It is not appropriate that the Commonwealth should continue to ignore its clear, separate constitutional responsibilities for the conditions under which Federal prisoners are held. This report proposes that certain steps be taken by the Commonwealth to ensure that prison conditions for Federal prisoners comply with minimum standards of treatment for Australian prisoners. The general public and even lawmakers have little idea of actual conditions in Australian prisons. Authoritative reports by a number of impeccable and independent inquiries in recent times (and lately a decision of the High Court of Australia and decisions of superior courts) bear witness to the deep concern that is felt amongst those who know about prison conditions in some Australian prisons. </PARA>
<PARA> A fair system of punishment will permit those sentenced to imprisonment to have access to independent machinery for the just determination of complaints about methods relating to prison administration according to law. Ombudsmen already perform useful work in this regard. In this report specific suggestions are made for the handling of prisoner complaints and for improving access to ombudsmen, including the provision of a facility of confidential correspondence with the ombudsmen throughout Australia. As to prisoner access to the courts, the ancient rule that convicted capital felons do not have access to the courts should be repealed in the Commonwealth's sphere as it has already been repealed elsewhere. Information should be provided to Federal prisoners concerning their rights and duties, including in respect of parole, remissions and complaints. Most Federal prisoners have committed 'white collar crimes', typically fraud and property offences. Many of them lived peacefully in society and most will return to do so. The provision of fair machinery to uphold the rule of law even within the walls of our prisons is a special feature of our form of society. Taking rights seriously, including the right of people temporarily outcast from the community, marks off countries such as ours which proclaim adherence to the Rule of Law and fair administration by government officers. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mention these specific areas simply to highlight their importance and to express again my concern that they be not ignored by the Government in the aura of self-congratulation in which it is no doubt wallowing in having finally got around to introducing this legislation. The strong view of the Commission is that reform in these areas is necessary. It is important, I think, to adopt and to accept its approach that sentencing reform must be seen as an integrated whole and not just a collection of peicemeal measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the major provisions of this Bill. The most important thrust of it is in the direction of alternatives to imprisonment. This was one of the areas of reform, obviously recommended by the Law Reform Commission, and forming part of the integrated approach to which I have already referred. The Commission summarised its reasons for moving in this direction of alternatives to imprisonment in the following terms in the introductory page xxvii of the report. I think it is important to put this on the record. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The pressure for finding effective alternatives to imprisonment is not motivated solely by altruism. It is only now that Australian society is coming to realise the enormous capital and recurring costs of building and maintaining prisons. One estimate recently put the cost of keeping a married person in gaol (allowing for social service payments to the family) at more than $20,000 per annum. Whatever the precise sum, it is high and it is growing quickly. The costs in money terms are high but so are the costs in human terms. Many of Australia's prisons are unsatisfactory as recent Royal Commissions of inquiry and other reports disclose beyond doubt. Conditions in some Australian prisons in which Federal offenders are kept fall well below international and proposed national standards. There is strong evidence that far from contributing to the reform of offenders, present prison conditions foster deep resentments and actually contribute to continuing criminality. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission went on:</PARA>
<PARA> For these and other reasons the search has begun in many countries for effective alternatives to imprisonment which, whilst punitive, avoid many of the financial and human costs of imprisonment. Whilst this search has progressed somewhat in the Australian States, it has not made any real progress in the Commonwealth's sphere. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA> The third major proposal in this report is to suggest steps designed both to control the use of imprisonment in the case of Federal offenders and to facilitate and encourage the use of non-custodial sentences, where these are available in the local jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>In pursuing that theme, the Commission goes on to recommend a number of specific measures to implement this objective. Firstly, it refers to legislative directions of the following kind:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . imprisonment is to be used as a punsihment of 'last resort' i.e., where no other sanction would achieve the objectives contemplated by law; reasons should be given when a sentence of imprisonment is imposed; and imprisonment should not be automatic on failure to pay a fine-</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission then recommends the adoption and use in appropriate Federal cases of non-custodial sentencing options which are available now in State or Territory jurisdiction. If further recommends that there be a further more realistic and up-to-date range and gradation of penalties in Commonwealth legislation. The Commission further recommends that there be provision made for general sentencing guidelines to be determined by a sentencing council and that appeals in Federal criminal cases be available to the Federal Court of Australia. Many of the recommendations contained in the report are picked up by the Bill. Proposed new section 17A of the Crimes Act seeks to implement the recommendation that imprisonment be expressly a punishment of a last resort. We in the Opposition support that proposal, but we note that the Bill which was presented by the Attorney does not, unlike the Law Reform Commission draft Bill, specify the matters to which the court is to have regard in deciding whether any other penalty is appropriate. The Commission, in fact, outlined a series of criteria to which the court should have regard in determining whether to impose a penal sanction in the form of imprisonment, those criteria being:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether the person has endangered the life or personal security of others;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether the offence is of such a nature that no punishment other than imprisonment would be sufficiently severe, having regard to the seriousness of the offence or to the harm done;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether the person has previously been convicted, whether in the State or Territory in which he is convicted or not, of an offence similar to that in respect of which he is to be sentenced. </PARA>
<PARA>Whereas those criteria are suggested in the draft Bill provided by the Commission, by contrast the Bill with which we are confronted tonight contains no such criteria at all but rather only a generally expressed nostrum that judges should, where possible and appropriate, impose non-imprisonment sentences with a further criterion actually being embodied in the legislation to require that even that limited direction does not apply where the offence in question is one punishable by imprisonment either for life or for more than seven years. This cut off point which the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General have decided to put into the Bill does not seem to have any relationship to any recommendation of the Commission. As I say, it is a provision that requires the court to have regard to specific criteria and certainly not to have regard in any overriding way to the period for which the person is capable of being put in gaol by virtue of the particular crime which he or she is alleged to have committed. It is a very odd divergence from the recommendation of the Commission and it is not explained in any way by the Attorney in his second reading speech. We would appreciate from him an explanation of why this route has been chosen to implement what is undoubtedly a worthy aim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes on from there to identify, again properly and appropriately, what those non-custodial alternatives actually are. I suppose proposed new section 20AB is the centre piece of the Bill to the extent that it describes as appropriate non-custodial sentences any of the following: Community service orders, work orders, sentences of periodic detention, attendance centre orders, weekend detention and attendance orders. There is a final catch-all category which consists of any prescribed sentence or order that may subsequently be added to the list by executive decree. That is fair enough. Certainly, the Opposition welcomes the quite specific legislative focus that has now been given to the non-custodial alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> The next main area which is dealt with-it is the only other one on which I wish to comment in any detail at the second reading stage-relates to the payment of fines. Proposed new section 18A of the Crimes Act ensures that the full range of alternatives to imprisonment is available to the courts in the enforcement of fines against Commonwealth offenders-that is, a court can specify non-custodial options as being available in default of the payment of the fine in question. Instead of saying that a person is fined $500 or, in default of that, will go to gaol for three months, it is now provided that the court can and, in fact, should be encouraged to provide that in default of a fine of $500 a person can spend 15 weekends of attendance at a periodic detention centre or something of that kind. That is perfectly good as far as it goes and it is consistent with the general change towards these alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to insert a new section 18B into the Act which will make provision for application by a Commonwealth offender for time, or for further time, to pay a fine. Where such an application is made the court, after hearing evidence as to the person's financial circumstances and his ability to comply, may direct that time, or further time, be given and that payment be by specified instalments or by different instalments from those originally ordered. All of this is again a welcome addition to the armoury which is available to the court. It introduces a welcome element of flexibility in the sentencing of offenders in the first place and also in the enforcement of sentences thus imposed. So far so good. All this was discussed by the Law Reform Commission at paragraph 386 of its report but was not the subject of a draft legislative proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission distinguished-we accept that distinction-between the right of an offender to apply to the court for time, or for further time, to pay-preferably before the actual default arose, so that any change in his financial circumstances could, in fact, be accommodated-that being the provision which has been picked up in the legislation now before us. But, on the other hand, the distinction was made between the situation that I have just mentioned and that where there is a default in the payment of a fine. The Commission drew attention to the importance of applying a non-custodial sentence in that situation. The Commission's strong recommendation was not only that a non-custodial sentence be an option available to the court when confronted by some straggler who has been unable to pay his fine, but also, more strongly than that, that there be a legislative requirement that imprisonment not be imposed as a sanction for default except where there is wilful and unreasonable default. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the two classes of recommendation which were discussed by the Commission. Of those two, it is the second that was stated by the Commission to be the more important since it seeks to implement still further the basic principle of imprisonment as a last resort. It also seeks to ensure a fresh assessment of the offender's financial position before any sentence of imprisonment is actually passed. That there is a necessity for this kind or provision in the law, I think, was amply demonstrated by the case of John Quayle, an Aboriginal from Wilcannia, a case which came to the attention of the public not so long ago. That person was sentenced to a period of six months imprisonment at Broken Hill for his failure to pay a $400 fine arising out of his non-lodgment of a tax return. In that case the court, by virtue of the Commonwealth legislation governing tax defaults, had no alternative but to impose a prison sentence. The fact that it had no alternative is a classic demonstration of some of the weaknesses in the law and the injustices which can be caused to certain classes of offenders, not just at the initial stage of imposing a sentence but also at the stage of enforcing it once it has been imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am leading up to is that we are concerned about the failure of the Bill which is before us now to create explicit legislative rules to govern the situation of someone who is actually in default of an initial penalty of a fine that has been imposed upon him. As the Bill stands at the moment a court, when confronted by someone who has defaulted in a fine, has the flexibility under the provisions of the Bill to allow further time to pay. A court does not have the flexibility to introduce at that stage non-custodial orders and it certainly is not subject to any overriding declaration of legislative policy that, in those circumstances of a default, imprisonment should be imposed only as an absolute last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that absence from this Bill of such a provision as recommended by the Commission that we regard as perhaps the most serious omission from the Bill and one that we hope to rectify at the Committee stage. It is to that issue-I will not go through the arguments again in the Committee stage-that our amendments Nos 1 to 3 are, in fact, addressed. I conclude by saying that subject to that concern, and to several other areas of concern which I will sketch out rather more briefly in the Committee stage and which are the subject also of Committee stage amendments, we certainly do not oppose this Bill. It is a path-breaking one. It is an innovative one. It is long overdue and we welcome it very much indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the Senate for the support of this measure, which is a very important one. It gives some implementation to a report of the Law Reform Commission on a reference that I gave it on the sentencing of Federal offenders. However, my interest in and concern about the provisions of the Crimes Act and the limitations of its provisions in regard to the sentencing of Federal offenders have gone back for some time. I became particularly concerned about the limitations of the Crimes Act when I attended an inaugural meeting of the Australian Association of Magistrates in 1978. It was really as a result of that that I decided that we should prepare a paper for what was then going to be an international crime conference in Australia. The reference I gave the Law Reform Commission was for the purpose of getting the background for the contribution Australia was to make at that conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the event, the report of the Law Reform Commission ranged over a much wider area than I had anticipated. The Commission interpreted its reference in no doubt a permissible way, but also in the widest possible sense. The report which Senator Evans has been referring to, reading from and so on, is quite a huge document covering a vast range of penology in the Commonwealth and making a great number of reforms way beyond the question of the actual sentencing of Federal offenders. As I have said, the report made some helpful suggestions about sentencing and in that respect this Bill, subject to my consideration of it, partly implements those recommendations. However, as I have said, they relate to deficiencies in the Crimes Act that have been known for some time. For that reason it is important that the Bill should be passed as soon as possible. The Bill also updates the pecuniary penalties in the Crimes Act which have become very much out of date. That is really another urgent and important part of this legislation, although it was not mentioned by Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> The most interesting aspect of it, I believe, is the general statement that imprisonment should be a last resort. I think that is really only stating what is the better view of sentencing and one which is adopted by judges and magistrates who are fully seized of the modern principles of sentencing and of the attitude to imprisonment as against other forms of punishment. Insofar as that proposition has never had legislative endorsement in Australia, this amendment to the Crimes Act will set that standard and I hope will give a lead to legislatures in Australia in adopting that general principle. Hopefully it will make some contribution to a more uniform use of imprisonment throughout Australia, certainly in the Federal sphere, but possibly in the State sphere as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important aspect is the making available of magistrates and judges who are sentencing Federal offenders of a choice of various alternatives to imprisonment, which have been developed in the State systems in recent years, such as community service orders and so on. These have been rather experimental alternatives to imprisonment in recent years. They seem to have been well received and to have worked well. Certainly they ought to be available to magistrates and judges sentencing people under Federal laws. That has not been possible because of the limitations of the Crimes Act as presently drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all I believe it is a useful measure. Senator Evans obviously agrees with that. However, he, in his usual vein, would have wished that the Commonwealth had rubber-stamped the report of the Law Reform Commission. We are familiar with this debate. We have it a number of times in the Senate when Senator Evans takes the view that parliament should really implement the Law Reform Commission reports and I take a very different view, namely, that these reports should be very closely examined by government, and that governments and parliaments are entitled to have their own views in relation to those matters. I believe that law reform commissions are useful bodies which do valuable work and make very valuable suggestions but that the responsiblity for implementing their decisions is that of the Government and the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> This report, to which Senator Evans referred, is a voluminous document and it ranges over a vast field. It involves the whole subject of penology in Australia and, particularly, the area of State responsibility. A great number of the recommendations in this report are really the basic responsibilities of the States. The State governments have expressed very considerable concern about a number of these recommendations. I have said that apart from the matters dealt with in this amendment these recommendations will be the subject of very detailed consideration with the States before I will propose any implementation of them. They raise in a very major way the matter of prison conditions and prisoners' rights. Of course, Senator Evans will be well aware that the States under the Constitution have the responsibility for accepting into their goals Federal offenders. They are very much State gaols. They are not Federal gaols. No doubt the Federal Government could build its own gaols and, if it was minded, adopt the standards, the rights or prisoners and so on as recommended in the report. I would be interested to know whether Senator Evans and the Australian Labor Party propose to embark upon that course. I can assure the Senate that that is not going to be the course followed by this Government. We intend to proceed along traditional lines in this area. It is the responsibility of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the rights of certain Federal offenders to parole and other matters. The question whether those rights should be uniform throughout Australia or whether they should be uniform in the particular gaol in which the Federal offender is imprisoned is extremely difficult. People may favour uniform treatment of Federal offenders wherever they are in Australia but there is an equally strong argument-in my view it is a better argument-that the uniformity should be between all the inmates of a particular gaol. One is really looking for serious trouble if one applies different rules to prisoners in the same gaol. These questions are untouched here and unresolved. I believe that they are matters than can be resolved only by lengthy discussions with the States. I do not believe that there are any easy answers to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated in my second reading speech that I have written to my colleagues in the States suggesting the establishment, administratively, of a sentencing council comprising State and Federal judges with a view to discussing the matter of sentencing guidelines and, one would hope, uniform sentencing decisions. I have not yet had any reaction to that suggestion but it will no doubt be the subject of early discussion in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I hope that the Attorneys-General will agree with my proposition that we establish an Australian sentencing council in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans raised the matter of the Government's attitude to the compensation of the victims of crime. That is a matter on which I have been asked questions from time to time. The latest position is that the ordinance has now been drafted. I have it on my desk in the Senate at the moment. Subject to one or two small details to which I want further consideration given, that ordinance is ready to send to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA>I endeavoured to canvass the effect of these amendments during the second reading debate and I do not want to repeat that argument, except to say that these arguments are about the insertion of a new section 18C into the Crimes Act to provide that where there is a default in payment of a fine the court is enabled to impose, even at that late stage, a non-custodial penalty as well as further time to pay or as well as a custodial penalty in respect of that default, and, more importantly, the proposed new section 18C imposes an obligation upon the court not to allow the imposition of a custodial sentence for default in payment of a fine except where there is wilful and unreasonable default on the part of the offender. The object of the exercise is to implement that Law Reform Commission recommendation which deals with this matter. The draft before us is squarely based on the Law Reform Commission report. There does not seem to be any great resistance from the Government, so far as I can elicit, to the principle of these amendments because, after all, they are entirely consistent with the thrust of the Commission's report and of the rest of the Bill; namely, to broaden and to make as flexible as possible the range of options open to the sentencing or enforcing judge and to reiterate the emphasis on non-custodial sentencing with its corollary that imprisonment should be only an absolute last resort. For all those reasons, I urge the chamber to support this package of Committee stage amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not prepared to accept these amendments. It is a matter to which a good deal of consideration was given before we adopted the provision in clause 7, which provides for a new section 18B, as set out on page 4 of the Bill. This deals with the way in which the courts may consider the position of a person who has been fined. The new clause provides for an application to pay by instalments to be made by a person who has been fined or, if the fine was to be paid by instalments, by lesser instalments if he does not have the means to pay. Senator Evans's amendment would, of course, go very much further than that and provide that a person should not be imprisoned in default of paying a fine unless the person had the means to pay it and wilfully refused to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of whether a person has the capacity to pay a fine or not really ought to be considered by a court in the first place; but it is, of course, the case that that is not always done and indeed these people's capacity to pay may change. So the reason we adopted what might be considered a fairly cautious approach in proposed new section 18B is that we do not want a situation to develop which could develop if Senator Evans's amendment was the one which was chosen. Indeed, as Senator Evans said, that was based on the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, but we felt that there were some very practical problems. The effect of the amendment, in our view, would be that a defendant who was fined could neglect to pay the fine and require the prosecution to satisfy the court that the defendant had the means to pay the fine and wilfully refused to pay it. That would be a very time consuming process and the result could be that people, we believe, would be able to get out of paying fines in very many cases. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said the proposal in the Bill that we have adopted will afford the opportunity to an offender to seek time to pay the fine by instalments or by reduced instalments and will not place an unreasonable burden on the courts really to ascertain whether the person had the ability to pay and was wilfully in default of paying. I think that would be a very difficult thing to endeavour to prove. I think if we adopted Senator Evans's amendment the use of fines as an alternative to other sentences may be drastically reduced because it would really be so easy for people to avoid paying them. Therefore, that is the reason why we did not adopt the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and why we developed the particular alternative that appears in proposed new section 18B. </PARA>

How far beyond a person's own assets does the court go when it makes these decisions?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about a discussion which may take place on this matter before a person is fined at all. That question does not arise here. This proposal is simply to give a person who has been fined an opportunity, if the cannot meet the fine as such or the instalments if there has been an order to pay by instalments, to come back to the court and have the matter reviewed. That is our proposition; it does not relate to the original imposition of the fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question no doubt arises in many cases as to what will be the financial circumstances of the person and his ability to pay. How a court determines that is very much at large. I am not aware of any particular rules as to how a court does so. It is just a matter largely of what the defendent, or his counsel, tells the court about financial circumstances. I think that would be the same way in which this matter would be investigated under either of the proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Haines that I agree with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that the formula here used would be one which would be treated as allowing the court to engage in a very much at large investigation of the person's financial circumstances in the most general sense of that word, enabling the court, for example, to have regard to finance that was not perhaps technically legally in that person's name but rather in the name of another member of the family but to which that person clearly had access for the purpose of discharging a fine. If that is the nature of Senator Haines' concern I think I would share the Attorney's view that the court would have an open-ended capacity to take all that into account rather than just purely technical questions of cash in hand of the person concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to prolong this debate too long, but the fundamental objection I have to the Attorney's response is this: The Government seems willing to pay lip service to the notion of imprisonment as a last resort, but when it comes actually to applying in practice the notion of imprisonment as a last resort the Government in fact retreats from the legislative provisions needed to ensure that imprisonment will in fact be a last resort. We are talking here about a situation in which a person is fined possibly a large sum of money, in default imprisonment perhaps for many months, and trying to devise a formula to deal with what happens when a person is in default of paying that particular fine. The provision that is in the Bill, which we do not seek to alter, gives the court power under those circumstances to look again at the fine which has been imposed and to vary the amount of the fine at least by way of giving the accused further time to pay. But it gives the court no more flexibility than that and if ultimately the time to pay runs out, then whatever the degree of wilful default that may be involved on the part of the accused under those circumstances the original sentence of imprisonment in default of paying the fine would apply and the person would just go to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to insert a further provision which adds further flexibility, which gives further powers to the court and indeed imposes further responsibilities upon the court in that situation, to re-evaluate a person's financial circumstances if he makes any claim that he has had difficulty in paying the fine and to enable the court not only to allow further time to pay but also to allow the court in those circumstances to impose at that point in the process another form of non-custodial punishment, for example, periodic detention or attendance at a centre or something of that kind. Of course, it may be difficult for a court to determine whether someone has been wilfully defaulting so far as the payment of the fine is concerned. But the way the Attorney left it, one could be forgiven for having the impression that if the court found it self unable to make up its mind on that question, the person would go absolutely scot free. That of course is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed legislation that I am putting, if the court has difficulty in making up its mind as to whether there has been a wilful default, the way it can satisfy itself in practice is to impose a non-financial penalty, another form of non-custodial penalty involving a weekend detention, periodic attendance, work or something of that kind. For all those reasons I do not think there is any practical difficulty about the Government's accepting this amendment. It has been thought through rather carefully. It should be acceptable in principle and I hope that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine will support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the amendment is an eminently reasonable refinement of proposed new section 18B. I might just mention for the information of the Senate that I have had a long experience of, and association with, the idea of non-custodial alternatives for persons who have been sentenced. In fact, it is now 15 years since the idea was introduced in the State of Tasmania on the initiative of the then Attorney-General Mr Max Bingham, after discussions between his Government, that of the succeeding Labor Government, myself as Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, and various other organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I consider that what has been put forward by Senator Evans is in fact a refinement of what has been put forward by the Government. It is, as Senator Evans has said, a recognition of the fact that there are in the community some people who may be fined at a particular time at which they are unable to pay the fine. What Senator Evans is doing is to enable the court, in those circumstances, to give full consideration to that fact and vary the sentence, using the new provisions to issue, for example, an attendance centre order, a sentence for Saturday work or what are commonly known as community service orders. That is eminently reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> For my part, I feel that the more messages the legislature can give to the judiciary, that fines must impose a cost that is in relation to the individual's income, the better. In other words, one person might not notice a $2,000 fine, but for another person it might almost mean the destruction of his life. Any message that we can give to the judiciary on those lines is well given and, I hope, received. I support Senator Evans's proposition and will do so when it comes to a vote. </PARA>

<PARA> (4) Page 8, clause 9, sub-clause (1), proposed new section 19B, sub-section (1), paragraph (d), sub-paragraph (i), line 11, leave out '3 years', insert '12 months'. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Page 9, clause 9, sub-clause (1), proposed new section 20, sub-section (1), paragraph (a), sub-paragraph (i), line 20, leave out '5', insert '2'. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments are to clause 9 of the Bill and proposed new sections 19B and 20 respectively. They relate to the maximum periods for which a conditional release order may be imposed. Under the Bill, when someone is made subject to a probation or conditional release order, without an actual conviction being imposed, such order can be made for a maximum of three years. Certainly, that is an improvement on the existing law, but a maximum is nonetheless included. After conviction, where a probation or conditional release order is imposed, the Bill proposes a maximum period of five years. That is certainly an improvement on the present law, which provides no limitation at all as to the period for which a conditional release order can in fact be imposed. It is our object, by these two amendments to reduce the period in both cases-in the first case, the without conviction order, from a maximum of three years to a maximum of 12 months, and in the case of the post-conviction order from a maximum of five years to a maximum of two years. </PARA>
<PARA> In both cases, the proposed amendments are based again on the recommendations and arguments of the Law Reform Commission. I propose to indicate briefly in each case what that argument is in the hope that at this stage I may persuade people whose minds might not be closed on the subject. In the case of discharge without conviction, recommendation 42 of the Commission's sentencing report is that there should be a maximum period of 12 months in the case of a discharge order imposed on an offender. The argument is expressed in paragraph 360 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the fact that such an order can only be imposed for an offence which is 'trivial' and in which there are 'extenuating circumstances'--</PARA>
<PARA>That refers to the way in which the Act is drafted at the moment-</PARA>
<PARA>it is doubtful whether an upward limit of three years in relation to a release without conviction would often be appropriate. It has frequently been pointed out, in studies of bond and recognizance systems, that the terms and conditions contained in such sentences can be breached quite readily by relatively minor transgressions. They can create a situation in which, for relatively minor crimes, persons are enmeshed for a very long period in the criminal justice system. </PARA>
<PARA>The argument goes on to state that the expression 'good behaviour' is particularly vague in its practical application and can easily be interpreted differently by the offender, by the court, by police, by probation officers and by persons in authority. Given the vagueness of that particular, familiar term in this context, it is inappropriate that someone's behaviour should be subject to the potential operation of the criminal law in this way for such a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the situation of discharge after conviction-of someone being subject to a conditional release order of this kind after conviction, but in lieu of imprisonment or perhaps a fine-the amendments, as I have said, propose a maximum of three years rather than the open-ended period presently provided under the Act or the period of five years that is proposed by the Commission. The Commission's argument, as set out in paragraph 369 of the report, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst a minimum period should not be set for discharge orders, a maximum time limit should be set of two years for this type of penalty. The research available--</PARA>
<PARA>The reference is to Potas's book of 1976 entitled The Legal Basis for Probation--</PARA>
<PARA>has shown that the largest proportion of all existing supervised probation orders in Australia are for periods no longer than two years. The second largest proportion of such orders is for periods no longer than one year. Similar findings have been made in the United Kingdom, where it has also been suggested that a maximum time limit on all probation and discharge orders should be two years. A period of two years is sufficient time for discharge orders following conviction, including those involving supervision of an offender. The provision of a maximum period is preferable to the existing unlimited discretion given to courts when sentencing Federal offenders to set any time period they wish in regard to a discharge order following conviction. The longer the period, the less likelihood there is that the offender will benefit, and the greater the danger of his committing minor offences and continuing his involvement in the criminal justice system. Section 20 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) should be amended to provide for such a maximum period. </PARA>
<PARA>The maximum period referred to is two years. Those arguments seem to me and to the Opposition to be quite compelling. We are puzzled as to why again, except out of an abundance of conservatism and caution, the Government has apparently resisted that argument. We urge the Senate to accept its force and to support the amendments accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats might like to hear the Government case before they make up their minds. The Government is opposed to these amendments. We have accepted in the amendment the principle that there ought to be an upper limit on the power of the courts to order probation rather than the unlimited provisions that prevail in section 20 of the existing Act. To that extent we agree with the Law Reform Commission. However, whether one chooses a period of three years, five years or one year is very much a matter of judgment. The Government believes that there ought to be a reasonable amount of flexibility in discretion given to magistrates or judges in fixing these terms and that the actual periods that the Law Reform Commission recommended are too short and too restrictive and limit to too great an extent the discretion of judges. For those reasons the Government has chosen the figures that are included in these clauses of the Bill. Anything that Senator Evans has said has not convinced me that they ought to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; we will leave the trendies to Senator Evans. I am sure he will know better what to do with them. It seems to me that if part of Senator Evans's argument rests on the basis that a good behaviour bond is defined by different people in different ways, the answer to that is to make sure that communications are better and that the offender in particular has a precise idea of just exactly what is meant if a good behaviour bond is applied to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of cutting back the maximum sentence applying under clause 9 which refers to the discharge of offenders without proceeding to conviction, I cannot see a great deal of benefit in lowering the period from three years to 12 months. There does not seem to be any point in decreasing a maximum sentence when the maximum is hardly enormous. As the Attorney-General has just pointed out, such a step would diminish the number of options available to the court. It overlooks the fact that an upper limit is not a mandatory term but a potential maximum. It seems to me that it could lead in some instances to the courts choosing to err on the severe side-that is in not opting for the good behaviour bond in the first instance if the maximum is only one year, which is really a very short period. I think the same argument applies to the conditional release of offenders after conviction. The Opposition's amendment No. 5 proposes that the maximum term be lowered from five years to two years. If the court wishes to make it two years it can do so regardless of whether the maximum is three years, four years, five years or two years. Again, I support the Attorney's assertion that such a proposal could tie the hands of the courts, that it could limit their options to an unnecessary extent. We do not support the two amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Senate and the other place deal with extremely important issues from time to time. However, I do not wish to raise one of those. In fact, I wish to raise a very minor issue, one which is of very little importance to the nation as a whole. However, I think it is the type of issue which concerns many people in this country in their day-to-day lives. I think this is best put in a letter I received from a constituent that spells out in very clear detail what is happening to thousands of people in this country. I would like to read sections of the letter because I think it expresses better than I could the position that these people are in. After some introductory remarks, the person wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have never felt compelled to complain before-perhaps I have been too apathetic-but I would like to tell you what happened to my husband recently-a war-blinded, ex-P.O.W. in Changi, he was critically wounded in Singapore, where he remained with little or no medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> My husband, . . . volunteered to protect this country. He was 35, strong, virile, full of the joy of living, holding a good job. He came back from the hell hole, broken in health but not in spirit. I don't think I know anyone who has been so courageous in the face of such odds-but I know there are 1000s more like him. We, his family, gave him all the support he needed, even tho' for many years it was hell on earth trying to help him adjust and to see his frustration. He has been in and out of hospital like a yo-yo for most of the time. You know, he even lost his manhood during those awful years in Changi-something we have had to live with all this time. We thank God for the support of our family. Never did my dear husband complain and fought desperately to rehabilitate himself. We battled through rearing and educating three sons, . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We are proud of our sons who all hold good positions . . . to help them achieve their goals we had to live from week to week. We had our first holiday since the war in 1969, when my husband was 65 and I was 58; that was paid for by our sons. </PARA>
<PARA> We never were able to have any money in the bank until this year, when we had approximately $6,000 about the time I filled in the income assessment forms-I have always been honest with the department but I was foolish in not stating that about $2,000 of that money was about to be paid out in accounts like insurance, house, furniture, car, light, phone, rates etc., plus our living expenses. As my husband had just come out of an 8 week spell in hospital, and is even unable to water the garden, I decided to buy a little boat for him, and one son gave us a small motor for it. A kind neighbour was going to take him out on the lake to help him fill in his day. The boat cost me $500. My dear husband then insisted I buy myself a comfortable chair for my 70th birthday-$400. We also had hoped to go to Western Australia at Christmas to visit our son who lives there. </PARA>
<PARA> I know I have been a long time getting to the point, but I am so angry. We received a letter about a month ago telling my husband because of the interest we received, his service pension had been cut by $1.30 a week. The interest, by the way, amounted to $65 for the year. I think this is so paltry, and we probably won't miss the $1.30. Another thing I omitted to tell them is that we are, and have been for years, supporting two World Vision children out of our pension. </PARA>
<PARA>I think when one gets a letter like that-probably most honourable senators have received such letters from time to time-one feels so frustrated that our bureaucracy and our organisation in terms of the support that we give people in this country can be so paltry, so mean and so debased as to take $1.30 from people like that. It is not a matter of economics because as every honourable senator here knows, it probably costs upwards of $15 to process that $1.30. Yet this is what we do and this is what we continue to do. There are thousands upon thousands of people who have, as these people have, sacrificed for their country, who have worked hard, who have paid their taxes and who have asked for little. Yet when we get to that stage when indeed we should be supportive of our senior citizens, our ex-service people and other people such as that, we set about prying into their lives, asking them to fill out forms and, of course, if they are honest we then set about penalising them, as this person has said, by taking away $1.30 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think this person is unexceptional. I think the point is-I have spoken to her since she wrote me the letter-the fact that she can seek to help others despite the enormous burden shows the type of people that we have in this country, people who are generous and who will go out of their way to support other people whom they see as less advantaged than themselves. But I think it says little for our Government; it says little for this country, if in fact we can then turn around and penalise such people such paltry amounts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is some time since I spoke in the adjournment debate. I do so only when I gather it is most necessary as I do on this occasion. I raise with the Government and with the appropriate authorities my concern about certain people who appear to have been unjustly persecuted by the authorities in Czechoslovakia. I refer to the following persons who were arrested on 10 September 1979 but who, on the intervention of Pope John Paul II, were temporarily released. They were subsequently arrested again and they have stood trial and have received certain sentences. The persons to whom I refer are Father Frantisek Lizna S.J., Father Rudolf Smahel, Jan Krumpholc, Josef Vlcek and Josef Adamek. They have been charged with illicit trading under paragraph 118/1 of the penal code because the authorities preferred not to admit that it is illegal to print the Pope's encyclical 'Redemptor Hominis' which is the Pope's letter in 1979 to all priests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In brief, Father Lizna was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment and he is awaiting another trial. Jan Krumpholc, who is 54, was sentenced to three years imprisonment. He has since broken his leg. I make the point about the latter, that he and his wife in fact took two foster children out of an orphanage and gave them a great deal of support. There is testimony from people who were dealing with these children to the effect that these parents gave such loving care to these children that there was a remarkable improvement in them since they came to the Krumpholc home. This man was sentended to three years on that outlandish charge; imprisoned and taken away from those children. Josef Adamek, who is 67, and Josef Vlcek, who is 61, received 20 months and in view of their ages that could mean the death sentence. Adamek is the father of 11 children. </PARA>
<PARA> Father Smahel, who is 31 years of age, is a member of the Salesian order. Those honourable members who know of the Salesian order would recognise the great work that it does, particularly with poorer families and in the development of skilled trades. I am not sure whether the order is involved in that way in Czechoslovakia, but it is certainly involved in that way in other areas and its work is important to particular countries. Father Smahel received two years imprisonment for receiving some money from a West German priest and not reporting it to the authorities within 14 days. He was not aware of that law. All the persons I have mentioned have been charged, tried and sentenced on trumped up charges because the authorities prefer not to admit that they consider it to be illegal to print the Pope's encyclical. </PARA>
<PARA> The other person whom I wish to mention tonight is Jan Litomisky of Vyskytna, who was detained on 17 February 1981 and charged under paragraph 98-1 of the Czechoslovak penal code with attempting to subvert the republic. This person is a member of VONS, the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Persecuted. In fact, he has peacefully drawn attention to possible violations of Czechoslovak law by Czechoslovak authorities. For this he has been detained. This is a matter of concern that I raise in the Senate. I am not too sure what has finally happened to this person, other than that he was detained in February 1981 and was told by his interrogator that his crime was his membership of VONS. </PARA>
<PARA> For the same charge Rudolph Battek-a fellow member of VONS-received 7 1/2 years imprisonment at the end of July 1981. These people are really prisoners of conscience. As honourable senators would know, these matters are given consideration from time to time by Amnesty International. I think it is important that they be aired from time to time in the parliaments of the democratic world in the hope that some people in authority will take note of them and recognise that the people of Australia feel that citizens of this type are not acting contrary to the interests of their countries. Basic human rights, such as freedom of religion and freedom to express opinions, should be safeguarded. I thought I should take this opportunity to raise this matter in the Senate. </PARA>

They are matters of very broad concern and policy. The Government's policy is to apply the income test as defined at present. Naturally, it is a Budget matter which would need consideration at the appropriate time for any change to occur.

<PARA> Does reciprocal recognition exist between the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) and State Government Ethnic Authorities in connection with the status and grading of translators and interpreters.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1504" SPEAKER="Durack Sen The Hon P.D." NAMEID="8G4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) was established in 1977 with the objective of prescribing the standards and conditions leading to professional status for translators and interpreters in Australia. NAATI has determined five levels of competence at which interpreters and translators may be accredited.</PARA>
<PARA> NAATI is the only Authority which accredits interpreters and translators Australia-wide and its accreditation is generally recognised by employees.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the size of the Authority's task (it has received approximately 5500 applications since its inception from interpreters and translators seeking accreditation in more than 80 languages at Levels I to V in both interpreting and translating) NAATI has not yet been able to arrange tests in all languages or at all levels for which there is a demand. However, the national testing program for October 1981-July 1982 aims to test as many as possible of the remaining applicants.</PARA>
<PARA> Generally, State Government employment authorities require applicants for interpreting and translating positions to have NAATI accreditation at Level II or Level III. In those cases where NAATI has not tested in the language or at the level required, some States Governments conduct their own tests. These tests are not recognised by NAATI, but interpreters and translators are able to apply to NAATI for recognition which may be granted with status at Level II where they are able to provide proof that they are working as interpreters or translators.</PARA>
<PARA> As with any profession whose practitioners are not bound by law to be registered before they are able to practise, employers are not required to insist that applicants have NAATI accreditation. However, experience has shown that as more interpreters and translators are accredited by NAATI, employing authorities will increasingly require accreditation by NAATI as a pre-requisite for appointment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) For the purpose of exemption from tuition fees a student will be regarded as having obtained an initial tertiary qualification where he or she has completed the requirements for a degree, or an undergraduate diploma or an equivalent overseas qualification or an approved combined course.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department has prepared a draft explanatory statement which has been sent to State authorities and institutions for comment on any points requiring clarification. The statement provides details of exemptions including lists of approved courses.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to (7) In preparation for the introduction of the loans scheme, which will enable students to supplement their income by amounts which will be repayable after graduation, Ministers have been considering such questions as eligibility and administration. There have been fruitful discussions between Commonwealth officials and representatives of the Australian Bankers Association. Some aspects of the scheme have still to be settled which may cause problems in having the scheme operating at the beginning of 1982 but the Government is firm in its intention to set up a loans scheme as a supplement to existing forms of student assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Government's decision that eligibility under the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme will be restricted to those needing qualifications for employment will mean that as from 1 January 1982, only applicants who have indicated an employment objective for which completion of matriculation level studies is considered to be essential or highly desirable will be eligible for consideration under the scheme. Acceptable employment objectives will include those requiring completion of a tertiary qualification for which matriculation is a prerequisite. It will be necessary in future for the employment objective to be stated on the application form.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) One of the objectives of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission in proposing a program of consolidation of single purpose teacher education institutions into larger, more broadly based institutions was to increase the flexibility available within higher education in responding to changing needs. The result of the amalgamations will be that, within the Commission's planning ranges for the student places for the 1982-84 triennium which is similar to that for the current triennium, institutions will be able to meet increased demand in some fields of study, particularly the technologies and business studies, while adjusting to reduced demand in other fields.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Government expects that costs which are associated with the amalgamation of colleges will be met from within the funds available, and that overall the amalgamations will result in savings which will be applied elsewhere in the tertiary education sectors to bring about the re-distribution of resources required under the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) In its 'Report for 1982-84 Triennium', the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission commented (paragraph 4.22) on proposals to rationalise the provision of engineering courses in Victoria. It stated that, in view of the large number of engineering schools in Victoria and the small size of some of them, some rationalisation was required if the quality of engineering education was to be maintained. It expressed the view that, given the small size of the schools involved, the effect of such rationalisation on output of engineers would be small and the more effective use of resources which would be possible was likely to increase the overall capacity of higher education to meet Australia's future needs for well qualified professional and other technological manpower. The Government supports the Commission's view.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Various organisations and individuals have made known to me their views over aspects of the Government's 1982 guidelines for the education programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The views of all State Ministers for Education were taken into account in the development of the Government's policy and guidelines for schools programs for 1982. The views of the State Ministers have also been taken into account in the Government's consideration of the Commonwealth Schools Commission Report for 1982, prepared in response to the guidelines issued in June.</PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be claimed that the distribution of Commonwealth funds for schools in 1982 is inequitable. Much of the 1982 allocation reflects the needs basis of Commonwealth funding for all schools. About 86 per cent of the increased allocation for non-government schools in 1982 will go to the low resource schools classified at Level 6 by the Commonwealth Schools Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The major policy objective underlying Commonwealth programs is to assist all schools to reach and maintain high standards of operation with no greater priority for one sector than another.</PARA>
<PARA> The combined resources of the States and the Commonwealth have resulted in great improvements in per pupil resource standards in government schools. While standards have also improved in non-government schools, the Commonwealth Schools Commission has reported that the great majority of such schools are still operating at about 70 per cent of average government school resource levels per pupil. The Commonwealth is concerned to ensure that freedom of choice and equality of opportunity continue to apply to all Australian school children.</PARA>
<PARA> If the total expenditure of taxpayers' funds on a per pupil basis is looked at, it is shown that the taxpayer is spending more than double the amount on education a student in a government school that is being spent in non-government schools: about an additional $1,000 per pupil in favour of government schools.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) If so, is the Minister aware that those in fourth year of secondary school are usually aged 16, and that, according to the Bureau of Statistics, 38.4 per cent of the unemployed left school at age 14 or younger, and (b) 4 per cent of unemployed school leavers left at age 13 or younger.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the Minister taken steps to simplify the wording of the unemployment benefit claim form and the disadvantaged health card application form to help alleviate the confusion of the less educated poor who are in most need of such benefits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)&amp; (2) I refer the honourable senator to my answers to Senate Questions Nos. 803 (weekly Hansard, 12 June 1981, p. 3288) and 1022 (daily Hansard), 9 September 1981, p. 622).</PARA>
<PARA> In these answers I said that my department is committed to a program of reviews to make its various written communications, including claim forms, more understandable for people with limited literacy, and that my department's research indicated that the reading skills of about a fourth year secondary school student could be needed to understand the unemployment benefit claim form then in use.</PARA>
<PARA> I also foreshadowed a new, more readable replacement for that form.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I can now confirm that the new unemployment benefit claim form has reached the readability target which I indicated in my previous replies. The form should now be comprehensible to someone with the usual reading skills of a first year secondary student.</PARA>
<PARA> The claim form for the health care card has an average readability level of about the second year of secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA> Work is continuing to improve the readability and presentation of other claim forms, and I hope to be able, in due course, to report further progress in this important aspect of client service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the problems being experienced by public broadcasting station 7CAE-FM. The coverage of 7CAE is inferior to that of the other public broadcasting station in Hobart (7HFC-FM). This inferior coverage extends across the bulk of the station's service area and my Department is presently endeavouring to determine the most appropriate means whereby 7CAE's coverage may be improved.</PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the installation of a translator would improve reception in certain areas. However, it may also be necessary for the station to undertake various other corrective measures to improve its coverage overall.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department will be negotiating with the management of 7CAE in the near future with a view to reaching a conclusion, which would be acceptable to me amd the station, with regard to improving the station's overall coverage.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department presently has registered in excess of 500 projects relating to the establishment of new broadcasting and television services or revised operating conditions of existing broadcasting and television services, and the number of expression of interest in establishing new services or revising operating conditions of existing services is growing.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Amongst the projects registered, in excess of 350 relate to requests directly associated with improving reception of existing stations, either through the use of translators or by varying the operating conditions of the actual station concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As mentioned earlier, in the case of radio station 7CAE, the Department is soon to endeavour to prepare a suitable plan to improve the overall coverage of 7CAE. It is anticipated that a recommendation to this effect will be with me by end of this year. Most of the proposals presently registered by the Department relate in some way or another to either improving reception of existing stations or providing new services to areas where the choice of broadcasting or television services is limited or non-existent.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the delays evident in processing applications for new services or varied operating conditions to existing services and have directed the Department to examine the present procedures relating to planning and to make recommendations concerning streamlining the planning approach to enable proposals to be processed more quickly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Concerning the net benefit of tuition fees in financial terms, on the basis of 1980 emrolments it is estimated that the partial introduction of tuition fees will result in revenue of about $8 million in 1982. It is not known to what extent enrolments in 1982 will be affected by fees. A benefit will accrue to taxpayers in that they will not bear the full cost of future studies now that students will be expected to make some contribution towards the cost of their tuition.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The proposed tertiary student loans scheme will benefit students by providing a form of assistance additional to that provided under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), thus widening opportunities for students to obtain support while studying. I cannot give further details about the proposed scheme at present as negotiations with the banks and tertiary institutions are not yet complete.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) See (a) for estimation of revenue in 1982. I would expect that the collection of fees would occur as part of the normal enrolment procedures adopted by the various institutions and for this reason it is not possible to calculate the costs of fee collection separately from the administrative costs involved in enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It remains to be seen whether the limited reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees in 1982 will have any disincentive effect. It would serve no useful purpose to speculate at this stage. As I observed in answer to part (1) of the question, it is not known to what extent enrolments in 1982-or in subsequent years-will be affected by fees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) The statistics quoted have not been verified, but are not disputed. People have moved to homeland centres in recent years in the knowledge that a full range of services would not be available and indeed one of the aims of many people moving back to their homelands has been to lead a more traditional style of life. The provision of fixed housing and water reticulation at every camp site would not be compatible with a traditional life-style and the initial programs developed in consultation with each group have concentrated on the provision of basic water supplies, communications, transport and health services.</PARA>
<PARA> Future housing programs will be developed in consultation between the individual groups and the Aboriginal Development Commission. My Department is continuing to make grants for the improvement of water supplies, on the basis of plans developed in discussion with the groups about their priorities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 553) Senator Sibraa asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on the discovery of horse meat in export beef cartons of the Profreeze company by the Victorian Department of Agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I answered the honourable senator at that time and clarified my original answer to the Senate when further information became available (Hansard, page 578).</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> A considerable number of cartons of meat of the Profreeze company destined for the domestic market were examined whilst in cold storage. Although labelled as beef, the cartons were found to contain dye-stained horsemeat, presumably of knackery origin. These cartons of meat presented a serious threat to human health in that nothing was known of the disease status of the animals butchered not of the cleanliness of the premises in which it had been produced. All cartons were subsequently destroyed by rendering under the control of the Australian Federal Police and the Victorian State Department of Agriculture.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Department of Primary Production advises that a large quantity of horse meat regularly leaves the Northern Territory as pet meat. The Department also advises that, at present, there is no requirement for the registration of shooters or dealers in pet meat in the Northern Territory, but that new legislation is under consideration which may include such a provision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1981 (Hansard, Page 722) Senator Coleman asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. Her question concerned the export of chicken meat from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry does not provide inspection for export poultry meat and does not certify it as having been inspected. Rather certification is to the effect that the poultry has been killed and packed in export registered premises. This is accepted by those countries which import out poultry meat, hence the trade referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> Contamination of poultry meat by salmonella bacteria cannot be detected by visual examination, requiring instead laboratory tests. Countries which import Australian poultry meat do not require such tests, and so there are no plans to introduce them with respect to export product. In regard to the domestic market, this is a matter for appropriate State or Territory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Salmonella bacteria are widely distributed and may contaminate poultry meat at various points in the distribution chain. However they are readily killed by adequate cooking and do not pose a health hazard under normal circumstances. The Department of Primary Industry therefore considers present controls adequate and has no proposals at this stage to increase its involvement in the poultry meat industry.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to a report in the Melbourne Age newspaper of 10 September concerning aid to the 31 poorest countries. That article reports that a recent United Nations conference determined that aid-giving countries should allocate a target of 0.15 per cent of their gross national product to these least developed countries. Australia did not oppose this determination at the conference. In fact, yesterday the Australian Foreign Minister was reported as saying that 'industrialised countries would be asked to carry the biggest share of the burden' in aiding the world's poorest countries. As Australia's total aid contribution is merely approximately 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, can the Minister say what proportion of this amount in fact is directed to the 31 countries defined by the UN as being the world's poorest? Will the Minister agree that once again the domestic policies of this Government do not conform to the international rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference on 29 January 1980 the Minister for Primary Industry indicated that, if there were costs to pay as a result of the restrictions imposed on the sale of grain to the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics in support of similar United States restrictions in response to the situation in Afghanistan, the costs must be borne by the whole Australian community, and not just by primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Yellow Maize Marketing Board for the State of New South Wales (Maize Board) sought compensation of $89,533, which amount included $36,000 owing by it to the Oilseeds Marketing Board for the State of New South Wales (Oilseeds Board) as a result of undertakings provided by the Maize Board on 19 February 1980. The Maize Board subsequently indicated to me that it had advised the Oilseeds Board to take the matter up with the Government direct and sought compensation of $53,533 in respect of its other costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has rejected the Maize Board's claim for compensation. No other claims for compensation were received from maize growers (or indeed other primary industry bodies or producers) as a result of the Government's decision to support the US partial embargo on grain sales to the USSR.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Following the Maize Board's letter informing me (a copy of which the Maize Board sent to the Oilseeds Board) that it had advised the Oilseeds Board to take up the matter of its outstanding debt directly with the Government, the Oilseeds Board wrote to me indicating that it did not have, nor would it have, a claim for compensation against the Commonwealth Government for $36,000 owing to it by the Maize Board; that it had never requested the Maize Board to make a claim against the Commonwealth Government on its behalf; and that it wished to disassociate itself completely and absolutely from the Maize Board's letter to me.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am advised that the Maize Board was never provided with assurances that it would receive compensation. Consistent with the Minister for Primary Industry's statement to the 1980 National Agricultural Outlook Conference, the Minister provided telex advice to the Maize Board on 31 January and 26 February 1980 that he was prepared to take a demonstrated case of loss to the Government for consideration. The Minister also indicated the evidence the Board would need to provide to enable the Government to assess any losses claimed. In particular, the Minister indicated that it would be necessary for the Board to provide detailed documentary evidence of relevant market circumstances prior to and after 5 January 1980, the date President Carter announced the US restrictions on grain sales to the USSR.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the advice provided by the Minister for Primary Industry, the relevant question is whether the on-farm returns to growers were less than they would have been in the absence of the embargo. On the basis of figures provided by the Maize Board, this was not the case. Because a premium domestic market had developed at the same time as a result of the drought feed requirement, the actual on-farm returns to growers associated with the proposed exports were above the returns that would have resulted from the embargoed USSR sale. Growers were therefore not disadvantaged by the Minister for Primary Industry's decision to disallow the proposed sale.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As announced by the Prime Minister on 13 June 1980, the compensation guidelines were drawn up having regard to the essential principles which had been applied in consideration of such ex gratia payments by the Government over the last decade or so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Assistance to industry is provided in a number of ways which include direct outlays and taxation concessions such as those mentioned by the honourable senator. Direct assistance and assistance through such concessions have similar effects on the Budget outcome, the former on the outlays side and the latter on the receipts side. Taxation concessions are, indeed, often called 'tax expenditures'.</PARA>
<PARA> Year by year, in Statement No. 3 of Budget Paper No. 1, a figure is given for what is described as 'net direct industry assistance'. This constitutes predonderantly direct outlays and can, therefore, be costed with a high degree of accuracy from Government accounts. Similarly, at first in Statement No. 3 but more recently in Statement No. 4, assistance to industry through the taxation system is summarised. Estimates are not, and cannot be, given for every form of assistance and, where estimates are given, the degree of accuracy varies with the concession.</PARA>
<PARA> Particular difficulties attach to estimating the cost to revenue of concessions like double depreciation which do not confer greater deductions over the life of an asset than would otherwise be allowed but do allow alterations of timing. The estimates of revenue forgone in respect of double depreciation that have been included in the Budget documents and in the table below represent the immediate impact on income tax revenue of the deduction in each of the years concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the cost to revenue of a taxation concession, not being a Budget outlay in a strict sense, can be expressed as a proportion of Budget outlays proper only in an analogous way.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Definite steps towards meeting the Government's objective include the introduction of a national broadcasting development program solely for remote areas and a much broader three year plan for the extension of national broadcasting and television services. The areas included in these plans to date represent only the first stages of an ongoing concept which is reviewed annually.</PARA>
<PARA> Although there is at present no provision in the three year plan for the further development of the national broadcasting service in the Snake Bay area, I am advised by my Department that the district has been included in its engineering field survey program, with a view to recommending, in due course, that the provision of facilities to serve the area be included on a future three year plan.</PARA>
<PARA> Private funding of a national translator may also be an attractive alternative for the people of Melville Island to consider. In this regard I am able to advise that as a result of recent amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, it is now possible for a community group to fund the establishment of a national television translator station, and obtain, through the normal licensing process for broadcasting services, a licence to operate it. It is envisaged that communities wishing to pursue this option, as a means of obtaining an earlier service than possible under the Government's normal planning, will be reimbursed by the Commonwealth. However, such reimbursement would only apply to installations of an approved technical standard.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the above, the proposed domestic communications satellite system, to be operational by the mid-eighties, may prove the most effective means by which direct national television reception could be provided to Melville Island. Accordingly, I have asked my Department to note your representations in regard to the future planning of domestic satellite services.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic difficulties do not necessarily involve an erosion of safety standards although it would be fair to say that safety standards may come under pressure in times of financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA> As I previously stated, the Government is greatly concerned about aviation safety and in fact has recently instituted two significant measures to increase the safety of operations of light aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, subsequent to a review of pilot standards conducted in 1977, the Department of Transport has introduced a requirement that all private and commercial pilots not subject to some other form of proficiency check by either the Department or industry approved pilots, shall have their flying proficiency and aeronautical knowledge reviewed at two-year intervals.</PARA>
