Were meetings of the Ministerial Committee on Public Information attended by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Eggleton, as reported in yesterday's Age? At these meetings was Mr Eggleton able to obtain information about market research and advertising not available to other political parties? Did Mr Eggleton, at any time, suggest a line of briefing for market research companies engaged on any Government project? Did the Committee deal with Government funded projects which led to commissions for the Liberal Party advertising agency, D'Arcy-McManus and Masius Pty Ltd, or for the Party's polling organisations, Morgan Gallup or Task Quantum?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy and refers to what I will call and affirm to be the River Murray crisis. Does the Minister recall the major recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution of some 10 years ago that as a matter of urgency a national water commission be established? Will he examine that recommendation and note both its constitutional and Federal concept? Is he aware that these recommendations are reinforced by contemporary findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment? Will he acknowledge the value of these statements and persuade the Government either to heed them or to take steps to give some immediate authority to the existing and, as it was described in the Adelaide Advertiser, toothless River Murray Commission? Will he give an assurance that the nation will be spared yet another time consuming inquiry and that the Murray system will be treated as being as important to Australia as, for example, the energy situation with its present emphasis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter raised in the question, of course, is very important. Primarily it is important to South Australia which is downstream of the confluence of the Murray and Darling rivers, but also it is of importance to the other sharing States of New South Wales and Victoria. As to the first part of the question, yes I am aware of the previous Senate report and of its significance. I will obtain a further copy of it and put it under further study. I am also aware of its recommendations and that a subsequent committee on science and the environment reinforced certain of these conclusions. The States and the Commonwealth are currently in full discussion to obtain a complete redrafting of an agreement on the River Murray. There are now only two matters in dispute. We are endeavouring to hasten their resolution. I do not believe that the Commission report is toothless. Of course, one would like to have more capacity to enforce certain matters, but in a federation what is required in terms of progress is a consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that our ability to determine at any time any potential significant changes in the flow of these river systems, by way of quantity or quality, will bring about a sufficiency of exposure to enable the right amount of dialogue for the appropriate action to be taken. If other reforms are necessary along the journey, we will put them under study. I acknowledge on behalf of the Government the importance of the River Murray, including the importance of the increased salinity aggravated by the drought, particularly in the Darling area. I am aware of the Maunsell report. All these things are under study. We intend to act upon them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Carrick both in his capacity as Leader of the Government in the Senate and in his capacity as Minister representing the Prime Minister. I ask whether it is the case that until late last year there existed a special committee of Cabinet-known as the Intelligence and Security Committee-the functions of which were described, for example, in the Prime Minister's Press release of 4 February 1979 as being:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to set overall policy and oversee the work of the intelligence community.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask whether it is the case that, following the Prime Minister's announcement of a new Cabinet committee structure on 25 November 1980, that Committee has now disappeared except insofar as the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee is now described as existing:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to consider matters concerned with international relations, defence, intelligence and security.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it thus the case that there is no Cabinet committee charged with the detailed oversight of security organisations and that the detailed supervision and control of such bodies is now effectively in the hands of the Prime Minister alone? Finally, I ask: To what extent is this development linked, if not with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's newly identified status as a creation of the KGB, then at least with the new and apparently even more sensitive functions now being exercised by the Australian Security Intelligence Service-ASIS-following Mr Justice Hope's recently revealed recommendations?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Evans has stated the facts in regard to the earlier Intelligence and Security Committee. Today its essential functions are absorbed in the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of Cabinet. That Committee, in conjunction with the Prime Minister and in association with the Attorney-General, would have a primary responsibility in regard to security. I do not believe that the oversight by Cabinet of security has been weakened in any way. On the contrary, the Prime Minister has laid great stress upon the need for full intelligence and security understanding. I see no weakening at all on this matter. Indeed, I believe that the present arrangements give a full oversight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the recent decision of the Reagan Administration to lift the ban on sales of military equipment to Argentina and to move away from the United States of America's previous emphasis on human rights in dealing with Argentina and other South American countries. I ask the Minister to comment on the statement of the State Department spokesman, Mr William Dyess, that the abnormality in United States-Argentine relations was due in large part to the Carter Administration's outspoken position on human affairs and that future criticism of human rights violations in authoritarian but friendly countries such as Argentina would be conducted in private. In view of the prompt, vigorous and commendable actions taken and representations made by the former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Argentina and other South American countries on many human rights issues, can the Senate be assured that the Australian Government has no intention of varying its policy and attitudes to suit the convenience of these authoritarian regimes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It was made clear to the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was in Washington that the United States of America is not downgrading its concern for human rights. The Secretary of State told him that the new Administration was as sensitive to human rights issues as any previous administration had been but it believed that human rights concerns were best pursued in private through diplomatic channels rather than in public. He said that, however unpleasant some of the authoritarian regimes of the Right may be, there was no point in undermining them publicly on human rights grounds to the point where they would be replaced by even more repressive totalitarian regimes of the Left. Our own commitment to international action to protect and promote human rights remains firm. We will continue to use opportunities which present themselves both privately, with governments, and through bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to make our concerns known.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which also concerns human rights, is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I draw the Minister's attention to the grisly and appalling photograph on the front page of the Age of 21 March which depicts the sulphuric acid-caused wounds of one of the El Salvadoran Government's torture victims. Is the Minister aware that such Government-approved torture of political prisoners is part of the daily life of El Salvador? Does the Minister not agree that it is both pathetic and farcical for El Salvadoran junta leaders such as Jose Antonio Morales to deny the existence of Government-sponsored torture in the face of graphic evidence to the contrary? Does the Minister now regret the Prime Minister's statement of 5 March that the United States of America is 'entirely right' in its policy of military support for the El Salvadoran junta? Would the Minister not agree that the United States could be making the same mistake now as it did in Vietnam 20 years ago in seeking military solutions where these are not applicable? Will the Government use its close and friendly relations with the United States Administration to dissuade it from aiding the torturers and right wing death squads which are now parading in El Salvador?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="657" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see the photograph in the Age. I will have a look at it. I am aware that suggestions have been made that there has been torture in El Salvador. Of course, the Government would reject and be thoroughly opposed to all such actions. The Government, in the expression of its attitude on El Salvador, in fact expressed precisely the viewpoint given by Senator John Wheeldon from the Opposition benches some time ago. I commend that speech to honourable senators as a good statement of the circumstances in that unhappy country. The country is in misery and has great extremes of poverty and wealth and great overcrowding. It is a country which has had oppression, which has had a change and which is now also being invaded by outside subversive elements with-as is alleged-Cuban influences. Senator Wheeldon pointed out that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Government does not support torture or duress at all. El Salvador is in a form of agony at this moment. A great belief in the world is that the best way to get the country out of its misery and back to a form of freedom would be to offer support to human beings to raise their living standards, to free them from the subversion that is suppressing them and to lift them upwards. I think that would be a very significant thing to do. Indeed, that view was expressed by Senator Wheeldon-an Australian Labor Party senator who was, I think, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Therefore, he must have been expressing, in his day, the viewpoints of the Labor Party of the past if not of the present.</PARA>

I wish to ask the Minister for the views of himself and the Government and not Senator Wheeldon's views, which I respect but with which I disagree. I want the Government's views. That is the purpose of my question. I was interested to hear the Minister say that he had heard of suggestions of torture in El Salvador. I ask the Minister whether he is persuaded that government-sponsored torture does exist in El Salvador. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government does not support torture in any form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp, if he looks at the Hansard report of what I said, will see that I in fact indicated the Government views. I said that the Government views are in parallel with those of Senator Wheeldon and I then went on to state what those views are. Of course, the Government does not tolerate torture in any way. I am not in a position to know the facts. If Senator Chipp asked me as John Carrick I would have to say: 'Yes, I believe there is evidence that torture has occurred'. Yes, I would have to say that, and I would abhor that situation. The Government holds the view that was respectably put forward by Senator Wheeldon as a former Labor Chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, namely, that the best way to help that unhappy country is to help it internally, through its existing systems, to lift itself up and to give itself a better living standard. The alternative is to leave the country to the communist-type subversion that has been accurately reported, I think, in terms of the Cubans and others.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted the reports in the newspapers of Senator Tate's remarks following my statement on this matter to the Press on Sunday. I do not think he referred particularly to this aspect of the matter. He is seeking some information as to whether a scientific survey was undertaken in respect of my conclusion that obviously some people were affected emotionally and were in a state of anxiety as a result of publicity about agent orange. In relation to that I can give the honourable senator this information: This claim has been put to me by no less a person than the President of the Vietnam Veterans Association, Mr Holt McMinn, as a clear understanding of some of the difficulties that are faced by Vietnam veterans. Furthermore, I have personally had a number of contacts with veterans and also had calls to my office with regard to this matter. There is no doubt, in my opinion, that there is in the community a very genuine feeling that a number of veterans are having their anxieties and feelings raised above all realisation and all possibility of their ever being settled. This has come about by virtue of some sensational media coverage of this matter based on a relatively small number of cases.</PARA></TALK.START>

Also a number of studies are being undertaken by the United States veterans administration, and we are anxiously awaiting that information. That does not disturb the point I am making, namely, that some cases which have been sensationalised by the media, and by politicians in some instances, have led to the sharpening and heightening of anxieties amongst some veterans to the extent that they feel that there is only one solution to their problem, and that is the herbicide matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to an article which appeared in the West Australian of Thursday, 12 March 1981, and which was titled: 'Kanga Wine a Hit'. The article informed us that a special South Australian wine, marketed in Britain as Kanga Rouge, had been chosen as the wine of the month by the highly respected British journal Decanter. The wine is apparently a 1978 Chateau Reynella made from shiraz grapes grown at Coonawarra. Is this article true? If so, does the Government think that marketing a good quality wine with such a name makes Australia lose face in the eyes of the world wine industry? Will the Government consider asking exporters not to market Australian wine by satirical means?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator may have unwittingly hurt the feelings of whoever is marketing this wine; that person may not regard the name 'Kanga Rouge' as at all satirical. I am not in a position to confirm that the article is accurate although the advice I have had from the Department of Primary Industry would appear to indicate that the wine has been recognised in the way the honourable senator suggests. I am aware that some Australians hold the view that the use of colloquial names such as 'kanga' based on Australian animals and birds creates an unfavourable impression about wines. I note that you, Mr President, have avoided the temptation to put a similar name to the wine that you produce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appears that in the instant case, notwithstanding the view of the honourable senator and those of us who like something a little more along the lines of a Coonawarra or a Chateau Reynella shiraz, this wine is being marketed quite satisfactorily and no doubt any view that I express would be regarded as irrelevant by the people who are doing so. What is important is that the quality of the product from Australia is good. I think that all honourable senators will be aware that the Australian Wine Board monitors the quality of wines exported from Australia. It appears from the article referred to that the wine mentioned by the honourable senator is living up to the standards that we hope would be achieved by the Australian product. I am sure that all honourable senators will be delighted at the recognition it has achieved in the journal Decanter.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that in the Minister's statement on the weekend he implied, as he implied in his answer today, that one of the problems with the Vietnam veterans and the agent orange situation is that they have insufficient knowledge of the difficulties and therefore are likely to be emotionally affected by the sort of media reports that have been forthcoming on this subject? Would it not be better for Vietnam veterans if they had more detailed knowledge of the problem?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the question about insufficient knowledge, I think it should be crystal clear to Senator Grimes that the main purpose of the epidemiological study proceeding at present is to establish whether in fact there is any link between the physical or psychological disabilities of Vietnam veterans and the use of herbicides in Vietnam. We are awaiting the result of that study. Consequently, there is that information which will establish a scientific base for any decision which the Government might need to make. Senator Grimes has referred to a report. I point out that what the honourable senator refers to is not, in fact, a report but a collection of various pieces of literature relating to herbicides and their use in Vietnam. This was referred to by the previous Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Evan Adermann, in a statement at about the end of February, I believe. It was made quite public and it has been known by this Parliament and by members of the public generally that this information has been available within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I hasten to add that the author of that report-if it can be called one; I repeat that it is a collation of various printed articles on this matter-himself acknowledges that it is not scientific evidence and would in no way supplant, be superior to or be useful to the Government in reaching its decision. In fact, the epidemiological study which is proceeding is the only basis for that.</PARA></TALK.START>

In that case, why has the report not been made public? Would it not be useful for those assisting Vietnam veterans who believe they have been affected?

In that case it does not seem necessary to provide that information because, as I have already said to Senator Grimes, the information is drawn in such a way as to be merely a collation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to note that the repeal of the Aboriginal affairs legislation of itself would not affect the status of the reserves in Queensland. Queensland Aboriginal reserves are reserves under the Lands Act of that State and it would require action under that legislation to abolish them. That is the first point we need to understand. The Queensland Premier has said already that no action would be taken on the question of abolishing either Act without full consultation with the Aboriginal people. I have already had friendly and, I must say, very useful communications with the new Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland, Mr Ken Tomkins, and in fact I will be visiting some Aboriginal communities with him in a few weeks. In these circumstances and in view of the consultations which have been promised, it is really quite foolish to talk about Commonwealth intervention at this stage. I was advised as recently as this morning by Mr Tomkins that further consultations are to take place when the Aboriginal council set up in Queensland meets in Brisbane the week after next with the Queensland Government. I think that is the week beginning 6 April. I think we should at least wait to see what those meetings bring forth.</PARA></TALK.START>

Because it is new oil, it will not attract an oil levy as old oil has done. I understood that the Australian Labor Party also had a policy that did not propose to put a tax on new oil.

Of course, the aim is to give the River Murray Commission the ability to have an effective overview, to be able to know what is likely to happen not only in regard to the quantity of water but also in regard to the quality of water along the way and to be able to present the evidence of what will happen. One would hope that, through the members of the Commission, the necessary steps would be taken. We believe that a significant step in the journey will be achieved by getting the new agreement signed. If there is any necessity to do more, and if it can be done, we will take those steps. We fully understand the vital nature of getting an adequate volume of water and quality of water down the River Murray to South Australia. That will be a primary target on our part.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. No doubt the Minister has taken note that today South Australian senators have been questioning him on the problem of and the concern about both the quality and the quantity of water in the River Murray system. Is it not a fact that the River Murray Commission mostly does have control over water quantity but has very little control at present over water quality? Is this not a fact because the Commission has virtually no say over the river systems feeding into the main trunk stream of the River Murray? Is it not a fact that, in part, these problems arise because no recommendation can be made by the River Murray Commission unless it has the unanimous support of its members? Will the Government make every effort to rectify this anomaly so that recommendations by the River Murray Commission can be made by a majority decision rather than unanimously as at present and so that the Commission can also have greater power over the quality of water flowing into the system in addition to the water flowing down the main stream?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge in general terms that what Senator Young states is the basic facts of the situation. Of course, it is true that there is a keen interest by all the States and the Commonwealth in the quantity of water. It is equally true that a main preoccupation of the Commonwealth and others at this moment is water quality arising from the prior action of States within their sovereign territories higher up the river system. That is where the nub of the problem lies; they have total sovereignty. Unless we get voluntary co-operation, the journey will be so much the harder. One of the main points we are seeking at this moment is to have the States, in particular New South Wales, let the River Murray Commission know well ahead any significant actions on their part upstream which will alter not only water quantity but also water quality. I stress the words 'significant actions'. That matter will be looked at. Equally, of course--</PARA></TALK.START>

Like the questions asked earlier this month, as well as those asked earlier today by Senator Davidson, Senator Bishop and Senator Young, my question concerns South Australia's alarm at the quality and quantity of water in the River Murray. Is the Minister aware that, despite the welcome and useful statements he has made in the Senate about progress in determining new purposes and powers for the River Murray Commission, the people of South Australia continue daily to express enormous concern that the proposed new arrangements for the River Murray Commission will still fall far short of solving the pollution problem? I emphasise that more than half of all water used in South Australia-whether in Adelaide or country areas, and whether for domestic or industrial use-comes from the River Murray. It is quite truly the lifeline of South Australia. I ask the Minister: What guarantees can the Commonwealth seek to achieve, in the national interest and in the interest of South Australia, to reduce the one million tonnes of salt exported down the river to South Australia from Victoria and New South Wales? I ask about reductions, particularly noting the alarming danger of increases in salinity which would follow were the Darling River irrigation licences now proposed in New South Wales to be granted.

Senator Teague, Senator Davidson and Senator Young are today putting the whole River Murray agreement in jeopardy by levelling their criticisms at the New South Wales Government and letting the Victorian Government completely off the hook.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the great concern of the people of South Australia about the quantity and quality of the water flowing down the Murray. I am aware that the people of South Australia depend very significantly upon the River Murray. I am equally aware of the salinity question. The Maunsell report, of course, is available. There has been some argument as to the sources of salinity and whether it is from parts of Victoria or from parts of the Darling. That is a controversy that I do not enter into. For example, in the Darling at this moment, due to the drought, there is more salinity coming down because of the dry salt pans. A lot of anti-salinity work is being done at this moment, and that will be expedited. As to the Government's seeking to bring about a moratorium on irrigation, I do not think any Commonwealth government could intervene at the State level on what are solely sovereign powers. What a Commonwealth government can do, and what this Government is doing, is to indicate to the States that any significant extension of irrigation, of riparian rights, would influence the quantity and quality of water. The Government is seeking to bring about a situation in which the River Murray Commission will get to know each episode which could vary these things and, therefore, can adjudicate on what is happening along the river. We will concentrate on this matter. We want to get the best agreement we can. We will look at it in action and, if further action is necessary, we will take it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek the indulgence of the Senate to speak very briefly on this matter. It is of particular interest to me basically because Northern Territory coastal waters are involved. I realise, of course, that the area runs over into Queensland and Western Australia, but the majority of the area to be fished is in Northern Territory coastal waters. I have visited a number of the vessels and seen the conditions under which the Taiwanese fishermen carry out their work. I have been involved in Darwin with meetings to discuss the facilities that ought to be made available for the groups of sailors who will stay overnight in Darwin, and I have talked to Northern Territory fishermen about the total situation in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not read the agreement, but I think it is possible to make a few general comments without having done so. Firstly, I query the return to the Australian people from the exploitation of this Australian resource. I am given to understand that the licence fees charged-the figures may be different when I read the agreement, but my figure is $35 a metre-do not cover the costs of surveillance, of supervision on board the ships or of the inspection of ships' licences. The costs involved are not met by the licence fees which are charged. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my contention-as I think it would be of any honourable senators sitting in this place-that licences should cover more than the costs. This plus of which I am speaking could be used to encourage Australian industry. I will be interested to read the agreement, and to see the sorts of royalties involved and the returns to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Two claims have been made publicly in the Northern Territory. I do not know whether they have been made elsewhere. One claim concerns the fact that there is no return to the Australian people from this agreement whereby there is the fishing in our waters by Taiwanese boats. It has been claimed that it actually costs us money to have the ships there. The second claim is that the total return is less than $1m a year. I suppose that one has to assess the costs of surveillance and wonder whether that ought to be covered by licences and so on. I will be very interested to read about this matter in the report. I am very concerned about the fishing methods used by the Taiwanese. It has been alleged to me by professional fishermen and others involved in the industry in the Northern Territory that the Taiwanese adopt a method which would not be accepted by Australian fishermen or the Australian people. The Taiwanese work on the basis of fishing out an area completely and taking everything that is available. These methods are not used by Australian fishermen for the very reason that such a method fishes out all sizes and all types of fish and virtually cleans an area out. I repeat that these methods are not acceptable to Australian fishermen. It has been said to me by people who work in the industry that as a final step the Taiwanese use explosives to get everything in a particular area. I do not have to explain to the Senate the problems associated with this method of cleaning out an area entirely and leaving no resources behind. </PARA>
<PARA> These are, I understand, serious allegations. They were made to me very seriously. People are concerned for the resources around our coast. This problem highlights, of course, the need for supervision of foreign fishing boats as they work in Australian waters. But that is not the only need. There is also a need for consultation with industry. I was particularly interested to read the submission made to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce by the Australian Fishing Industry Council. I understand that the Committee met last week. As the submission is now a public document I shall read from it. I was interested to read the Council's comments about consultation with the fishing industry. The submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are strongly of the opinion that both State and Commonwealth Governments have a responsibility to adequately consult with the industry over which they have administrative control;</PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>The principal responsibility of the Commonwealth is to ensure the 'Australianisation' of the Australian Fishing Zone. By Australianisation of the AFZ we mean that the Australian Government should, in all bilateral and multilateral negotiations regarding the AFZ, adopt an attitude of 'overt favouritism' to the Australian fisherman. </PARA>
<PARA>The submission further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not uncommon to hear the comment that the land mass of Australia has been turned into a vast quarry for foreign mining companies. Whether you subscribe to that particular ideology or not, we fear that the AFZ could come to be regarded as a vast marine quarry for the more sophisticated foreign fishing fleet if we do not make it abundantly clear to guest nations that they are here as guests and will be politely but firmly asked to withdraw as the Australian industry expands its areas of operations throughout the AFZ. </PARA>
<PARA>I support this view strongly and I know that the Northern Territory Professional Fishermen's Association also supports it. I will look at the agreement very closely, when we have a copy, to see whether the Government supports this view also. I know that the licences are issued annually but I wonder about the philosophy behind this. Can we look towards an Australianisation of our industry and a movement away, over the years, from the present Taiwanese group taking into account, of course, the comments I made earlier concerning the methods used by the Taiwanese and the effect this has on our resources. We hear a lot about the multiplier effect. I wonder what it is in this instance. I understand that the bunkering and victualling process presents no return at all to Australia. This process is covered by boats in their main ports or by other ships. I know that we do not have much processing on the north coast but I wonder whether there is some suggestion in the agreement that if we have processing plants erected there will be some requirement on foreign fishing vessels to use them? I wonder whether the small ship facility is required to be used. I understand that this is not the case and that ships return to their home bases. I would want to see some return from that aspect as well. I will be looking to see whether there is in the Agreement any obligation on foreign vessels to use this facility. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that I had been involved in some discussions about visiting sailors coming into the Port of Darwin. The suggestion was made that we should have some type of sailors' rest facility, that boats should be encouraged to stay overnight and that sailors should be given some time to come ashore. My information in respect of the multiplier effects is that the sailors have nothing to spend. The workmen on the boat do not get paid until they return to Taiwan. I am told that the only people who have money to spend are the two officers on board-the captain and the radio officer-and that they buy only those things which they cannot bring with them from Taiwan. So we will be looking not only for a return from the fishery resource but also something from the multiplier effects as well. </PARA>
<PARA> How can we encourage the Australian fishing industry? Firstly, we must make finance available. This is one of the points made in the submission by the Australian Fishing Industry Council. I notice that Senator Archer, who is interested in this subject, is taking a keen interest in what I am saying. I hope he will make a contribution either today or at a later stage on this matter of the provision of finance because at the present time it is not readily available to the Australian fishing industry. I will not go through all of the details because the information is set out in the submission but I do know that finance is not available from banks such as the Commonwealth Development Bank or from any of those groups which we hope would support this primary industry. I have suggested one alternative method of raising finance, that is, the use of additional money from licences to encourage industry development. This could be done by a form of loans or in some other way. I hope that the Government will be able to find some way to encourage banks to lend money to the fishing industry so that individuals can become established.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the regulations imposed on the fishing industry should be checked to see, firstly, whether they are too stringent and, secondly, whether the application of the regulations is consistent from year to year. The Australian Fishing Industry Council stated in its submission:</PARA>
<PARA>Fishing is a highly regulated industry. To the extent that our resources are limited and vulnerable to over-exploitation, this principle of regulation is welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that we are afflicted with seemingly endless rules, amended rules, revised rules, substituted rules, ad infinitum, over a myriad of issues, such as labelling and packaging of our product for export, we are less than amused. More seriously, the Australian Fishing Industry has been, and is currently being, placed at a severe marketing disadvantage in world markets as a result of the added cost of meeting Government requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>In brief let me say that the fishery resource is ours. It belongs to the Australian people. I have put forward a proposition that we should benefit from this resource. I have raised the question of whether we are benefiting and if so, are we benefiting to the full or even sufficiently under the present conditions. I look forward to reading the Agreement to see how much return there is to be to the Australian people-how much Government encouragement there is to the Australian fishing industry. I repeat my concern about the fishing methods that the Taiwanese use. I once again draw attention to the absolute necessity for the Government to supervise this industry. I look forward to seeing in the Agreement what arrangements have been made in this regard. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I want to make two points in regard to this matter. The first confirms, or is a parallel to, what Senator Robertson has just said but it relates not so much to the Northern Territory as it does to the North West Shelf. In the first place, I believe it would be unfair and certainly a dog in the manger attitude for Australians to say that we should not allow any of our fishery products to be made available to the people of Asia who need them so badly. At the same time, I think it is going too far along the path of charity if we actually do this to the extent that we disadvantage our own industry and our own people in a fairly serious way, and I understand that this is what is happening. Indeed, that is the view put by the Australian Fishing Industry Council on North West Shelf fishing by the Taiwanese. The Council's contention is that the pattern of fishing by the Taiwanese on the North West Shelf will make it uneconomic for an Australian boat to work that area and will probably make it uneconomic to work the area for many years or possibly for even decades to come, the reason being that the people in Asia who the Taiwanese supply have a predilection for very small fish, wasteful though that would seem to us. Indeed, it is wasteful. They do not want large fish; they want small fish. For that reason we have apparently come to an agreement with the Taiwanese on the size of trawling nets. The mesh limitation is only 50 millimetres on nets used by trawlers working the North West Shelf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also gather from the Australian Fishing Industry Council that the Taiwanese put one net inside another. This virtually halves the net size and the size of the fish caught. To use the old terminology they are catching fish as small as one inch long. I gather that these are snapper and bream, the sort of fish which, if allowed to grow to maturity, would be perfectly satisfactory for the Australian market. Further, the Australian Fishing Industry Council makes a very serious claim that this is one of the major fishing grounds of Australia. We are having to import fish. It was said to me by members of the Council that they would have no doubt that if this fishing ground were allowed to develop so it would be fished by Australian vessels we would not have to import fish. So, we have got ourselves into a ridiculous Gilbertian situation. We are allowing the starving millions of Asia to catch fish an inch long-and the fish are not being allowed to grow any bigger-while at the same time we are forcing ourselves into the situation where we will have to import fish permanently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats ask whether we should try to negotiate this situation a little further. I do not believe that our fisheries should be depleted to the extent of supplying merely a matter of taste. It is a fact that the people of Asia will be nourished just as easily on fish a foot long as on fish an inch long, except if the fish are only small a lot more will be required to make up the catch. This is a serious matter. It is serious to our fishing industry which needs all the support it can get. It is suffering now because of a reverse action of the economies of scale. Our fishing industry is not the size that it wants to be. If we bring in new modern boats we will need fishing grounds where fish which suit the Australian taste can be caught. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise my second point more briefly. We are on the verge of having our first research ships of marine science built in Australia. The Australian Democrats make the plea on this matter that we have made so many other times: Can these ships be built in Australia? I have no doubt that that question could be answered in one way. Of course, it is possible to build them in Australia. We are asking that a reasonable view be taken of the economics of this matter so that we may have the opportunity of getting our shipbuilding industry back on the ground again instead of witnessing the constant destruction of our industries one after another to the benefit of foreigners. If this cannot be done, and if a tender goes to a foreign builder-in spite of the best wishes I believe of most Australians who would like to see these ships built here-Australians should have some share in the project, either by way of a joint venture or some similiar arrangement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke on 20 November 1979 I pointed out that I would not speak too long because I had come to an agreement with the Government that a reference be given to a Senate standing committee. That reference is referred to on page 2556 of the Senate Hansard of 20 November. The motion that I moved, by leave, and which was agreed to stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce: The Commonwealth's responsibility for the development of the Australian fishing industry following the declaration of 200 mile off-shore sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur with everything that my colleague, Senator Robertson, said today on the tabling of this agreement. I note that Senator Archer is in the chamber. He is now the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. The previous Chairman, Senator Sheil, is no longer a member of the Senate. As that reference was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce on 20 November 1979 I would be interested to know from Senator Archer how far he has gone in that inquiry or whether he has started it. If the Committee has not started its inquiry, I think some criticism should be levelled at the fact that we are now entering into a further agreement with people in Taiwan which allows access to the Australian fishing zone by fishing vessels operating out of and owned in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague, Senator Robertson, said, we need to see that our resources are used for the benefit of Australian citizens and not foreign countries. The whole purpose of having that reference given to a Senate standing committee was to have a look into where the Australian fishing industry was going and whether our local fishermen were getting any benefit from our national resources. I think that matter is of great importance. That opinion was expressed to me by many people in the fishing industry. I have not mentioned the matter since the agreement was tabled here on 20 November 1979. I hoped that the committee of inquiry would be well under way and that it would not be long before a report was tabled in the Senate. I am not aware as to how far that inquiry has proceeded. I hope that Senator Archer will inform the Senate of the present stage of the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I will comment on the progress of this hearing and on the remarks made by the three previous speakers. I will start at the end. Senator McLaren raised the question of whether the agreement was the same one that was brought down in 1979. This agreement has been introduced 12 months after the first one. The present agreement has quite a few variations from the first one. The agreement was reached at a meeting at which the Australian Fishing Industry Council, the fishermen's own organisation, was represented. It was present at the discussions and negotiations. A lot of stories are pursued by various people as to all the things that are wrong with the fishing that is carried out in particular by the Taiwanese. Very few of these stories are available to us in evidence. Most of them are hearsay by people who have never been to sea with the Taiwanese, seen the gear they have or inspected the catch that they produce. I caution people from repeating some of the allegations that are made in case they give some credibility to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a responsibility, nationally, to look after the Australian nationals. Certainly the Governments policy is that it should look after the Australian fisherman first. The Australianisation of the industry is the prime consideration in all of these negotiations. Beyond that we have an international requirement that we should make any resource available that we do not use. The amount of catch that is allocated in the agreement that has been tabled today is a very conservative proportion of what is believed to be the available catch on an annual sustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce called applications for evidence 12 months ago. Evidence has come in; Committee hearings began here last week. We have had the first three days of hearings and have taken evidence from various government departments, from the Australian Fishing Industry Council and from other witnesses. We will start some field work in about a week's time. I think that is where we are up to at the moment. We will endeavour to keep all the hearings open to everybody who is interested. Senator McLaren and others are welcome to come and participate in the hearings at any stage that they so desire. It is the intention of the Committee that we should give everybody the opportunity to participate in both giving evidence and listening to it. We hope to have the completed report brought down in the Parliament during the Budget session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the honour to represent the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association at the meeting of the CPA Study Group on Parliament and the Scrutiny of Science Policy in Ottawa from 23 November to 27 November 1980. This was the second of the study groups initiated by the Executive Committee of the Association and financed by its newly-established working capital fund. The study group comprised delegates from seven branches of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association-the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India, Singapore, Kenya, Trinidad and Tobago-selected and invited by the General Assembly of the Association and representing its seven geographical regions, and a representative from the kindred group of the Congress of the United States. The Chairman was Lord Sherfield, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., former President of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, Chairman of the Imperial College of Science and Deputy Chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology. The Rapporteur was Mr D. N. Clay, Chief, Science and Technology Division, Research Branch of the Canadian Library of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the small number involved, the participants quickly established a personal rapport. The discussions were a very good exercise in the exchange of information, communication and mutual support. The industrialised countries found that they shared common problems in the domestic and international fields. The less developed countries were rather more concerned with information and advice relevant to specific scientific and technological initiatives that had already been taken. Throughout the discussions there was emphasis on the need for a readily accessible bank of information which would help parliamentarians to understand better how science and technology can be harnessed to serve the nation. The discussions of the study group clearly demonstrated that there is a general awareness among parliamentarians of the massive impact that scientific and technological development will have on the lifestyle on this, the next and future generations of mankind and on national welfare and progress, and can have on international understanding, co-operation and independence. Several members, however, evidenced their concern that the curricula of our educational institutions at university and technical college level is not keeping pace with research and the implementation of new techniques. There was a consensus that the legislature, through the Executive, should give a positive lead in the framing of national educational objectives. Such legislative direction, of course, calls for a well-informed parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an interim report. A full report, compiled by the Rapporteur, will be published by the Headquarters Secretariat of the Association and distributed to all Commonwealth parliaments. I received a letter today from Mr Ian Clay explaining that there will be a delay in the presentation of the report because the Rapporteur concerned is dealing in Canada at the moment with a select committee inquiring into alternative energy sources. So, the report will be presented later than we would have liked. I should like to congratulate the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association on its initiative in setting up these forward-looking study groups, the host branch of Canada on its organisation, and the Secretariat on its skill and efficiency. I also wish to acknowledge the support of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and particularly its staff; the invaluable assistance of the Departments of Science and Technology, Trade and Resources and the Treasury in providing briefing material; our Mission in Washington which seconded Dr Richard Brock as an adviser and observer; and our Consulate-General in New York and our High Commission in Ottawa for their courtesies and facilities. I think it is also appropriate to mention at this stage Mr John Ferguson and our staff in Canberra for the help they have given me, and Sue Boyd, our Foreign Affairs Parliamentary Liaison Officer, for the help that she was able to provide. Finally, I am grateful for the privilege of representing the Parliament and the Commonwealth Branch at this very useful exercise in Commonwealth co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present a statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, in another place today. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> It is now five months since I was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, not long enough to justify a comprehensive survey of Australia's foreign relations and interests, but long enough-and full enough-to justify my setting out some preliminary impressions concerning the nature of this country's foreign policy and some of the more urgent tasks facing it. The first thing that is brought home very forcibly to a new Minister for Foreign Affairs is the complexity which Australia's external relations have now assumed. In this respect there has been a profound change in recent years. The much tighter integration of the international community, the gradual recognition of interdependence and the emergence of institutions to manage it, the development of Australia itself, changes in our region-all these have moved us rapidly to the stage where Australia is now a significant middle power with a range and depth of relations comparable with any country, other than a handful of great powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Today our foreign policy is concerned increasingly not only with the classic issues of security and political relations, but also with trade and aid, with energy and food, with immigration and refugees, and with communications and transport. In its role as a middle power, Australia needs a foreign policy which encompasses not just bilateral relations but the multilateral diplomacy of international organisations and blocs of countries acting together. And, of course, it continues to include the day to day problems of individual people which assume even greater proportions as the personal contacts between nations rapidly increase. </PARA>
<PARA> In a general sense, of course, this is well known, but we need to come to terms with what such a wide-ranging or total foreign policy means, what implications it carries in terms of co-ordination, the balancing of differing and sometimes competing interests, the addressing of multiple audiences, and the use of scarce human resources. Increasing complexity also makes it more important than ever to have a clear sense of Australia's national interest, defined in an enlightened and long term way, so that we can determine our priorities sensibly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is essential to understand the needs that have to be served by the foreign policy of a middle power such as Australia. If we are to get things right in what, by general consensus, is going to be a difficult and dangerous decade, the gap between the complexity of our foreign policy, as it really is, and public perception and discussion of that policy must be narrowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to give this matter careful consideration, to see what can be done on the Government's side, to stimulate and promote discussion of the issues which face us. I have just referred to Australia as a significant middle power. This has become a familiar term of self-definition in recent years, but I do not think that we give sufficient attention to what such a status implies, what characteristics a middle power has as an actor on the world scene. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point to make is that the designation 'middle power' refers to one's overall global position and one's status in terms of the whole range of international issues. It does not define a nation's importance in terms of particular isues or circumstances. The 'weight' of a middle power can be very considerable indeed within its region-as ours is in South East Asia and the South West Pacific. It can be very considerable in a particular forum-as ours is in the Commonwealth. And it can be very considerable in relation to particular resources-again, as ours is in relation to food and energy. In contrast, of course, on a range of other international matters our significance is less. This considerable variability in 'weight', depending on the issue and the circumstance, is one of the key characteristics of a middle power. It is one which demands very considerable judgment and flexibility in assessing situations and Australia's response to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Closely allied to this, and again pointing to the need for sure judgment, is the fact that the balance of opportunities and constraints facing a middle power is more complicated and ambiguous than it is for either the very small or the very powerful. A middle power has more opportunities-and therefore more temptations to overreach itself-than a small power; and it faces more constraints-and therefore greater danger that it will be unduly cautious and timid-than a great power. Certainly the problem of striking and maintaining a proper, realistic balance between opportunity and constraint is at the core of middle power diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Both these characteristics point to a third feature of middle power foreign policy: That quality of performance is particularly important in determining influence and status. Great powers are, almost by definition, going to be important in any event; while lack of power sets definite limits on the influence of small countries. But the variable positions of middle powers mean that how seriously they are taken and what impact they have on events in which they are involved will depend largely on the quality of human performance-on the skill, knowledge, maturity, determination and imagination of those who formulate and implement their policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this means that it is essential that the conduct of Australia's foreign policy at the professional level be of a high standard. But it means more, much more, than that. It means that in the kind of society Australia is-the values it embodies; the degree of consensus and bi-partisanship that exists within it; the clarity with which its national interests are perceived; the kind of leadership it enjoys; and, if I may use an old-fashioned but indispensible term, the quality of its patriotism-these things have a great bearing on the effectiveness of our foreign policy. In other words, we should not think of the term 'middle power' in fixed terms, as implying a given status which cannot be changed one way or another. The human factor is vital; it can enhance or diminish us very significantly as international actors. </PARA>
<PARA> My fourth point is that the range of issues on which we, as a middle power, can and should concentrate substantively is necessarily limited, because our resources are limited. We must be selective and resist both temptation from within and pressure from without to extend ourselves unrealistically. The issues on which we can act in this sense must be determined by our national interest and will usually be in our region or will relate to special political, strategic or economic interests that we have. Having said that, however, it is important to go on to make a distinction between the scope of the substantive policies I have been discussing and the scope of what might be called declaratory policies. </PARA>
<PARA> By declaratory policies I am referring to the obligation of a middle power to declare its position on all major issues-issues of war and peace, freedom and oppression, racialism, development and poverty. Australia's interests are now sufficiently wide-ranging and our status is sufficiently recognised for it to be not only legitimate but also proper for us to do just that-proper because ultimately those issues can have a serious impact on us, as indeed history has repeatedly demonstrated in this century, and proper also because, in some circumstances, a middle power can be more effective than a great power, precisely because it does not bring too much power to bear on the situation and does not automatically engage the interest of other great powers. Our intervention in the Zimbabwe conflict was a clear case in point. I believe that this is important in considering the opportunities available to a middle power: In some situations limited power is an asset rather than a liability. </PARA>
<PARA> In making the distinction between substantive and declaratory policies, it is important to point out that it is a serious mistake to think of the first as the only ones which are real and important and that the second are merely a matter of posturing. If we have not yet learnt that words, symbols and arguments representing genuinely and strongly held views are important in international affairs, we have learnt very little. The history of this century has demonstrated that they are often crucial. </PARA>
<PARA> My next observation is that, for a middle power like Australia which is allied to a super-power, the management of that relationship constitutes a particularly important part of its diplomacy. The ANZUS alliance receives bi-partisan support in this country and it is eminently desirable that it should continue to do so. While the Alliance is reinforced by ties of friendship and cultural similarities, it is based firmly on considerations of national interest. That is not to say, of course, that Australia's national interests and those of the United States always coincide. Indeed, it would assist the management of the alliance relationship if it were appreciated that differences must exist in an alliance between powers of a very different magnitude. Far from being peculiar to the Australian-American relationship, it is entirely normal. It derives from the necessary trade-offs between the desire to maximise the benefits of co-operation and shared interests on the one hand, and the concern to safeguard independence of action on the other. We should neither deny the existence of these differences nor engage in paranoid exaggeration concerning them. We should rather accept them as a part of life and work out our policies accordingly, appreciating as we do that our super-power ally is a free, democratic and pluralistic country. Quite clearly the development of this middle power concept is closely linked to the practical formulation of foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the issues which are currently in the forefront of Australian foreign policy. In doing so I shall not try to be comprehensive but shall focus on those aspects which my pattern of visits to date has highlighted. The first one is Kampuchea. In the last five months I have had the opportunity of discussing this question in four member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, as well as in Tokyo, Peking and Washington. That is, I have discussed it in every like-minded country, apart from New Zealand and Singapore, that has a serious interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in South East Asia. Naturally, I will be looking to discuss the issue of Kampuchea with those two countries at the earliest opportunity. During my recent visit to the United States I also had the opportunity to have a very useful discussion on Kampuchea with the United Nations Secretary-General Dr Waldheim. Australia regards the implementation of the United Nations resolution on Kampuchea as essential for the restoration of peace in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress that on the basic issues involved in Kampuchea, our interests coincide with the countries I have mentioned. There should be no misunderstanding about this, either in Australia or outside it, or about the meaning of our derecognition last month of the so-called Government of Democratic Kampuchea. That act of derecognition was based on two considerations, one moral and one practical. Morally, the regime in question was so repugnant that we felt that continuing recognition was unjustifiable; practically, as long as the question of recognition remained unsettled it would confuse and distract attention from the basic strategic and political questions at issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Powerful as these considerations were, the balance of arguments was not clear cut. Against them, the Government had to weigh the opinions and interests of other countries in the region who share our basic interests. Some of them are much closer to the sharp end than we are and have had to bear a much greater burden as the result of what has happened to Kampuchea. This affected the timing of our act of derecognition. The Government makes no apology for this but I want to make it clear beyond any doubt and ambiguity that our opposition to Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea remains implacable. We reject outright that that invasion proceeded on the basis of a concern for the welfare of the Khmer people. We reject outright the claim that the Heng Samrin regime, which the invasion installed, is the legitimate representative of the Khmer people. We deplore and oppose the continued Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea because it denies the independence of the Khmer people, because it affects the security of Thailand and other Asian countries, because it holds the threat of Vietnamese hegemony in the region and because it imports a Soviet strategic presence into the region. In this last respect, I draw attention not only to the significant strategic presence which the Soviet Union has now achieved in Indo-China, but also to the fact that Vietnam launched its invasion of Kampuchea only after it had signed a so-called treaty of friendship and co-operation with the Soviet Union. It was this which gave it the security guarantee against China which was a condition for its attack. </PARA>
<PARA> We deeply regret Vietnam's refusal to accommodate the legitimate interests and concerns of its neighbours and to play a more constructive and co-operative role in the region. In the end Vietnam itself will be the greatest loser as a result of its actions, in terms of isolation internationally and from its neighbours, and of domestic economic difficulties and social strains, which have been identified as causes for serious concern by the Vietnamese authorities themselves. Australia will continue to support actively the interests of the ASEAN countries in restoring stability to the region and the implementation of the United Nations Resolution on Kampuchea. With respect to the region, we want nothing but the restoration of peace and stability, the conditions which will allow its prosperity to grow-but we are serious in wanting that. We will watch carefully the efforts to create a new political grouping of Khmers-what is sometines referred to as a 'third force'-and will naturally review our position if the situation changes significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> In January I visited two great Asian powers situated further to the north-Japan and China. I was pleased to have confirmed that with both of these ancient and formidable nations Australia has been able to establish a sound relationship, based in both cases on mutual economic advantage, goodwill, and a degree of common perception of the international scene. With Japan, of course, we have more in common-in terms of similar democratic and free enterprise institutions, of our relations with the United States, and the way we view events on the mainland of Asia. China is a participant in those events, and a most important one. Our interests and China's are not always the same, but as I said we have many perceptions in common-concern about Soviet policies and intentions, for example, and a wish to see stability in East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of recent reports of the results of the re-examination of economic policies and priorities that has been going on in China and the restraints which have resulted from this. As far as Australia's own commercial interests in China are concerned, the policy of restraint could well lead to a reduction in demand for some commodities supplied from Australia, but these reductions seem likely to be limited, and Chinese interest in economic and technological co-operation with Australia remains high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not an easy task for China's leaders to maintain a steady policy course, given the scale of the problems they face and the awakened aspirations of their people for a better and more predictable life. However, after the convulsions and distortions of the Cultural Revolution, more pragmatic leaders, who seek to meet these aspirations, have emerged. China's present leaders now look back with bitterness at the years of the Cultural Revolution and its wasted efforts. Vice-Chairman Deng Xiaoping told me in January that it would take longer to undo the harmful effects of the Cultural Revolution than it had to cause them. Despite this, Chinese leaders were resolute in saying that they were facing up to the task of rehabilitation, were conscious of the demands of their people, and that broad policy lines would not change. I found these statements welcome. I believe that it is in our broad political and strategic interest, as well as in our bilateral commercial interest, that China maintain its outward-looking orientation and 'Window to the West'. When I refer to strategic interests, I have in mind the global balance, the Asia-Pacific area, and North Asia in particular, where four great powers-China, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States-are all involved, and where China's favourable disposition is of considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of our relationship with the United States under the new Administration. Recently, as honourable members will know, I have had the opportunity of speaking to several of the key foreign policy and national security members of the Administration, including Vice-President Bush, Secretaries Haig and Weinberger and Ambassador Kirkpatrick. The first point I should make is that I gained a clear impression from my private discussions that what these important members of the Administration have been saying in public is not merely rhetoric for its own sake. They mean what they say, they believe that important changes are required in American foreign policy, and they will not easily be deflected from their course. The Administration is proceeding in a very deliberate way and I believe that the end result of the series of comprehensive policy reviews now in train will be a greater degree of predictability in the content and conduct of American foreign policy. This is a development which Australia, for its part, will welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I was struck by the extent to which the philosophical perspectives and the analysis of the international situation of the Reagan Administration and of the Australian Government-as set out in a series of statements over the last five years-coincide. I refer particularly to a shared concern about the grave implications of the remorseless military build-up by the Soviet Union, about the need to maintain a military balance as a condition for stability and effective negotiations, about the need to improve consultation and co-ordination within the Western Alliance, about the need for purposeful American leadership, and about the need to pay close attention to crisis situations outside the West itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I was left with the very firm impression that the attitude of the new Administration to military power is not-I repeat not-that there should be early recourse to it in order to settle disputes. On the contrary, it is that the possession of adequate power is desirable precisely because it reduces the chances of armed conflict. It is believed, and the Australian Government shares this belief, that it is uncertainty, vacillation, disunity and weakness which increases the prospect of war by inviting expansionist, aggressive behaviour by States seeking to change the balance of power to their own advantage. Preparedness and evident resolution diminish the prospect of war. I stress this point because, either inadvertently or deliberately, it is often misrepresented. There are always some who, while they find it possible to remain silent in the face of huge military efforts on the part of the Soviet Union, raise the cry of war-mongering whenever the West shows any sign of matching that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the new Administration believes that the various elements of foreign policy-economic matters, human rights, strategic and political questions-cannot be treated as separate and distinct but that they must all be seen as components of the whole. This may be the most valid meaning of that much-used concept 'linkage'. Currently, this is particularly relevant to the way in which the issues at stake in Central America are viewed. For our part, the Australian Government believes that human rights issues are of the greatest importance. But we also believe it wrong to assume that economic reform issues and human rights can be divorced from questions of security and strategy. That distinction does not serve the cause of strengthening these rights. There are precious few human rights in the Soviet Union and Cuba, or in the regimes they support and install. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, the fact that there is broad agreement between the Australian Government and the Reagan Administration on the analysis and evaluation of international affairs should not be taken as implying that there will be automatic or across-the-board agreement between us. The very nature of international politics means we shall have our differences. Our perspectives as a regional power, as a developed country with almost exclusively Third World neighbours, and as a member of a multi-racial Commonwealth will necessarily differ from those of a global super-power on occasions. As an ally of the United States we will continue to pursue as helpful and co-operative a role as possible in the responses of the United States and the West generally to particular situations as they emerge. At the same time, however, Australia will seek to make its contribution on the basis of an independent national judgment, as is currently the case in the Indian Ocean. Equally important, Australian assistance can only be on the basis of complete consistency with Australia's national interests and the maintenance of our national sovereignty. I believe that these realities are well understood and accepted in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and last issue-or complex of issues-that I want to touch on is that of North-South relations. This is an area where Australia, as a middle power and an active and important trading nation, can play a role. Among developed countries Australia has distinctive interests. They derive from our geographical position and the regional concerns flowing from it, as well as some features of our own economy. But there are also vital global interests to be served in efforts to resolve North-South issues. This Government is deeply committed to the view that the peace and stability of the world between now and the end of this century will depend to a very considerable extent on progress towards easing the tensions between developed and developing countries. Efforts must be made to assist the developing world to solve its problems. Only those with an interest in instability and conflict will benefit if progress is not made. </PARA>
<PARA> Promoting the evolution of a better and more equitable international economic order also holds out the prospect of benefits for both North and South. Assisting the South to realise its full potential will provide significant economic opportunities for the North. It has to be recognised that, in some important respects, this year is not propitious for North-South dialogue. There are increasing pressures on scarce budget resources and trends towards restriction of trading opportunities which make progress more difficult. The combination of serious economic difficulties in developing countries, including continuing inflation and reduced growth rates, with increased East-West tension centred on Afghanistan, Poland and El Salvador, has distracted attention from North-South issues and created an unfavourable climate. Impatience and cynicism feed off each other. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which is to be held in Melbourne in September will provide a unique opportunity this year for leaders from both North and South to transform the dialogue over North-South issues into practical measures. At the last Commonwealth Meeting of Heads of Government in Lusaka, two years ago, those present succeeded in resolving the problem of Zimbabwe. Until then it had defeated all efforts at solution. In the same way I hope that at Melbourne the leaders of the Commonwealth will succeed in making that meeting a significant landmark with respect to North-South issues. We should certainly aim for such a result. We would want to see such progress translated into effective and sustainable practical programs which would help to mobilise national and international efforts in the development task. Returning to the point which I stressed earlier, it may be that a determined initiative by a number of middle powers has a better chance of getting things moving in present circumstances. Certainly Australia, as host, will try to give a resolute lead in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, in concluding what has been in the nature of an interim report to Parliament, I would like to say that in the visits I have so far paid to heads of government and foreign ministers I have been very struck by the regard and respect paid to Australia. I think the point is worth making because, while we have in the past occasionally exaggerated our importance in the world, more often we are inclined to indulge our Australian gift for scepticism and deflation by insisting on our comparative insignificance. This is not only self-damaging; it is plainly wrong. We are, as I have been at pains to emphasise, a significant middle power. There is an important role for us to play in our region, in the Western alliance, in the Commonwealth, in the United Nations and in the North-South dialogue. We must have the will to respond to the challenge, and the determination to make the most of our opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had the opportunity to peruse the statement as fully as I would like but I wish to make one or two comments about it. Most of the statement is, as it were, a lecture to the members of this Parliament about the foreign policy considerations which any country might be confronted with. I take it that it stems from the quilled pen of Professor Owen Harries. It is couched in very familiar terms for those of us who have read earlier works by that gentleman. It is not until the latter stages of the statement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) seeks in any way to deal with the real foreign policy issues with which this country is confronted. One of the first things that the Government tries to do in every statement of this kind at this stage of the year is provide some free advertising for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Melbourne later this year, which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will no doubt be seeking to use as a sounding board in his efforts to be recognised as an international statesman. So, there is a lengthy paragraph about that meeting in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two things which the statement stresses as being important in respect of which, as usual, the Government's rhetoric is very different from the Government's performance. I refer first of all to the question of the so-called North-South dialogue and the importance of the provision of foreign aid. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that Australian aid as a percentage of gross national product has now fallen to 0.4 per cent. A number of statements have also been made-not in this document-which look threatening to Australia's future in respect of provision of multinational aid of one kind or another. The second point I make is that the Government stresses, as always, the importance of nuclear safeguards. That is a matter in which again the performance of the Government does not match its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a steady decline in the requirements of nuclear safeguards under the Fraser Government. There has been a desperation to sell Australia's uranium resources to any potential buyer and a decline in the requirements made on those purchases in respect of the safeguards which purchasing countries are required to observe. Of course, the statement is light on the matter of Australian research and on the use of nuclear power in a peaceful way in terms of the provision of energy and the sort of technology and research that might go into that area in Australia. It is also totally silent on the matter of waste disposal. To that extent the statement is inadequate because these are matters which have been of public concern in Australia. They are matters which a statement of this kind ought to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual the statement is heavy on blustering rhetoric about the Soviet Union. We have become used to that. Of course, there is no comment in the statement about the question of trade with the Soviet Union which is again I think a matter of legitimate concern to the Australian people. One wonders about the validity of the bluster about the evils of the Soviet Union which springs from the mouths of Ministers and Prime Ministers who trade to their own personal advantage with the Soviet Union on almost a month by month basis. That is again an extraordinary omission from the statement. There appears to be no willingness to deal with that matter of our trading relationships with the Soviet Union. The Opposition is quite clearly of the view that trading relationships with the Soviet Union should continue and that they should continue as far as possible with all countries but it is hypocritical, in the environment in which this statement is made, not to deal with that topic. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement, in espousing the arrival of President Reagan in the United States of America as some sort of good thing for international affairs of course is silent on the Law of the Sea treaty which this Government has properly been pursuing in United Nations forums for some time. Again that is a matter which, according to a Press report, is under threat from the Reagan Government because of influences exerted by multinational companies on the Reagan Government to reduce the effectiveness of that proposed treaty. If the statement were in any sense contemporary-unlike the Minister who gave it in the House of Representatives-it ought to have followed up that matter of foreign affairs at this time. Again, of course, very little reference was made in the statement to the vexed question of our trading relationships with the Association of South East Asian Nations and the need to scrutinise closely those trading relationships in recognition of their relevance to the question of possible future co-operation in a wide variety of areas with ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is a most unlikely story in the statement about the Government's derecognition of the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea. It is the most unlikely explanation as to why there was so much delay in Australia's abandoning its recognition of the Pol Pot regime. Those are just some brief comments I wanted to make about the statement. I make them briefly as specific points because, as I said earlier, the rest of the statement does not bear serious examination by anyone interested in foreign affairs as it sheds no light at all on the subject. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Democrats support the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) in his point on foreign aid. I think this view of dwindling Australian foreign aid sits very badly with the protestations and statements about North-South dialogue made in the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). Indeed, we deplore this colourless and utterly unadventurous statement which confirms to our minds-if indeed that were necessary-that Australia will pursue a weak and supine foreign policy that will sooner or later get this country into trouble. It is a fact that weakness is not a help in presenting the image of a country to its neighbours. Some of the smallest countries such as Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries, have been able to present reasonable, courageous points of view to other nations, and to much larger nations, and to get a hearing. We do not get a hearing because we do not put that point of view. Reasonable strength is always respected. Weakness is never respected. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I would like to pass that message to the Government. It might like to think about the implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two realities seem to inform our foreign policy. The first is the embarrassing speed at which we always rubber stamp everything our large allies do. Especially now the Reagan Administration is in power we are climbing on to new bandwagons. We do not seem to question them. We even come forward, as in the case of the B52 aircraft, and make offers to the United States of America which it might not otherwise have solicited-although I believe we have not yet heard the whole truth of that matter, not by a long chalk. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of El Salvador I mention briefly Senator Chipp's question asked during Question Time today. It is a classic case of what I am talking about. The answer the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, gave to Senator Chipp worried me intensely. The Minister was honest. He did at least say that he believed torture was going on in El Salvador. All of us know that there are faults on both sides in this matter and that, indeed, we cannot hand over the country to the communists and the leftists. But I would have thought that Australia would have made an effort to support a reasonable act of self-determination in that country. The Government at least should say that that is what we want and not say that America's use of a military solution is absolutely right-as indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said. To merely say that we wanted some self-determination would not have done any harm and would not have diminished our stature or our respect in the minds of the Americans at all. I can only say to the Government: It cannot have it both ways. It cannot say it disapproves of torture, that it does not like this and it does not like that and then say that it supports a country without reservations. I think that is another point we have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that seems to inform our foreign policy is the flogging off of our minerals, particularly the sales of uranium, by our Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony)-he also seems to be our effective Minister for Foreign Affairs these days-anywhere we can get rid of it, to such places as South Korea and now Egypt. Whilst I wish the present Egyptian Government the best wishes in the world-it is a highly courageous Administration which has brought a measure of peace to that country-how are we to know what will happen in Egypt in 10 years? It is the most volatile region in the world. We know for sure that, through the machinations of Colonel Gaddafi, nuclear weapons are almost certainly being made. Fission weapons are quite certain to be made in that area and used. They will certainly contain Australian uranium. That is really what the Deputy Prime Minister is saying. He is right in the front ranks of the lemmings. It is time he realised that. The fall-out from those weapons will eventually reach our sky and our air. I look briefly at page 2 of the report. I am struck, as was Senator Button, with the contrast between rhetoric and action. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>This considerable variability in 'weight', depending on the issue and the circumstance, is one of the key characteristics of a middle power. </PARA>
<PARA>That is nonsense. A middle power can bring forward weighty matters if it is fair and honest just as well as any other power. I think that is the key to the problem. Our Government is gutless in this matter. It is time the Government realised that it is letting down the Australian people by being gutless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I take advantage of the Senate Standing Orders to speak to the first reading of a money Bill. I wish to deal with a situation that exists amongst the employees of the Australian National Railways Commission which I believe deserves some attention from the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). I hope that by drawing the attention of this House to the situation we will reach some reasonable solution to the problem. The Tasmanian Government Railways, as it was, was taken over by the Australian National Railways Commission and is now operating very efficiently. One result of the development of that efficiency has been a considerable drop in railways staff, and it is the manner in which that staff decrease is being achieved that I wish to raise. I quote the case of a Mr Barwick, and I believe that this example is typical of many, who was employed by the Tasmanian Government Railways, and later the Australian National Railways, for some 19 years and had an impeccable employment record. He was superannuated from the railways under rule 307 of the Australian National Railways Commission rules, which provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission may in addition to its powers under Rule 177-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the rule which enables people to be laid off-</PARA>
<PARA>retire an employee who is by reason of injury or illness unable to perform his regular duties on the ground of invalidity after consideration of a Medical Officer's report. </PARA>
<PARA>When inquiries were made about Mr Barwick's retrenchment, the reason given was that a report from the Commonwealth Medical Officer had declared Mr Barwick ineligible for work. On investigation, we discovered that the Commonwealth Medical Officer in his area was not only the Commonwealth Medical Officer but also, as it happened, Mr Barwick's private medical practitioner. I shall quote from a letter from his private medical practitioner, to whom he had been referred as Commonwealth Medical Officer, who was asked by the Secretary of the Australian Railways Union in Tasmania why this man had been invalided out of the service. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your note re Colin Barwick. </PARA>
<PARA> This man presented to me both as a patient of the practice and in my capacity as a Commonwealth Medical Officer. He informed me that he had been put off from the railways because of his back. </PARA>
<PARA> He has never presented to me with back trouble and although he says that he gets some back pain from time to time it has not been a great problem for him. I was concerned that Mr Barwick had been put off from the railways when he had not been having any problems with his back requiring sick leave. Admittedly he was not doing the job, i.e. Fettler, for which he was in fact listed with the ANR, but this was a railways decision as I understand it rather than his. He was in fact doing the job of Plant Operator. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the ANR simply wanted to reduce staff and found this a convenient way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA>That latter sentence not only was the view of the doctor but also increasingly has been the view of the union looking after the interests of men employed by the Australian National Railways Commission in Tasmania. Later I wrote to the Minister for Transport concerning the decision to dismiss Mr Barwick on medical grounds. I was informed that the decision was made by a senior medical officer in Hobart, whom I understand has never examined Mr Barwick. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises a problem for Mr Barwick, and an even greater problem for other employees of the ANRC who are in this situation. After 19 years of service Mr Barwick has superannuation and some payments will be made to him because of the contributions he has made over the years. However there are others in the service-I am told about 100-who do not have superannuation who have been retrenched below the age pension eligibility age, and whose severance conditions are only one week's pay for each year of service. Mr Barwick, like many others in this situation, although declared unfit for work in the ANRC, does not qualify for an invalid pension because the conditions for being superannuated from the railways on medical grounds are much less stringent than the conditions for acquiring an invalid pension, which most people in this chamber know involve 85 per cent disability and some certainty that that disability is permanent. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that arises in the minds of railwaymen in Tasmania, and I dare say in other branches of the ANRC, the question that certainly was raised by Dr Rayner in his report on Mr Barwick, and certainly the question in my mind, is whether these medical grounds are being used as a means to retrench workers employed in what was previously the Tasmanian Government Railways, to hurry up the reduction in staff. When the railways were taken over by the ANRC there was a guarantee that retrenchment would occur only as a result of natural wastage and that people would not be put off because they became supernumerary. The whole issue is complicated by the fact that under the ANRC rules there is no appeal against such a decision. In other words, a man can be superannuated on medical grounds and there is no one to whom he can appeal. Previously under the Tasmanian Government Railways there was an avenue for appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a very strange situation that a doctor's report can be used to declare a man unfit when the doctor himself does not believe that that is so and is willing to state publicly and in a report that that is the situation. It is a harsh provision which deprives a man of his job but leaves him without financial support through the social security system, which declares him invalid under the rules of the railway legislation yet does not provide him with an invalid pension after 19 years work with those railways. I raise this matter now to take advantage of the first reading of a money Bill rather than doing it in the wee small hours of the morning in the adjournment debate. I request the Minister for Transport, who is in another place, to look at this problem to see whether we can have some semblance of justice. If the invalidity provisions of the ANRC rules can be used to hurry up retrenchments in that area, then great injustice will be done. Justice certainly will not be seen to be done, and we will have considerable dissatisfaction in the development of what up until now has been a very efficient railway system. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>By Christopher Dickey</PARA>
<PARA>LA BERMUDA, El Salvador-when the shooting dies down, the silence tells you this is a war zone. Only 20 miles away, San Salvador is a thriving city. San Martin, a market town on the way here, is bustling with traffic and people. But then, on the road to Suchitoto, the traffic disappears, as do the people. </PARA>
<PARA> ''This,'' says the driver of a Green Cross ambulance 'is what you call guerrilla country''. </PARA>
<PARA> A lorry load of government troops passes by, their rifles bristle in every direction. They are young men, some of them very young, and many are obviously terrified. Their eyes are wide and staring at embankments and hillsides where any moment a grenade could be launched, a machine gun open fire. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a body lying in a drainage ditch. A small dog is pulling furiously at an arm. The sun is hot and the smell of decay is nauseating. A few miles further along the road, the army has retaken Suchitoto, or at least its buildings. Almost all of its people have fled and only soldiers and their paramilitary friends wander through its streets. </PARA>
<PARA> Nearby the parched hills around the Guazapa volcano are laced with bunkers and tunnels. This is the height of the dry season-the fields are bare and there is little cover for the insurgents above ground. But the hills still belong to the leftist guerrillas. </PARA>
<PARA> The ambulance giving me a ride turns onto a dirt road before reaching Suchitoto, driving slowly, one of its young attendants waving a white flag. All within are aware of the possibility that mines have been laid in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> There are small houses, peasant homes amid the burned-out cornfields. But there are no peasants and the houses, little more than one-room shacks, are now charred shells. Only the rattle of the old ambulance breaks the silence. </PARA>
<PARA> The driver stops amid a throng of women and babies in front of what was once a grand old hacienda. Now hammocks are slung from its rough-hewn beams. Everywhere there are children. Many are naked. Many have distended bellies from malnutrition, some babies have eyes sealed shut with infections, others are covered with skin lesions from chickenpox. Two suspected cases of smallpox have been discovered. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 1,600 people in the Green Cross camp at La Bermuda, 80 per cent are children under 10 years old. The rest are women and a handful of desolate old men. </PARA>
<PARA> ''We came here because we were afraid of death', said one young women simply. Her name is Anna and at 28 she is the mother of five children. She comes from San Rafael, a small settlement just a few miles away. She said she felt compelled to come here two months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The authorities came,'' Anna said. ''There was a stray shot somewhere in the area. They burned my house. They burned it with everything. </PARA>
<PARA> ''My husband is in San Salvador. He is a construction worker. But I don't know what he is doing. I don't know what has happened to him. We have not seen each other. I was alone''. </PARA>
<PARA> No, Anna said, she never had anything to do with the guerrillas or with the ''popular organisations''. Many people in her village did, however, so all were suspect in the government's eyes. ''The crime is to be from the village,'' she said. ''Whether you put yourself into politics or not, the crime is to be from San Rafael. Now it is an abandoned zone.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''They burn for suspicion,'' Anna said, ''or because they find you alone. Because I am alone they think my husband must with the ''boys''-the guerrillas. They even burned the food.'</PARA>
<PARA> Standing nearby, listening, is a women of 43-she looks older-who is tending her own small children and grandchildren. Lucia's house was still standing when she left it three months age. Her husband was killed last summer. </PARA>
<PARA> ''They took him out of the house at three in the morning,' said Lucia. She said she did not know who 'they' were. She described finding her husband's body, mutilated, the next day. </PARA>

<PARA>EL SALVADOR</PARA>
<PARA> El Salvador has gone beyond being a Central American backwater with a serious human rights problem. External communist backing for the left-wing revolt there has made the country an issue in East/West relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia considers that the United States is entirely right to cut off that source of disturbance and revolution in an area of traditional United States influence. It also believes that this action must be accompanied by support for economic and social reform, and this view is shared by the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreseen in the last 'Backgrounder' article on El Salvador (issue No. 269 of 4 February) that formerly little-known part of Central America has now emerged to unexpected prominence as an issue in East/West relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently, Australia's concern with El Salvador was almost exclusively with long-standing, serious violations of human rights there. In the past Australia has several times expressed concern about human rights violations in El Salvador at the United Nations General Assembly and in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Our concern has now broadened to encompass El Salvador's new international importance as a source of conflict close to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States has shown that the revolt in El Salvador has the backing of the Soviet Union and other communist states, notably Cuba, and the Reagan Administration has declared its determination to counter this Eastern bloc foray into the American hemisphere. Following the capture in November 1980 and January 1981 of several caches of documents held by Salvadoran left-wing guerillas, the United States has been able to provide extensive evidence, which Australian and other assessments find convincing, of a well organised campaign to overthrow the Duarte Government, using externally supplied equipment and weapons. Coordinated by Cuba, the inflow of arms through Nicaragua to guerilla groups inside El Salvador was carefully planned and executed over a period of months, and involved mostly Western-manufactured arms in an effort to cover up the communist source of supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Under President Carter, the United States limited its military support for the Government of El Salvador between 1977 and 1979. Military aid was stopped entirely, following the murder of a number of American nuns and missionaries in late 1979, and resumed only in January 1981 when the Carter Administration decided to respond to external communist involvement. This resumption of military aid included the first provision of lethal items since 1977. Once it had fully assessed the situation, the incoming Reagan Administration announced-in early March-its intention to further increase military assistance by twenty million dollars, and to provide an additional twenty United States military training personnel, increasing the number of such advisers to 54. The United States has emphasised that these advisers are not to take part in patrols or combat missions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia recognises the United States' historic interest in Latin America, and believes that the American response to Cuban-supported insurrection in the area is justified. In the words of Prime Minister Fraser, speaking in Parliament on 5 March, 'We consider that the United States is entirely right in seeking to cut off that source of disturbance, that source of revolution' in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, many people have been rightly concerned that military factors should not overshadow the continuing and very basic need for social and economic reform in El Salvador. The Foreign Minister, Mr Street, discussed this with the United States Vice-President, Mr Bush, during his recent visit to Washington, and found that the United States shares this Australian view-that United States military support will be accompanied by support for economic and social reform as two mutually supporting parts of the effort to bring a peaceful and lasting solution to the problems in El Salvador. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The central theme of my speech is what should happen to a person who is in Australia on a tourist visa when a disruption occurs in his country. Leaving that aside, last week senior immigration officials, at the instigation of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), gave members of the Opposition a full briefing on the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System and certain ideas were expressed on how it could be improved. Anyone who has read the ethnic Press knows that that is a very difficult job and that there are always ideas for revision. Sometimes it is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The point I wish to make is that there is a rising awareness of the need for a more equitable intake of people in dire straits in Latin America, whether we designated them as refugees seeking asylum, as family reunions or as persons with job skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that we cannot achieve complete parity. I have raised this matter at various times before Estimates committees. I also know that our international obligations are such that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, for geographical reasons, has argued that Australia should have a larger intake of refugees from South East Asia than from the Latin American continent. In fact, I think one of the Brazilian representatives on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees has argued that most Latin American people who are subject to political duress would prefer to go to Mexico or to North America. That argument, to a point, is reasonable. It is fair to say that a number of the Chilean people to whom both the Labor Government and the present Government have given political refuge have permanent residence status but hope one day when democracy beams out again in Latin America, particularly Chile, to go back and take an active part in the reconstruction of their country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not unusual. Many people who fled to England from Hitler between 1936 and 1939 went back to their countries and played a notable role in their reconstruction, particularly Germany. As Senator McIntosh would know, many socialists returned to their countries after the war and helped to rebuild them. We are not arguing about whether a person who is brought to Australia as a political refugee should become an Australian citizen in the long term. I am saying that if we are consistent we should slot in, as it were, people who are, in the main, victims of the military dictatorships in Latin and Central America. One of the documents I have incorporated in Hansard is an article from the London Guardian. It is similar to many articles which have appeared in the London Guardian and the Washington Post. The central theme of it is the plight of the innocent bystanders who are caught in the crossfire between various roving guerrilla bands. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall take a little further the case of the gentleman whom I have mentioned. In my letter to the Regional Director-I know that the Minister will read it as I have had it incorporated in Hansard-I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> While I admit he is not a full trade union functionary, I intend amplifying the case largely on the theme of relativity as regards people we give sanctuary to on an ideological basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I said that for the following reason: Last Thursday night when we received an in-depth briefing from senior officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, I asked how we would balance from 1 July the categories of people in immigration queues in various countries in the world. They said: 'The position is that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Austrian Government say that we should take a considerable quota of people who have crossed from some eastern European countries to Vienna'. I do not think it is hard to assess such people. They would be people who are under totalitarian governments of the Left, and I use that word in a broad sense. I would not object to our taking them, but I could give the Senate case histories if I am forced to do so-I have raised this matter before Estimates committees in the past-of engineers in nationalised industries in Romania who obtained jobs with the Comalco company in Australia and who reckoned after 12 months that Comalco was as bad as the eastern European nationalised industries. They are people whom nobody can please. Frankly, some of these immigrants would not fit in anywhere, but because they are coming from eastern Europe we take them. We are more solicitous with them than we are with people such as the El Salvadoran to whom I have referred. To fortify my argument, I shall quote from the Ethnic Press Digest of 18 March 1981 a reference to an article in La Fiamma, which by no stretch of the imagination would be regarded as a left wing ethnic publication. La Fiamma, commenting on the dubious status of the bikini clad Soviet Union girl, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>What stinks-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the newspaper's word, not mine-</PARA>
<PARA>is the tendency to regard as victims all those who live in countries behind the iron curtain and who one day decide to migrate. </PARA>
<PARA>I will qualify that. I know that the Minister has asked the Committee on the Determination of Refugee Status to take another look at this case to see how dinkum the girl was. I know that in another case a Soviet Union ship's officer has been given a holding line. The Department has not given him asylum, but has given him another three months in which to re-think his position. Let me say definitely that I have never been backward in criticising the excesses of Stalinism. Of course, I always equate them with the excesses of fascism, whether they be exercised by Franco a decade or more ago or by some of the neo-fascists that are found in many of the Latin American countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that I refer to the El Salvadoran, Victor Manuel Montoya. I had a Peruvian girl assisting me in interviewing him. I interviewed him a second time. I would say that he would be in his thirties. On the information I received, he has been only a rank and file trade unionist. I make this point because the people who suffer the full brunt of dictatorships and the secret police are student activists and trade union functionaries. When I use the term 'functionary' I mean largely what we would call a State secretary or an organiser. This chap is not one of those people. I know that he has been interviewed by an officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs. I think he has been interviewed in Canberra or that verbal submissions have been made. My information is that at this point the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs feels that he does not have a strong case and that he should leave Australia. I can appreciate the existence of some doubt. When a person is not in the mainstream of agitation against his government or a dictatorship one can always say that he is just one of many, that his living standards might be lower but he is not subject to what is called political duress. I think that is the definition that is generally applied when people seek political asylum. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there is a no-man's land between what the Foreign Affairs Department suggests about political asylum and how the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs accepts that suggestion. In saying that I am adopting a bipartisan attitude. When a former colleague of mine, Senator Willesee, was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there was a tripartite watching team in Vietnam investigating breaches of ceasefire agreements. One member of that team was Polish, and he defected. The officials cut corners in that case. He went to our Embassy in Saigon and gained a speedy passage to Australia. I do not cavil at that action. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to my central theme. We are much more receptive to the pleas of a person who says that he is a victim of a government of repression which represents the Left than a person who says he is the victim of a similar government which favours the Right. When I first became a member of the Senate, I used to reply to the Government that it was pretty poor consolation to try to distinguish between the treatment of a person being interrogated by the KGB in Moscow and another being questioned by Franco's secret police as each group would probably use all sorts of instruments to get confessions. In the light of what was said at Question Time today-and our approach must be a balanced one-I believe that the plight of our El Salvadoran colleague ought to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another point that deserves consideration. The argument can be applied right across the board that a country that is too tolerant in these matters will get people flooding in. I do not intend to argue about how far this Government went with the boat people. We are not likely to get a flotilla containing people fleeing from El Salvador. A consideration of the hard statistics with respect of immigration intakes and the cases which go before the Determination of Refugee Status Committee reveals that they are much more loaded with South East Asian people and possibly east Europeans than with people from Latin America. I make the plea to the Minister that the submission that I have made on behalf of the El Salvadoran member be favourably considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I always believe in covering my flanks. It could be argued that some activities, which may have to do with the work of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the narcotics authorities or a similar area, have not been probed by me. If the Minister lets me know tomorrow of any such matter, I will know that I have been given a bum steer. In my attitude to this El Salvadoran member, I have not gilded the lily and said that he is a top trade union representative. As a matter of fact, I have endeavoured to communicate with the Latin American trade union confederations, equivalent to our own organisations. In some other countries, I have been able to do this; in respect of El Salvador, I have not. I simply refer to the documentation that I have presented. In that respect, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an extract from a document produced by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs entitled 'From the Ethnic Press'. At page 2 of that document, there is recorded an extract from La Fiamma on what it regards, as I do, as an undue solicitude towards some eastern European migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> La Fiamma (9 March), commenting on the ''dubious status'' of Lilian Gasinskaya, says: ''What stinks is the tendency to regard as victims all those who live in countries behind the Iron Curtain and who one day decide to migrate.'' (page 26)</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I hope that the Minister will be able to consider this matter favourably. Let me re-emphasise one point. I am aware, as is every honourable senator, that an amnesty was introduced for people illegally resident in Australia as distinct from political refugees. We said at the time that short cuts should not be adopted to enable people who were on tourist visas to convert to permanent resident status. I stand by that statement. When I first raised this El Salvadoran case, I had to tell a group of Colombians and Ecuadorians at the same time that, frankly, they had cheated by overstaying their tourist visas in Australia. I told them that I would not take their cases further. I put that aspect on the record so that the Minister will know that I am being consistent and objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise another matter. I hope, with my Deputy Leader, the Honourable Lionel Bowen, to meet within the next few days the new Argentinian Ambassador to Australia. I know that Senator Chipp and Senator Evans have raised several cases similar to those on which I have made representations. Some people would know about the case of Miss Montard. I give credit to the Australian Government and in particular the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrew Peacock, and to Ian Macphee. Australia was prepared to take this girl as a political refugee through our Embassy in the Argentine. The girl was let out for 48 hours to pack her bags to come to Australia and she was put in the Cordoba penitentiary by the authorities in the Argentine. We are to see the new ambassador. Our hope is that, if Argentina wants its image to improve, it will release this girl so that she can come to Australia. Senator Coleman, with her involvement in Amnesty International, probably has heard of the case. The Swiss Government as well as the Australian Government, has interceded. I know that at times we feel good when raising the cases of such people, and our adrenalin even rises, but to be practical we must ask how many of these people we can bring to Australia to get away from such a totalitarian atmosphere. Many of the relatives of these people are working here and are taxpayers and members of trade unions. I repeat that if immigration statistics showed a more equal quota from the various continents of the world our immigration policy would be seen in the eyes of many Latin American groups to be a lot fairer and they would feel that they were not at the end of the queue. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise some other matters. The first concerns the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, and relates to the annual report of the Security Appeals Tribunal for the period to 30 June 1980. The civil liberties of many people are concerned. Questions have been asked about a suitable appeals tribunal for people who feel that an ASIO evaluation has been to their detriment. The Security Appeals Tribunal report mentions Dr Deschamp who is the Dean of Trinity College at the University of Melbourne and Chairman of the Migrant Resource Centre. He was the member of the Tribunal experienced in migrant affairs. When the Minister first sent me a copy of the report, I ascertained that an appointment had not yet been made to that position. We have had lengthy debates on ASIO. This is one of the areas where somebody can be adversely affected. I would like to know as soon as possible why there has been a delay and when an appointment will be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I raise is again directed at Senator Durack. It is a matter on which I took the trouble, rightly, to defend the motives of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer to the ineptitude of senior officers of the Australian Soccer Federation. I have in my sights particularly Sir Arthur George. If a person wants to represent Australia in any sport to my mind he has to meet our rules and citizenship requirements. Senator Peter Baume on one occasion asked what perhaps I would call a loaded question of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. He asked whether the Australian Soccer Federation had had lengthy discussions with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The answer was yes. If a player came to Australia on a signed contract and pyramided that contract to extend his stay for six years he could probably be fairly close to getting permanent residence. Let us consider the problem with the Australian Soccer Federation. It is not a matter of being nitpicking. The Australian Soccer Federation makes Australia look silly. One tour included Jimmy Rooney, an Irishman, and two Englishmen. Those players were travelling on Irish and British passports. Al Grassby was the responsible Minister at the time. I know that we had to telescope citizen qualification procedures to avoid Australia's losing a match on protest by North Korea. This is not good. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, in the present case, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs would have told the Australian Soccer Federation what the score was. Last Saturday the sports pages of one newspaper carried the headline 'ASF will help Niven get citizenship for Socceroos'. I welcome people who want to play for Australia. I cannot understand why the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has not responded to the question I asked Senator Durack on Thursday of the week before last and has not defended its senior officers. I have no doubt that the Federation was told what the rules were. Let me relate a story on this aspect. Some honourable senators would know that on one occasion I had a violent conflict with none other than Mr Charles Perkins. It was nothing to do with immigration; it involved Aboriginal expenditure. I think the present Government Whip, Senator Kilgariff, was the other person caught in the cross-fire. I think Senator Shirley Walters was in the chair. Therefore Charlie Perkins and I do not get on too well. As late as last week at the Mount Isa airport Charlie Perkins said to me: 'Senator, I am all with you when you get stuck into Sir Arthur George'. There is a unity ticket between Charlie Perkins and myself. I would like an early answer to the question that I have raised in that respect. I hope what I have said on each matter will be taken on board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this first reading debate to mention a matter which I think is of some importance to the Australian community at the moment. I refer to the air transport mess. I think one can describe it as no less than that. The Australian Democrats earnestly ask the Government to make an effort for once to sort out the air transport mess in Australia. I say at the outset that it is not a mess at the level of the staff, aircrews and support areas we have in this country. Thank goodness that at least we have employed in our aviation industry a body of people-in spite of all the provocations they suffer-who do an incredibly fine job. As I have said, this is in spite of the mess created by the Government in this area. Although, on reflection, I think it would be more accurate to lay the mess at the door of the Liberal Party of Australia as part of its endless subterranean process of support and financial wheeler-dealing. In almost every context one finds, by examination, that getting money for the Liberal Party turns out somehow to be a more important objective than the rights and wrongs of individual wishes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this situation was exacerbated recently by the Government's wicked-I call it no less than that-fiddling with the Commonwealth Electoral Act so that it could use the financial devices more and more with less and less accountability to the people in this country. That would be a real withdrawal from democracy. Recently, there has been the decision of the High Court of Australia. In its wisdom it said that the Government had a mandate in the future to lie as much as it wished and those lies are sanctioned by law. That decision exacerbates this problem even further. Let us be in no doubt about it. The Democrats know it. Businessmen who get telephone calls when an election campaign is coming up know it. They all come and tell me about it. The public know it. No wonder we have cynicism about the political process. I suggest that a good place to start remedying the situation would be to look at the whole air transport mess to try to get it straightened out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats would like to be in a position to ask the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares to finish the job it started. But the situation is like Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall with all the King's horses and all the King's men and all the rest of it. There is no way that the Holcroft inquiry members, for whom I have a profound sympathy, can be expected in all self-respect to start where they left off nor, I suggest, could they be expected to have the motivation to do so after being treated with the cynicism and dishonesty that they have experienced. The Australian Democrats believe another investigation into this messy area is regrettably needed. Either a select committee of this Parliament or a royal commission should be established. The inquiry should ask: 'Does the two-airline system work?' Is it doing anything for Australia? Would deregulation be better? How much deregulation would be required? The Australian Democrats do not pretend to know the answers. We have had a bit of a look at the experience of deregulation in the United States of America and there are matters that are worrying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in the United States on 14 October 1978. Its major aim was to encourage, develop and maintain an air transportation system which relied on competitive market forces to determine the quality, variety and price of air services. I would have thought that this would have been very close to Liberal Party philosophy. It is certainly very close to Australian Democrats philosophy. I would have thought that the Liberal Party would be quite interested in that concept of fair market forces. We are always hearing about that in the Parliament and the Senate. Deregulation was strongly opposed in the United States by many of the smaller United States airlines which feared that the large, national lines would move in and take their previously protected territory away from them. However, the opposite happened. Because of a shortage of aircraft the major airlines tended to withdraw from low and medium traffic routes and use those extra aircraft on the major trunk routes. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation, although far from chaotic as it has been described, is in some respects an improvement on the previous system. Indeed, extra competition has led to lower fares. That has been a plus and more people have been able to travel by air. The big losers, unfortunately, have been-this is very relevant to the Australian experience-small and medium-sized cities. Service to these cities has been reduced as airlines reallocate aircraft to the more significant and high-load trunk routes. This has struck a significant blow against the concept of decentralisation, as businessmen tend to shy away from locations which do not enjoy a full airline service. This has obvious and serious implications for Australia where, indeed, we have to consider decentralisation as a major issue of the future and as something with which we must really come to grips as soon as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other relatively minor disadvantages flowing from deregulation in the United States include a considerable reduction in most airline profits which, it is fair to say, are partly accounted for by very high oil prices-this is a world-wide phenomenon-and a rationing problem of ground space and booking facilities et cetera at high demand airports. We believe that an inquiry is urgently needed which would take international experience into account and which would look at these kinds of points. The Democrats believe that total deregulation might not be a good thing. We are not in any way in favour of that for the reasons we have mentioned such as the safety aspects and other matters. But it would seem not unreasonable to examine whether two airlines are the right thing for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The two airlines agreement is properly the Airlines Agreement Act 1952. It has been in force in this country for nearly 30 years. That in itself is almost a good reason for its re-examination in the light of changing circumstances in the world and this was commented on in the Holcroft report. The report sought-indeed I think it is a fair statement-to sweep away the Menzies doctrine with its findings that 'the main presumption underlying the inauguration of the two-airline policy is not now applicable, if it ever was'. Whether it ever was is not relevant in 1981. The relevance today is something that I think an inquiry ought to look at. The Holcroft report exposed quite devastatingly the myth of competition between Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia. It denounced the policy, in effect, as merely ensuring the 'preservation of a duopoly'-a horrible word but I think it is very demonstrable in this case. It preferred the solution of progressive deregulation of all but safety requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly obvious in all the debate in this area that something along those lines is what we should be pursuing. The important point is that we should be pursuing it and not abandoning it. The debate has been cut off artificially in midstream. I think this is the most serious aspect. There seems to be very little doubt that the Holcroft inquiry was nobbled because of the Government's determination to have the new airlines agreement ratified in this parliamentary session, despite Government denials. Indeed, according to the article by Ali Cromie appearing in the Australian Financial Review of 9 March it became plain-if that report is at all accurate-that the Government had treated the Holcroft committee with extreme cynicism. Several points arise in this connection. There seems virtually no doubt that the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, gave everybody to understand that the report was due in June or July this year. The impetus for curtailing the inquiry almost certainly appears to have come from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser). An article appearing in the Australian Financial Review of 4 March stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Another Western Australian Member said that at the meeting in the Prime Minister's office on November 26, the Prime Minister asked Mr Hunt when the Holcroft inquiry was due to report. Mr Hunt had replied 'June, July or thereabouts,' he said. The Prime Minister then said 'Ralph, tell them to report by January 31', the Western Australian Member said. </PARA>
<PARA>He did. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This account of the meeting was verified-according to that reporter-by a number of Western Australian Members yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very interesting that there have been these significant leaks on procedures from Western Australian members of this Parliament. I say to Western Australian Government senators that the time has come for them to remember that they are senators for Western Australia in this place and that there is very great interest in Western Australia in their character and performance on this matter. They have so far gone to water. I am suggesting to them that time is running out. This is not an issue on which their electorate will take kindly their running to water. I think it is a matter that they will have to consider. They will have to consider their position honestly as senators for that State rather than as Government senators or any other kinds of senators. They will have to consider Western Australia's best interests. It seems to me that in relation to that State there is no doubt where its best interests lie. If one looks at the mess we must go back to the matter of parallel timetabling. I recall that nearly two years ago, on 26 September 1979, I asked the Minister then representing the Minister for Transport in this place, upon notice. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) Why has the Government not taken some effective action to end the dangerous, wasteful and inconvenient nuisance to the public which is involved in parallel timetabling between Ansett Airlines of Australia Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Can the Minister, under Clause 5 of Schedule 3 of the Airlines Agreement Act 1952, use his discretion to refer the whole matter of parallel timetabling to the Rationalisation Committee established under that Act, in view of the fact that relative closeness in scheduling of flights between the airlines has given rise to the complaint that the services are not operated at intervals that adequately serve the public; if so, what action is proposed for the exercise of such discretion immediately so that the whole matter can be properly resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time, I received in reply one of the most astounding pieces of double talk that I can remember. But the Minister said at the end of that reply:</PARA>
<PARA> I have since been advised that a joint working group has been established by the Airlines to devise schedules which reduce the incidence of parallel flights. Recent moves taken in regard to separated schedules on the Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne routes are considered only as a first step in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>I would say that now, nearly two years later, any further steps that have been taken in this regard have certainly been very tiny and hesitant. We are still a long way from a rationally spread, safe system of scheduling. I have never been able to understand why this is the case. Why does the Government not exercise the powers that it has under the Act? Why can it not control the chaos that any honourable senator would have experienced if he had been at Canberra airport at 10 a.m. today when about four flights arrived at about the same time. In fact, there must have been grave safety problems, even air-space control problems, when aircraft are in the same air-space at the same time and when passengers have to wait for up to half an hour to get their baggage. It is absolutely unnecessary. It is an imposition on this society. That is another issue that I raise again. </PARA>
<PARA> Why cannot the sort of thing I am suggesting not be done? We would say that this is another instance of the Government's gutlessness, its complete subservience to present airline interests. The Government cannot even get that one right. It cannot step in and insist. Almost every member of Parliament, regardless of party, to whom I have mentioned this matter has said that the position is terrible and has asked why the situation cannot be rectified? I have never been able to understand why it should be the case, yet it happens. I suggest that it is a grave indictment of the Government's view of this whole area of industry. I also raise the situation of the more remote States and the philosophical question of whether we ought to consider this country as one country, as a country in which there should be some kind of subsidy paid to the more remote States or at least a fair recognition of the fact that aircraft operating over long distances operate more economically than over short distances. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not often agree with Sir Charles Court but in this case he at least sees the interests of his own State. I think it is essential for some means to be evolved so that the people in these parts of Australia who, through no fault of their own, are geographically isolated, should not have an additional financial burden placed on them. I suggest that it is completely unnecessary. It is a fact that to fly from Perth to Sydney is a big financial investment. Normally, when people have to make that flight it is for very good reasons. They just do not do it for pleasure; it is for urgent family, personal or business reasons. People on flights between Canberra and Sydney or Melbourne and Sydney perhaps do not have that motivation. The air fares involved for the businessman flying between Sydney and Melbourne are cheaper, anyway. He flies more cheaply than the person travelling between Sydney and Perth. I do not believe that the fact that Perth is further away justifies that. From a purely mechanical, cost accounting point of view it may do so, but from a nationalistic point of view, from the point of view of efficient business and efficient society in this country, it does not justify it in the least. I think that is also something that a committee should look at. Again, this is a matter for honourable senators from Western Australia to be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to raise on this matter, concerns my constituents in New South Wales, and particularly in Sydney. It involves the vexed question of Sydney airport. I do not think, in view especially of modern scientific findings, on the effect of noise on human beings over a period, some of which are quite recent-they have been conducted over the last four or five months-that we can continue to say that we will have Sydney airport at Mascot forever. People from the Municipality of Rockdale have come to me in absolute desperation. School teachers from that area have come to me and said: 'Senator, it is no use. Every child who goes to school here will fail his exams and will not succeed because every time an aircraft goes over he or she looks out the window. Three minutes later the children are looking out the window again'. I have been told that there is not a great deal that can be done to stop them. They cannot habituate themselves to the terrible shattering roar over them all the time. Ninety thousand people live in the Rockdale municipality alone. The Major Airport Needs of Sydney Committee report of December 1979 recommended that we should have this nuisance increased by having a close spaced parallel runway established alongside the existing north-south runway at Mascot. This will be bedlam increased for probably 100,000 to 150,000 people who, through no fault of their own, live in these residential areas. </PARA>
<PARA> These noise problems are now a major political and social issue in those parts of Sydney, and with good reason. If we agreed with the MANS report, and I gather that the Government is considering this as a cheap alternative for the future-perhaps to the year 2000-we would increase the number of flight movements to 278,000 a year. That would represent an increase of 57 per cent on the present number of aircraft movements. Whilst that report states that the Committee is absolutely confident that modern engineering will make those aircraft quieter, the people of Rockdale, the Mayor of Rockdale and I do not believe it. I do not think that will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that modern aircraft may well become noisier, because of the exigencies of the fuel situation, than they ever were. Certainly, more of them will be flying. We will have a situation in which, because of fuel exigencies, engine muffling may not be as satisfactory as it was before and in which a number of other factors such as flight paths will have to be taken into account. On the basis of the nuisance level alone, a re-examination of Sydney's airport should be seriously taken into account. This is a matter on which the initiative should be taken by the Federal Government. After all, the Commonwealth members of the MANS Committee pushed hard for the close spaced parallel runway next to the existing north-south runway to be the answer. The MANS report mentioned something which I think is almost lunatic in its absurdity. It recommended that land under aircraft flight paths in that part of Sydney should be rezoned. I wonder whether the members of that Committee stopped to think how many thousands of houses would have to be torn down to allow that rezoning to take place. We are talking about Australia's largest city now and that sort of monstrous statement in a report like that makes its credibility disappear. </PARA>

If we grasped the nettle now, we could solve the problem. The amount of environmental, social and residential disturbances there would be minimal. I do not say that it would not exist and my profound sympathy goes out to the people in that area, but I think that this has to be a better solution than what the MANS report suggested should be a contingency plan. Between 1980 and the year 2000 when passenger demand will grow by a factor of 2.7-in other words, it will be almost trebled-we cannot have a situation in which a major airport, catering both for international and national travel, should be allowed to exist in inner Sydney. As far as my constituents in Sydney are concerned, that is an important area in the airport mess, that the Government might also grasp. But surely these points indicate that everywhere one looks at this problem, except at the tremendous performance-safety and otherwise-of the actual individuals working in that industry, one finds trouble. I suggest that this is big trouble and that the Government ought to consider it. This is trouble about which a lot of people in Australia are concerned. This is, as we would say, a gut issue, and I commend it to the Government on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the motion for the first reading of a number of Bills before the Senate dealing with protection of the sea. As is the tradition in the Senate, because of other limits placed on us, this gives us as senators an opportunity to raise a wide-ranging number of issues which we consider to be important and of moment. The issue that I seek to raise this evening relates to charging by Telecom Australia. Today I raised in the Senate a question in relation to the charging of consumers by Telecom for international subscriber dialling if the consumers did not choose to have the service. I think that is totally outrageous and gives us a basis for looking at the whole rationale for Telecom and its future in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to give the Senate a rundown on the present system, which is shortly to become, we are told, the previous system. Today in my question I asked why, when a new system of accounting for international subscriber dialling calls is introduced into this country-it is long overdue, I might say-all subscribers will have to pay a penalty if they choose not to be connected to the ISD system. In reply the Minister indicated that Telecom was introducing a system of recording calls which would enable subscribers to check whether they had made international calls by direct dialling and that the introduction of that system and the machinery that goes with it would mean that all Telecom subscribers would have to pay a charge and those who chose to be barred from international dialling would have to pay a penalty charge. I suggest to the Senate that that is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment if subscribers want to query a total-and only a total is given-for trunkline calls, they have to pay a charge. I have been in the situation of requiring Telecom to give me a statement of charges for trunkline calls. I have had to pay a fee for that and, whilst there is assistance for members of parliament in paying telephone accounts, it does not cover that fee. It is, I will agree, a small amount, but when I have received such a detailed statement I have certainly found quite a number of errors in the charging by Telecom for trunkline calls on my telephone. The errors have fallen into three categories. The first relates to when I have made a call from my telephone service and requested that it be charged to the Federal Members Authority system, which means it should not appear on my bill at all. Some trunk operators have not properly billed the calls and they have appeared on my personal account by mistake. The second category relates to when others have made telephone calls from my service and have used credit cards. Instead of the call being charged to the credit card, it has been charged to my account. When Telecom has been queried it has had a record of the fact that such calls should have been charged to a credit card but were not and appeared on my bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category relates to calls which should never have been charged to my telephone at all. I must say that there is not a large penalty for me personally in this because I can have something done about those incorrectly charged calls and I have the alternative of diverting to an FMA charge those calls which should have been charged thus in the first place. Nevertheless, I had to pay a charge for extracting from Telecom a statement of telephone call charges that should never have been billed to me. It is a small charge but a matter of principle. I think of those subscribers who have to pay all their own trunkline charges, but who would reasonably ask Telecom for a statement of charges and find them to be incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two years a number of such cases have come to my notice because they have been connected with me. I have had access, by favour, to someone's private telephone, have made a call on business and have asked for it to be charged to my FMA number. Some of those telephone calls tend to be rather lengthy. I know of at least two cases of individual subscribers who have been horrified by their trunk call charges and have asked for a statement of the charges; and it has transpired that the reason for the high trunk charges is that calls which I made on their telephone service and which should have been charged to my FMA number have not been so charged but have been charged to them individually. This raises with me the serious worry as to how many other people who granted me the favour of using their private telephones, on my assurance that the calls would be charged to my FMA number because they were on parliamentary business, have paid telephone accounts that they should not have paid because they were not properly charged. </PARA>
<PARA> In those two cases the people asked for statements of their trunk calls and queried with me whether the call charged to them, which they did not make, was one that I made. I have verified that and it has subsequently been charged to my Federal Members Authority. How many people whose telephones I have used in good faith have subsequently paid bills that they should not have paid because of Telecom's sloppiness? Those who have discovered the error have had to pay a Telecom charge for the favour of being given the information to acquaint Telecom of its own errors. They have had to pay a charge to receive information to enable them to right their telephone accounts. That is the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the subject of metered calls. There have been many complaints in the Senate about the method of charging for STD calls. I have been a victim of this system. The simple situation is that in the past subscribers who have used a telephone for STD purposes, and who have received a charge for metered calls which they consider to be overinflated, have had no come back at all if they have used STD in the period for which they were billed. I will relate my own circumstance. My own telephone bills, including rental, have ranged between $70 and $100. I do not make many telephone calls from home; the telephone is used mainly as a convenience for incoming calls. I do not spend very much time in my home because of the demands of my jobs and I live on my own. After some years of $70 to, at the most, $120 six-monthly accounts, I received to my horror in January 1976 a bill which showed that I had to pay almost $1,200-ten times more than the maximum I have ever paid for a telephone account. This covered a period when I was Deputy Opposition Whip and had made STD calls on two occasions which I could identify very clearly in terms of the dates and the length of time that those STD calls could have occurred on given days. But because I had used my telephone for subscriber trunk dialling and because I had not kept a record of the actual length of those calls, after two years of arguing the toss with Telecom I had to pay. That was at a time, I might say, when members' metered calls were not paid by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A large proportion of the account was paid out of public funds but as a matter of principle I was arguing the account because it had to be grossly wrong. The State accountant for Telecom in Queensland called me at my office one day and I suffered the indignity of being asked very rudely by him whether I was stalling on the account because I wanted the Government to pay it. I told him that in any event the Government-that is, the taxpayer-would pay a major part of it. The point was not whether I paid it or whether the taxpayer paid it but whether Telecom had any right to charge it. In the next two years my telephone accounts came back to normal. By the end of the two years my accounts were less than $100 for a six-month period. They have remained thus. Nevertheless, I was in the position that all Telecom subscribers are in eventually: I had to pay the account or lose my telephone service. In Australia there is nowhere else to take one's business if one thinks one is being charged for a telephone service one did not get. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the many arguments that have raged whether Telecom is charging correctly for metered calls, we have all been aware of the machinery available which would enable a proper recording of STD calls made from an individual telephone service. However, Telecom has not introduced this service and there have been debates in the Senate as to how much revenue Telecom would lose if the service were introduced allowing individual subscribers to check the metered calls made and thus to challenge them by the same method as in the case of trunk calls if they thought they had not made those calls and could give reasonable proof that they had not made them. It appears that reasonable proof in the checking of booked trunk calls is to check with the person whose number was dialled to see whether he or she received the call and that the call was made on the date and from the service of the person to whom the call is charged. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, international subscriber dialling has had to be connected to individual subscriber's telephones by request. There has been a catch for those people who have requested the connection. Those who have the international subscriber dialling service connected to their telephone and who believed they were overcharged have no come back at all about the total charge appearing against the ISD item. Whilst it would appear from the Telecom bill that certain overseas telephone calls had been made, Telecom would never check with the number dialled overseas to verify that the call had been made. Telecom would check against the booked local trunkline calls but would not under any circumstances check it against international calls. If the subscriber had been foolish enough to have the ISD service connected he would find that he had no comeback at all about any unfortunate overcharging that showed up in his telephone account. We all know that overseas telephone calls are charged at a very high rate for each minute and the complaints about such charges are many. There is, therefore, a situation where some charges, but not all, could be verified. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has had available to it for a long time the machinery which would have avoided these difficulties with subscriber trunk dialling and international subscriber dialling. Telecom has also had in its employ a large number of inspectors who were supposed to check on the honesty of Telecom employees in regard to complaints that certain technicians who had access to subscribers telephone services were abusing that access. The inspectors were supposed to examine those complaints. Many times on Senate Estimates committees, I have asked questions on the number of inspectors employed, the salaries paid and the number of charges brought against Telecom employees. From memory, on the most recent inquiry I made, which is now several years ago, there were then 49 inspectors paid, a very high total salaries bill and no charges had ever been brought against any employees of Telecom for abuse of access to subscriber telephone services. This is despite serious charges made by former employees of Telecom and by sections of the media about the abuse of access to subscriber services. Those serious and on occasions what appeared to be well-based charges were not investigated. Several years ago, 49 inspectors were employed to investigate abuses but no charges were ever levelled. This is what Telecom told us some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time when this subject arose for discussion in the Senate perhaps it would have been appropriate for a parliamentary committee to investigate the methods of charging by Telecom-Telecom told us that it was going to introduce this machinery available to it which would enable a recording of all metered calls so that all subscribers could have available to them access to information on calls for which they were being charged. It appeared to me from the answer that I received today in the Senate that what we were being told is that the installation of this ISD service is to be paid for by all subscribers whether they need it or not. There has been no indication that the system of recording and charging booked trunk calls is to be changed. Apparently one is still to pay the account even when the statement of account is incorrect. We are now told that with subscriber trunk dialling we will be able to get details of calls made by direct dialling within Australia. This is years after that service has been available. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the cost of this proposal? At present STD is automatically available on all telephone services. Certain telephone subscribers require that access to STD be barred. Large organisations require that a certain number of extensions passing through a switchboard have bars placed on them so that not all those telephone extensions can take STD calls. I think that we would all understand the reasons for that requirement. That has been a selective barring. It applies in respect of the Parliament House telephone system. Now ISD is to be available on the same basis and if the subscriber does not want to be charged for international subscriber dialling he must request that this be barred. I emphasise that the present situation with STD is that it would normally be available on all private subscribers' numbers. If subscribers do not use STD, they will not be charged for STD calls. If the subscriber can claim and verify on a reasonable basis that he never makes STD calls, he is excused from those charges. ISD is now to be made available on the same basis and simply because Telecom is bringing in a recording system which it should have had in operation years ago in relation to STD and ISD we are all now to pay if we do not want access to the system. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not suggested before that individual subscribers who did not want to use STD-certainly I am one of them now-should have had to pay a fee for not having access. It was not suggested when ISD was first introduced that if we did not choose to have access we would have to pay. Because ISD is to be available on the same basis as STD, now we must pay not to have access to international dialling. It is not good enough, according to Telecom, that the service is not used. We must positively prevent Telecom giving us that service and we must pay for that action. It was never felt that there was any need to charge for offering to people a barring for STD. As far as I am aware, unless they had been caught badly by a Telecom account of the type about which I recounted my experience earlier and sought an STD bar, most subscribers would be unaware that STD barring was available. Those who were aware of the barring device were those who encountered it in a work situation with a multi-telephone extension service. Why has this access to barring been introduced only in relation to ISD for what is claimed to be a moderate charge?</PARA>
<PARA> I could not care what the initial fee to be charged will be-whether it is moderate or large. A principle is at stake. I do not care whether it costs 20c, 40c or $40 to get a statement of trunk line calls for which one should never have been charged in the first place. The simple fact is that Telecom has a monopoly on this type of telecommunication in Australia. It is a statutory corporation in a monopolistic system and protected in its monopoly by the Government. There are a number of other what I consider essential services carried out by statutory corporations. I name organisations such as Trans-Australia Airlines, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Qantas Airways Limited. They have not resiled from competition with private enterprise. It has been necessary to have some regulation of the industry within which each organisation operates. I suggest it is time that the Government seriously addressed itself to looking at opening up to private enterprise the telecommunications services over which Telecom currently has a monopoly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator should just be quiet. I do not support an arrangement which enables private enterprise to pick the eyes out of the profitable area but I am saying that there have been other areas in which Government services have been considered to be necessary-I have named them-and in which it has been possible for statutory corporations, government backed to operate alongside private enterprise. I think it is time that the Government seriously considered that in relation to Telecom. We have the worst of both worlds in this situation. We have a statutory corporation in a monopolistic system claiming protection because it has to provide a service to areas which are uneconomic. I accept that because in my State of Queensland those services are essential and I accept that at this present stage it appears to be necessary to have a government backed enterprise which is able to provide such services. I also point out that in this same State we have difficulty with air communications. It has been possible to reach a situation whereby an air service can be provided by more than one organisation although part of the service is uneconomic. The Government ought to consider this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We, the supporters of the Liberal Government, cannot live with a monopoly which can charge for services never given and which can charge for providing a statement of account which proves that the services were never given and the consumer has no comeback. Those who feel and cannot prove that they have been overcharged by Telecom have absolutely nowhere else to turn. If they have been overcharged many of them, I believe, have a genuine case which ought to be accepted; but they are told: 'Pay up or else lose your service'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of overcharging on metered calls which I described earlier, the alternative that Telecom has given to date has been to install at a six-monthly rental rate a metering device. If a subscriber installs this device and there is still a discrepancy between the calls metered by it and the calls metered by Telecom the subscriber has to pay for the calls as metered by Telecom. Never mind that one is paying rental on Telecom's equipment to meter the charges and that its equipment, either the stuff installed in one's home or at the exchange, is faulty, one has to pay the charge that Telecom claims one should pay. One has no argument about it because Telecom is a monopoly. If Telecom cannot provide a more satisfactory service to consumers, it ought to be in competition. I think it has been amply shown over the years that Telecom cannot provide a service with which the consumer can be satisfied. Consumers cannot be satisfied that they have received the service for which they have been charged. A proposal to charge a fee to those people who choose not to have access to a service surely highlights the absurdity of it all. If Telecom seriously intends to proceed with this proposal then I think its position in the market-place ought to be very closely examined. The history of Telecom, its reliability, its sensitivity to consumers, its willingness to admit that it is wrong, is very poor indeed and it has brought on itself, through its own insensitivity, a questioning of its basic function in Australia. I say that without any blush, Senator Button. In all the years that I have been a member of the Liberal Party I may from time to time have examined why, and it is organisations such as Telecom which have persuaded me why. If we lived in a society in which we were subject to charges for services by organisations such as this, it would be a very frustrating and unrewarding society. Many thousand telephone subscribers have faced the situation of being totally convinced that they were being charged for services which they had not received and they have received absolutely no consideration at all in a reasonable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of overcharging on subscriber trunk dialling, it has been quite common for Telecom employees to say to elderly people: 'Oh, but you are old; you don't remember the telephone calls you have made'. Even if they had made claims that they rarely if ever used STD the fact that they were elderly or pensioners was held to be of sufficient proof that they could not possibly know better than the equipment which was demonstrably not totally satisfactory. Certainly there are cases of those who have operated with the system-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has already been said that it is traditional to take the opportunity on a motion for the first reading of a money Bill to speak on a variety of subjects. Honourable senators have certainly covered several subjects this evening. I take this opportunity to raise a subject which is causing me great concern and which should be causing the Government more concern than it is. I refer to the unemployed young people in our society. My concern stems from the proposal, following the October election last year, that the Government intended to cut the unemployment benefit for young people under the age of 18 years. My concern also is that we are not even aware of what is happening in our society because of unemployment among our young people. Practically no money is being spent on research to find out just what these people who are unemployed are feeling and their reaction to the society which virtually has rejected them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 19 December last year in the West Australian a very moving letter from a person living in Sorrento was published in the Letters to the Editor section. The person claimed that he was usually apathetic when it came to government policy but he felt at that stage that he could no longer privately contain his anger at the Government's shortsighted and dehumanised policy toward youth unemployment. The letter went on to read:</PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, as I voice my views among my acquaintances, I am struck by the number who share my opinion. The silent majority, among whom I none too proudly number myself, are not indifferent; rather, individually, they feel powerless to influence the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Combined effort by the mass of people must force the Government into action; and who in the community can stand indifferent? As actors we play many different parts-friends, neighbours, workmates, uncles, aunts, parents and grandparents. As a community we are involved and touch each other. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps your child is employed-but what of his best friend, his mate that dratted kid who's been arriving at inopportune moments on Sunday morning since he was six, letting in flies, walking in sand and helping himself to the food? Directly or indirectly we are all involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The fight against inflation must not be won at the expense of our kids. The cost is too dear. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the writer of that letter. I think it sets out very clearly the effects that unemployment, particularly as it relates to young people in our society, is having on those people who were perhaps once apathetic and who now are part of that silent majority gradually finding its voice. We also find that a number of small reports-articles in psychiatric magazines and medical journals-are coming to light which show that individuals are doing some research on the effects of unemployment on young people. One article that I read recently was by Dr Robert Kosky, the psychiatric superintendent at the Child Psychiatry Services division of the Mental Health Services in Western Australia who is also a visiting psychiatrist at the Princess Margaret Hospital for children in Perth. Dr Kosky, in the light of the very high unemployment in the 15 to 19 year age group and on the basis of his clinical work, has made some observations which were printed in the Australian Family Physician of December 1980. The article was entitled 'Unemployment/mental health of adolescents'. I do not intend to read the whole article. I will seek leave at a later stage to have it incorporated in Hansard for the attention of honourable senators. It is important to record some of what Dr Kosky said. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an astonishing lack of research into the mental health of young people who experience long term unemployment, although this aspect is often referred to in sociological studies. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to pay particular attention to those very descriptive words that Dr Kosky used to describe the feelings of these unemployed people. For instance, he used words such as depressed, angry, powerless, impotent, bored, lonely, frustrated and rejected. Those feelings are all very real and it is all very sad that not only do we not provide enough money for research into these areas but also we do not even bother to find out just how those people who are affected most by high unemployment are coping. Dr Robert Kosky said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an astonishing lack of research into the mental health of young people who experience long term unemployment . . . It is possible to make out a prima facie case that unemployment is associated with poor mental health from a number of isolated studies-</PARA>
<PARA> Juvenile delinquency in South Australia was associated with unemployed status of offenders and offenders' parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of attempted suicide in unemployed persons in a large Victorian country town was twelve times the average area rate. In Blacktown Municipality of New South Wales, it was estimated that 30-40 per cent of people attempting suicide were unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of 15-24-year-olds who were treated for the first time by the Mental Health Authority (Victoria) and who were unemployed, 11 per cent were diagnosed as alcoholic. The majority of 15,000 people under 25 years, estimated to be homeless in Melbourne in 1978 were said to be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployed persons reported more respiratory illnesses, more migraines, more blackouts and more irritability, than employed persons in a South Australian study. Twenty-one per cent of Community Youth Support System, and 35 per cent of Commonwealth Employment Service clients reported 'often feeling depressed'. None of these studies assesses personal mental health adequately. Nor do they decide between cause and effect. </PARA>

<PARA> What happens to young people who cannot get work? What do they feel?</PARA>
<PARA> My clinical work brings me into contact with many adolescents who cannot find work. A dozen of these I have interviewed regularly over a period of one to three years in each case. I would like to describe what I have observed. </PARA>
<PARA> They all started their search for employment on leaving school with confidence and optimism. As successive attempts fo find a job proved fruitless, they got angry. They reckoned they had been deceived by school and, when their friends found work (often through the personal influence of parents) they felt unfairly treated. Still they showed courage to go on applying for jobs, some over a hundred times. 'It was like', said one, 'having each morning to climb into the ring with Muhammad Ali knowing that . . . well . . . boom'. Suddenly, they felt let down-powerless to do anything about their situation, impotent in the face of seemingly endless rejections of their offered services. Overton has captured this feeling in his cartoons, reproduced here by kind permission of the editor of Nation Review. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to all honourable senators that they look at them. Whilst they are in cartoon form, I assure honourable senators that they are too real to be funny. Dr Kosky continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The unemployed person had little spare cash and could not afford to keep up socially with his or her friends. They parted company-a further blow to the self-esteem of the unemployed person. Now, instead of going out and enjoying social activities, the jobless person sat around home all day watching television (often quite oblivious to the program content), bored, lonely and frustrated. At this stage some became very depressed and this was in marked contrast to their earlier and normal selves. One tried to kill himself, several others started abusing drugs and alcohol apparently to escape feelings of despair. </PARA>
<PARA> This phase lasted several months before contact was begun with others in a similar position-often met as drinking companions. They then linked up with other unemployed and a happier period began. Activities were enjoyed again and television was eschewed. But I had noticed a change in the personalities of the people I was seeing. In place of those personal aspirations for their future which they had previously cherished, they now talked about having new ideals and personal philosophies. These, it seemed to me, did not have much to do with their own unique personal qualities or experiences but were, rather, products of their new group experiences- with other long-term unemployed persons. However they en- abled the person to take a renewed interest in life.</PARA>
<PARA> The first phases of anger and despair were reactions to the experiences of rejection. Obtaining work brought a return to normal mental health. However once the group phase had settled in, changes were difficult to reverse. The young person appeared to lose interest in working, or if work were obtained, to lack any enthusiastic commitment, tire quickly of it, and hanker for return to jobless status. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to look more closely at why this might be so . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In adolescence the two major psychological tasks are the establishment of independence and the consolidation of a sense of personal identity. It should be clear that unemployment can cut directly across the accomplishment of both of these tasks. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Kosky goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> However the jobless adolescent must turn from the parents to the State for the money to buy the necessities of life. The alternatives are to remain dependent on parents in some way, or to engage in crime. </PARA>
<PARA>To me, the most important part of that problem is crystal clear. Unemployment is of such a magnitude and of such a destructive nature to our young people that only real and long term solutions should be sought. In the light of anguish of the majority of young unemployed, the Government's reported proposal to cut the unemployment benefit can be regarded only as cynical and distasteful-cynical as an attempt to merely reduce the number of people officially unemployed while making no real impact on unemployment and distasteful in that the Fraser Government has turned on a section of our society which is not politically powerful and which it has systematically over the years, denigrated by encouraging the use of the term 'dole bludgers'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how many honourable senators received the questionnaire that I had on my desk some two weeks ago when last we were in this place but, from memory, it came from an institute of learning in South Australia. The questionnaire asked me to express my opinion on a number of matters relating to unemployment. Among all the questions, it asked, something to the effect: How did I personally view dole payments? I object wholeheartedly to the use of the word 'dole'. It is an insulting word. The people who receive that benefit are receiving an unemployment benefit. We do not ever suggest that aged people received an age dole. Yet if honourable senators look at the word in the dictionary, they will see that its meaning could allow it to be used in that sense. 'Dole' means a payment from charity or a payment by the State as a benefit, so any benefit that a person receives could be considered to be dole. But this is all part and parcel of the conditioning we have had in our society over the last few years-this conditioning of setting Australian against Australian, the employed against the unemployed and the trade unionist against the employer. We now find that it is common even for unemployed people to talk about the dole. They talk about the Commonwealth Employment Service as the unemployment office and, as I say, they talk about their unemployment benefit as the dole and they do so with what appears to be some sense of pride or achievement. They have had to do so in order to react against what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) think that they can balance their books at the expense of our kids. The last time I stood in this place and referred to young people as kids I received a number of letters from people saying that kids were goats. Well, I have two kids of my own. Fortunately, one is employed but the other is still at school and I have to recognise the distinct possibility that with the situation that pertains in this country at the moment he may be very lucky ever to be employed. He is my kid and I want the best for him as I am sure most honourable senators in this place want the best for theirs. But, as the letter which I quoted at the beginning of my speech said, the cost is too dear if in actual fact we allow the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to balance their books purely and simply at the expense of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of reports of various studies that have been done on this matter. In the Age of 21 January this year another study was reported which is claimed to be one of the first to evaluate scientifically the emotional problems of the unemployed. It sampled 313 people in Melbourne-not a very large sample, I am sure honourable senators will agree, but probably once again all that could be done given the possible financial limitations of this necessary research area. In that study researchers found that of the 169 unemployed-mostly under 35 years of age-37 per cent showed a dangerous level of anxiety. Sixteen per cent needed urgent treatment. The study described such anxiety levels as comparable to those of maximum security prisoners in Pentridge. That is an incredible statement to be made. A high percentage of unemployed people had anxiety levels similar to those of maximum security prisoners in Pentridge, a Melbourne University study has found. The report in the Age went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The study was conducted by Dr Alan Hughes, senior lecturer in political sociology at Melbourne University, and Mr Talisgolis, a registered psychologist and a lecturer in political psychology at La Trobe University. Dr Hughes said the study indicated that anxiety neurosis, with symptoms such as a sickly appearance, hand tremor, speech hesitation and restless body movement, was at a ''dangerous level among the unemployed''. </PARA>
<PARA> He said people suffering from anxiety neurosis would be unlikely to find employment even if jobs were freely available. In most cases, they would also be unable to get psychiatric help. Dr Hughes said it was common for a young person unemployed for a long period to pass through four stages: financial problems because of a failure to find a job; an inability to maintain friendships because of the stigma of being unemployed, accompanied by distrust and despair; the growth of uncontrollable anxiety, with depression, suicide, in extreme cases. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . He said many young unemployed did not reply when asked to describe their lives. ''They can no longer make sense of their situation or describe it with any hope,'' Dr Hughes said. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ''The questions people are asking themselves are: 'Will I get a job?' in contrast to 'What sort of job will I get?' and 'Will I hold this job?' rather than 'Where will it take me?''</PARA>
<PARA> . . . . Dr Hughes said that if the Federal Government moved to cut unemployment benefits to people under 18, it would have a disastrous effect on the young unemployed. 'It is imperative for the Federal Government to reconsider it,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>As we have not heard any mention of it over the last few weeks I hope the Government has reconsidered it. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> ''To suggest taking away their unemployment assistance would lead to personal tragedy for which the politicians would be directly responsible.''</PARA>
<PARA>So clearly, cutting the unemployment benefit to young people is no answer, especially when the Government is in no position to offer employment. The cold hard fact is that unemployment is not easing. One does not have to be an economist or a mathematician to find that; one has to look only at the reports that regularly flood across the desks of members of parliament. Alan Austin said in an article in the Nation Review in October that although 'unemployment has grown marginally, evidence suggests that the Government's drive to remove unemployed and disabled people from the registers may have had a lot to do with it'. The Age editorial of Friday, 23 January this year asked, 'What work, Mr Viner?', in reply to the Minister's statement of the day before that there was employment around if people were motivated to find it. The editorial had to point out to the Minister the reality of the situation. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In December 430,000 Australians were looking for work, one-third of them teenagers, but only about 30,000 jobs were looking for workers. Most young people who are on the dole are unemployed because there are not nearly enough jobs for them, not because they are stupid or lazy or because the education system has failed them. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Employment Service figures show that unemployment is still rising. Its figures indicate that in December last year there were at least 20,000 more people without jobs than there were in December 1979. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment for juniors for December was 146,200. More than 21 per cent of the junior work force do not have a job. In the West Australian of 16 January this year a report stated that the unemployment rate for juniors did not fall below 16.7 per cent during 1980. That is a disgraceful statement to be made on the part of a government that professes to be concerned about those young unemployed people in our community. But those official figures do not take into account the hidden unemployment which would substantially raise the numbers out of work officially. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Kosky, in his article, is obviously alluding to certain sections of those hidden unemployed when he refers to unemployed women and to some of the serious ramifications of the position they find themselves in. I repeat that this article is by Dr Robert Kosky who is a Psychiatrist Superintendent of the Child Psychiatry Division of the Mental Health Services of Western Australia. He is also Visiting Psychiatrist at the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth. He is obviously a very feeling person. He is obviously a person who recognises that the problem in our society does not stop with the young unemployed; it continues on through to the societal problems which are created by their very unemployment. Dr Kosky, in referring to women, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The position of women in relation to unemployment presents special problems which have not yet been clearly defined. While it is generally accepted that women have as much right to work as men and to receive equivalent remuneration, in practice this not yet the case. Furthermore, it is often stated that women should keep out of the work force in the present difficult employment situation. What effect these opposing forces have on young women seeking work from school is not known. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind the high and rising rate of attempted suicide in young females, the high incidence of depressive disorders in women compared with men, the recent increased incidence of failed marriages, it might be argued that women are seeking to escape the competition for jobs and the conflicting attitudes about their place in the work force, by contracting early unhappy and unsuccessful marriages. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Kosky takes part of that quotation from 'Trends in Suicidal Behaviour and its Management' published in the Australian-New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry 1980 by Goldney and Burvil. His comments, as he admits, are speculative, but I would think that the majority of the people in this place and in the other place have a fair amount of contact with the unemployed and could hardly express surprise at that appraisal. It is these human aspects of the tragedy of the young unemployed that I believe politicians and others who influence the destinies of the young should constantly keep in mind. We find, unfortunately, that the Government tends to sweep them under the carpet. I get the impression that the Government would like to ignore the problem in the hope that it will eventually go away. One of the things that it has to recognise is that it is just not going to disappear. The number of unemployed young people in our society will continue to grow until such time as the Government takes positive action and really makes its presence felt in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Some welfare groups have warned that the Federal Government's proposal to discontinue the unemployment benefit for 16 and 17-year-olds could heighten problems associated with homelessness, crime, alcohol and drug abuse, and possibly even the destruction of the family unit. I would say that a large number of families have already found themselves virtually destroyed either because they are affected by young unemployed people in their unit or because one of the parents has suddenly become unemployed. There are any number of refuges for unemployed in all States-the Jesus People Inc. in Western Australia, the Reverend Ted Noffs's Wayside Chapel in Sydney. There are such refuges throughout Melbourne-in the eastern and western suburbs-and in Brisbane, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania. They are all there and they will all tell us much the same thing-that after a short period on unemployment benefit, being rejected time after time for jobs for which they apply, young people particularly go through four stages, becoming more and more depressed and more and more susceptible to crime, alochol and drug abuse, and destruction of the family unit. Dr Kosky states:</PARA>
<PARA> As a group of individuals who are disallowed full social acceptance, the unemployed group becomes stigmatized. They are then identified, by outsiders, in terms of stereotypes. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs have unmercifully labelled sections of the unemployed as dole bludgers. Senator Mason spoke earlier about travel by aircraft in Australia. He put a different interpretation on it. I have some of my most interesting contacts with people on my very long flights from Perth to Canberra and Canberra to Perth every week, which, incidentally, take me almost two days. I am concerned at the growing number of well educated, possibly even well meaning, people in our society who have now latched on to the term, 'dole bludger'. As far as the majority of people are concerned any young person who does not have a job, whether it is because he or she cannot get a job really is not important, is a dole bludger. When the Governor-General opened the new session of Parliament in this chamber in November last year he expressed a concern for unemployed people, but the Government has done very little about unemployed people, especially unemployed young people, in the last five years. It has had five years-almost five and a half years-in office and it has still not done anything about the situation. Dr Kosky states:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, these stereotypes represent projections onto the group by the outsiders and have little basis in the actual individuals who make up the group. </PARA>
<PARA>They are then identified by outsiders in terms of the stereotype that I have already mentioned. Dr Kosky states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . .'dole bludger' is familiar enough. Others are 'aggressive rebels against society' or 'a moral cancer in the community' or the paternalistic 'problem kids who need saving from themselves'. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately it appears likely that these very stereotypes are used in bonding the individuals in the group. All, as individuals, felt impotent. The group acceptance provides strength by increasing the individual's self esteem.</PARA>
<PARA>What of the possible effects? Dr Kosky explains one. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the values inherent in the stereotypes are inverted. Work becomes self-debasement, poverty or virtue, rags a fashion.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst work was initially sought as a means of acceptance into society it may now mean giving up the comfortable acceptance of the group which has nourished a wounded self-esteem. Dr Kosky further states:</PARA>
<PARA> To take the first alternative invites the possibility of further rejections, like those previously experienced, with no sure knowledge that, having turned ones back on the group, one will be accepted back if the need arises. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fraser has said that the Government owes young people more than an inadequate schooling and the dole. At one stage he asked 'Would you leave them the option of just getting unemployment benefit?'. I have to say: 'No, Mr Fraser, I would not leave them in limbo on a meagre $36 a week and I certainly would not consider cutting that benefit and claiming that it would ensure the youth of Australia a better preparation for the workforce by forcing them back to school'. More schooling will really produce only a more educated group of unemployed. The Government just does not seem to appreciate that the jobs are not there. An article in the National Times of 25 to 31 January has rightly pointed out that for the large majority the lack of the paltry $36-which, incidentally, is nearly $30 below the poverty line-would not cause these young people to return to school. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Many assume that the parent who takes a child from school to put him or her to work is a figure who died with the Dickens novel and the Great Depression. They forget that one in five Australian family income units are still at or below the Henderson poverty line (a figure that is growing worse, according to a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics income survey). And one in 10 families is headed by a lone parent who is often desperate for a teenage child to supplement the family income and even to take over as breadwinner. </PARA>
<PARA>Those students, those young people belonging to those low income, below the poverty line families, are forced from school by poverty. Forcing them to stay at school by non-payment of the unemployment benefit only places more of those family units at risk. I believe that it is totally callous and unreasonable to expect families already living below the poverty line to shoulder the entire responsibility of young unemployed members of their families. Within that context, this is the real poverty that exists in this country. It is clear that the Government has reneged on the statement of the Governor-General, in his speech in this chamber on 25 November 1980, when he expressed concern with the human dimensions of the serious issue of youth unemployment. How long after that statement was made by the Governor-General did the Government come up with the bright idea of suspending the payment of unemployment benefit to those young people who had left school before they were 18 years of age?</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Statistics figures that I referred to earlier showed that of the 1.7 million income units below the poverty line more than 200,000 are living on less than $40 a week. Young unemployed who are not at home clearly fall into this category, that is, if they are claiming the benefit. We may ask: What of the unemployed who have left school through choice, those whom Mr Fraser may describe as dole bludgers? The National Times article states that a study conducted by the Outer Western Sydney Regional Council for Social Development among unemployed in the suburbs of Blacktown, Mount Druitt, Penrith, St Marys and the Blue Mountains found that 25 per cent of unemployed youth left school because they did not like it. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Many, however, do not claim-</PARA>
<PARA>Once again we find that reprehensible phrase-</PARA>
<PARA>the dole. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of studies, including the Norgard report on the Commonwealth Employment Service of 1977 which was commissioned by this Government, have found that about one-third of all unemployed do not register with the CES. The article in the National Times of 25 to 31 January from which I have already quoted continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A great many youth who leave school for reasons besides poverty don't claim the dole because of the stigma attached to it. So withholding payment is hardly likely to force them back into the classroom. </PARA>
<PARA>To break out of the vicious circle we need the real economic recovery that the Fraser Government has been promising us for nearly six long years. I do not believe it is any longer any good for the Government to complain about what the people of Australia are failing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We have gone through a phase where it was the consumers who were responsible for the lack of economic return. Then it was business which was responsible for the lack of economic return. I do not believe it is any longer any good for the Government to seek to indoctrinate the Australian community to advance Australia. I do not believe that it is any good indulging in grandiose talk about new youth schemes and a brighter future for the young unemployed. The Fraser Government's attempts to deprive many young job seekers of any money to live on would punish them and their families who might already be struggling just to make ends meet. I believe it is an indecent attempt to form some economic recovery by cooking the books and fiddling with the numbers when all the facts clearly point to the Government's continuing failure to stimulate that economic recovery. Conscripting kids back to school is not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I question when Mr Fraser will show us that his Government is prepared to develop a serious approach to the tragic problem and the social consequences of youth unemployment. If he is serious about using the school system to alleviate youth unemployment, his record certainly does not show it. As I have said, he has had the last five or six years to implement his educational programs designed to relieve unemployment. They have not done so. The question remains: When will the Government fulfil its promise? I remind honourable senators of a promise made in 1975 prior to the election at a time when Mr Fraser was the caretaker Prime Minister of this country. He said: 'Every person who wants to work will have a job.' I have cited figures already tonight. Hundreds of thousands of people who want to work cannot get a job because of the callous and extreme attitude being expressed by this Government, particularly to those people who fall into that 16 to 18 years age group. I seek leave to incorporate a report by Dr Robert Kosky, the child psychiatrist from the Mental Health Services of Western Australia, from which I have been reading at various stages of my speech. I notified the Deputy President who was in the chair earlier that it would be my intention at the end of my speech so to do. I have not shown it to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). I do so now. I seek leave to have the report incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment and the mental health of adolescents</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 February 1980, there were 442,400 people registered as unemployed in Australia. One third of these were aged between 15 and 19 years. (Australian Bureau of Statistics)</PARA>
<PARA>Any attempt to understand the effects of unemployment on these tens of thousands of young Australians must therefore take into consideration that they are adolescents. Their social circumstances will have some effect in determining the outcome of the developmental processes which occur in this phase of life, and on what sort of adults they will become. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to look more closely at why this might be so. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment and the developmental processes of adolescence</PARA>
<PARA> In adolescence, the two major psychosocial tasks are the establishment of independence and the consolidation of a sense of personal identity. It should be clear that unemployment can cut directly across the accomplishment of both of these tasks. </PARA>
<PARA>Independence The school child is dependent on parents (or guardians) for food and shelter. It is made clear to him or her that ultimately these commodities will have to be obtained independently. This independence is a basis for acceptance as an adult. However the jobless adolescent must turn from the parents to the State for the money to buy the necessities of life. The alternatives are to remain dependent on parents in some way, or to engage in crime. </PARA>
<PARA> Dependency on the State for 'charity' is not considered by our society to be an acceptable demonstration of adult capacity, it suggests that the dependant for instance, could not support a family. Furthermore it is considered a shameful situation not to be able to exchange labour for money. This is reinforced by the demands of the State that the unemployed must register as dependant and must submit to inspection of his or her private activities. The unemployed young person is consequently labelled as a shamed person. It should not be forgotten that his or her parents share the same sense of shame and, for some fathers particularly, this is a situation very hard for them to accept and may result in tremendous conflict with their children. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>* Despite unemployment being the major social phenomenon of the past five years, there has been negligible research into its effects on mental health. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>* The inability to demonstrate a capacity to support oneself independently is a shameful experience for young people. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Identity</PARA>
<PARA> As a group of individuals who are disallowed full social acceptance, the unemployed group becomes stigmatized. They are then identified, by outsiders, in terms of stereotypes. The stereotype of the 'dole bludger' is familiar enough. Others are 'aggressive rebels against society' or 'a moral cancer in the community' or the paternalistic 'problem kids who need saving from themselves'. Of course, these sterotypes represent projections onto the group by the outsiders and have little basis in the actual individuals who make up the group.5</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately it appears likely that these very stereotypes are used in bonding the individuals in the group. All, as individuals, felt impotent. The group acceptance provides strength by increasing the individual's self esteem. In order for this to happen, personal aspirations are given up and group ideals replace them. </PARA>
<PARA> These ideals are elaborations of the common stereotypes but, in order to regain power and overcome the sense of impotence the values inherent in the stereotypes are inverted. Work becomes self-debasement, poverty a virtue, rags a fashion. To maintain group acceptance some at least of these group values need to be retained and therefore the person may find himself in a dilemma when work is offered. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, work offers the possibility of acceptance into the wider world of adults. On the other, it means giving up the comfortable acceptance of the group which has nourished a wounded self esteem. To take the first alternative invites the possibility of further rejections, like those previously experienced, with no sure knowledge that, having turned one's back on the group, one will be accepted back if the need arises. </PARA>
<PARA> The shaming experiences and the new ideals seem to become fixed in a personal identity. This may be seen as an essentially negative identity based on what, for our society, might be considered negative qualities and unpleasant feelings. </PARA>
<PARA>Social effects of group bonding</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this whole question is open to politico-sociological analysis. One can interpret the situation as a good thing or a bad thing, depending on one's own notions about personal and social interactions and change. </PARA>
<PARA> There are obvious social possibilities which ought to be briefly considered. For instance, there is, by virtue of the bonding inherent in groups, the power to create opposition to existing social structures. The group processes are themselves vulnerable to manipulation (as Freud pointed out 60 years ago), by outsiders. Such possibilities ought not to be considered farfetched. Countries which share with Australia the highest rate of youth unemployment in the western world-Italy and Britain-have both experienced violent rioting with extreme political action undertaken by groups involving unemployed young people. </PARA>
<PARA>Women</PARA>
<PARA> The position of women in relation to unemployment presents special problems which have not yet been clearly defined. While it is generally accepted that women have as much right to work as men and to receive equivalent remuneration, in practice this is not yet the case. Furthermore, it is often stated that women should keep out of the work force in the present difficult employment situation. What effect these opposing forces have on young women seeking work from school is not known. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind the high and rising rate of attempted suicide in young females,2 the high incidence of depressive disorders in women compared with men, the recent increased incidence of failed marriages,11 it might be argued that women are seeking to escape the competition for jobs and the conflicting attitudes about their place in the work force, by contracting early unhappy and unsuccessful marriages. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of available research studies has led me to utilize my own clinical observations and to proffer a number of hypotheses about what happens, psychologically, to adolescents who cannot find employment. I am conscious of the limitations of such a speculative appraisal. Nevertheless; I do not think my arguments about the effects of unemployment on the mental health of young people are in major disagreement with the scattered information that has appeared in the literature relevant to the Australian scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the hypotheses regarding the processes involved, I think these remain to be tested. I feel that failure to analyze the major issues will result in continuing cost to our society. That, so far, this major social phenomenon has largely escaped careful psychological, social and political analysis is in itself a curious matter. In a culture based, as ours is, on paternal lineage, perhaps we underestimate the hostility engendered in the older generations by the potential of the young. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity on the first reading of a money Bill to raise briefly a matter that has been of some concern to me for a few weeks and of grave concern to a trade union and particularly trade union organisers operating in one region of Australia. I hoped that the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, would have been present to hear what I have to say. As best as I can understand the situation, the matter comes under his portfolio by virtue of the fact that a certain company is a contractor to the Pipeline Authority and is laying a gas pipeline between Wagga and Young. The firm concerned is Red Rue Construction Co. Pty Ltd. I understand that it is a Queensland-based company and its principal is a Mr Nicholas. A letter I received today from Mr David Crease, the Federal and State organiser in Canberra of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had extreme difficulties in establishing elementary employer Trade Union relationships with Mr Nicholas. Even though our approach has been normal in the sense that we have shown the usual courtesies, Mr Nicholas has been extemely difficult, threatening physical violence against Union Officials and workers, refusing to observe statutory provisions in respect to safety, site amenities, and other similar related matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not about these sort of things that I write to you, but I mention them to provide a background to industrial relations on this project. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter I wish to draw to your attention and about which we seek some assistance concerns an incident in which a worker was killed. </PARA>
<PARA> The accident occurred when a crane of Red Rue's-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the company concerned-</PARA>
<PARA> No Safety Certificate of worthiness, was operated by a dogman, who was instructed to drive the crane. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the instructions given to the dogman were that he drive the crane or lose his job. The letter goes on to state, in brackets, that the dogman was not the holder of a crane operator's certificate, and continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The crane came into contact with overhead power lines, and electrocuted the dogman, Mr Miers, (Mr Miers was not a trained dogman, nor had he the necessary experience to hold a certificate). He was a young jeweller by trade, and was attempting to get a few dollars together working for Red Rue Pipeline Constructions. The crane was in poor condition at the time of the accident, and had previously collapsed, dropping its load on at least three (3) previous occasions. I am also told that another employee of Red Rue was electrocuted fatally in Queensland, by a crane of Red Rue. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> I-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the author of the letter-</PARA>
<PARA>believe that Senator Carrick was instrumental in the contract being awarded to Red Rue Constructions, and the question of whether this irresponsible employer should retain the contract for this pipeline or any other by the Federal Government should be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> The excuse given by Mr Nicholas of not adhering to the safety standards was, as far as he knew the job was a Federal Government one and therefore did not come under the rules of any state safety regulations-this false assumption only goes to substantiate the irresponsible attitude of this employer. </PARA>
<PARA> As you may guess from the tone of my correspondence I am extremely irate, not only about the unnecessary death of a fine Australian lad, but the fact that a person like Mr Nicholas may get off with a nominal fine for a possible breach of a statute. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that from the information given verbally to me it would appear that this company and, in particular, Mr Nicholas have thrown every spanner and every obstacle they can in the path of industry and research officials who have been seeking to investigate Mr Nicholas's plant and machinery. He has also been extremely rude not only to union organisers but also to his staff. I hope that Senator Carrick, being the sort of person that he is, might take up this matter with the Pipeline Authority and in future make sure that persons such as this are not employed by a Commonwealth statutory authority such as the one I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For you, Senator; not for me. Australia is involved in what could be called the great tax sharing debate. Essentially this is a political argument and, as it applies to governments, it is not party political. It is obvious that different parties will tackle the argument in different ways and come up with different solutions to it, but the problem will still be there whatever solutions might be presented. The plea I make in this brief speech is for a breadth of vision when looking at the whole range of problems and not looking at one or two isolated aspects of taxation with respect to the needs of the various States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument is not what it used to be. Formerly the argument was about how much the States in aggregate were getting from the Commonwealth Government as part of the share of personal income tax. That matter seems to have been satisfactorily resolved. The argument now is rather about how the individual States carve up the amount of money available. It is a very serious matter. All the signs at the moment are that the argument will get worse and embroil all of us. It will get worse for two reasons. Firstly, there is the economic decline in the principal manufacturing State of Australia, that is the economic decline in Victoria. Its tax base is diminishing or failing to grow from its own internal sources. Secondly, there is the contrast of the resource-rich States going ahead. These two factors are placing demands on the available funds because both groups feel they need more. One group feels it needs more because the inefficient industry is demanding more and more support whereas the other group of States-the resource-rich States-feel that they need more to develop the export earning industries which will produce the funds for the nation to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> The origins of this argument, of course, go back to 1942 when the uniform income tax Act was introduced. That Act provided an agreed formula for the distribution by the Commonwealth to the six States which existed at the time. This distribution formula was not sensitive enough and those States which had a small tax base to fall back on to supplement their income were falling behind the other States in the Commonwealth which had a larger tax base within their boundaries and so the Commonwealth Grants Commission was set up. The purpose of the Grants Commission quite simply was not to provide equivalent standards of living between the six Australian States but to raise those States that were behind to a very basic agreed level. I return to the point that under the tax formula there was an unequal distribution of funds to the several States. It is true that those States that paid the most tax gained less than they paid from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Some figures currently being circulated by the Victorian Treasury show that Victoria paid the highest tax per person in the Commonwealth. In 1979-80 it was an amount of $1,100 per head. Queensland paid the lowest amount of tax last year of $890 a head. But Victoria received only $318 per person from the Commonwealth as against $430 for every person in Queensland. That is a rather specious argument for a whole variety of reasons. It happens to be one of the principles of all governments that they do not return taxation to those people who contribute most. If that were true, the benefits and the discounts that were available to high income earners would exceed those that were available to low income earners. Of course, the fuel tax is a very good example. We all pay a great deal more collectively to Consolidated Revenue in excise duty on fuel than the Commonwealth Government spends on road grants. </PARA>
<PARA> When Victoria looks at this matter it gets a bit upset. As I will show later, this is because it is taking a very limited view of the situation. Victoria looks at the royalty payments that Queensland and Western Australia are earning and, in the case of Queensland, at the earnings from rail freights, and Victoria feels that it has been quite disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is only half the argument. Victoria fails to take into account the effect of transfer payments which accrue under the tariff programs that exist for Australia. These are quite huge and, most importantly, they are very unequally applied to the States. For example, the tariffs for every person living in Victoria are equivalent to $430 a head, yet in Queensland they amount to only $123. Putting it another way, I think the figure I saw last week in one of the newspapers in relation to payments made to people working in the motor industry was $15,000 a worker. Most of the workers in the motor industry happen to be in Victoria, with secondary involvement in New South Wales and South Australia. That is a very substantial payment to the community and it is in addition to the payments made by the Commonwealth in return for income tax disbursements to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting consequences of all of this is that in the various economic recessions we have had since the Second World War those States which enjoy the highest level of tariff protection as compared with those which have the lowest level, show a marked difference in the unemployment figures. Those States which have the highest unemployment are those which have the lowest recourse to tariff protection and vice versa. Of course, this is seen in the analysis of average incomes for the residents of the various States. This is a very important point to bear in mind. Despite this, when the Grants Commission looks at the several Australian States, it makes an award to Queensland despite the fact that more money is paid to Queensland than to Victoria under the income tax sharing scheme. That rather refutes the validity of the Victorian claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of this high tariff protection, of course, have led Victoria into the problem of a declining industrial virility at present because Victoria has been denied the natural competition of the market place. It has also led to the advancement of Queensland and Western Australia because they were denied the industrial development of the south and they had to turn to more export orientated industries. They have been very successful in that. The work force in Queensland went up by 4.4 per cent in 1979-80 whereas there was an increase of 1.8 per cent in Victoria for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the needs of Queensland are quite different to the needs of Victoria. So one can validate the claim for more money from the tax disbursements than it is getting. Queensland is Australia's most decentralised State. The last figures I was able to obtain are for the year ending 30 June 1976. Only 48.4 per cent of the Queensland population resided in urban centres of more than 100,000 persons compared with a nation-wide average of 64.5 per cent. Of Queensland's population, 31.7 per cent lived in urban centres of between 1,000 and 99,999 persons compared with 24.5 per cent throughout the whole country and 19.8 per cent resided in rural areas compared with 14 per cent throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of services to a highly decentralised population creates problems which are not faced in highly urbanised societies. The magnitude of these problems is evident when it is remembered that these higher costs must be shared by a significantly smaller tax base-a much smaller population-than exists to carry the burden of government services in parts of New South Wales and Victoria. One finds additional problems when one looks at the age distribution within the State. In Queensland, 43.8 per cent of the population is in the 0 to 18 years age bracket and over 65 years of age. This is the second highest percentage of the six States of what can be regarded as those outside the 19 to 64 years productive age group. The provision of services for the young in the form of full-time education and services for the elderly are both costly undertakings, and this places a considerable financial burden on the rest of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry employment statistics amplify further problems facing Queensland. Of the employed population, 9.7 per cent are engaged in primary industry, by far the highest figure and well above the Australia-wide average of 7.1 per cent. However, only 13.9 per cent of Queenslanders are employed in manufacturing compared with 24.2 per cent in Victoria, 20.9 per cent in New South Wales and 20.8 per cent in South Australia. Let us look at the break up of those figures in relation to those employed in the manufacturing industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These statistics indicate that the three industry groups enjoying the highest level of assistance-clothing and footwear, textiles and transport equipment-employ only 14.9 per cent of the Queensland manufacturing work force and contribute only 11.8 per cent of the value added to manufactured goods. On the other hand, the four industry groups with least protection-non-metallic mineral products, basic metal products, food, beverages, tobacco, and wood products-employ 52.3 per cent of the work force and contribute 57.5 per cent of the value added to manufactured goods. These figures illustrate the gross disadvantage which Queensland suffers under the current tariff laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a serious matter for two reasons. Most people do not recognise the transfer payments which tariffs occasion. Hence, there are ill-formed opinions about the inadequacies of the distribution of tax when it is viewed purely on an income tax distribution basis. Secondly, the tariffs lead to inefficient industries as we see in Victoria today. The motor car industry in Australia is a classic example. It means that there is a higher cost of doing business within Australia. That would be all right if we lived in isolation and if everything kept pace with everything else, but it does not. The cost of tariff protection is an additional cost for our exports, and it is very important to us. We do not live by taking in one another's washing. We live and grow by our export earnings. The country cannot develop if it does not earn money from abroad. So resource development and the export industries are absolutely crucial to us. We should have a good hard look at the effect of tariff protection on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of all of this is that it inhibits and retards resource development. Queensland, Western Australia and, I hope, South Australia and Tasmania, by developing resources, help the whole of the Australian community with their export earnings. At the same time, of course, States such as Queensland and Western Australia are helping themselves to catch up to a reasonable standard of living, the standard of living which has been enjoyed by the southern States for so many generations. Queensland is doing that by virtue of its mining royalties and its rail freights. The royalties are perfectly fair and accepted. They are perfectly legal from a constitutional point of view. The authority is vested in the State to levy these charges. These charges in Queensland, I am happy to say, are levied at a rate which the market will bear. The rail freights are an issue for Queensland's creative thinking. Queensland is making a profit-quite unashamedly-out of mineral rail freights. That is of benefit to the whole of the Australian community. Revenue from rail freights has increased from $12m in 1960 to $190m in 1980. The gross revenue from the railways has increased to approximately $353m in 1980. Out of this income, Queensland has been able to develop and to upgrade the rail system, which is very important in a large and decentralised State. It has enabled industrial development to take place through the building of rolling stock with its benefits of employment and the distribution of funds throughout Australia. It has enabled the subsidisation of passenger services to take place-in aggregate, $103m last year for the city and country passenger services and for the freight services throughout the State. It is important that this is done because if we did not earn revenue from the freighting of our minerals, there would be a charge against consolidated revenue, in one form or another, and the public would have to pay. This way the public does not pay; the industry pays. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to return to my original theme; the argument that we will face through the next five to ten years is the argument over the level of disbursements of personal income tax by the Commonwealth to the States. It is a very emotional issue. I think the temperature will rise very considerably as the balance within the Australian economy changes. It is not a simple argument. It needs to be understood in all its complexity and a balanced approach needs to be taken so that fairness shall prevail. If that happens, the whole Australian community can benefit because we can grow and develop the money from our export earnings which we need so much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of the first reading debate on these money Bills tonight to raise with the Government a matter which I think is scandalous and which exists all over Victoria. I refer to dental disease. So far as I can ascertain from my observations and from talking to people all over Victoria, we have a raging epidemic of dental disease in Victoria and neither the State Government nor the Federal Government will do anything about it. That may be, of course, because it is affecting mainly those who have no vote. It is affecting children, the aged and the handicapped who are in institutions. By far the most horrifying point of view, because of the inference it has for the future, is that it is the children of Victoria who are sick and suffering and who have a very dismal future because of this illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had reports from the country and from the city. I have had them from middle class suburbs in the east of Melbourne and from the working class suburbs in the north of Melbourne. Everywhere there is a raging epidemic of tooth decay and tooth loss. In December 1980, a school principal in Northcote reported that many children's teeth were rotting away. On closer examination, he said that 50 per cent of children in the preps and in grade 1 were in dire need of dental work. In October 1980, the principal of the Heidelberg Primary School reported that 50 per cent of his prep and grade 1 children were in dire need of dental treatment. That was the case in only the first two classes of those primary schools. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports were made to the Nunawading and Box Hill councils about the appalling state of children's teeth. The Camberwell City Council was advised of the deep concern expressed by a visiting dentist at a brush-in at a local school because of the large number of children whose first teeth were seriously decayed. The headmaster of a primary school of 356 pupils in Ballarat, Victoria, did a survey of those 356 pupils and found that over 60 children had complained of toothache in the previous three or four weeks, including children from each of the 12 grades; that over 60 children had been identified as needing urgent dental work, including children from each of the 12 grades; and that over 70 children had been identified as having very poor oral hygiene. That was despite no official inspection having been made, and the above numbers represented obvious attention needed. There would, of course, be more children than that number requiring attention. The problem is not new; that is the appalling aspect. It is not as though suddenly the children of Victoria have developed badly decayed teeth and badly diseased mouths. This has been going on for a considerable number of years and nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The very real problem that exists-I suspect it exists all over Australia although I have experience only of Victoria-was recognised by the Whitlam Government. That Government, in its 1975-76 Budget, allocated $26.4m towards achieving the goal of free dental treatment for all primary school children by 1982. That was a great goal and would have been a wonderful achievement. The present Government, in 1975-76, reduced that $26.4m to $24m and in 1980-81 has made available only $23.3m. Six years later, after all the inflationary increases that have come about because of this Government's policies, we have less money to spend on dental care than we had in 1975-76 and we have no goal. The amount allocated in 1975-76 was reduced when the Fraser Government took power. In 1976-77 it reduced that amount even further. In 1976 the Fraser Government said that it planned to provide a dental service to all primary school children by 1985. There is not one sign of that planned dental service and the dental health of the children of Australia is worse than it ever was and is getting worse still. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme to provide a dental service for all primary school children depended on dental therapists being trained. In 1976 it was estimated that we needed 2,300 therapists to provide a free dental service for all primary school children. In 1976 only 944 of those 2,300 had been trained. The expenditure on the training of therapists has been almost halved. No more facilities have been built. The scheme has not been expanded. So in 1981, five years after the Fraser Government said that it had a goal of a dental service for all primary school children by 1985, Victoria has the lowest percentage in Australia of children covered by a dental scheme and appalling dental health. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the primary school children who are in bad need of dentists and of dental care. In 1976 the dental advisory committee to the Minister for Health in Victoria reported that the state of dental health in Victoria was still deplorable. It had previously reported in 1969 and nothing had been done in the intervening years. This study pointed out that particular groups were in great need of dental assistance. Those groups were the frail aged, handicapped children, disadvantaged school children and the populations of small towns. The results of the survey confirmed the need for more dentists to improve the deplorable state of dental health in Victoria and in addition highlighted the need for a comprehensive dental health survey in Victoria, for the rational development of dental care services in Victoria and for better education of dentists to cope with the special dental health problems of disadvantaged groups. Nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey found that in 1976 and, as I said earlier, in 1969 there were about 300,000 people in Victoria over the age of 65 years; and no one knew what their state of dental health was. A small pilot study was done of 100 aged people visiting or confined in a geriatric institution. It was found that 97 said that they seldom visited a dentist and over 25 said that they could not remember when they last visited one. A high proportion of the patients did not know where their nearest dentist was located. Seventy-two said that they could not manage public transport before entering hospital and one-third of those would have no one to assist them to visit a dentist when they left the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> More than half the group said that they had had their teeth extracted more than 20 years ago and three had neither natural teeth nor dentures. More than half claimed that their dentures were more than 10 years old and about one-third thought they needed new dentures. The examiners considered that two-thirds of the dentures were poorly cleaned and that about one-third were encrusted with deposits of calculus. About two-thirds of the patients with dentures needed new dentures or repairs to their dentures. Many of the patients who had retained some natural teeth had severe disease and/or tooth decay. Often such patients were not aware of any disease processes occurring in their mouths. Some urgently required treatment for dental decay. There were not enough trained dental personnel at the institution to give adequate care to sufficient numbers of the patients in need. That was in 1969 and it was repeated in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year in Victoria a similar survey was done and the same people said that, if anything, the situation had got worse and that nobody seemed to care whether aged people, frail or not, received adequate dental care. There are no additional dentists in Victoria but there is a greater population. There are no additional trained dental personnel. There are no additional dental clinics. That sort of situation cannot help the health of aged people. It cannot help them if they cannot eat properly, if they cannot eat proper food and if they are in pain and their mouths are ulcerated. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group that these people in Victoria were concerned about was handicapped children. If, as I have suggested, the dental health of healthy children, of children who are not in institutions or of children who are not physically handicapped is bad, then the dental care of handicapped children in Victoria is appalling. There is very little hope that they will get any dental care at all. There are more than 20,000 handicapped children in Victoria and about half of them are severely handicapped. The handicaps include cerebral palsy, spina bifida, mental retardation, chronic disease, deafness, blindness and some congenital conditions. The dental disorders of the handicapped are more severe, more difficult to treat and frequently more prevalent than those of the normal population. Oral hygiene procedures are far more difficult to carry out on the handicapped and consequently gum disorders are more severe there than they are in the normal population. </PARA>
<PARA> The preliminary findings of all these surveys are that handicapped children suffer from much untreated dental disease, including decayed teeth, gum disorders and irregular teeth. The existing dental services, through both government and voluntary agencies, are hopelessly inadequate and overloaded. There are few preventive dental care programs operating within institutions. A number of institutions have routine dental facilities but cannot get either voluntary or salaried staff. Special dental facilities for treating handicapped patients are inadequate; that is, patients frequently require anaesthesia, yet such facilities are available at only a few centres where waiting lists are already very long. Education of more dentists in the special procedures of caring for the handicapped is urgently needed. There is a need for special education for dentists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never spoken before in this chamber on the subject of dental health, but I am moved to reflect on a few aspects of it, with no reference at all to any previous debate tonight. The Federal Government has been involved in funding dental health for some eight or nine years now-I am not sure for how long-and the current annual payment through the school dental services would run in excess of $20m. I think it is a worthwhile and laudable service insofar as it provides a form of treatment that it is necessary to deliver. I have some thoughts on whether the Government is moving to supply that service in the most cost-effective way, but that is not a matter I am prepared to discuss tonight because we are debating the adjournment of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I would like to get across with great firmness to the Senate is that the school dental service, or any service of that nature, is a reparative service. It is a service that is provided after disease has occurred, and in that sense it is wrong because dental disease is preventable. Dental disease is one disease that need not occur in the human race, and that has been known for 20 or 30 years. The classic means of prevention on a public health scale, of course, is through the application of fluoride to drinking water. If we do not like that, we can have recourse to dietary control measures, the restriction-not the elimination but the restriction-of refined carbohydrates in the diet being one of the methods. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the statistics on dentists' children. Those statistics show that some 20 or 30 years ago their caries experience was negligible. My own four children went through to adult life without having any caries experience. Four times 32 teeth without caries is not a bad record. The important thing about dentists' children is not that they are all following one regime of caries control or caries prevention; they are following a variety of schemes. The important point is that caries can be prevented from occurring and, rather than coming in after the ravages of the disease, that should be the task of the Government. I think that is a most important point for the Senate to understand, and it relates to all the health programs in which we become involved. For goodness sake, let us put a little more emphasis on the prevention of disease, let us not try just to repair its ravages. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
