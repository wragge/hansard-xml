<PARA>To the honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That residents of densely populated suburbs in the vicinity of the Brisbane Airport and residents of other suburbs in the flight path of international and domestic jets are experiencing an unreasonable degree of aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Further, that these same residents will be subjected to prolonged bouts of such aircraft noise if a decision is taken to extend the curfew at both the domestic and international airports.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That this decision has been foreshadowed on two occasions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) In Submissions to the Public Hearing held by the Public Works Committee of this Parliament in regard to Stage One-Redevelopment of Brisbane's International Airport: these submissions proposed an extension of the existing curfew when the new runway is completed (approx. 1986). This proposal received the full support of the Queensland Government</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) TAA's request for an extended curfew to coincide with the introduction of the Airbus.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should request the Government to refuse to extend the existing curfew and to reconsider its siting plans for the proposed new runway so as to minimise noise pollution over high density suburbs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question by expressing the regret and concern of the Opposition to hear of the sudden illness of Senator Chipp. I take this opportunity to wish him a speedy and full recovery. I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to the fact that his Government has consistently argued that sustained economic growth is the only way to reduce unemployment. In formulating the 1981-82 Budget, the Government clearly saw the economic growth of late 1980 as threatening excessive wage growth. In view of the fact that the Government's reaction to economic growth was to seek to dampen wages growth by depressing the economy and increasing unemployment, is it not fair to say that this Government's stated aim of reducing unemployment by encouraging sustained economic growth is wrong? Would it not be more accurate to say that the Government's strategy, as revealed in this Budget, is to seek to build further economic growth on a foundation of sustained unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intrude also to indicate that Government members are concerned to learn of Senator Chipp's temporary ill health. We wish him well and a speedy return. I now direct my attention to the question. The answer is, of course, emphatically no. When the Budget was introduced last year the Australian Labor Party said, along with ' ''We'll all be rooned,'' said Hanrahan', that everything that could possibly happen, from german measles to polio, would happen from that Budget. In fact, that Budget resulted in a 2 per cent fall in inflation and a significant growth in real employment. It did the things that the Government said it would do. What is more, it was applauded by countries overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer is therefore no, it is not our intention to move to get increased growth by more unemployment. In fact, as has been demonstrated, increased growth will create more employment. The Budget's main thrust is to so demolish the deficit, to get a substantial reduction overall in the total deficit, that the Government's intrusion into the borrowing market in Australia will be less and there will be more room for enterprise to borrow in the market. This will take the heat off interest rates and provide more money for capital investment, more jobs and more expansion. That is the basic thrust of the Budget. We will have exactly the same Jeremiahs as last year.</PARA>

Materials used in the course of the manufacture of goods such as yachts are exempt from tax and this will not be changed by the proposals in this present Budget. There is no anomaly in this situation but there was an anomaly between yachts which were to be hired with skipper and crew and those to be hired on a bare boat basis. Yachts for that latter use were taxable but those for the former use were not. This anomaly is being corrected in the proposals in this Budget. The Government considered this anomaly in the preparation of the Budget. It was considered that this had crept into the law and was, in the overall sense, having undesirable effects and conferring unfair competitive advantages. However, I understand the thrust of Senator Hill's question to be whether the Government would consider representations on this matter. I can say only that the Government is always prepared to consider representations on the matter. I will refer the question to the Treasurer for his consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable senator and the Senate that the Government is doing all within its powers to deal with what is a very serious matter for Australia and for a major export industry. I have answered a number of questions on this matter since Parliament resumed, and the Minister for Primary Industry has, I think, been keeping the public as well as the Parliament closely informed as to action being taken by the Government and by the United States Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a copy of the latest Press release on the matter which was put out by the Minister for Primary Industry this morning and which details some of the more recent action which has been taken. I would like to draw attention to the major points in that Press release, which I think go to the main points raised by the honourable senator in his question. The Press release pointed out that the inquiries so far have indicated infringements only with respect to Establishment 140C-that is, the premises known as Profreeze in Richmond, Victoria-which was deregistered on 13 August 1981. The release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> All known product from this establishment has now been seized for testing.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the detection and advice from the United States on 11 August 1981 of horsemeat in export packs from this works, a most intensive investigation and tightening of surveillance has been initiated in Australia. Australian authorities have been in close contact with their counterparts in the United States, and the US government has acknowledged the ready co-operation of the Australian government and its determination to stamp out illegal practice.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon said the US Government had now advised the following procedures to more rigidly prevent any attempt at substitution of beef for the United States market:</PARA>
<PARA>The Press release outlined measures which are being taken in the United States as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All stocks of Australian meat at present in the United States are to be held and sampled for substitution infringements.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Further consignments of Australian meat to the US will be species sampled on arrival before release.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Australian Bureau of Animal health will set up an approved procedure for species testing in Australia before export meat receives its final certification.</PARA>
<PARA>The investigations by the Australian Federal Police are proceeding and are described by the Minister as satisfactory. The Minister has indicated that he is determined that prosecutions should be launched wherever possible. Various immediate measures have also been taken by the Australian Bureau of Animal Health to tighten final export surveillance. There is additional spot checking of meat products in all States, extra meat inspector surveillance at cold stores and shiploading scrutiny and intensive checking of certificates and documentation. Other measures not yet in operation but under urgent investigation include new processes for sealing, stamping and certification of export cartons and greater security over meat transfers, boning rooms, cold stores and trucking to dockside. These matters are all being discussed with the United States authorities in the hope that mutually satisfactory arrangements can be made.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have advice on the point raised by the honourable senator with respect to export licences. But as I indicated earlier in my response, all of the products have been seized and I think I can say, without having any direct information, that there would be no licence to export meat from those works until the whole matter has been cleared up. I would stress to the Senate that the matter is for quite obvious reasons regarded with great seriousness by the Commonwealth Government, as it is by all meat exporters, and every effort is being made to ensure that the matter is cleared up as quickly as possible.</PARA>

Is it a fact that this tax will increase the cost of most houses started after the end of the year by $500 to $1,000? In what way does the Government see this as anti-inflationary?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this question should properly be addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. However, I will take the question on board. It so happens that I am in the process of reading at this very time a publication put out by the Premier of New South Wales who is also the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party. In the publication he writes about the boom in the domestic housing industry. That may not be true. Perhaps we should wait for the statements of the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party in the weeks immediately ahead. I do not know what the impact of the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax will be in terms of cost of an average house. I am prepared to find out and let the honourable senator know. The overall cost of a house is governed primarily not by sales tax but by the rate of inflation in Australia. The ability of the Government to reduce inflation by 2 per cent last year was of enormous benefit to those who in those circumstances were purchasing a house. It is true that the imposition of additional sales tax will add perceptibly to the cost of a house but in no way can it compare with the great value got from a reduction in inflation. The Budget sets out to reduce and to contain inflation and interest rates in Australia. It is towards that end that the thrust of the Budget is made. In looking at the Budget one looks not at just the one factor of home ownership but at the whole range of factors. The greatest benefit that we can give to a potential home owner in Australia is to reduce inflation, and that is the Government's aim.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Specific decisions were taken to reduce staffing within the Department of Education following an extensive review of all departmental programs As a result of staff ceiling reductions for this year the Department of Education reduced the level of services in a number of program areas. As a consequence it was decided to relocate the Australian Capital Territory office of the Department of Education to the MLC Tower in Woden which houses the central office of the Education Department. Relocation of the Australian Capital Territory office will enable the Department to make use of common service facilities. However, care has been taken to preserve the Department's identity and its autonomy. Whilst some inconvenience to some Australian Capital Territory students will arise from the relocation of the Australian Capital Territory office it will remain more accessible to Australian Capital Territory students than most other State offices to their client groups. The course of action chosen was considered preferable to other options which would have affected more directly the availability of educational services to students in the Australian Capital Territory. It should be pointed out that Australian Capital Territory office staffing has been calculated on a work load basis.

However, it has since been desirable to exchange with the States and the Northern Territory correspondence seeking the introduction of complementary legislation and complementary arrangements with regard to the territorial seas. I understand that following consultation with all States and the Northern Territory on the arrangements for administration of the legislation, action is now being taken to proclaim it.

A mortgage of $30,000 taken out in 1978 at an interest rate of 10 per cent would now attract an increase of $54 a month in interest payments. By the same token, in the same period the average weekly wage has risen by $221 a month. There has been a significant rise in real wages. Last year inflation ran at 8.8 per cent and average weekly wages rose by in excess of 13 per cent. So there was a net gain in real purchasing power to the average person. We do not wish interest rates to rise. In fact, the thrust of the Budget, as I have said, is directed towards abating interest rates. The real test for people is: Are the living standards of the people of Australia improving? Based on the figures of recent years, they are improving demonstrably. Over the period since 1978 the rate of growth in new housing in Australia has improved demonstrably, and last year there was a highly significant increase in house building.

It is not my intention to involve myself in any argument about particular politicians because I am not sure that that will help Aboriginal people. I should like to make two points. The first is that views in society which have come down from previous generations do change, even though they change very slowly, and they will change on this as on other matters. The other point I make is that, whatever we say about the State of Queensland and whatever people want to say in criticism of the State, it should be remembered that out of that State's funds it spends more on Aboriginal affairs than does any other State in the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

That right is to be exercised freely. Indeed, it is an offence against the Act to interfere or attempt to interfere with the free exercise by an Aboriginal of his or her choice whether to enrol. There is some real concern as to whether affirmative action at the polling places during the NAC election may infringe that section of the Act.

Has the Government considered raising the Australian royalty to a realistic level?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Siddons is referring to royalties, I say that royalties basically are imposed by the States. They are a State tax. I do not narrow the matter to that because I understand the general thrust of the honourable senator's question. However, to the extent that he asked a question about royalties, that would be a matter for the individual States. As he may know, for example, Queensland imposes considerable royalties and also types of royalties in terms of freight rates. Whether or not the particular resource taken from the ground is taxed sufficiently depends on whether we get a world price for it. The first job we have to do is to sell it at world price. We then have to ensure that throughout the whole movement of bauxite from the ground to its sale the range of local, State and Federal taxes is sufficient to take what is an optimum amount. At the moment the Commonwealth Government's policies on taxation are directed towards other forms of taxation, including company tax. It would be a matter entirely for budgetary policy, and therefore a policy matter, for the Government to change that. The Government has in fact imposed an export levy on coal. Because the production of coal has expanded enormously recently the Government has continued that levy. The people of Australia are sharing in it. For the time being at least the Government has not taken any such step with bauxite. It will seek through the variety of other taxes-local, State and Federal-to return the true value of the resources to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Dear Mr Daschle,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 31 July 1981, signed jointly with Mr Panetta, concerning my visit to the United States earlier this year. It was unfortunate that we were unable to consult during the visit. My time in Washington was extremely limited, and some of the meetings with Government officials and veterans' organisations had to be fitted in during visits to other cities, as I needed to include in my schedule an examination of important research projects and practical programmes being conducted outside Washington to help veterans.</PARA>
<PARA> In the time available during my visit to Congress offices, I was able to have discussions with members of the Veterans' Affairs Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In requesting these meetings, the Australian Embassy made it clear to the staff directors of the two Committees that I would be pleased to meet any other Committee members who were in the position to join the meetings with the Chairmen. Those who did attend the meetings were the Chairman of the Senate Committee and the Chairman and the ranking minority member of the House of Representatives Committee.</PARA>

In this context, I would be happy to examine any submission you care to make which you feel would be of value. The Government is glad to have available information relevant to this aspect of its policy-making, the aim of which is to contribute, within the Government's economic possibilities, to the well-being of Australian veterans.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Victoria-Leader of the Opposition) (3.45)-This matter of public importance relates to bad management, bad government and the credibility of governments. I will begin by taking the classic example in the Fraser Ministry of credibility, or incredibility, by referring to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch. At the outset I say that he has never been renowned for being a subtle chap but he typifies a government whose overriding instinct has been to hang on to office, if necessary through the seat, misrepresentation or shonky figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Treasurer of this country, Lynch introduced a new word into the lexicon of Australian politics. The word was 'rubbery'. He used rubbery figures in his Budgets and he has been using rubbery figures ever since. It is a tragic fact for the language of Australian parliamentarians that that has now become a word freely used. The Minister excelled himself in the matter of the so-called resources boom. He had many friends in this Government when he excelled himself in those matters. Before the last election Ministers in the Fraser Government were swapping figures around like drunks at a horse sale, boosting the value of the resources boom with blinding speed. I reiterate that that was before the election. In a matter of days they moved more figures than a window dresser at the Myer emporium would move in a year. It is not surprising that Sir Phillip Lynch was at the top of the heap in this process. He is the man who made his mark in politics with the Stumpy Gully estate. </PARA>
<PARA> As Minister for Industry and Commerce Sir Phillip Lynch topped off the value of the resources boom by citing a figure of $33 billion. According to the figures which he provided that amount was to have been invested in the boom. Let us take that as the top figure suggested. Let us ignore for a moment the statement he made on 2 June this year when he got totally carried away and talked about a $50 billion boom over 10 years from private investment alone. He went on to say that the potential benefits would include a one to one percentage point increase in the gross domestic product, continued strong growth in resource-based exports and potentially more job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I will illustrate in quite a simple way, from the point of view of a member of parliament, what that sort of proposition means and what that sort of talk by a Minister in the Government means. On several occasions last year I visited the provincial town of Ballarat in Victoria. The people of that town and its council are very concerned about unemployment and about industry, the two matters, of course, being intimately related. What they did on my advice and the advice of Liberal parliamentarians who used to visit Ballarat was to set up, as it were, a inquiry related to industry in that town. The inquiry was to look at how, because of the enormous resources boom about to take place, prophets of which were people such as Sir Phillip Lynch, the people of Ballarat could change the structure of industry to make it more responsive to this resources boom and what they would do about employment in the city of Ballarat to make it move responsive to this enormous resources boom which was said by Ministers in the Fraser Government to be upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of mini-experience I had in visiting Ballarat and discussing those issues must have been replicated time and time again across this country as the resources boom was talked up, and people who were very concerned about the future of their communities in terms of industry, employment, training and educational institutions and so on were encouraged to believe that this El Dorado was upon us and that they would have a share in that El Dorado if only they very quickly adjusted their economies to the scale which was espoused by Sir Phillip Lynch and which was talked about so freely. I said that he had said only on 2 June this year that the benefits of the boom would be a one per cent to 2 per cent increase in gross domestic product, a continued strong growth in resource-based exports and potentially more job opportunities. As is usual, I doubt that he consulted the rest of the Ministry before making these extraordinary prognostications. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of weeks after Sir Phillip Lynch had spoken in these glowing terms the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) said that in his opinion resource projects would not solve the unemployment problems. I remind any subsequent speaker in this debate that the Opposition has been asking questions in the Senate about that matter for two years now. I have put the questions on notice and have asked questions of Senator Carrick on numerous occasions when he has talked glibly in this place about the multiplier effect of resource developments. Let us see the figures for the multiplier effects and what they will mean in terms of their impact on unemployment in Australia. We have never seen the figures; they do not exist. The figures upon which it is all based are, to use Sir Phillip Lynch's expression, rubbery figures. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Brown-admittedly he is a new, young, active Minister-said with characteristic honesty, if I might say so, that resources projects would not solve the unemployment problems. That was something Mr Street said 2 1/2 years ago, and he was sacked as Minister for Industrial Relations for doing so. That is the level of credibility of this Government and its level of agreement and understanding of what we are really talking about in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Phillip Lynch and his colleagues such as Senator Carrick were talking it all up for 2 1/2 years prior to the last election. But by 30 July this year one of the big investors in development projects in Australia, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, thought it was about time to tell people of the real situation. The AMP Society's manager of share and resource investment said that for the most part the resources boom had been energy related and was saturated as far as that company was concerned. By 3 August this year the Melbourne Age, after talking to organisations in Europe, warned that Australians, to use its own words, had been 'conned'. By whom had they been conned? Whom were the people of Australia conned by, if the statements in the Age editorial were correct? I will tell honourable senators whom Australians have been conned by; they have been conned by Ministers in the Fraser Government. The Age editorial further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . some of the projects which have been touted in Australia are duds. They are projects which are basic to the boom. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>After taking out some of the double-counting and chopping off the already duds, the list-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Lynch's list-</PARA>
<PARA>has been estimated at nearer $17,000 million worth. </PARA>
<PARA>So the estimated worth of these projects is $17 billion rather than the $50 billion cited by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 2 June this year. The figure is nearer $17 billion than $50 billion. Some of the projects are duds. What will be the reputation of this country and this Government if that sort of material, published in the Melbourne Age-I suggest it is a reputable newspaper-is published in foreign newspapers as well? Will the Australian resources boom be seen in the same way as the Australian meat industry where American comedians make a lot of money out of telling jokes about our meat export industry-for example, hopping of the stage like a kangaroo having eaten Australian beef. Those sorts of things are happening. Americans are making money out of that and laughing at us now. Will the same sort of thing happen in respect of the resources boom? Have we not developed since the time when emancipated convicts went back to the United Kingdom and sold gold bricks to the Poms? Have we not, as a nation, improved since then? The answer to that question must be no if Government Ministers are to persist in this sort of approach-talking things up prior to an election and letting them down afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The editorial in the Age is of course right. The wild talk of a $33 billion boom in resources development-the hard figure that Sir Phillip Lynch used, as distinct from the $50 billion that he mentioned a couple of months ago-is now coming to be seen for what it is, talk designed simply for last year's election. The Government, the editorial says, fine tunes the economy. It certainly fine tunes it before an election and then tunes it down afterwards. That is what has been happening in this case. The point that I wish to make again and again is that, in a sense, the reputation of everyone in this Parliament is at stake. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber have had to come here for two years and suggest by implication that the resources boom was being talked up, that perhaps we were going a little overboard about it all, yet be accused, to use Senator Carrick's words today, of being Jeremiahs, Hanrahans and Jonahs, people who were not really concerned about Australian development. We have been accused of that for two years, but listen to what Mr Anthony, the Minister for Trade and Resources, had to say on the subject only a day or two ago. Suddenly Mr Anthony, who is a fair hand at talking up the resources boom himself, decided to come clean; he began to play it down. He said that references to a boom were unfortunate. My God, they are unfortunate for many people who invested their hopes and aspirations in the boom, not to mention people who bought Rundle shares. Mr Anthony stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a convenient catch cry, but one with too many implications of speculation and uncontrolled growth and the unspoken implication of an ultimate bust. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for Mr Anthony's faith in the Government's capacity to manage such a boom if it should in fact arrive. He described it as a convenient catch cry. It was indeed a very convenient catch cry of the Fraser Government before the last election. It is a very inconvenient one now but there are still two and a half years to go before the next election. The statement of the Minister for Trade and Resources is breathtakingly cynical. This Parliament ought to be concerned about breathtaking cynicism on the part of Ministers because we all have problems of credibility in the profession that we follow and will continue to have them if that sort of talk is to become the standard language of Australian politics. It is breathtakingly cynical on the part of a senior Minister, the Acting Prime Minister of a government which has so deliberately built up people's hopes. The back-pedalling has even affected Sir Phillip Lynch's Department of Industry and Commerce. The word is out in the Department that any day now it will pull back its estimate of the worth of resources development from $33 billion to $20 billion. To be fair to the Department, it had mildly qualified its estimates in the past, but those qualifications were ignored by its Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Trade and Resources, following a separate study of the situation, has indicated that the level of investment will be between $16 billion and $22 billion. The rubbery figures have finally been exposed, but not before many fingers have been burnt. An important case in point was that of the Rundle project-whatever may be said about it by way of denial and qualification. That project was talked up but now has been brought into a more realistic focus. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber wish Rundle well, as they do every resources project, but we do not encourage a process involving totally phoney exercises such as have been engaged in by this Government. It is no comfort to see our position confirmed. The damage done by the wilfulness and stupidity of Ministers is not to be brushed aside. If there is already in the community a perception that politicians and governments cannot be trusted, this episode will further entrench it. It will be to no avail, on this occasion for Senator Carrick to quote a publication of the New South Wales Government concerning its expectations of resource development in New South Wales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying that. I am saying that, on the admission of the honourable senator's Government, his own Acting Prime Minister, his figures were wrong, were lies. That fact cannot be avoided in debating the matter in this Parliament. If the honourable senator wishes to reduce Australian politics to the lowest common demoninator he will, I suppose, answer the allegation by saying: 'We were wrong. We were cynical. We misled the Australian people but the New South Wales Labor Government is doing it too'. Such an argument represents the lowest common denominator in political discourse. It holds that anything is justified as long as one's opponents do it in one way or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us try to salvage something from the resources boom management issue. Such resources developments as will occur must still be subject to measures which will ensure that they will not warp the Australian economy. We allege that the Government has done very little to prepare for the pressures that inevitably will flow from the development of our mineral resources. Already there are pressures on exporters, especially farmers, because of an appreciation of the exchange rate. Economists have predicted that farmers could lose $100m a year, mostly because of appreciation of the dollar. Not even job maximisation will result from the boom. Firstly, there is a lack of planning to minimise disruption. Secondly, there is excessive foreign ownership and control. Thirdly, there are inadequate efforts to involve local manufacturers in supplying equipment for resources development. There is a totally supine attitude about the importation of foreign technology and capital. No conditions are applied in relation to technological transfer. Fourthly, an excessively restrictive monetary policy is hampering efforts to raise capital. Fifthly, there are chronic shortages of skills, a fact which has been talked about for years in this place, but about which very little has been done. Sixthly, there has been inadequate investment in social infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have drawn attention previously to the plight of communities, such as Gladstone, which are at the heart of resources development, for example, to the rapid increase in the number of families living in caravans. Some 300,000 Australian families, or more than twice the population of Canberra, are living in caravans. The position will not be helped by the recent introduction of sales tax on building materials, which can only force even higher the cost of housing. The supply of other infrastructure has also been notoriously slow. It took the workers of Gladstone, by banning future developments in that town, to force any concessions from the Queensland Government. I have previously described Gladstone as one of the dark satanic mills of Australia. Any Federal government makes a lot of money from what happens in Gladstone, but nothing has been done in the way of infrastructure developments there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That came from the Queensland Government. The people of Gladstone have had no concessions at all from the Commonwealth Government in regard to infrastructure development. Again, the penetration of foreign capital into resources development is already alarming. Sir Gordon Jackson expressed only the other day his alarm about some aspects of that penetration. Vast profits already are flowing overseas because there is no control over foreign capital. To make matters worse foreign firms more often than not buy their heavy equipment overseas, thus denying our manufacturing sector a chance to participate as fully as it might. That is an important consideration especially, as I have mentioned, in a State such as Victoria, which relies heavily on manufacturing and has relatively little in the way of mineral resources. The flow of foreign capital has increased from $6 billion last year to an estimated $7 billion this year. These are all problems on which there has been insufficient guidance from Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should acknowledge that the development of resources gives us opportunities to increase economic growth in a planned, steady way and to improve living standards and employment, but it has to be properly managed. We should encourage local participation, prepare economic and social plans, monitor demand for resource exports and, in my view, introduce a resource rental tax. We should bring order into the range of projects so that States are not wastefully bidding against each other for funds to develop specific projects. These are other considerations but they all require a serious, planned, thoughtful beginning, not empty rhetoric. We have already been promised-and seen the promise disappear-an export-led recovery, an investment-led recovery, and a consumer-led recovery. If there is to be resource-boom recovery, let it proceed with proper planning, realistic costing, and honesty from government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Virtually the whole, in fact some 15-odd minutes, of the 20 minutes of Senator Button's speech on this subject has been directed towards one thing-attempting to demolish the figure of some $33 billion put out by Sir Phillip Lynch as a reasonable forecast of what would be in the chute throughout Australia for the development of Australian resources. Indeed, as I recall it, the whole attack was that the figures were wrong, that we were led astray, that the figures were rubbery, and that the Australian people were being misled. Senator Button did not quite calculate what I was going to quote from. I was going to quote from the information source of his own Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, the Premier of New South Wales. I was also going to quote from a much more up to date document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button, anticipating that I might use these figures, said that if I used the figures honourable senators should keep in mind that Mr Wran might be wrong, that he could have been misled by the Federal Government. We have the situation of a Premier who is going to the people in a few weeks saying things-I will quote those things-that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button) says people should not take any notice of because all the Premier's stuff on resources in terms of quantum and direction may be based on misleading information. I will quote from a document which is the text of a speech of His Excellency, the Governor of New South Wales. That speech was made on the 12th of this month, a handful of days ago. Let us not forget that the crux, the whole thrust, of Senator Button's argument is that the figure of $33 billion for the whole of Australia is enormously distorted and enormously wrong. What does the Federal President of the Labor Party, the Premier of New South Wales, say through the mouth of the Government of New South Wales? Only a handful of days ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Development projects valued at over $20,000 million are planned during the next five years. There will be major expansion in the mining, aluminium and steel industries. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole of the speech of the Governor of New South Wales, written and prepared by the Premier, the Federal President of the Labor Party, is based on the prediction that in New South Wales there will be expansion of the order of more than $20 billion. Of course, Senator Button was quite right in thinking that I would bring into the Senate the publication concerning development projects in New South Wales, signed by the responsible Minister of the New South Wales Government, listing all the items which the New South Wales Government says will add up to this amount of money. Let those who speak afterwards say what items they would strike out as rubbery, et cetera. The Government of New South Wales stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As at January 1981 the total value of projects in New South Wales announced, or planned for commencement, and currently under way, was of the order of $23,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of $23 billion for the population of New South Wales, the projection for the whole of Australia would be of the order of $80 billion to $85 billion. Where does that put Sir Phillip Lynch's projection? It makes it very discreetly low, modest in its thrust. I again ask: Does Senator Button say that this publication of the New South Wales Government, listing line after line after line of projects which add up to $23 billion, is wrong? Of course, he says that most of this money will be spent overseas, But the New South Wales Government says that most of it will be spent in industries in New South Wales for purchases of goods and services. Is the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party wrong in claiming that? Is this the greatest deception on earth? Is the Premier of New South Wales going to the people in the next few weeks telling them what Senator Button now says is a tissue of untruths?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button cannot have it both ways. He attacks the situation and says that the resources development will not create employment. In fact it has already created employment. I will quote what the Federal President of the Labor Party says is going to happen to employment opportunities. Incidentally, one would not believe that these kinds of statements came from a Labor leader. The New South Wales Government states:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite continuing problems on the world economic scene, there is cause for an optimistic view of the future for Australia, . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can look forward to a brighter 1981 than most major industrialised countries in the West, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's gross domestic product growth is expected by the OECD to accelerate from 2.5 per cent in 1980 to around 4 per cent in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>We know now that that figure is being put higher. The New South Wales Government continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's rate of inflation of 10.2 per cent in the twelve months to September 1980, remained below that of the U.S.A. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the document continues. In that statement the Labor Premier cast down every one of the arguments put up by Senator Button. Senator Button implies quite clearly that Mr Wran is wrong and is hoodwinking the people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the subject of employment because, in the words of Senator Button, that was supposed to be a 'con job'. However, Mr Wran's Government states:</PARA>
<PARA> Employment opportunities expected to be created in relation to projects in the committed and final feasibility stages, where such information is available, total approximately 50,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the words 'in the committed and final feasibility stages . . . 50,000 jobs'. That relates to direct employment. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the employment opportunities reported are expected to occur between 1981 and 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wran's Government continues:</PARA>
<PARA> These data relate to direct employment only and do not include the increased indirect employment likely to be generated in supplier industries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Button wants a multiplier, that is of the order of four times. The economists generally agree on that. Apart from the 50,000 jobs in New South Wales, Mr Wran's Government makes this claim:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, at least 22,000 jobs are represented by major projects which are in preliminary study or possible stages. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the employment details that are available are likely to considerably understate the potential employment opportunities which will arise . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There Mr Wran's Government was talking of the order of something like 100,000 new jobs. That figure is far away in excess of Sir Phillip Lynch's figure. He was talking about expenditure in Australia and not overseas. He was talking about the development of Australia and of New South Wales. Every word in that document and in the Governor's speech is in refutation of what Senator Button has said today. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of 'con jobs', how can anyone come here and pin virtually the whole of his speech around an attempt to rubbish a figure of $33 billion for Australia when in fact the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party is pinning his flag to $23 billion for 37 per cent of Australia, that is, New South Wales. His whole argument falls down in a flight of words. We have a document stating that everything Senator Button says is wrong. List after list of items of undertakings that are going ahead is published in this speech and they are the ones upon which the New South Wales Government bases its claim. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us put the thing in perspective. Here is a government that came to office six years ago when inflation was running at 17 per cent and heading through the roof; when Australia was being costed out of world markets and was in the top quarter of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development high inflation countries; and when Australia was losing jobs. In one action by the Whitlam Government 130,000 people were wiped out of the manufacturing industry. That was the result of the decision to cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent. The situation is that last year inflation dropped by 2 per cent to 8.8 per cent, which is well below the OECD average. Real employment-and, happily, real employment amongst the young-was on the up and up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the Senate would like to have the comments of the Premier of New South Wales about what is happening to real employment. The Premier of New South Wales says that real employment is rising and that in fact there has been a decline of 35 per cent in youth unemployment in his State. This is the pattern throughout Australia. Members of the Opposition cannot have it both ways. They cannot come in here on some kind of a device and say they are going to demolish this figure without having to face up to what is happening in New South Wales and elsewhere in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me put this matter in perspective. The fact is that the world outside Australia is in the grip of a massive energy hunger brought about by the oil prices set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the fact that the world is running out of oil. In putting this in perspective we must remember that today the world is consuming oil at twice the rate it is finding it and it will run out of it. In fact, since 1973, when there was a quadrupling of world oil prices, the world has been shrinking in its ability to trade and buy anything except oil. World inflation has been forced up by some 9 per cent as a result of oil prices. The world is facing a situation in which many countries are energy hungry. They have not got alternatives and they are turning to countries like Australia for help. If one wanted to talk about resources management one would have thought that the Labor Party would have acknowledged first of all that we have a responsibility to the people outside Australia, to the world. We have a responsibility to get them energy-to get our coal on the sea, to get our natural gas on the sea and to get them uranium so that they can generate electric power, so that they can stay alive and keep up their living standards. Not a word about that came from the Opposition. What did we hear in the whole of the 20-minute speech from the Opposition? We heard some nonsense, which is now completely demolished by the facts. We heard nonsense about figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Labor Party ignores the world outside. It ignores the fact that we have a responsibility to get our coal mines going, to get our electric power stations going, to find the natural gas, to find the oil, to get the bauxite, alumina and iron ore on the sea, to get it overseas to people whose living standards will fall unless we in Australia help. Very few countries have the capacity to reach out and lend a helping hand. There is sneering and denigration instead of great encouragement. If the Labor Party wanted people overseas to maintain healthy living standards and wanted the developing countries not to collapse politically and economically, its supporters would have been saying: 'Let us get on the sea and away more and more of our help to these people, either our raw energy or our processed materials, because that is the way in which we can have in this world people who are not starving.'</PARA>
<PARA> Look at what the International Energy Agency has said. It was said unanimously by 21 nations. It said that there is no way in which energy can be developed and living standards can be maintained in this world unless nuclear power is developed as one of the most significant of the energy sources. The Agency went on to say that unless this happens people will starve, people's living standards will fall and people will freeze because of an inability to provide energy. What has happened? There has been the greatest propaganda campaign aimed at denying uranium to the peacetime uses of the world. This is creating an atmosphere of pollution. Those behind this campaign know in their hearts, as the International Energy Agency knows, that if we go on burning coal at the kind of rate that is being talked about we will create health hazards in the world. We will create an effect on the atmosphere which is irreversible. We will create acid rain. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have supporters of the alternative government getting up on their feet in this place, ignoring the world outside, ignoring the terrible things that are likely to happen to other countries unless we get this resource development going. They attempted a smart trick but failed on the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk about this because this Government of ours is keen that the world outside should be stable. It is keen that we should be helping countries with coal, gas and uranium. We want to get these things on the move and we are getting them on the move. This Government of ours and the member nations of the International Energy Agency want Australia to get its steaming coal exports up from about 6 million tonnes at this moment to 120 million or 130 million tonnes in a decade's time. What is said? Is Mr Wran wrong? Is all this development a hoax? He said that more than 20 coal mining projects are under consideration which will lead to the establishment of new mines to produce coal for both local and overseas requirements. He said that major coal resource development at Saxonvale and at Drayton will involve capital investment of $375m and further development in the Gunnedah-Boggabri coal region will involve expenditure of almost $150m. Are they rubbery, shonky figures? If they are not, you know, the Senate will know the case against Senator Button has been proved. Step by step, these projects were itemised throughout the Governor's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said that we have done nothing about infrastructure. My goodness, we brought in the infrastructure financing in 1978. We provided something like $4.5 billion in extra loan funds so that we in Australia could get on with the building of power stations and all these other things. Mr Wran says-and I somewhat doubt it-that New South Wales will have a sufficiency in electric power from the projects in that State. The fact of the matter is that we have provided the infrastructure. The fact of the matter is that we took over an education system in which the technical and further education skills had been downgraded and the white collar jobs upgraded. We have pumped more and more money into the technical and further education field to lift the skills of apprentices and others to offset what was a serious drain. We have brought in the Foreign Investment Review Board regulations. The fact of the matter is that we are insisting upon Australian equity of at least 50 per cent-and we are getting it-in investment projects in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are with a government that can say these things at the end of a Budget year at the start of which the Labor Party said some 12 months ago: 'You have brought down this Budget. It is a horror Budget. It will create more unemployment and more inflation. There will be no growth and no development'. I remind Labor Party supporters of those things because today they are saying the same things. At the end of that journey there was a fall of 2 per cent in inflation, making Australia the envy of the world. In fact the Australian people had an inflation rate of 8.8 per cent and an average increase in weekly wages of a little over 13 per cent, which provides a very real increase in purchasing power to the people of Australia. There has been real growth in the gross domestic product, real growth in productivity and great growth in reducing the number of young unemployed. That was not a bad journey for a year; it was the best of the journeys of all of the Western countries. No other country can hold its head any higher on this and at the same time say: 'Let us get on with the job. Let us get these resources overseas. Let us not try to destroy the development so that people overseas may starve, go cold or suffer the effects of political and economic instability'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not to provide a luxury that we develop. The Australian people have a reponsibility to face up to the fact that because of the energy crisis we have a major responsibility to help the world-to help other nations achieve stable and rising living standards and maintain political stability. Through doing that we will give more jobs, skills and security to the Australian people. Anyone hearing Senator Button's contribution and my contribution would think we were from two different countries and talking in two different languages. May I say that it would have been a third and new foreign language if--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carrick, was getting so excited a few minutes ago that I thought he was going to start talking up Rundle shares again. I will not get involved in a long disputation about the figures which he presented. I just observe that Mr Anthony said only last weekend that the magnitude of the so-called resources boom had been greatly exaggerated. A report prepared by Mr Lynch's Department, which has been suppressed by John Stone for his own political reasons, downgrades the figure of $33 billion to something below $25 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week a Budget was presented in which the Government itself forecast that in this financial year inflation would go up, unemployment would go up, interest rates would remain at record levels or go higher, taxes which are already at record levels would go higher, and economic growth would come down. There could be no more telling indictment of the Government's failure to manage the so-called resources boom than that self-confessed failure. If higher interest rates, higher inflation, higher taxes, higher unemployment and lower economic growth equal economic success, may God protect us from failure, because Malcolm Fraser obviously cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> After five years of rhetorical and false forecasts, it is correct that last year there was substantial economic growth. That growth, for the only year since Mr Fraser became Prime Minister, was above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and was high enough to make a small dent on the previously continuously rising level of unemployment. Growth was induced chiefly by a substantial increase in real terms in consumer demand and by a 20 per cent increase in real terms in investment expenditure-much of it but by no means all, it is correct, was associated with resources investment. </PARA>
<PARA> In this period interest rates rocketed, increasing to all time record levels. There were several reasons for that. First, and possibly most importantly, is the psychological factor-the fact that the financial market no longer believes anything the Government says. The financial market was fed so much false information during 1977 and 1978, the highlight of which was the Prime Minister's unqualified guarantee that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent, that it no longer believes anything the Government says about interest rates. Rising interest rate expectations are induced by past attempts by the Government to deceive the financial market. Interest rates were pushed up also by a very large surge in private investment and by foreign capital inflow. I will say a bit more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not acknowledge any of those matters. Obviously it will not acknowledge that its own past attempts to deceive the money market are a significant factor-perhaps the prime factor-in record and rising interest rates. The Government does not admit the crucial role of the vast increase in private investment in forcing up interest rates. Instead it spreads the furphy that the record interest rates have been caused by the rapacious borrowing demands of the public sector. In that line the Government is assisted by the Stone Age ideologues in the Treasury who posture as economic scientists. The plain fact is that the total public sector borrowing requirement has fallen continuously from 6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1977-78 to 3.2 per cent in 1980-81. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from this year's Budget Papers which details those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The table read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Government policy seeks to kill off public sector investment, both directly and indirectly, by squeezing the States. It will, at the margin, kill off private investment with record interest rates. It is true-to a substantial degree it was the case in 1980-that private investment was an engine, though not the sole engine, of economic growth. However, it does not follow automatically that all private investment is desirable. The opportunity cost of some private investment exceeds its benefit. In other words, growth would be higher if some forms of investment were forgone, thereby freeing resources for other forms of investment. I stress that I am not making value judgments about the final product; I am simply referring to the effect on economic growth as it is recorded, without passing value judgments about whether what is recorded as economic growth is necessarily socially desirable or whether that proportion of output which is included in gross domestic product is necessarily socially desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen some outstanding examples of private investment which would have been better forgone. The most outstanding example-it is happening now and it will happen in the future-is the film industry where tax subsidies of up to 120 per cent of the cost of making a film are available. Tax subsidies of up to 105 per cent of the investment are available for water storage and reticulation projects, and for emergency fuel storage there are tax concessions which will cost revenue more than it would have cost to buy larger tanks to store an equivalent amount of fuel. A 100 per cent deduction applies to the fencing of land which is liable to erosion. No farm land in the world is not liable to erosion or, in fact, is not eroding, so all fences on agricultural land are eligible for immediate write-off. All of those things, all of those tax rorts, have been introduced by this Government in the last 15 months. I mention also the pre-election bribe of an accelerated 20 per cent depreciation allowance for investment in agricultural machinery when all the empirical evidence showed that farmers already had a propensity to overinvest in plant and capital equipment. Of course, we have also the notorious 20 per cent investment allowance, which was first introduced in 1976 as a 40 per cent investment allowance. That was to have led to an investment-led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> If investment demands are placing unacceptable pressure on interest rates and physical resources, the first response from any rational government should be to remove such artificial stimuli to investment which, in addition, misallocate investment resources. Predictably, the Fraser Government did the opposite. As recently as three months ago it was passing through this Parliament the most outrageous of its investment stimuli-the 120 per cent subsidy for investment in film making. The Prime Minister seems to believe that if it is a cost to revenue through the tax system it is not actually the same as governments providing money. That is related to some of his psychological hang ups. Last weekend a token reference was belatedly sent off to the Industries Assistance Commission for it to look at some of these matters. I say 'token' advisedly because one does not need either an IAC or six months to discover that all of the Prime Minister's off-the-top-of-the-head tax rorts and election bribes which have passed through this Parliament in the last 15 months ought to be scrapped if there is excessive pressure on available investment resources. The Government's answer to what it perceives to be the problem is to kill off investment demand across the board with rising interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, assorted members of this Government have a view of rising interest rates which is different from that of most people. When the Prime Minister bought a house in Canberra in 1974 he had enough cash to make it a straight cash transaction. When the Prime Minister's wife needed $50,000 for the family farming business, it was obtained from the Victorian Government at an interest rate of 4 per cent. When Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd had a liquidity problem, it received a $400,000 cash transfusion from a funeral company. When someone found out and complained about it, the cash transfusion was converted into a loan at a fixed 10 per cent rate of interest. Lesser Government clients have been looked after to a lesser extent. I asked Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle last week whether a farmer in a drought-affected area who might have assets worth $10m could get government money at 4.5 per cent interest and bank overdraft money at 10.5 per cent interest, whilst people with negligible assets who had a housing loan had to pay 12.5 per cent to a bank and more than that to anyone else. The answer to those questions, of course, is yes. People in this Government, the clique of wealthy and millionaire graziers who dominate this country, have a perception of high and rising interest rates very different from that of the millions of ordinary Australians that they govern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear Senator Walsh speak on this matter. I assume that one or two people outside this place were still listening to Senator Walsh at the end of his remarks. The subject matter of debate is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The management of resources development by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I have noticed in the first two weeks of this session that Senator Walsh has not spoken in this place as often as usual. I was hoping he would have used that time to study this matter. Unfortunately, the performance he has just given demonstrated a totally negative approach to the subject to which he referred; also he did not even talk about the subject under review. I can forgive him his usual diatribe of negative remarks but I cannot forgive him for being negative about a matter that has nothing to do with the subject at hand. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in the minds of most people that the resources boom is good for Australia. It certainly creates short term problems and it is the Government's job to manage those problems. The Australian Labor Party would have people believe that the resources boom is bad for Australia. What do the members of the Labor Party want? What are they saying? How do they explain the situation to, for instance, potential employees? How do they explain it to graduates or to tradesmen, or to the many qualified people in the community who are working well below their qualifications? Lastly, how do they explain it to the unemployed? The resources boom has the ultimate potential-it is already demonstrating that potential-to solve many of our problems in Australia in regard to all sorts of matters, but particularly employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic background of resources development is that the Commonwealth Government has established a policy whereby the benefits will be good for all Australians. I say that they will be good because there has been-I guess the Press is partly to blame for this-a rather false expectation in the minds of many people. They believe we are having a boom. I do not like using that word because it conjures up expectations, and those expectations are not being realised. There is no doubt in my mind that eventually they will be realised but it will take some time and the development needs to be managed very carefully. There is no doubt that the economic climate is encouraging. Investment in Australia is at an unprecedented level. The only fear in the minds of those people contemplating development in Australia is that the Labor Party will be returned to government. They can remember what went wrong. They hear the claims of the Labor Party that it will not support policies that have been adopted by this Government. Not just in the area of uranium development but in many other areas as well, commitments made by this Government which encouraged enormous development will not be supported by a future Labor government. What sort of economic encouragement will that give to a potential investor in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that there is a growth is not denied. In the first half of 1980 there was an increase of about $5 billion in resource development expenditure. In the first half of 1981 the figure rose to $6.8 billion. Those are actual figures. From 1975-76 to 1979-80 the increase in exports was 87.9 per cent. In iron ores, for instance, for which my State has the prime role, from 1975-76 to 1978-79-these are the latest figures available-the increase was 39.6 per cent; for coal the increase was 63.7 per cent, for aluminium and alumina the increase was 122.7 per cent, and for lead and zinc it was 211.1 per cent. There is no doubt that the development is taking place and that the community is benefiting from it. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to foreign investment, I direct the attention of the Senate to a paper written by Messrs Gallagher, McColl, Copeland and McDonald on the subject of the relevance of foreign investment in resource development. The title of the paper is 'National Economic Benefits of the Gladstone Aluminium Smelter'. One of their conclusions was that increases in Australian equity in that project would produce a relatively small increase in the net present value of the project to Australia. How does that statement stand up in the face of repeated claims by the Australian Labor Party that it is imperative that resource development be undertaken by Australians; not necessarily solely, but that they should have a very large investment in the project. The Labor Party would sooner see a project stopped than have a major foreign equity in that resource. But the comment I have just mentioned from that paper demonstrates that the return to the Australian community depends very slightly on the equity arrangements. Of course, that is, because the dividend that is earned is only a small percentage of the value that is earned from that investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The three broad aims of our foreign investment policy in Australia are to raise the level of real resources available to Australians, to bring new management skills and technology to Australia and to open new markets and create new employment opportunities. The Government's foreign investment policy welcomes foreign investment. It not only increases the resources available in the economy but also it can increase Australia's access to up to date technology and managerial skills and open up new market opportunities. I think the foreign investment policy is well understood by Australians. The aim is to have at least a 50 per cent equity in resource development projects in Australia. If that cannot be obtained in the short term, the Foreign Investment Review Board is empowered to allow that project to commence on the undertaking and assurance that the Australian equity will be at least 50 per cent in a very short time. As we know, the Labor Party has indicated time and again that it would rather see no development than have that sort of policy adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of criticism of the Government and of the Taxation Office for the Government's taxation policy. The most recent Budget has some strong things to say about taxation. It has changed significantly the rate of taxation that will be reaped from these resources development projects. I refer in particular to the high wages that are paid to employees, which of course attract a higher level of tax. I refer also to the fact that the Government has increased the total amount that it will receive from the resource development industries. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to employment, as I said before there are large numbers of people who are looking to the resource development industries for their future. They are well advised to do so. The amount of effort that is going into this area is quite exciting. There has been a general criticism that the resource development industries will push up the cost of labour to unacceptably high figures and make it more difficult for competing industries or other industries in the community to compete. But it is my belief that there is a large pool of labour in the community that is working at well below its training or capacity. Many people have jobs at the moment which do not exercise their full capacity. They will be attracted to these industries, but not necessarily away from the other competing resource development industries.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government may have made a slight mistake in its assessment of the future employment needs of the resource development industries in Australia. I would recommend that another survey be done, because I do not think the available information is sufficient. A larger group of people in the community is available for employment in the resource development industry than has been claimed. </PARA>
<PARA> Touching on other areas of resource development, the Government's crude oil pricing policy has been attacked very strongly by our critics. I point out that in the year 1981-82 the excise levy revenues are estimated to be $3,357m-about 72 per cent of the crude oil revenues before tax and royalties. In the light of these figures it is crazy to claim that we are not collecting sufficient tax from these industries. It is estimated that $83m will accrue from the liquefied petroleum gas industry. The Bass Strait oil producers pay royalties at rates of up to 12 1/2 per cent on the well-head value of petroleum products. It is estimated that in the year 1981-82 Bass Strait will provide revenue of $215m. That is to be shared, of course, between the State and Commonwealth governments. Esso alone will provide $208m in taxation. It is expected that overall government take in 1981-82 will result in aggregate government revenues of some $4 billion from petroleum products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which I have the honour to chair, is completing an inquiry into the aluminium industry. Although I do not like speaking for the other members of my committee, because we have not yet brought down our report, speaking for myself and taking into account all the evidence we have received, I have come to the conclusion that the aluminium industry is good for Australia. It provides jobs and it is providing new jobs and investment opportunities for people within Australia as well as those overseas. In fact, I met many potential private investors who are attracted to that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Senator Button spent a very short time talking about the problems in the resources industry in Gladstone, he failed to mention other areas where the development program is welcomed. I was told by senior local government people in Portland that they welcome the development there. In fact, they asked me why they could not have two smelters instead of one. That is an example of a good State Government supporting the initiatives taken by the Federal Government, solving in a sensible and rational way problems that can have a tremendous impact on a local community. These are some of the human problems that can be created. I congratulate the State governments for facing up to these problems, because this is one of the areas for which they are primarily responsible. I also congratulate my Government for the support it is giving the State governments in this important area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to support the matter of public importance which is before the chamber this afternoon. The topic is the management of resources development by the Federal Government, and I think it is very necessary, when making a contribution to this debate, to keep in mind those terms of reference. The Senate is concerned, as a matter of public importance, that the management of resources development by the Federal Government be discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is in favour of the accelerated resources development that is taking place within the Australian community. There is no doubt that the great reserves of minerals and energy resources, coupled with the skills, enterprise and sheer hard work of many Australians, will create such national wealth that many Australians ought to be able to share in an increased, more prosperous standard of living. We are concerned that the accelerated resources development being undertaken should be managed in such a way by the Government -the Federal Government, the national Government-that those benefits are distributed in a fair manner to all Australians, wherever they might reside. Nothing in the remarks of the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, in any way allayed the concern expressed by the Labor Party in bringing forward this matter of public importance. No strategy was outlined which indicated that the national Government saw a need to co-ordinate the resource development taking place throughout Australia. There was certainly no indication of any sense of direction or management of the time, pace, and scale of the resource development. We have nothing to indicate that anything is going on in Australia other than a confused scramble, a competition between State governments to secure for each State community some major resource project or projects. So one has a competitive scramble for these resource developments which, without some national Government management, could well lead, and is leading, in the view of many, to the inability of the nation as a whole to secure for all Australians the sorts of benefits that should derive from those resource developments. I say that with some sorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Thomas referred to the work of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. It is a fact that in February this year I queried the top Federal bureaucrats who were giving evidence to the Committee as to whether there was some co-ordination between the Federal and State Ministers concerned with minerals and energy to secure a pace and strategy of development that would secure benefits for all Australians. In other words, I was not asking that a national blueprint be manufactured somewhere in Canberra, or that some unitary action be taken single mindedly by the national Minister. Keeping in mind the Federal structure and accepting the constitutional restraints that come from the Federal system, I asked whether any discussion had taken place between the Federal and State Ministers for minerals and energy on the growth of the aluminium industry, which is the prime example in the minds of all Australians of the sort of resources development which may be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked Mr Monaghan, the Director of the National Energy Office, whether in the past three years any Ministers had met to undertake such a task of review and co-ordination. His reply was: 'I do not think so'. There we had a reply to the Senate Standing Committee that, even within the constraints of federalism, this Federal Government has made no attempt to manage the resources boom in a way which would ensure that benefits flowed to all Australians. Of course, this is recognised not only by the Labor Party but also by such excellent Australians as Mr Gordon Jackson, the General Manager of CSR Ltd. Only last weekend Mr Jackson said that a national concensus had to be developed to overcome the strains and adjustments of the resources boom. He further said that much of the responsibility for the concensus lay with Australian governments, and it was imperative that they collectively brought some clear sense of purpose and direction to the task of resource development, so that it might be socially beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> That responsibility of governments, which should be initiated primarily by the national Government and by the Minister in this chamber, has not been undertaken, and there was no indication at all in the Minister's remarks that such a strategy would be undertaken. One can take many examples, both in the foreign investment field and in regard to employment opportunities, and those topics have been touched on by my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps there is no matter of greater concern to those who might be listening to this broadcast than the question of the pricing of electricity to these great resource projects. Every consumer of electricity throughout Australia is asking whether the household or the small domestic trader or commercial concern is paying such a high tariff that the household or the small trading or commercial enterprise is indeed subsidising these great resource projects, particularly those in the aluminium industry. Many people are asking that question, and one would have thought that the Minister for National Development and Energy would share their concern and at least would be trying to compile the sort of information which would enable the Federal Government to ensure that the tariff policies of State governments were such that the major resource projects being undertaken were not subsidised by domestic or small trading or commercial enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Federal Government's response in the face of this concern within the community? Is it putting itself in a position where it can know, be aware of, the tariffs being charged by electricity commissions to these great resource projects? Once again, in evidence before the Senate Committee it became very clear that not only was the Federal Government not formally demanding that such tariffs be placed before it, but also it was not even requesting that such tariffs be placed before it. The Minister for National Development and Energy is not even trying to find out the actual level of charges being levied by State electricity commissions on these great resource projects. That leads to many consequences, amongst them a possible diminution of tax revenue. If the Commissioner of Taxation does not know the true cost of the electricity input to these resource projects, then it becomes very difficult to assess whether the profit levels being proclaimed are, indeed, a true indication of the profitability of the enterprise. It also means that the Minister for National Development and Energy is in no position to say whether the coal or gas resources, whichever may be used for the generation of electricity, are being used in the best possible manner, or whether perhaps some coal resources ought to be reserved to enable the coal liquefaction plants of the future to overcome the shortage of transport fuels which is predicted for the turn of the century. It is quite clear that the Minister for National Development and Energy in the national Government is not even putting himself in a position to come to grips with the proper allocation of these resources within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of great concern in the community is the control of these national resources, these mineral and energy resources, by overseas investors. There would be no complaint on the part of any Australian if overseas capital were brought into Australia to bring to fruition some of these great projects which otherwise would not be undertaken at all. It is quite clear that at times not only are the technology and the managerial skills which can be brought from overseas essential to the development of these projects but also quite often the nature of the industry is such, as with the very highly integrated aluminium industry, that unless some participation on the part of foreign investors is obtained at, for example, the smelting stage, the development will just not be undertaken. So there are occasions on which the participation of foreign investors in the development of our resources projects is, indeed, welcome. The same applies to the proportion of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> But surely the Government can appreciate the concern in the Australian community which expresses itself in the fear that ordinary Australians are being squeezed out of the opportunities to share in the ownership of these projects. It is simply not good enough that great Australian companies such as Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd or CSR take their place in particular developments. It is not even good enough that the superannuation funds channel the compulsory savings of many millions of Australians into these projects by way of equity participation, although the fact that that is happening now is to be welcomed. Some sort of unit trust fund is needed whereby ordinary Australians can contribute their hundreds of dollars to this investment in Australia's resource projects so that more money will be returned to them as investors of the comparatively small savings which may have accumulated in their ordinary bank accounts. Some sort of resources development fund needs to be established so that small investors' funds can be mobilised. </PARA>
<PARA> This would not only increase Australian equity in some sort of abstractly desirable matter but also it would be politically very important as it would involve many millions of ordinary Australians in the development of these projects. There is no doubt that there is a feeling in the community that these projects are being undertaken by foreign investors in collusion with State governments whose allegiance appears to be more to an alliance with these international investors rather than with a concern for the social cohesion of Australia as a whole. It is really to that social cohesion as a whole that we look to the Federal Government, the national Government, the Government of all Australians, to ensure that the resources development undertaken is such that all Australians, wherever they live, will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have emphasised in my remarks, the Australian Labor Party welcomes resources development. It welcomes it as a way of increasing national wealth, of utilising our skills and enterprise and of using our work force. We are blessed with great minerals and energy resources. However, we are concerned to ensure that State governments do not, in a fragmented way, apparently secure benefits for their own State communities so that other parts of Australia and other Australians find themselves without any benefit from the increased standards of living that should flow from this resource development. The pace of this development, the call by this development on Australia's financial resources, can be controlled, monitored and co-ordinated only by the national Government. Only in that way will there be an increase in national living standards for all. That resource development planning needs the leadership of a national government. </PARA>
<PARA> It surprises me that so frequently the national Minister fails to acquire the information which would put him in a position of leadership. He hides behind constitutional veils and talks about the responsibilities of the States. As I have pointed out, he fails to use the federal forums available within which all Ministers for minerals and energy from throughout Australia could meet around a table and discuss the various projects which are in prospect. The management of the resources development projects throughout Australia ought to be undertaken by the national Government and the Australian Labor Party wishes to ensure that it takes place. For that reason it makes no apology for the fact that about every four or five months this matter becomes a matter of public importance within this chamber. It is our intention to press the point until there is forthcoming from the national Government, as Mr Gordon Jackson of CSR has requested, a true recognition of its responsibilities in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very pleased to hear the previous speaker say that the Australian Labor Party is not against resources development. He also said that we have to have this debate every three or four months because the ALP is so concerned at the way things are going. I suggest that when we are pressed for time, if members of the Opposition feel a burning urge to have this debate once again, we could incorporate all our previous speeches and then get on with the business of the Senate. Nonetheless this matter is before us again today. I think we debated it on 25 February and maybe some of the same speakers took part then. I was very pleased to hear Senator Tate say-I hope that he speaks for the total membership of the ALP-that members of the Opposition are not against resource development and that they mainly have hassles with the way it is going. However, I am not quite sure whether he would be speaking for all ALP members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Resources development in Australia really started to get underway, I suppose, in the 1960s when we were developing resources to provide raw materials for other countries. Until then we had coal mines, iron ore mines and other industries for our own use. It was really in the 1960s when the world became desperate for supplies of coking coal that the development of our resources started to take off. It happened at a fortuitous time. Honourable senators will remember that during the 1960s we saw a major downturn in wool prices and, at the same time, a rather disastrous drought which had a devastating effect on the primary industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that it particularly affected my own State of Queensland. At that time I was working in the railways and was based in Cloncurry. I saw both the devastation of the drought and the effect that that downturn in wool prices was having on many people who, until that time, had been making a good living on the land. Fortunately the resources boom started to take off. We were able to provide employment for many young people who had to leave the land at that time. It was a tragedy that those young people had to leave, although we could not do anything at that stage, because now we are recognising the fact that we have lost a generation of expertise in working the land and running the beef and sheep industries. However, that is a little aside. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, as I have said, the resources boom started to take off and we provided employment for those young people, particularly in the coal mining industries. The resources boom developed further in the 1970s when we had another downturn-this time in the beef industry. Once again it provided employment. Not only did it provide that very necessary employment at that stage but also it provided a very necessary boost to decentralisation. My State is one of the most decentralised States in Australia. We find that without such developments as these mining projects-and this applies not only to people in Queensland but also to people in the other States-people naturally seem to go towards the capital cities and it is not healthy for any country to have that happen. So the development of our resources has provided a very necessary boost to decentralisation. Of course, even before the boom took off there was an element of decentralisation in early mining communities such as Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Mary Kathleen. But the resources boom has added impetus to the movement of people to those areas and this is to the great benefit of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Our resources are no good either to ourselves or to nations which are in need of those resources if they are left in the ground. I think there would be agreement on both sides of the chamber on that fact. But it is not just a matter of digging resources out of the ground and selling them off. If we did this we could very soon become a gravel pit of the world. In simplistic terms, we should not dig up a bit more gravel and sell it if we need money to buy something. It is very essential that Australians share in the returns from our resources. Of course, that has been the Federal Government's attitude right down the line. We have been criticised for taking that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention the use of our export controls. The Federal Government, through its intelligence, became aware of the fact that we were not receiving what would be generally recognised as a fair price for our product. Because we took a stand we ran into problems with some of our colleagues in the States. I can completely understand their attitudes. They felt there was a Big Brother attitude and that we were stifling their development. It is quite right that they keep a watchful eye on what we do. Our intelligence was to the effect that some of the buyers were acting as a cartel. They were playing one mining company off against another and as a result we were not actually receiving what would be generally considered to be a fair price. So the Commonwealth Government, in spite of the criticism it received from those who are normally friendly towards it, stepped in and used its export controls to make sure that Australian companies received a fair price. This sort of action has to be of overall benefit to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Another principle which the Government instituted and which has caused concern and criticism concerns Australian equity. We have a general policy that in any mining venture that is getting off the ground there should be about 50 per cent Australian equity and about 50 per cent Australian voting strength on the board. The exception is uranium investment, where a 75 per cent equity and control is required. Of course, the implementation of this policy has to be very finely balanced. We know quite well that there is not enough money in all Australia to undertake the vast mining developments that have taken place over the last few years. So the Federal Government has had to take the balanced view that although we need sufficient foreign investment the Australian people themselves should be able to partake in the resources development. To its credit, the Federal Government has been pretty flexible on this matter-some people would say too flexible and others would say not flexible enough. This argument cannot be settled to everyone's satisfaction. But I make the point that our Australian equity policy has been implemented to enable Australians to partake in the development of our resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The resources boom has also had an effect, of course, in the employment area. I have mentioned the problems that we would have faced as a result of people leaving the pastoral industries. However, it must be recognised that a generally accepted rule of thumb is that for every person employed in a mining industry four persons are employed in ancillary industries which are not necessarily at the mine site. So once again the resource development provides a measure of decentralisation. In my own State ancillary industries have sprung up at Rockhampton, Mackay and Gladstone to service the mine-fields of central Queensland. Also, some work is being undertaken at Bowen. So the development of resources has a multiplier effect. This development has helped the employment situation. Indeed, since we came to power we have been putting more and more people into the work force almost continually year by year. We should not understimate the amount of company tax that has gone into our Federal coffers or the income tax that is paid by the people who are employed in the mining industry and the ancillary industries. Royalties, rail freights and levies have all contributed to Consolidated Revenue and have thus had an effect across a broad spectrum of Australian development, social welfare, defence and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to introduce a note of caution. I think we have to be a little careful. We are currently at the stage where it is almost a battle between the States and the Commonwealth to see who can get the most out of mining companies. I think in fairness it must be said that mining companies are not looking too kindly at that development. There is a need for both the Federal and State governments to maintain some liaison in this matter, to see that royalties, rail freights and levies do not prevent development from going ahead. Of course, over and above all this, Mr Hayden said in a speech yesterday that he would introduce a resource rental tax. Of course, if anything would have a stifling effect on development I think that measure certainly would. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a massive degree of infrastructure development. Technology has been introduced. We did not have such things as massive drag lines in Australia until our resources boom got going. We can now build this equipment ourselves, albeit under sub-contract. But Australian workmanship is going 100 per cent into drag line construction. We were able to introduce the locotrol system into the industry in which I was previously engaged-the railway industry. I do not think this system operated at that time in any other country. The system, which was introduced on the line with which I was concerned, involves putting three diesels at the head of a train. Three more diesels which are unattended and operated by a driver in the lead diesel are put in the middle of the train. This system enables power and braking to be distributed more evenly throughout the train. It is to the credit of the railwaymen with whom I worked at that time that this innovative system was introduced without any hitches. The men who operate those trains grasped the significance of the equipment. Although we had no one to teach us how to use this completely new development we were able to handle and operate it. We were told what to expect. Indeed, we modified what we were told so that the equipment worked very effectively. To the credit of my colleagues in the railway at that time the system was introduced and has worked well. So new technology has come along. We have complete new railway systems, which of course, have been of massive benefit. They have not cost taxpayers a cent but the capital costs have been paid by the mining companies and they in turn are being repaid by freight differentials. The upshot is that we will have a complete railway system including rolling stock and locomotives which will not be paid for by the taxpayer but which will be of great benefit to the State. </PARA>
<PARA> We have set up study groups, both international and interstate, to look at the processing of our raw materials. We have provided tax benefits and the investment allowance. Mr Hayden said that he would get rid of the investment allowance. Yet that allowance has helped companies to purchase machinery to process our raw materials instead of sending it somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite interesting to look at what has been espoused by certain members of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber in respect of uranium enrichment, that is, the processing of a raw material. We need a uranium processing capacity in Australia. It will provide us with another industry. It will provide us with expertise and know-how. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) said in his speech, we have to look more seriously at nuclear power. We cannot continue to burn fossil fuels. We are not quite sure of what the greenhouse effect will be. However, we know that ultimately our actions could have an effect on generations to come. We know that the unwarranted burning of too much fossil fuel could disadvantage the lifestyle of future generations of Australia and the world. We have to look very seriously at the nuclear power industry and, of course, at the processing and enrichment in Australia of that uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly mention Gladstone. On a previous occasion and during his speech on this matter of public importance Senator Button mentioned all the problems associated with Gladstone. Nobody is denying the fact that there are problems at Gladstone. When I lived in Cloncurry I knew of problems at Mount Isa when it was fast developing. Such problems are the result of growing pains. The people of Gladstone are sick and tired of hearing what a bad place it is. They are particularly sick and tired of southern media representatives coming up, taking photos and going back and showing what an awful place Gladstone is. It is a very desirable place to live and there are many happy people living there. Mr Acting Deputy President, being a fellow Queenslander, I am sure you share that view. We get a little sick and tired of the wonderful town of Gladstone, albeit with growing pains, being used as an example. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations: The Government's decision to sell the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That in making its inquiry the Standing Committee consider a report by a government committee of inquiry, known as the Allison-Brewster Committee, which recommended continuation of the Government Clothing Factory. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in 1962 the Menzies Government established an independent committee of inquiry to investigate the proposal for a new government clothing factory. This Committee, known as the Allison-Brewster Committee, reported to the Government in 1964. It recommended a continuation of the Government Clothing Factory for the following reasons: Firstly, the Services expressed the view that the Government Clothing Factory should be retained for the quick delivery of items in variety. Secondly, many items produced at the Government Clothing Factory are unattractive to or not normally obtainable from private industry. Thirdly, it would be imprudent to depend for the needs of the Services, either wholly or heavily, on the peacetime vagaries of private industry's level of commercial work. Fourthly, in emergencies the Government Clothing Factory would carry the burden of supply until industry slowly became geared to the task. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these recommendations, in 1964 the Liberal-Country Party Government decided that the continuation and development of the Government Clothing Factory was essential. The Department of Defence has listed several main advantages in the procurement of uniforms from the Government Clothing Factory over private enterprise. They are: Stability and reliability, quality and standards, straightforward procurement procedures, technical and design aids, relatively short lead times and, lastly, capacity to produce special items. These points are contained on the Department of Defence list. It should be noted also that Government Clothing Factory prices over a long period have been competitive with the prices of private industry. The Industries Assistance Commission in its report in 1977 agreed, with some minor exceptions, with the recommendations of the Allison-Brewster Committee of 1964. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and have had discussions with both management and union representatives. I assure the Senate that the factory is very efficiently run. It has adopted a cellular organisational structure with profit centres throughout its organisation. It has the latest numerically controlled machines and its industrial relations record is extremely good. In only one or two years in its long history, which dates back to the early 1900s, has its revenue fallen below its expenses. The previous Liberal Government, after very careful consideration over a four year period, saw fit to keep the Government Clothing Factory going. Surely the Senate should have something better than a philosophical argument before acquiescing in a course of action that could seriously affect our defence preparedness. Further, I believe that the very cogent arguments of the Allison-Brewster Committee in favour of the continuation of the Coburg clothing factory could equally apply to the Bendigo Ordnance factory and that, therefore, these two factories should be considered concurrently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, which relates to the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Senator Siddons, on the basis of personal observation and experience-if I might say so he has strong qualifications for assessing the merits of such an establishment as the Government Clothing Factory-has made some comments about that factory. I merely wish to make a few observations about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first real problem involved is that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is very important to the economy of a provincial town in Australia-Bendigo. I turn to the Review of Commonwealth Functions-the work of the so-called razor gang-and the short explanation given of what is to be done in relation to the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. In relation to the Government Clothing Factory, the following comment was made:</PARA>
<PARA> Factory to be offered to private sector for sale or lease as a going concern.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, this was said:</PARA>
<PARA> To be sold to private enterprise (with protection of defence interests). </PARA>
<PARA>No enlightenment is given as to how that protection is to be achieved. The further comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA> Some activities to be transferred to Maribyrnong factory. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, albeit briefly, last Monday and the crisis, if I may call it that, which exists at the factory is one of Government-induced uncertainty and anxiety on the part of the staff, the management and the 600 employees. That has been the situation ever since the committee which reviewed Commonwealth functions brought down its report. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention to a number of issues which should be examined by the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations when the matter is referred to it. First, there is the uncertainty about the future of the factory. The razor gang having made a pronouncement, in what I would describe as an ideological document, on the future of the factory, there have since been numerous actions and statements by the Government which have only added to the confusion about what the decision means. For example, I refer to an item of $800,000 in the Budget for further expenditure at the factory by the Commonwealth in the coming year. Rightly or wrongly, that has been interpreted as indicating some equivocation as to whether it is to be sold. I make the simple point that in Bendigo that factory, which employs 600 workers, has 200 tradesmen and 100 apprentices. That it has those appretices is the result of Government policy. Those apprentices cannot of course all be employed at the factory. A number go out to private industry after they have completed their apprenticeship. In that way the Ordnance Factory is providing a service, a training facility for the provision of skilled tradesmen needed for the economy of Bendigo. There are 20 professional engineering staff at the factory. I mention that only to indicate the balance between the trades employees and the engineering staff employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The dilemma for people working at the Ordnance Factory and indeed the people of Bendigo, who are very concerned about this issue, and the equivocal statements made by Government spokesmen, is that if the factory is to be sold to private enterprise the questions arise: Who is to buy it and what does that mean? For what purpose is a private employer, a private company, to buy the Ordnance Factory? Is it to buy it in order to put a computer out of business? Is a company such as Vickers Ruwolt to buy it for that purpose? Is it to do so in order to use the plant and equipment, much of which is very modern and includes numerically controlled machine tools, in the factory itself, in Bendigo? Is it to buy the factory because it believes that it has a contribution to make in manufacturing for the resources boom, which has been the subject of debate here today? Or is such a company to buy it to engage in an asset stripping exercise? Is such a company to buy it from the Commonwealth Government, then sell the equipment, dismiss the employees and engage in a little profitable trading operation based on asset stripping, leaving the work force without anything to do and the economy of Bendigo debilitated? That is one of the things that could happen if the factory were sold to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> It could also be said at the moment that if it were not sold to private enterprise the decision announced by the Government would nevertheless be terribly debilitating to the operation of the factory. What could happen-although I would hope that there would be some commitment by the Government to ensure that it did not-is that firms would tend to say: 'The Ordnance Factory is under a cloud. We have a tender for a job but really we do not have the future of the factory, so perhaps we should not accept it'. That is a possibility which is feared by those in Bendigo who are concerned about the future of the factory. Both aspects represent a considerable worry and I would like a Senate committee to consider them and, in particular, to make recommendations about the conditions under which the factory would be sold to private enterprise-if that should happen-and what would happen to the assets of that establishment. I would like a Senate committee to examine, if the factory is not sold, what commitment should be made by the government concerning its future in terms of continuity of orders from the Defence Department. Some 50 per cent of the factory's work results from such orders. I would like considered also the question of continuity of tendering for private enterpise work which constitutes about 50 per cent of the factory's current activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must be in a genuine dilemma concerning this matter. It is one on which the guidance of a Senate committee should be welcomed by all concerned. The factory receives a subsidy from the Government of some $5m a year from the Government. A group such as the razor gang could say: 'They are getting $5m a year from the Government. The factory is clearly not profitable, therefore we should get rid of it.' Such a figure should be examined closely. For defence equipment contracts the Ordnance Factory is paid $9.34 an hour per employee engaged on what is a wide range of functions. However, that is a totally unrealistic price compared with what would be demanded by private enterprise for equivalent work. The correct figure would be more of the order of $20 an hour. If some of the more modern, sophisticated machine tools were used the figure would be higher still. Although the Government provides a subsidy to the Ordnance Factory, the Ordnance Factory provides a subsidy to the defence forces. If the factory is sold to private enterprise, will the Government continue the subsidy to private enterprise for defence equipment orders? What I am asking is this: Is the Government really rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, as it were, or is it recycling the process in pursuit of an ideological commitment? All these matters have to be considered. As I indicated earlier, they are matters which are causing grave concern in the city of Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> I have much pleasure in seconding the motion moved by Senator Siddons and in associating myself with the remarks he made about the Australian Government Clothing Factory. I have outlined additional problems in relation to the Ordnance Factory in Bendigo which I believe the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations should consider. It is very easy for a committee of four razor-wielding Ministers, or whatever it was, to sit down and decide such things by adopting a broad brush approach. I believe that the committee, in making such decisions, made no real reference to, and neither discussed nor gave consideration to, the regional economies of places such as Bendigo or the contribution to the economy which something like the Ordnance Factory makes. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not intend to oppose the Government's proposals in the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1981 which seeks to bring the Constitution of Norfolk Island into line with the process that exists in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The legislation seeks to provide that beautiful island with a chief judge to preside over matters that fall within the normal jurisdiction of a chief judge in other Territories under the control of the Commonwealth. The legislation provides also that the judge shall have applied to him-I am afraid we have to talk in terms of him because we have no High Court of Australia judges of the fairer sex-the requirement that he retire at the age of 70 years, as is required of other judges within the Federal jurisidiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Opposition understands it, two Federal judges are aged over 70 years at the moment. Consequently, one of them could quite conceivably be appointed to the position in Norfolk Island; for example, Mr Justice Dunphy. He is fortunate in that the legislation passed by Parliament at its last sitting requiring judges to retire at the age of 70 years was not made retrospective. As he had already passed that age, it cannot apply to him. There is nothing in the legislation to suggest that the Government intends to appoint someone such as Mr Justice Dunphy. It provides that the judge appointed must be a judge acting under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and appointed by one of the courts for which, under the Constitution, the national Parliament is responsible. Of course, if the appointed judge ceases to hold a position in that jurisdiction he will cease to be the chief judge of Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to enter the controversy about salaries other than to say that the last Remuneration Tribunal determination made substantial awards to judges. Those awards will obviously apply to whoever is selected for the position created as a result of the passage of this legislation. In the Tribunal's determinations of 1980 and 1981 very substantial salary increases were awarded to the judges described as judges of the High Court, judges of the Federal Court and judges of the Supreme Court. As I understand it, the appointment will be made from the latter category. It is worth mentioning that the award increases vary between $8,000 to $12,000 in actual salary, with much more reasonable increases in allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> Norfolk Island has come of age. One does not have to visit Norfolk Island to realise the tremendous suffering that took place there in the early days as a result of Australian settlement, the suffering of convicts who were placed on Norfolk Island as a result of the judgment of judges. Fortunately, in this day and age the judgments that the chief judge of Norfolk Island will make will probably be less horrific and less likely to be of a nature that we could take exception to. Certainly, we could take exception to some of the decisions made in the early penal colonies. Some people may take the view that the passage of this legislation will create a sinecure for one of the judges in the Federal jurisdiction. When the Opposition looked at the legislation in totality, we realised that in fact it would give the same classification and status to Norfolk Island as exists in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. To that extent, we are pleased to give our assent to the Bill and expect its speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am indebted to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) for his courtesy in relation to this matter. I do not want, if I can avoid it, to use too many words like 'horrific' in talking about the Budget. That seems to happen with every Budget. Everybody says something like that. I want to deal with some of the major themes and issues in the Budget which seem to me to be important. In 1975 Mr Fraser promised to cut taxes in order to restore the incentive to work harder. He was talking about tax cuts for the rich. Since then the Government has been in office for six years and in each of those years taxes have increased, and they have increased most of all for those who could least afford to pay them-the poor. Since 1975 we have had income tax cuts in real terms for the wealthiest 2 per cent of the population. Those earning $40,000 and over have maintained their status-even after this Budget-of having lower income tax than they had in 1975. For the other 98 per cent of the population tax has significantly increased. That is what restoring incentives has been all about for the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Budget is but a continuation of the trend in redistribution of income which has been engineered by the Government over a number of years. If we penetrate the soporific and sometimes misleading prose of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and look at the figures we will see that this Budget not only continues the regressive redistributional trend of the Fraser Government in earlier years but also in fact accelerates it. Sales tax receipts are to rise by nearly 40 per cent in one year. That is more than they have risen in a decade. It is probably more than they have ever risen in the space of a year. The shame is not just that this Government has misled people by promising lower taxes and every year for six successive years has given them higher taxes; but the disgrace is compounded by the way in which taxes have been raised. They are to be paid by those who can least afford to pay them. An increase in sales tax represents at best a flat tax on the consumption of all Australians regardless of their capacity to pay. In effect, it may be more regressive than that. Sales tax on floor coverings, white-goods, crockery and bedding is to be doubled. As those things are general necessities for family life the poor may well pay a greater percentage of their income in increased sales tax on them than the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few months ago the Treasurer said that 'any moves towards greater reliance on indirect tax' would not be introduced 'without providing a noticeable offset in personal tax reductions'. Those assurances now stand as a sort of cruel joke at the expense of the Australian taxpayer and voter. Mr Howard has identified himself as a Fraser man to the bootstraps. He says one thing before an election and does another thing after. In fact, as we have seen, pay as you earn income tax has gone up dramatically more than ever before under this Government. Pay as you earn income tax for wage and salary earners will increase by 22 per cent, or over one-fifth, in money terms. That is a record for the present Government. The PAYE tax will be increased to double the predicted rate of inflation. At the same time income tax paid by the self-employed will rise by only 5 per cent. There is to be a fall in income tax for non-wage earners of 5 per cent in real terms, having regard to predicted inflation. To be fair, it should be said that the figure of 5 per cent in respect of self-employed persons partly reflects a fall in farm income due to the drought. But it reflects more than that; it reflects the growing burden that is being placed on taxpayers by tax avoidance. Tax avoidance is budgeted to continue to cost $300m this financial year. In fact, it is likely to be more. </PARA>
<PARA> The greater increase in the PAYE take will be increased 'by stealth', to use Mr Fraser's memorable words when this Government introduced tax indexation. Again the shame is not just that broken promises on tax indexation exist but also the fact that Mr Fraser chooses to use methods of revenue raising that he himself has condemned as corrupt and dishonest. The outrage, as I shall demonstrate clearly, is that this form of tax increase 'by stealth', as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has put it, hits the poorest taxpayers hardest. The reason is simple. Tax is increased because as people receive wage increases a greater proportion of their income becomes taxed at a higher rate. Those already paying a large proportion of their income at the higher rate, like those who are sitting in this Senate, have little to fear because a rise in their salary will not send them into a higher tax bracket, but it is quite different for the poor in this country. As a matter of fact, in line with trends established by this Government the poorer the wage earner you are, the more your tax will increase. After the first two Fraser Governments, the real after tax income for a family living on the average minimum award wage had been eroded by 11 per cent in real terms compared with the position in 1975. Families on average weekly earnings had suffered a cut of 7 1/2 per cent in real after tax income. In the last two Fraser Governments, tax cuts were only for the wealthy. This Fraser Government has imposed a tax the equivalent of about $10 a week on all families not classified as disadvantaged by abrogating Federal Government responsibilities in relation to health care. That is even more regressive than a flat income tax which charges people a fixed percentage of their income. That is a potted history of the Liberal-National Country Party's record on the distribution of income. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let me look at how this Government's non-indexed tax scale will hit the less wealthy hardest. Taking the assumptions on wage growth that the Treasurer made in the Budget we get the following sorts of figures: A wage earner earning $14,500 a year will gain a 13.5 per cent wage increase in money terms but his tax will go up by 17 per cent in money terms. A wage earner on $12,000 will see his tax increase by more-by 18 per cent in money terms. A wage earner on $10,000 will pay 20 per cent more tax. A person living near the poverty line, on $6,000, will, with a wage rise of 13.5 per cent, according to the Budget prediction, have a tax rise of 33 per cent. These are the realities of the Government's own predictions in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that in the last week or two we have heard these absurd yardsticks which Government supporters have used in discussing things as diverse as interest rates and sales tax. It has been said by Government spokesmen: 'Sure, interest rates have gone up and the sales tax is going up but average weekly earnings have gone up by more'. This notion of some sort of political trade-off with these sorts of figures is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators will remember that a fortnight or three works ago the Prime Minister, in talking about industrial relations, said that the Government might put a dampener on interest rates in exchange for wage restraint. What an extraordinary concept in terms of a trade-off. The sales tax and the average weekly earnings trade-off is a figment of the Prime Minister's imagination. Indeed it is a figment of Senator Carrick's imagination also. He used this tactic today at Question Time. It is absurd. When we talk about distribution of wealth in this country we are not talking about the people who are on average weekly earnings and above. We are talking about the 60 per cent or more who are in receipt of below average weekly earnings. They are the people whom this Parliament ought to be concerned about. Real hardship is being felt by them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation of families under the Fraser Budget. Seeking re-election 10 months ago the Prime Minister said to the Australian people:</PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief that the strength of Australia depends upon the strength of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what he meant by that when I look at the Budget. Perhaps he thinks strength arises in adversity for most Australian families but not for his type of family. Let us look at the tax position of Australian families after this Budget. Firstly, by failing to index the spouse rebate-I do not necessarily say that it is a good thing that the Government should do that, but in its terms the family is important-tax increases will hit those with dependants considerably harder than single income earners. A single income family on $14,500 per annum, approximately average weekly earnings, will receive a tax slug, or increase, of 21.5 per cent-an increase of over one-fifth. Again, the poorer the family the greater the tax impost. A single income family on $12,000 per annum will pay 25 per cent more tax. That is a tax bill that grows by a quarter in one year. A family on $10,000 per annum will see a tax increase of nearly a third. A family on $8,000 will be taxed 57 per cent more next year than this year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not taking into account the effects of the increased sales taxes. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three documents which show the relationship between tax and earnings between 1975 and 1981. I am sorry I have not been able to show these documents to the Minister. The documents are tables that were prepared by the Opposition. </PARA>

The Government's health scheme calls them disadvantaged Australians. It is a very good description. Mr Howard expressed his view with the rhetorical question: 'What is wrong with the distribution of wealth in Australia?' What did the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, have to say about it? He was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald quite recently as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there may be some Australians living in relative poverty-compared to the incomes of Australians generally . . . I believe there are very few Australians who lack the basic subsistence requirements of life. </PARA>

I invite them to think about a lone parent caring for four children on a $120 weekly pension. I invite them to think about lone parents, as a matter of fact, without making monetary calculations. According to the Smith Family organisation, for a lone parent with four children approximately 63 per cent, or $76 a week, will go in rent. That is $76 out of $120. That leaves less than $10 per week per person for food and other necessities. Does Senator Chaney think that such a family would not lack the necessities of life? There are in this country, unfortunately, 172,000 lone parent families. I invite the Ministers to look at a mature unemployed person with dependants. For some reason such people have been downgraded by this Government, even next to other pensioners. This Budget increases unemployment benefits by $5 a week, leaving unemployed people $11 a week behind the level of benefit they received in 1975 when the Fraser Government came to power. I invite the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Senator Chaney to consider the position of a young person under 18 years of age who does not wish to or who cannot live at home. What is such a person to do with $36 a week? What sort of self-respect will the person just out of school have when he or she is forced on $36 a week into a hostel or out on to the street? Is it any wonder that the clientele of the Smith Family organisation has grown from 57,000 to 90,000 in just four years? Despite government cuts in funding grants to that organisation, the figure has risen from 57,000 to 90,000 in just four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The poor are just some of the people footing the bill for this Government's austerity program. Spending in real terms on health has fallen 22 per cent. Low cost housing relief is down a massive 59 per cent in real terms, at a time of acute need. If Mr Fraser, Senator Chaney or the Treasurer want to know about that they should ask the Victorian Liberal Government Minister for Housing. He will tell them about that because he knows what it is about. He does not go to Perth and say that there could not be poverty there because it is such a beautiful city; he goes to places like Fitzroy and Kensington in Melbourne, to mention two suburbs, where there are very real problems in relation to low cost housing. Mr Kennett is a man with whom I could scarcely conceive that I would have any ideological agreement but I have a lot of admiration for him and his style, and for the command he has over his portfolio. He knows what low cost housing is about and I could utter no words more critical of the Fraser Government's attitude to housing than those uttered by Mr Kennett. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for low cost housing is down a massive 59 per cent in real terms. Education is down 2 per cent in real terms, with money for public state school down more dramatically and funding to private schools up equally dramatically. At the same time, assistance to mining and manufacturing industries has gone up from $151m in 1975-76 to $524m this year. That is an increase of just under 200 per cent in real terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there are not many of them. The Government has saved $212m by shortchanging the mature age unemployed; it has increased the unemployment benefit from $54 to $58. Without indexation, that represents a loss of about $11 a week. The Government has saved $272m by freezing the employment benefit for under 18-year-olds at callous figure of $36 a week. It saved $240m by shortchanging pensioner families with children so that it could allow for a $300m revenue shortfall in tax collections due to tax avoidance. That is a part of the value system of the Fraser Government Budget. Why has the Government done all these things? Is it so that it can pay to industry over $200m in a program of export incentives which are daily sabotaged by the same Government's own policies of appreciating our currency, or is it so that it can give to industry $500m to subsidise the replacement of men by machines? Perhaps, in part, they are necessary policies but in the hands of this Government they are not well thought out policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are some of the fundamental issues that concern the Opposition about this Budget. That is something of the Opposition's response to the Budget, considering it as a social document. Of course, this Government's great claim before the Australian people has been that it is a fine manager of the Australian economy. It is a claim that looks a little hollow in the light of some of the things it has done. I refer to the handing down of that great document, the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. That review was so ad hoc in its approach that pages of the final draft of its report are blacked out with printers ink. It was a review so hastily and shoddily put together that, as a cost cutting measure, it abolished one committee which was giving its services voluntarily to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> How does the claim of efficient economic management over five years stand up against the fact that more than half of the advisory committees abolished by the Fraser Government were created by it in the previous five years? Of the committees abolished by the so-called razor gang, three-quarters were created by Liberal-Country Party governments, half of them in the period of government of the present Prime Minister. Does that represent economic efficiency over a period?</PARA>
<PARA> How does the Budget stand up as an economic document? Whatever its social consequences, how will this Budget affect the health of a mixed economy such as that of Australia? Again we see amateurishness and, ultimately, incompetence. This Government has for some time refused to impose a rational resource rental tax. It has refused to do that against the advice of its Treasury and against the advice of almost everyone except the mining lobby. What has been the result? The result has been the introduction of State resource taxes, and now this Government has imposed a duty on steaming coal. We have State resource taxes instead of a Commonwealth resource tax, and now we have a duty on steaming coal-a de facto resource rental tax ineptly imposed. Instead of being a tax on profits it is a tax on production which jeopardises coal operations which are only marginally profitable. It is a tax which will discourage production. Much more alarmingly, it is of course to be seen in the Budget's overall strategy. The overall strategy runs something like this, as it is set out in the Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Real growth over 1980-81 was 4 per cent. This is too big a growth, and it must be wound back, or inflationary pressures will get out of control. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Government proposes to remove about $1000m more from the economy than it intends to put back. I refer honourable senators to page 11 of Budget Paper No. 1 where we can see that the figure of 4 per cent has been made up by two half-yearly figures. Growth for the first half of 1980-81 was running at an annual rate of 6.1 per cent. Then, dramatically, interest rate rises started to bite. A number of extremely large development projects faltered, credit sensitive industries went into rapid decline and other industries postponed and cancelled developments. Accordingly, the annual growth rate for the second half of 1980-81 was severely cut back to 1.6 per cent. That 1.6 per cent is the lowest annual growth rate figure produced for five years and the third lowest for the decade. In the face of that, the Government is brazen enough, dishonest enough or just plain incompetent enough to predict non-farm growth in 1981-82 of about 3 1/4 per cent. I would like to know whether Mr John Stone agrees with those estimates or whether the emperor has again lost his clothes. It would not seem to me to require a great clarity of vision to see that, if an economy growing at 1.6 per cent per annum is depressed, it is hardly likely to grow at double that rate. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reality of this Budget's overall strategy. It is a strategy which, by its own admissions and on its own forecasts, will see higher employment, lower profits, higher inflation, possibly higher interest rates and further depressed living standards. This is the sixth year of Fraser Government management. It is the sixth year of bad medicine. It is the sixth year in which the patient has received bad medicine but has not seemed to get any better, and there seems in this sixth year to be no hope of a cure. </PARA>
<PARA> One more aspect of this Budget needs to be attended to, one final issue or theme to which I want to refer. About the first substantial issues to get a mention in the Budget Speech are wage demands and industrial disputes. We are told that the Budget was framed with a view to tackling those things. This was foreshadowed about a week before in a statement made by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, and Mr Fraser on their so-called wages policy, in what might be called the apres royal wedding summit drinks instead of the pre-royal wedding industrial summit drinks. They announced in that statement what was euphemistically to be called a wages policy. Their wages policy, in the absence of wage indexation, amounted to saying that they had no wages policy at all. I quote from the editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 3 August 1981, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The nearer the end of indexation came the more the total lack of direction the Government in the vital industrial relations and wages areas became apparent. Rather, it has weakly back pedalled on its formerly tough approach in the Arbitration Commission and hoped to the very last moment that indexation, partial, flexible or otherwise, would survive in some form . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Arbitration Commission certainly tried hard enough to keep indexation going . . . But the Government never gave it sufficient support to make the effort any longer worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA>So, instead of a wages policy Mr Fraser announced his intention to use monetary policy, tariff cuts and an appreciating dollar to contain wages. This is the underlying strategy of the Budget. He was opting for a market approach to wage fixation and, given his ideological preferences, such an approach cannot be described as surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> It has long been recognised that market forces cannot be used as being acceptable in industrial relations areas, as they can in many others, for a number of reasons which I would be happy to discuss at any other time. But this Government's only wages policy is market forces. Business in Australia, confronted with that wages policy, should be beginning to ask itself what it will cost a business to test the resolution of employees in the market, to test the viability of a market forces wage policy. What will it cost them? I can tell them now, this social experiment on which the Fraser Government is embarking in wages policy, as it is embarking on social experiments in every other area of government activity, will cost them millions of dollars. In 1979 it cost well over four million man days in Australia. That is about $200m in lost wages, and more than that in lost production. In Austria, by contrast, to mention one other country which has a wages policy, and which has, perhaps coincidentally, a Democratic Socialist government-I do not think it is coincidental, but it has one-and which uses the centralised wages bargaining system rather than the market, 800 man days were lost in 1979 through strike action. The figure in Austria was 800 man days in comparison with a total of four million man days lost in Australia. That is less than one-twentieth of one per cent of Australia's rate in per capita terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Market forces can be used to dampen wage growth in two ways. Firstly, they can be used to reduce profits, thus lowering the overall prosperity in the economy and making it harder for businesses to agree to wage rises. That is one way of doing it, a sort of big stick approach. Secondly, the market can be used to create unemployment, which worsens the bargaining position of employees. I would argue that this Budget was intended to do both of those things and that this Government's only response to the prospect of wage push inflation, its only wages policy, is summed up in two words-more unemployment. As the prospect of wage push inflation will be with us for some time, that fact has ominous implications for the long term. It means that whenever the economy threatens to recover this Government, fearing a bout of wage inflation, will seek to ensure that market conditions exist which will prevent wage inflation. That means higher unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> If we think about that, a new paradox opens for this Government in terms of this Budget strategy. This Government has always handed out its tough medicine using the lure of economic growth. The Australian people have been told that with enough belt tightening, enough bankruptcies, enough unemployment, we could pave the way to a new economic order, a new economic boom. They have been told that our only cure for our ills as a nation-they have been told that for six years now-is contained in those three words which mesmerise the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-sustained economic growth. But when for the first time under the Fraser Government the signs of sustained economic growth appear-as they began to appear a few months ago-this Government immediately warns that excessive wage demands will jeopardise that sustained economic growth. So its reaction is not to formulate a long term wages policy, which is what it ought to be doing, but to dampen wage anticipations and growth by creating more unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> We used to be told that the only true cure for unemployment, the only road to full employment, was sustained economic growth. Hundreds of thousands of Australian kids have been told that. They have been told that they are not getting better unemployment benefits and they are not getting such things as the Community Youth Support Scheme because the Government knows that the only true and correct road to full employment is sustained economic growth. This Budget is significant for one thing. The great untruth is finally out. This Budget represents a tacit admission, and it has been made by the Fraser Government for the first time. We have been told that sustained economic growth will not cure unemployment. Far from economic growth being the cure for unemployment, the strategy is to seek to base economic growth on a foundation of sustained unemployment. By handing down this Budget the Fraser Government has pronounced itself Australia's first government of permanent unemployment as a strategy for the economy of this country. </PARA>

What concerns me is that the sad thing about people like the honourable senator is that they probably were never told. I believe his instincts about this matter are completely decent, and if he had had any say in this Budget then it might have been better. But he had not any say at all, so I do not know why he wastes my time with interjections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the Opposition's point of view, we see a need for a much more constructive and responsible Budget in 1981-82. We need a Budget with a different economic premise from the Government's. The Australian Labor Party does not believe that this Government's severe contractionary measures are appropriate when applied to an economy which is already showing signs of an alarming slow-down. We believe that a non-farm economy, growing at a present rate of 1.6 per cent, is not much to be proud of in Australia. Accordingly, we would like to see the Government produce a more balanced Budget or even a mild deficit, rather than the $1,000m tax slug which the Government has imposed. Our priorities would be different, both in the revenue and the outlay areas. We would like to see hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money saved by ending the investment allowance which at present costs $500m. We would like to see, as would the Treasury officers, the Government's economic advisers, a resource rental tax imposed on the mining industry. Those measures would enable relief in direct and indirect taxation to be given to all Australians. We would not want to see sales tax increases proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the massive pay-as-you-earn income tax increases forecast for 1981-82, we could readjust tax scales to give relief, particularly to low and middle income earners. In fact, a few months ago the Treasurer, Mr Howard, said that he was going to do that. He said that any increase in sales tax would be accompanied by relief in relation to income tax. That has not happened. I suppose it is being kept for the pre-election bonus. A Labor government would adopt more stringent tax evasion measures. At present tax evasion costs the Treasury at least $300m a year. We would like to see that staff ceilings do not operate in important government departments, such as the Taxation Office, where the Government has created an inefficient and understaffed Public Service, unable properly to monitor and police revenue collection procedures. Some estimates of revenue forgone in this way have been as high as $1,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> Money thus saved, and a less stringent monetary policy, would enable a sensible government to start pegging back some of the Fraser Government's attacks on the disadvantaged. It would also enable a sensible government to move towards paying the $800m-plus bill that Mr Fraser has taken from the needy by stealth-to use his own expression-by not indexing benefits and allowances. It would enable the necessary expenditure to be made in a number of areas where the Government is saving a pittance, but prejudicing community initiatives and government services alike. The razor gang abolished some things-perhaps little things in the broad context-such as the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, which closed down because of a lack of $50,000; the public broadcasting movement; and standards in children's television. Fees were imposed for second university degrees. It abolished things such as youth assistance and women's refuges. In Budget terms these are small things but they are very important to groups in our society, and they are the sorts of values which a decent and honest society would espouse. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, an Australian Labor Party government would seek to develop a constructive solution to industrial relations problems in this country. The Government's failure to do that lies at the core of its Budget strategy. At times governments of either political colour must stand up to irresponsible action by employees or employers. But that is not an industrial relations policy, and it need not be a recipe for constant warring between government and unions. In addition to working towards a wages, prices and social wage policy, in consultation with trade unions and employer groups, we would seek, as we have done in the past, to bring constructive and long term reforms to the structure of the union movement and the arbitration system in this country. We would seek to unify industrial regulation by constitutional change if necessary. That would increase predictability, unity and rationality of arbitration. It would increase the confidence of employers and employees in the arbitration system. In addition, we recognise that industrially we have plenty to gain by moving away from the currently craftbased unionism, towards industry-based unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are important to consider as alternative strategies which any sensible, progressive government might adopt. When the Australian Labor Party was last in office and sought to facilitate the amalgamation of unions along the lines suggested, that initiative was blocked by the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition. In the 1980 election campaign the Fraser Government promised action along the lines of the legislation which it blocked in 1974. Six years later there has been a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of industrial disputation, and a lot of money has gone down the drain. In the 1980 election campaign the Government promised it would do something about that. After the election this Government ditched its brief commitment to structural reform in the industrial relations area and, instead, introduced some token legislation which has been condemned by almost all reputable authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the matter of industrial relations is central to this Budget, and the desire to contain wage growth using the market is a central clue to the unusual severity of the Budget. We are to go through another recession. The poor will be paying more and unemployment will grow because this Government cannot find any other solution to Australia's industrial relations problems. As I have said in this Senate on a number of occasions, only three Western nations have maintained full employment throughout the last decade. They are Austria, Sweden and Norway. None of those countries has a market approach to industrial relations. All of them have industry-based unions. All of them are benefiting from the policies of democratic socialist and social democratic governments, from enlightened, humane and responsible approaches to economic matters. We would move towards those sorts of solutions to our problems in Australia. We would not seek solutions, as the present Government has, in the social and economic nostrums of the previous century. We would not seek to make this country a social laboratory for cruel experiments in economic theory, where the poor are the guinea pigs and the wealthy have time to study the experiments and feel no pain from the results. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer that directly, Senator Walsh. Before I continue with my main remarks, perhaps I might comment on one or two things that the Leader of the Opposition said. I note that he referred to this Government's great tax increase. I believe that is something of a distortion in the sense that the tax increase, of course, relates to volume and not rate. If we go back to, from Senator Button's point of view no doubt, the halcyon days of Mr Whitlam's Government, we will find that in one year the amount of tax paid by Australians increased by 46 per cent when wages increased by 23 per cent. I think it is fair that we should have our attention drawn to the fact that there is a difference between volume and rate. The amount is relevant to the earnings of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button referred also to the increase in interest rates and the consequent increase in costs, in particular, home building costs, which no one would be pleased about. Then he went on to say that the fact that average weekly earnings were up by a very much greater amount-some $220-odd a month in the last three years-was adjudged in some way to be a trade-off. A trade-off with whom? A trade-off for what? Those are facts. They are not relevant to trade-offs and there is no way in which they can be construed as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button further mentioned that this Government was reputed, by itself and by others, to be a fine manager of the economy. I really do not believe that Senator Button thinks it is, yet I must remark that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development rates it as probably the most efficient economy in the developed world today. Although the OECD may not have members with the capacity in economic fields of Senator Button and others it has, I understand, some very significant economic brains in its make-up. The honourable senator went on further to suggest that the Government has a policy objective of creating more unemployment. I honestly believe that no one in Australia could believe that that is the objective of this Government or of any other government. To create unemployment is to create insuperable problems. Any government which seeks that as an objective will find itself with a very short term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Button referred to some of the policies that his own party would follow if in government. His party would seek to abolish the investment allowance, an amount of $500m, and it would seek to introduce a resource rental tax. All I can say about those policies-they are only two of the consequences of a socialist policy-is that there is no shadow of doubt that they would be significant deterrents to the development pace of this country. If they were deterrents to the development of Australia they would be deterrents to employment, living conditions and working conditions throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Budgets very often create a great deal of concern, loss of temper, distortion and confusion and, really, they should not. A Budget crops up in the national field, in the field of the Government, every 12 months. Budgets relate constantly to corporate and private business and, indeed, to every family in our community. So a Budget should be regarded as a normal event, as something which has to be analysed sensibly and constructively. Budgets must have responsibility as one of their main facets. In establishing expenditure and revenue patterns one has to be responsible in the first and final instances to the taxpayers. Taxpayers right across the board are the providers of the revenue with which governments seek to follow their various policies. </PARA>
<PARA> A realistic analysis of a Budget situation is an absolutely essential operation by a government, an opposition and, indeed, by the Australian people. Distortion and confusion, sometimes aided and abetted, unfortunately, by the contributions of the media and other people, do nothing but disservice to the community which the Budget is drawn to serve. The Budget is a blueprint for an interdependent community. Let us never forget that this community is totally and absolutely an interdependent community. Circumstances which affect any part of it significantly affect virtually all other parts. </PARA>
<PARA> A Budget, in the context of a free democratic society, must express the political philosophy of the party or parties which happen to be in government. Indeed, one could assume that if the Australian Labor Party were the Federal Government in this country today it would be expressing through its Budget the philosophy of a socialist system. It would be expressing through its Budget the implementation of the socialisation of the factors of production. That is its province and that is its undertaking. It is the important province of the Australian electorate to recognise and analyse this fact. Similarly, in the case of our own Government bringing down a Budget-as it has for 1981-82-amongst other things it expresses in some real sense its own political philosophy, the political philosophy of a free enterprise democracy, a political philosophy which highlights the security and the dignity of the family unit and equality of opportunity. Indeed, in Australia we live in a country where equality of opportunity is as great or possibly greater than it is in any other country. We believe in the institution and operation of the profit motive within the law, within a properly constructed legal system developed by majority opinion and imposed by majority opinion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure, Senator Walsh, that you will have an opportunity to enlighten the Senate at some appropriate time. The profit motive probably goes further towards satisfying human nature than most other ideas and ideals that have been developed. We believe in a philosophy which sees fredom-and this is immensely important at a time when terrorism stalks around the world and disruption is found almost everywhere-as meaningful only if it is freedom within a disciplined circumstance. It is essential that we recognise these things and that we apply them in the implementation of a socio-economic order that is literally dictated by the sorts of Budgets that governments bring down. In our view the state is here to be the servant of the people and not the master. We see the state as a social service-based state in which free enterprise can move as long as that basic element, the needy, the aged and the infirmed, are properly and decently cared for. So the state should be the servant and not the master of the people. It should prevent exploitation of man and his environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Budget seeks to consolidate and develop a position which has grown over several years and which, by all economic and social standards, is excellent by comparison with any country. I mentioned earlier in my remarks that the OECD view--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sometimes wonder why the honourable senator does not go there. The OECD view of the Australian economy, as I said earlier in my remarks, is that unquestionably it is on the right track and that at this point it is performing better than other economies in the developed world. Indeed, to coin a Mulvihillian phrase, it says we are running against the run of play. Economies around the world are tending to diminish in their security while the Australian economy is basically strengthening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen a year in which employment has increased by some 2 per cent. Unemployment, an unsatisfactory situation, is a little more than one per cent better than it was twelve months ago. We have seen a growth rate in the vicinity of 4 per cent. The overall deficit of $146m is almost $1 billion less than the overall deficit last year and the domestic surplus is $1.5 billion. These factors have made a very significant contribution to many things, not the least of which is the hopeful dampening of the escalating interest rate situation which is relevant not only to our own economic circumstance but also to the economic circumstances of other countries. On a percentage basis, the overall deficit in this country today is 0.1 of one per cent of gross domestic product. One would have to describe that as a significant performance in view of the fact that six years ago the overall deficit was 5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the priority of this Government in the expenditure field lies in defence, in maintaining and developing pensions, in other benefits, particularly for the training of youth, and in foreign aid. Foreign aid has increased by some 18 per cent or, in money terms, $100m. The Australian aid is significant in that it is not tied aid. I have had some contact with the people who implement foreign aid programs among our many friendly neighbours. I believe they make a significant contribution to the countries they serve and to their own country. Their contribution through the aid that they deliver and the expertise that they pass on to the communities in which they live and serve is quite remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence area has seen an increase in expenditure of 16.3 per cent, or, in real terms, 5.3 per cent. I believe that is an expenditure of which Australians should be justly proud. In the next five to ten years, the highly trained and extremely capable defence personnel in all three Services and the development of a sophisticated technological capacity, will make us a meaningful middle ranking power. This will put us in a significantly stronger position referable to our friends and neighbours and referable to our security in the years that lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance has been increased by 50 per cent for the third child and subsequent children. As I think was mentioned earlier by Senator Button, the unemployment benefit for single persons of 18 years and over has been raised to $58.10 per week, a rise of almost $5 a week. Pensions will move up as usual by the full consumer price index movement in November to about $70 for a single person and $116-plus for a married couple. Expenditure to expand skilled labour is up by 22 per cent or $203m. I believe this is an extremely important area. It is expenditure which enables Australia's youth, who in many circumstances may be having difficulties in finding suitable employment, to achieve the skills they need not only to serve themselves and their own desires but also to serve the country through filling areas in which they are needed. Employment training schemes this year in the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training area alone will involve some 100,000 apprentices-5,000 more than last year. The School to Work Transition Program is to be granted a further $8m. I pause for a moment to consider the importance of school to work transition. I want to put forward the suggestion that we should be seeking ways to develop the skills of students who in the final two or three years of their schooling demonstrate a real capacity and ability to become tradesmen, whether electricians, plumbers, brickies, carpenters or whatever. It seems to me we must adjust our education system so that young people can start a trade course in the later years of their schooling and, following two or three years of training at technical institutions, can graduate as fully fledged tradesmen and fill the many places that our developing economy has for them. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $20m will be spent in training for skills which are clearly lacking in the work force. Such training would be of immense value to those trained and the industries involved. It would mean that Australia need not be looking, and should not need to be looking, for migrants with specific skills. We can and we must train our own people to fill the empty places in this developing country. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass quickly over the taxation area. I just remind the Senate of the implementation of half indexation of personal income tax from 1 July at a cost of $495m. I remind the Senate of the tax rebate in respect of the health insurance scheme. This is a significant contribution that in mere round dollars means a saving of some $600m to the Australian taxpayer. The Government, through the health system, will provide full basic medical and hospital treatment to the needy and pensioners. People outside that category will have the incentive of a 32 per cent tax rebate on health insurance premiums, which will significantly reduce the real cost of that insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government envisages a move to encourage the small Australian investor through taxation concessions. Although this proposal has not been identified factually at this point, it is clear that the Government is awaiting the report of the special Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System before it makes any decision. I am confident that after the report becomes available significant encouragement will be given to small Australian investors. That sort of encouragement is necessary in a country in which we are concerned to establish a real measure of Australian equity. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass quickly across the sales tax proposals. I want to mention one or two things relevant to the Government's determination. This determination has not been taken with joy. No government seeks to increase taxes. No government seeks to increase the load on the taxpayer out of sheer devilry or for any form of enjoyment. In this case the Government seeks to broaden indirect taxes. It seeks to increase by 2 1/2 per cent the existing rates of indirect taxes and to tax some new items at a 2 1/2 per cent level. Incidentally, we should remember that medicine, food and wine are not involved, nor will the excise be altered as it now applies to beer, spirits, tobacco and petroleum products. Nevertheless, the yield from the proposed indirect tax will be $553m in this year and in a full year it will be $892m. </PARA>
<PARA> There are good reasons for imposing the new indirect tax. There has to be a recognition that ultimately income from oil levies will fall away, and a responsible government has to have a capacity to replace that money. That is one reason. Another reason, of course, is that an indirect tax is much more difficult to avoid than a direct tax. Tax avoidance has been one of the major problems this Government has concerned itself with over the past few years. It is interesting to note that, in reference to the broader based indirect tax, in Mr Whitlam's time the Asprey Taxation Review Committee was commissioned to report, amongst other things, on indirect tax. The Committee report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Committee has reached one recommendation that it believes should be acceptable to a broad spectrum of public opinion and is consistent with a wide range of attitudes to social policy. It believes that the weight of taxation should be shifted towards the taxation of goods and services and away from the taxation of income. </PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the determinations of the Asprey Committee. Indeed, if the sort of income that is generated by these extra taxes becomes the reason we are able to implement cuts in personal income tax, which cuts will enable Australians to retain more of their earnings and to expend them with the sort of priority they would want, those extra taxes will ultimately prove to be a worthwhile implementation of this Budget. The Budget estimates real income to rise by some 2 3/4 per cent in spite of an allowance for a 13 1/2 per cent wage rise and a 10 3/4 per cent rate of inflation. If indeed those rates are realised it will show that this economy is continuing to move in the direction that has been proved to be accepted by most worthwhile judges as the correct direction. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my remarks I do not wish to continue with a discussion of the actual mechanics and rates of this tax and that tax. I want to ask the Senate to consider just one or two things in general. I believe the success of this Budget and the attainment of the enormous potential available to all Australian citizens is largely related to two things. I was glad to hear one of them being mentioned by Senator Button. That concerned the solution to the industrial relations problem. Whatever system or plan, whether economic and/or social, this Government has an absolute prerequisite to a successful solution to the industrial relations situation. I hope and believe that discussion and analysis between employers and employees, and indeed where necessary with the Government, will produce a sane system in which we see a composite Australian body going forward without the shocking circumstances that have been in existence for, let us face it, virtually the last 10 years. We have to grow out of, above and beyond those circumstances if we are to utilise the sort of capacity that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly another thing I want to suggest is necessary for the ultimate development of policies and the Australian potential is the regeneration of what we might call Australian pride and enthusiasm. If there is one thing more than any other that this country seems to have lacked in recent times it is a sense of pride and direction and enthusiasm. There would be no need for this except that in this country there has developed a massive group of knockers who are becoming more and more objectionable and, fortunately I believe, more easily recognisable and so able to be treated by the community as indeed they should be treated. It is enthusiasm that this country needs. After all, in the final resort, any legislation is only as good as the will of the people. The enthusiasm that this country needs could be related to its history-a history of which we should be proud, a history of overcoming all sorts of frontiers, such as problems of communications, distance and so on. We have had a history in both peace and war of being great contributors in many fields. I trust that that enthusiasm will be found. I commend the Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the normal course of events the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, would be giving the speech of comment on the Budget on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Indeed, Senator Chipp has been the principal architect of that speech. It is fair to say that at this stage. Because of illness Senator Chipp cannot be here to give this speech, hence it falls on me to indicate a viewpoint and a course of action to which all five senators of the Australian Democrats subscribe and which we all support. I stress that point at the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point one has to make is that this Liberal Party Budget has nothing to do with the economic challenges of 1981. Clearly it is designed to look forward to the next election year, 1983. From that point of view the Budget then becomes one of the more cynical economic documents that we have encountered. This year the Government is bleeding the community so that it can pork barrel in 1983, not caring who it tears apart this year and next year in the process. As a result of this there will be many individual bankruptcies; many small businesses will go to the wall. Pensioners will have to go through a great amount of agonising. Young families will do without many of the things they should have including decent accommodation in which to live. This is a very simple thing. I would have thought that any civilised and enlightened society would provide for its people a place to live first of all. We are getting to the stage now where we are denying that to thousands of our people. So much for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I will turn now to the Australian Labor party. When the Australian Labor Party, on the other hand saw the Budget it had a sudden touch of the Machiavellis. It thought it was going into the business of political intrigue. It honed in on the sales tax. I believe now, of course, the Australian Labor Party has rationalised that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose from forcing an early election. Opposition senators cannot tell me that that was not in their minds somewhere. When we look at the motivation of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party we must ask how much they are worth between them as far as a long term approach to the problems of this country is concerned. Is there an ounce of vision in either of these approaches?</PARA>
<PARA> This has been a time of some concern for the Australian Democrats. This small matter has probably taken up more of our time than it ought to have done, which is a pity. We feel that one of the most significant decisions of conscience-I place it no lower than that-that could be demanded from a new political party was demanded from us on the very first day of sitting. The Liberal Party said: 'Here is the Budget. Accept it as it is. Nothing is negotiable'. The Labor Party members said: 'Come along down the garden path with us. We will hold your hand. Reject all the sales tax Bills completely'. We are conscious that that initiative would succeed or fail on our vote. Indeed, we are fully conscious of our responsibility in this regard. It is one to the people of this country, a responsibility towards stability rather than political intriguing, a responsibility to enable this country to go on in a reasonable way rather than not know from one day to the next-because that is what would happen-what the political future holds. The country would be in a state of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we make absolutely no apology for refusing to offer a knee-jerk reaction to the demands of either the Government or the Australian Labor Party. There have been several reasons for the much publicised delay on which we decided before reaching our final judgment. I suggest that the first was the sheer weightiness and significance of that decision-the question whether this would be a good or useful thing to do. The second reason was the conflicting legal advice which we received on the matter. There was good cause for that because this was a unique situation and one that the lawyers advising us needed plenty of time to consider. There was also the need for the contemplation of significant aspects of the Budget other than the sales tax provisions. I believe that this is where the Labor Party tends to have been one-eyed. There are plenty of things about the Budget, as I will shortly discuss, that one could criticise apart from the sales tax proposals. To the question: Why strike out the sales tax proposals initially? I give the answer that it is part of the Labor Party's policy and philisophy, but is not part of our view point and philisophy. There, I suggest, is the crux of the matter. We, the Australian Democrats, will decide for ourselves what course of action to take, based on what we feel is the right thing to do. I suggest that that is what will happen in the future also. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the most important consideration was as to the consequences which the Australian Democrats' decision could be expected to have for the future. We have tried to take the long view, to look into the years ahead-possibly even, I suggest to honourable senators of the Labor Party, to the time when a Labor government may be in office. Honourable senators may say: 'Hear, hear!'. But they should ask themselves this question: Is it actually within the constitutional, conventional or technical competence of the Senate to undertake the grave step of rewriting the Budget, even in its particulars? From the very beginning we sought the best legal advice on whether the Senate could or should amend the Government's sales tax Bills. Initially we were told point blank-I will not go into personalities but we were advised by a thoroughly respectable person-that there was no way in which it could be done; that it would be unconstitutional. Within 24 hours that legal opinion was contradicted. We were told that a very important part of the sales tax package, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill, could in fact be amended. I gather that that is the case, that the Senate could shufflle the schedules around so that the extra sales tax burden would fall on the shoulders of those who could best afford it rather than on those who could least afford it. We are thoroughly in accord with the Australian Labor Party on the desirability of doing that, but perhaps honourable senators from the Labor Party can advise me why they think that it would be better that sales tax should not be imposed on luxuries and that some battler's overtime tax should have to go up as a result. Also, I hope that the Labor Party will explain why it wants to oppose the whole package of sales tax Bills. I would like to know its view on that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Australian Labor Party has suggested such a tax. It is an interesting proposition. To continue the story of the legal complexities, yesterday afternoon we received sales tax measures which impose a tax of 2 1/2 per cent, to apply from 1 January, on items hitherto exempt. This time the package contained no Bills which amended the exemption and classification schedules. We are now advised that that legislation falls in the area of legislation that the Senate cannot amend but may be subject only to the making of a request to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that stage, we re-examined the pledges made by the Australian Democrats senators in connection with Supply when they went before the people of this country and sought election to this place-as indeed the people did elect them. I should clarify, for the sake of those who may not know, that these pledges by Australian Democrats candidates were statutory declarations. We naturally regard them as being of the utmost importance and significance. The significant sections of the text reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That I personally subscribe to and endorse without reservation of any kind, the publicly announced policy of the Australian Democrats, as stated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, the Honourable Senator D. L. Chipp, that the Australian Democrats, if gaining a position of 'balance power' in the Senate, would not use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of supply or money Bills in a manner which would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. </PARA>
<PARA> That for all purposes and without reservation of any kind, I hereby declare that if elected to the Senate, I shall not cast my vote as a Senator in a manner which would be contrary to the policy of the Australian Democrats as stated in paragraph 3 hereof and thus shall never during my tenure as a Senator, contribute to or cause a situation which, through blocking of supply or money Bills might bring down the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Our conclusion has been that to reject and amend the Bills does not legally and directly affect the pledge that we took never to block Supply. That is a fact, and we concede it to the Labor Party, but-it is an important but-a strong case may be made that it offends the spirit of that pledge and, with honourable senators' permission, we will be the judges of that. We are the only people who will be the judges of it. We need no assistance from outside to make up our minds. </PARA>

<PARA> We can legally reject Supply Bills but what would be the long term implications of such an action? A respectable view can be put forward that the right of any government, including a Labor government, to create a Budget and govern is inviolate. When a government is elected by the people obviously its Budget is basic to its financial policies. Take that away from it and in some degree you remove its mandate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the honourable senator to bear with me a little longer. I am one of those who regrets the events of 1975. I believe that it was a constitutional crisis. In saying that, I am not necessarily backing the honourable senator. It was something that should never have happened. The reason for making our pledge is that we do not want to see it happen again. We know that the people of this country do not want it to happen again. They do not want any meddling or messing around which will produce the slightest likelihood of its happening again. If Labor Party supporters have not yet learned that I suggest they should listen to their Federal President, who knows more about the subject and has exhibited more sense regarding it than I have heard from their side of politics. I say to them, listen to what Mr Wran said. He said to them something of value, something that they might be guided by to their advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the question that arises: Can we mess around with the Budget a little and if so, how much? Clearly, to reject Bills which would cost the Government a billion dollars would be going too far. I assume that Labor senators would agree with me; I do not know. Is it going to far? It really comes back to a matter of degree, does it not? Clearly the Senate has the right to alter the Budget a little. It has an equal right to alter it a great deal. I suggest that the difference is merely quantitative. That is a dangerous path that would lead the way to the re-enactment of the events of 1975-a constitutional crisis. I hope I have made my point. </PARA>
<PARA> Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I can only ask honourable senators on both sides of the chamber to accept our assurance that we have given this matter clear thought, we have taken some advice, and we firmly believe that this view is the correct one. We are encouraged in that belief by the fact that some very eminent members of the Australian Labor Party have taken the same view. We feel that, for the sake of the country, the Labor Party as a whole might well look at the issue in that way. We could put away forever into the history books those terrible events of 1975 and forget what happened. I would like to see a time when all political parties subscribed to the idea that the rights of any reasonably elected government in the House of Representatives should not be usurped again in such a way. I cannot believe that members of the Labor Party do not believe that that should be so. </PARA>
<PARA> I read a report in a newspaper the other day of something said by Mr Hurford which struck me as being really Byzantine. Mr Hurford was speaking on the question of whether the sales tax measures should be opposed. He was in Sydney addressing the Committee for Economic Development in Australia-business people. He was putting the point of view that the whole idea of Labor opposing the sales tax measures was not really based on a desire to oppose the sales tax measures but rather was an attempt to persuade the business community that it ought to get together with the Labor Party and persuade the Liberal Party of Australia that, because of all the kerfuffle, legislation should be brought down to curtail the powers of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn now to the social services area. Although the Government has used that deceitful way of getting more and more money out of the community, no attempt has been made to return money to the community. I suppose that we have to have more and more money for the new and permanent Parliament House and things such as that. The cost of that is now up to $300m, although in 1978 we were given a solemn undertaking that there was no way in the world the cost would go above $151m. I predicted then that before that building was completed its cost would be over $1 billion. I say that again, and I will take an even money bet from any honourable senator who would like to make it that that will be the case. In other words, that is where the money is going to.

We are here to try to be of service to the people of this country. There again, it is another Byzantine idea that we should have these colossal buildings in which we can all luxuriate. What has happened as a result of that? It is not that there is any shortage of money in this country; it is the way in which it is being spent. Of course, the Government then cuts expenditure in other areas in order to finance other things, such as the Strangelove Academy-excuse me, the Casey University, or is it not called even that now? I am referring to the idea of the Indonesian-type military academy that we are to propagate in Australia, in which we will train our officers who now go to an ordinary university and come into contact with civilians, as they should do. We plan to hide them away in a military establishment so that they will not be perverted by any ideas of the ordinary populace. Money is going into that project. How about that? Of course, the Government keeps slashing away at expenditure in education and housing. The Australian Democrats feel particularly badly about education. Every other enlightened society in the world understands that a country is only as wealthy as the extent to which its people are educated and equipped in quantity to deal with the modern world and its competitive nature, especially in the field of high technology. It is madness to reduce spending on education. It is short sighted. In a way, it is a form of national suicide, and we regard it as seriously as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cut in finance for welfare housing is disastrous. Even quite small cuts in welfare housing finance rapidly exacerbate the situation in poor areas of cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. Immediately there is a bit of a shortage of housing the landlords get a chance to rack-rent even more. The worse the shortage gets, the higher the rents go and the worse is the situation of the people in that accommodation. They are crammed into buildings. I cannot resist saying, because I believe it to be true, that people are crammed into buildings such as the one that burned down in Kings Cross the other day and in which people were killed. That building existed because the economic conditions in housing that have been created in this country promoted its existence. It was not the only one of its kind. Believe me, we will see more incidents of that kind. How shortsighted can we be to expose people unnecessarily to that kind of thing. It is unnecessary. The Government is budgeting now for a huge surplus. It should have had the compassion and sense to try to ensure that finance for those vital areas of education and housing was at least maintained rather than cutting away at it. I suggest that it takes some thought and meditation to plumb the depths of the course on which we are now embarked and which I and the Australian Democrats believe is a tragic course. </PARA>
<PARA> With all those things to be considered, our decision was formed by this point: Where is the logic that demands that we should go down only one track, namely, to block sales tax legislation in this House? Logically, if we reject the sales tax legislation because it is inequitable and unjust-I agree that aspects of it are very much so-then why should we not go right in and reject a great deal more of the Budget? It is that proposition and its consequences that we have tried to face squarely and honestly. If we and Senator Harradine-he has to speak for himself but obviously he is an important factor in this-were to go along with the Australian Labor Party and knock back the sales tax Bills completely, what would be the result? One alternative is that the Government would have to accept the situation, in which case a precedent would be established. The numbers in the Senate are fairly close now, and I concede that the electoral system for this House makes that a more or less semi-permanent situation. That course would mean that every future government would face the risk of having at least part of its financial program destroyed. It is a fact that Governments have a mandate for their financial program. </PARA>
<PARA> If indeed this Government goes ahead with the sales tax legislation and does not change it, I can assure it that its chances of being booted out in 1983 are very good indeed. People's memories are not that short. Like the bad tennis player, the Australian Labor Party might get back not because of the adequacies of its performance but because the other side muffed it up so badly. This inequitable sales tax legislation is one of the ways in which the Government is muffing it up. Sales tax is inequitable if it is applied to necessities. I wonder how the legislation got though the Government Caucus without at least some Government members understanding that, understanding how widespread throughout the community the realisation would be. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government's acceptance of our blocking legislation would be one alternative. The other alternative is that we would be forced to a double dissolution and, once again, to the crisis situation of November 1975. Are either of those alternatives really in the interests of this country? We do not believe they are. We have an interest in stability. We believe that if either of the two major parties is elected to government it has a certain mandate and a right to exercise it. A small party should not meddle or allow itself to be persuaded by somebody else to meddle with money Bills and legislation of that nature. Supposing we had agreed to the proposition. Does anyone in this chamber or in the country believe that similar action would not be tried again next year and the year after, in constant attempts to harry the Government? The mind tends to boggle at the tactics of any of the major parties in an election year in such circumstances. I ask the Australian Labor Party to consider the reverse situation-with the ALP in government, the Liberal Party in opposition, and it being an election year. We assume that in such a situation the Labor government would bring in a fairly reasonable sort of Budget because of its being an election year. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Democrats had accepted the ALP proposals tonight, what proposals would the ALP impact on the 1983 Budget, which might be a less than responsible electioneering-type Budget. Would a Liberal government be forced to accept, say, ALP demands for reductions in sales tax, increases in pensions, and so on, three months before a general election? The result would be a hotch-potch piece of financing which would have been formed completely by a desperate political situation and which probably would throw the country into economic chaos, from which it might take years to recover. That is the prospect as we see it. It would have been very easy for us to come out and say: 'Here we are, we are the Australian Democrats with the balance of power. Yeah, we are going to go in with the Labor Party and we are going to heavy these guys'. Great stuff! High drama! Headlines! Terrific story!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, we were tempted for about 17 seconds, Senator, to be quite honest with you. Of course, we are not going to do it. Our dilemma is that many of the sales tax increases are thoroughly undesirable and their impact is most damaging on those sections of the community least able to afford them. We are not going to ignore that. We are going to move our support motions requesting the Government in the House of Representatives to amend the new sales tax provisions relating to the basic necessities of life, that is, anything which would have an effect on increasing the price of food, medicine, clothing, education or shelter because they are the things that everybody has got to have. I said that sales tax is inequitable if it is applied to those necessities. It is inequitable for this reason: The Government is applying a tax broadly on members of the community without any regard to their ability to pay. This is inequitable. It is a basic principle of tremendous importance. I can assure Government senators that they will find this out at the ballot box before they are much older. There is no doubt about that from the feedback I have had already, not just from party members, but from the community. That has been deeply resented. After 1 January when the effect starts to bite it will be resented even more. Do not think that the people who will have to pay more for their houses and who will be paying more on their mortgages next year will forget by 1983 because they will not.

<PARA> What we of the Australian Democrats are putting is that if a request goes to the House of Representatives with the full authority of the Senate, one House of the Parliament will have said to the Government: 'Don't do this thing'. I would have thought that a government with any respect whatsoever for parliamentary government, one which did not regard itself as a dictatorship, at least would have to consider that request very very carefully. If the Government gets feedback from the community at large, from the public-indeed, I know it must be getting it because we are getting letters-I think it will have to accede to that request. The Government will get peanuts from that section of tax anyway. Everybody is thinking: 'Okay, you are putting it on now so that you can make it higher next year and the year after until you really have the community under your thumb and everybody is paying a fortune for all sorts of things, like children's shoes and school textbooks'. Surely Government supporters do not think that will improve conditions in the community. How could they? If the Government refuses that request the Government alone will bear responsibility for refusal and it alone will earn the contempt of all decent Australians. We will do everything we can to make sure they understand very fully what the Government is doing. We will not let the Government forget it between now and the next election. That is our proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. May I congratulate you on your election as Chairman of Committees. The situation we find ourselves in tonight in which the position of the Australian Democrats on the sales tax Bills is being laughed at by Government Ministers is amazing. If it were not so serious it would be amusing, bearing in mind the Australian Democrats high principles and remembering that their leader was in Mr Fraser's shadow Cabinet in 1975. It was that shadow Cabinet which decided to block not individual tax Bills but the Appropriation Bills which make provision for the ordinary annual services of the Government. I point out that those principles came out only after he was sacked by Mr Fraser.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that Senator Mason muddied the water further tonight by not making the distinction between tax Bills and the Appropriation Bills. He suggested that if the Senate defeated the sales tax Bills it would be setting a precedent. Of course, it would not be setting a precedent. It has been done many times before. It happened to the Labor Party when we were in government in 1975. The Bill to impose the Medibank levy-a tax Bill-was defeated. Nobody on either side of the House suggested at that stage that an election would result. And, of course, an election did not result in 1975 because other Bills were twice defeated and provided grounds for a double dissolution. The election in 1975 was due to the Governor-General's action over the blocking of the Appropriation Bills. That was the cause of the election. The double dissolution was an accidental side effect and allowed both Houses to go to an election. I regret that the distinction was not stuck to by Senator Mason tonight. I suggest that the main reason for the position taken by the Australian Democrats is that, like the people on the other side of the House, they are more attuned to taxing regressively rather than progressively, though I acknowledge Senator Mason's reference to the fact that the sales tax on the necessities of life, on which he concentrated, would be regressive. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have asked me why I sought to come back to the Federal Parliament, having been a member of the House of Representatives during the period Labor was in government, especially in view of people's attitudes to politicians. They have a relatively low opinion of us. Perhaps I ought to relate an anecdote. Only a couple of weeks ago when I was filling the boot of my car with some goods I had bought I said to the supplier who was helping me to fill the boot: 'Yes, no trouble; they will all fit in the boot'. But, as it turned out, they did not. I commented that the size of the boot was deceptive and he said: 'Well, you are a politician; you would know all about deception'. That sort of automatic response by people-generally they have a low opinion of politicians-certainly does not encourage some people to come back to this place once they have been reprieved. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does nothing to encourage people to modify their view of members of parliament. The broken promises of this Government do nothing to modify that view. The Budget we are debating tonight just adds to people's feeling of hopelessness. Apart from the fact that it is a dull and an unimaginative document it attacks the living standards and destroys the way of life of Australian families and individuals. There is nothing in the Budget to make the average Australian any happier with the Fraser Government. As a result, this feeling flows to politicians generally as far as the Australian people are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The year 1981 has been called the year of the recycled politician. Michelle Grattan referred to that in the Age of 10 April this year. I am not sure whether that was the original reference but it was the first I saw. That expression arises from the fact that many people in the last year or so have moved, or sought to move, from the House of Representatives to the Senate, either directly or after a term, and from the Senate to the House of Representatives and from State parliaments to the Federal Parliament. I will not go into the details of all the people involved. No doubt the new Parliamentary Handbook will contain it. I was in the House of Representatives as the member for Denison during the two parliaments of 1972 to 1975 when the Labor Party was in government. I make a small political point by referring to the period as two half terms. They were only half terms because of the action of this House under the direction of the present Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I think the main thing that ought to be said at this point-it refers back to what Senator Mason said-is that the powers of this House constitute the problem and not detailed arguments about legal opinions on existing powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe when journalists write about recycled politicians they are using the term derogatorily. They are almost suggesting that such people should have been left out to grass. Recycling conjures up images of a rusty old car being crushed into scrap metal, of waste paper being made into some lesser quality paper product, or of an empty bottle being refilled. Others will have to judge whether such a comparison is apt-I hope after leaving a reasonable period before making that judgment. Of course, recycling is a highly environmentally responsible activity-conserving and reusing resources and, perhaps, even improving them. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that I have learnt some lessons from that period in government and the period since so that now I have been transported into what ought to be regarded as the second House of the Parliament rather than the upper House, which implies some superiority it ought not to have. I hope I can make a better contribution on behalf of those who have sent me here than I was able to do before. I will not be able to do that-none of us on this side of the House will be able to do that-other than in a marginal way, unless we win government and so be in a position to implement Labor policies in a positive way. That must be the aim of all of us in the Senate Opposition. I was almost going to say 'on this side of the chamber' but I make a distinction by saying 'Senate Opposition'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, we can try to protect Australia from the worst excesses of Fraserism. We can use committee hearings to expose facts, and develop and promote new policies, but we can really achieve things only if we obtain a majority in the House of Representatives. Even then, we would not necessarily be able to achieve all that we wanted to achieve. Life will be tougher for us, as it was between 1972 and 1975 when we were in government, but that is what we are here for. We would be letting down all those dedicated Labor supporters and workers for our cause if we did not have that aim and work our guts out for it-not just sometime, but in 1983 or sooner. </PARA>
<PARA> While I must admit to some mixed feelings about being back in this institution, I am pleased and proud to be back as a member of the Federal parliamentary Labor Party. I would like to express my thanks to all those Tasmanian voters who supported the Labor team in last October's election and especially thank those who voted for me, in particular, for the that honour. I trust I will not let down those people who so deliberately expressed their confidence in me. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether this is a maiden speech. I do not particularly mind about the usual courtesies or anything like that. There are two schools of thought as to whether this is a maiden speech. The first is that one cannot be a maiden twice over and I should, therefore, receive no leeway. The second thought is that this place does not recognise service in the House of Representatives in any way. After all, I have had a break in my parliamentary service. Certainly it makes no difference to me. Before I move on to other matters I wish to refer back to my maiden speech in the House of Representatives on 8 March 1973. I am told that it is bad form to quote oneself, but it is with some wry amusement that I read what I said then. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was certainly very satisfying to have won Denison for the Australian Labor Party so decisively and, by that, to have played a part in enabling this Government to come into office, and so to allow the reforms to commence. We lost Denison in 1949 when we lost government; we have now regained it as we return to office. If this is significant, I do not mind having my personal political fortunes linked to those of the Party as a whole, because this Government, by its actions and achievements, is going to remain in office for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now history that my personal political fortunes were linked to the Labor Government. We did not remain in office for a long time-more is the pity. I believe we are on the verge of regaining office by winning, among other seats the five House of Representative seats in Tasmania, including Denison. Therefore, in two ways we would be removing the burden of the Denison incumbent from the people of Canberra. One of the points that I made in that 1973 speech-I must say that it seems a lifetime ago now even though it is only eight and a half years ago-was that Labor's political opponents ranted and raved about aspects of our policies and tried to make certain words dirty words-words such as 'peace', 'socialism' and 'caucus'. Their campaign continues but since I am basically an optimist I think we have made some progress since then in reducing the effectiveness of our opponents' campaign. In 1973 I said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are a socialist party and we should not be ashamed to say so. I think that the party is itself partly to blame for the past success of the Liberal party, so called, and the Australian Country party-</PARA>
<PARA>As it then was-</PARA>
<PARA>and others whom I will not name, in their blackening of the word 'socialism'. We have, to a certain extent, ignored the misrepresentations instead of reacting positively and explaining to the people what a modern democratic socialist thinks, and how our policies fit in with that. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then the party has made much more of an attempt to use and explain the word. I believe our opponents' misrepresentations have been somewhat neutralised, and they are now much more muted about that criticism. The present Government still makes much of the democratic procedures of the ALP, almost spitting out the word 'caucus'. Again, perhaps that does not occur quite so often as it did in the past. In 1973 I further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition makes much of the democratic structure of the Labor Party . . . However, our system is perfectly justifiable and in fact gives desirable safeguards to the public, because the electors are fully aware of the basic platform of the party within the framework of which we work. The platform is a public document, resulting from debate at open conferences which are representative of the tens of thousands of Australians who make up the Australian Labor Party, and which anyone who subscribes to the party's principles can join, and join in that decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA> The public knows that the policy they voted for when they supported Labor candidates cannot be changed at the drop of a hat by a handful of people, unlike the policies of the Parties opposite when they are in government. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that did not always work precisely as intended when we were in government, but overall it did and does. I suggest that if members opposite 'caucused' a bit more often instead of just accepting what their leader says their Government might improve as a result. I believe the amusing thing about Government members supporting the Budget Speech of their Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the sales tax measures in particular is that very few of them had any say in the proposal at all. The revenue measures would have been the decision of about three people on their side. Finally, I refer to the word 'peace'. This is another word that members opposing us have tried to denigrate. In my 1973 speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The other word that, to its everlasting disgrace, the present Opposition--</PARA>
<PARA>The present Government-</PARA>
<PARA>has tried to make out to be a dirty word is 'peace'. It still makes me sick to think of how the Opposition, when in government, got this nation involved in the Indo-China War. </PARA>
<PARA>Our opponents tried to make working for peace equivalent to treason. But now with this distance in time since the Vietnam war even they would have to admit that we were correct. As a result, to support peaceful solutions is now almost respectable. I was speaking in 1973, shortly after the end of Australia's involvement in that war. There are still warmongers on the other side of this chamber, but their position, I believe, is less credible now. I am proud to be part of a socialist party which stands for peace in this world and tries to conduct itself in a democratic way. I think the differences between the parties are much clearer now than they were, especially following the razor gang proposals which the Government is now implementing in getting out of any possible public involvement that it can. I believe the Government would put back the ACT Fire Brigade into private hands if it thought it could get away with it. The ideology of this Government distinguishes it quite clearly from the present Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say something of my attitude to the Senate, as a dedicated former member of the House of Representatives. If I must accept that this place exists, at least I can object to the Senate's powers and the way its supporters suggest not just that its powers are equal to those of the House of Representatives but that they are more than equal. This assertion of power is manifested in many ways, including subtle ways such as those I mentioned before-for example, referring to it as the upper House rather than the second House. I suggest that there is much forelock tugging here which is largely a result of the use of the title 'Senator', a name style I find difficult to get used to although I suppose I will have to. The existence of such a continuously used title is one of the subtle ways in which this place wrongly asserts superiority over the House of Representatives where everyone is plain Mr, Mrs, Miss or Dr, or whatever. At least 'Senator' is a non-sexist term. However, its use also takes away one's given name. 'Senator' becomes almost a new first name, as if one's former identity has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing which suggests superiority is the six-year term, which I believe is far too long. I do not think anyone elected by the Australian people ought to be able to go for that length of time without having to face them again. A term of four years ought to be quite long enough. People say that the Senate is imporatnt because of the way the House of Representatives performs. I argue that the House of Representatives performs in the way it does because of the Senate. Because of the Senate governments are encouraged to push Bills through the House of Representatives knowing that more debate must occur in the Senate. Because the Senate has a well developed committee system there is less pressure for a proper system to develop in the House of Representatives. Again, the Senate ensures that the House of Representatives is as gladiatorial as it is. I think that is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay a tribute to former Senators Ken Wriedt and Justin O'Byrne. In a way I am succeeding both of them in that whilst it was Justin O'Byrne's term that finished on 30 June-my term began on 1 July-Ken Wriedt was the senator resident in the southern part of Tasmania, having had an office in Hobart. As honourable senators will know, Justin O'Byrne served 34 years in the Senate, which is an incredibly long time to contemplate. He was Labor Whip and for part of the period we were in government he was President of this House. It has been a privilege to know him and I think it is a landmark in Tasmania's history and in the history of the Senate that he is now not in this chamber. If anyone were to be dubbed with the title 'Senator Emeritus', it would be Justin O'Byrne. Ken Wriedt was here for 12 years, including three years as a Minister of high repute and six years as Labor leader in the Senate. It is a great shame that he is not continuing to serve in Parliament. I am particularly indebted to him because, working for five years since 1975 as his electorate assistant, I was able to keep up my close involvement with federal political affairs. Both those former senators were fine representatives of Tasmania and of the Australian Labor Party and it is an honour to succeed them and to represent the Australian Labor Party and the people of Tasmania in this Senate. </PARA>

One welcomes the interesting observations Senator Coates made and also the modesty which he displayed in describing himself as a recycled politician. I suggest to him with all seriousness that perhaps the expression might better be that he is a reconditioned model rather than a recycled politician-one who has been elevated to higher climes, who has actually now gone on to more extensive and valuable service.

I hope that in his work in the Senate he will find that this is indeed a worthwhile chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the Budget. Tonight we are hearing the views of the Australian Labor Party and the views of the Australian Democrats on the Budget. The words that come to me tonight are the words which Senator Chipp used in his campaign. He said the purpose which the Australian Democrats hoped to serve in this chamber was to 'keep the bastards honest'. I think that expression in this day and age is acceptable. Of course I would not apply it to colleagues opposite. I say that keeping persons honest is what I hope we on this side of the chamber will do. Therefore, we will want to observe the various convolutions in the ideas, philosophies and views of the Labor Party, and perhaps even the Democrats, to ensure that they do keep consistent with the views they have expressed over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make reference to some of those views and, with loving care, speak of some of the things that have been said in this chamber in previous times by various leading members of political parties, particularly the Labor Party. Since the Labor Party has now entered upon a new version of its rights and activities in regard to Supply and money Bills and is now developing what one might call a pettifogging distinction between those Bills which they feel they can rightly throw out from this chamber-money Bills though they are-and those to which they think it would be wicked to do that, I want to remind its members of some of the things they have said over the years and suggest that, as they think they are now in the full flush of their powers, they should think of those principles and stick to them. I am afraid they are not showing much sign of doing that at present. It is true that tonight the Democrats have indicated that they will not go along with the line the Labor Party has put before them. I think the Labor Party offered to lead them down the garden path but I think Senator Mason's view was that the Democrats are not willing to take up that offer. I am glad to see tonight that they do not propose to take action which would in any way defeat this Budget or any major part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Labor Party has been involved in curious activities and actions in recent months and years. One could say that Senator Button, who has been a proponent of the new line by the Labor Party in regard to Supply, has developed push button principles that are capable of change when he does not need them. I remind the Senate that on 19 June 1979 Senator Button took it upon himself to write an article in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The participants in the debate about the issues which emerged dramatically in 1975 have tended to become locked into fixed positions. There is not much room for lateral thinking about the role of the Senate. It is clear, however, that if the Senate continues as it is now, it will lead to a repetition of the '1975 show' at some time in the future. The consequences will be even more divisive and disastrous for the parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a lot of sense in those words. I do like the Button of 1979. I do not like the Button of 1981 quite so much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. He recognised the consequences of repetition of this kind of thinking. But apparently he thinks now that it is all right for the Labor Party to pursue such dangerous lines. In the same article he went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, it is necessary to remove the Senate's power over Supply. Secondly, it is necessary to remove its power to totally reject legislation and substitute for it the power to delay legislation for a limited period. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very interesting, is it not, to understand that he was then so objecting to the power over Supply that he would remove it; but now of course he would use that power, even though he uses it only over some of the money Bills. Then he wanted not to stop the power of rejection but merely to delay. Now of course we hear nothing on that line at all. Yet the views which Mr Wran, the Federal President of the Labor Party has expressed over the last few days indicate that in the Labor Party itself there is a great deal more care and worry about the exercise of those sorts of powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the Labor Party has discussed its new set of principles, or its principled course of action as Senator Evans calls it, was set out quite interestingly a few days ago in a personal explanation which Senator Evans made after Question Time. He felt that he had been misrepresented by an honourable senator. He stated that he did not mind being described by anybody as a man of principle, and I will not have any concern about that. But I think he will have to work hard to maintain that role as a man of principle, considering the way in which he went on to argue. He spoke of the way in which the Labor Party could perform and should perform in regard to Bills. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the one hand Bills which are crucial to the survival of a government, are matters of life and death so far as the existence of a government is concerned and, on the other, those which do not satisfy that description . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is very interesting. Apparently those Bills that Senator Evans finds are crucial are the ones which are not to be touched by the Senate, but if they are otherwise they may be. Who makes the judgment? The judgment is made by members of the Labor Party, Senator Evans; not the Government. They make the decisions on the Bills. </PARA>

Senator Evans went on to say that the Opposition could vote against a number of Bills. He said that there are Bills which should not be touched and perhaps also in that category of packages of Bills that are absolutely essential to the Government's existence are some major taxing Bills, for example, Bills to establish the whole system of personal income tax which accounts for 50 per cent or more of the Government's revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator must learn that he cannot turn to someone else having done something which he does not like as a justification for his changing his mind. Unfortunately, he wants us to give him his principles. But he has made up his mind on these things. The Opposition has gone on record about them time and again. I want to tell the Senate what the record says. On 3 July 1981 Senator Gareth Evans gave an address to the National Conference of Labor Lawyers in which he said some interesting things. He spoke of the temptation that would be coming before the Labor Party. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most obvious is the temptation to block Supply, in the unlikely event that numbers elsewhere were such as to make this a practical option. </PARA>
<PARA>We note that the numbers are not here for them to do it tonight. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that constitutional and democratic principles were torn up in 1975 is no excuse for anyone doing it again. </PARA>
<PARA>Remember that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> While there is a great deal to be said, tactically, for never ruling out completely any option, I believe that our credibility and self-respect as a movement depend on us being more principled--</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that Senator Gietzelt listen to this; it will be useful to him-</PARA>
<PARA>than our opponents, and that we would sadly demean both ourselves and our cause were we ever to descend to the Tories' level. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans does not want to come down to what he thinks is our level. He wants the Labor Party to stick to its own level, and I hope it will try. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Nor do I believe that the ALP should contribute its numbers in the Senate to the blocking of other kinds of legislative measures in respect of which the Government can reasonably claim some kind of express or implied electoral mandate. I acknowledge that a good deal of nonsense is talked by parties of all colours about electoral 'mandates'. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans is certainly quite correct about that, but the fact is that there is, of course, an implied mandate for a government so recently elected to then put before the people of this country a Budget which sets out the matters it wants to raise by tax in order to pay for the various programs it wants to carry out. It is not for the Opposition to come so hot-footed, after a defeat in an election, and tell the people that the Government is not entitled to claim the moneys to carry out the programs it insists upon. In this very interesting lecture, Senator Evans went on to say at page 3:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . generally I believe that it would be unwise for the ALP to oppose to the point of defeat Bills with which we disagree, unless there are quite clear grounds for claiming that the measure in question is not only obnoxious but one on which the electorate has had no opportunity to pass judgment at the previous election. To do otherwise is to revert to the law of the jungle that prevailed in 1972-5, when-quite apart from supply-more Bills were rejected or emasculated by the Senate than in the whole previous seven decades of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition probably wants to beat that record, and perhaps it has in mind that it would like to defeat a lot of Bills. However, it must bear in mind what the very able Senator Evans, who after all is the shadow Attorney-General, has suggested are the principles on which it should base its activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am afraid it would be reprehensible conduct-language which I seem to have heard before somewhere.

We all know where the Bourbons, who never learned anything and never forgot anything, come in. In the course of this editorial it is said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the simple reality is that to refuse a Government the power to levy whatever taxes it wishes within the limits of the Constitution is to deny it the power to govern in modern terms. The essence of modern government is economic policy, which involves the setting of levels of both expenditure and revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that is simply the fact. Surely it is also the fact that the Labor Party, in saying tonight that it will try to defeat the provisions, is doing something quite contrary to that. It is denying a government its right to its very existence. Opposition senators ought to be careful that the Labor Party is not so exposed by hypocrisy that it will lose all faith it has in its own community. The Labor Party has a platform. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coates says 'Hear, hear!' That is what the Labor Party wants to do. It is not distinguishing between Supply and money Bills. That is the most recent Button-like invention. In the course of the debate on this resolution, which went through, the Honourable Lionel Bowen spoke strongly about it. In showing that the lower House is the one which should be the House of Supply, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, it was clear, was it not, that the founding fathers of this knew there had to be some opportunity for the Senate to look and to make suggestions on the question of supply, but in all other respects, the Senate had complete power. You might advert to some of the debates of the 1890s, and you see there expressions such as these, 'There can be no two Houses of finance', 'There must always be the one House of finance', 'It has to be the House of the people, there can be no other House, otherwise it is disastrous', and they were the words used. </PARA>
<PARA>Now it appears that the Labor Party wants it to be also the House of finance. It wants to take the opportunity of changing the Budget and removing great slabs of it that are important to the Government, and important to its decisions. Unfortunately Senator Button has now gone, but he was at the Constitutional Convention and he spoke in support of the Whitlam motion, which referred so generally to these things. Of course, Senator Button was not there when the vote was taken; he was unaccountably missing. We had that experience during the voting last year on the Freedom of Information Bill. He sometimes disappears. Perhaps he was under a chair or something, but he was not there to be counted. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another important aspect of this because the Labor Party is now changing its tactics. Unfortunately, tonight it is not getting the support of the Australian Democrats. It is important that we bear in mind the new strategy which the Labor Party has been pursuing for a couple of years. It has been described as the Blewett strategy and is named after Dr Blewett, who is a distinguished member of the other House. This strategy has been described in an article by Patrick O'Brien entitled 'Constitutional Conflict in Australia'. He speaks about the discussion paper, which I have here. The discussion paper, which Dr Blewett prepared, is headed 'Dunstan shows the way in constitution reform', and it appears in Labor Forum. According to the article, in the discussion paper Dr Blewett advocated:</PARA>
<PARA>'a unitary constitution in that indisputable legal authority will be vested in a popularly elected national assembly'. This is necessary in his view since 'elected national majorities and the pursuit of the national interest are constantly frustrated by the diffusion of power under a federal system'. Therefore, 'federal Labor must seize any opportunity that will serve the long-term goal (of a unitary state), even if there are short-term political gains to the enemy'. He added that 'any proposals which contribute to Labor's strategy should be accepted, however soiled their initiators, and however Labor's opponents may gain in the short term'. He added that 'the ALP should avoid spelling out the goals in minute detail, so that the party leaders can seize the opportunities of the moment to advance their basic strategy'. </PARA>
<PARA>So it can be seen that those sort of tactics are being used by the Labor Party, and that is why it is now twisting and turning and changing its strategy and saying: 'Yes, this Senate should throw back money Bills'. Let me say that there are other ways. I want to quote from the book Senator Evans' edited entitled 'Law, Politics and the Labor Movement'. When referring to constitutional strategy for 1981 he pointed out one of the measures that should be taken. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>As has been suggested earlier, one of the first measures of a Labor government could be an Appropriations Bill providing for the basic costs of government (with an inflation clause) for three years. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that we should cut out Parliament and have an appropriation covering three years. He and Dr Blewett hoped they would have the opportunity of controlling the finances if they had gained government at the last election. That was the tactic which they had in mind. </PARA>

<PARA> These specific guidelines-</PARA>
<PARA>which he spelt out-</PARA>
<PARA>need to be spelt out in relation to two specific challenges or threats posed by a conservative majority in the Senate: first, senatorial mutilation of Labor's legislative program; secondly, a senatorial veto over supply and thus over the continued existence of a Labor government. These two challenges are likely to be sequential: mutilation of Labor's program is likely from the outset; an actual challenge to the existence of a Labor government is unlikely to occur within the first year. </PARA>
<PARA>We can see happening here the desire to do the very opposite. The Labor Party has not gained government so it wants to see the mutilation of a Budget which has come before us. It wants to take away the things which the Fraser Government needs so that it does not have the money to do what it feels it needs to do in the community. Then, later on, when it is frustrated, there will be a challenge. Consequently, the Labor Party's newly exposed idea, which is coming unstuck tonight, is one which we must expect. </PARA>

As Senator Mason pointed out tonight, the Australian Democrats have made a declaration that they will not use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of Supply or money Bills in a manner that would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. I suggest that that is a consistent attitude that ought to be taken by the Opposition senators on both sides.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is a machinery Bill. It is designed to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952 which prescribes the charges payable in respect of the use by aircraft of aerodromes, air route and airway facilities, meteorological services and search and rescue services maintained, operated or provided by the Commonwealth. The purpose of the Bill is to vary the rates of air navigation charges-ANCs-payable for aircraft operating in all sectors of the aviation industry. It is proposed that the variations should be effective from 1 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The variations proposed in the rate of ANCs are to reduce the rates applicable to the international sector by 5 per cent; to increase the rates applicable to the domestic airline sector by 12 1/2 per cent; to increase the rates applicable to the regional airline sector by 25 per cent; and to increase the rates applicable to the general aviation sectors by 20 per cent. If these proposals are acceptable to the Parliament, it is estimated that revenue to be earned by the Commonwealth from ANCs in 1981-82 will, together with payments made in that year for 1980-81 operations, total $115.76m. This compares with the $95.89m received from ANCs in 1980-81. Further, the levels of increase proposed for the domestic airlines should have a minimal effect on air fares as they should increase airline costs by about 1 per cent for regional airlines and about 0.5 per cent for domestic trunk airlines. The impact on total costs faced by general aviation operators is also expected to be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that since 1961 the Government has had a policy for the eventual full recovery of the costs properly attributable to the air transport industry for providing and maintaining the aviation infrastructure. Full recovery of attributable costs was first achieved in 1975-76 in respect of the international sector. While this sector has continued to be fully recovered, the rates of ANCs for international operations have not been varied since 1 December 1976. Further, in the 1980-81 Budget, the Government announced that over recovery in this area should be credited to the cost recovery program and applied to the development of the aviation infrastructure. The Government has decided that there should be a reduction of 5 per cent in the rate of ANCs for international operators effective from 1 October 1981. While there will be over recovery in this sector, the Government re-affirms its 1980-81 decision on the treatment to be afforded over recovery from this sector of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted also that the Australian charges for international operations compare more than favourably with those imposed overseas when the comparison is made on the same basis. Australia, unlike most overseas countries, imposes a composite fee which covers landing fees, parking fees, terminal air traffic control and en-route aids and services et cetera. Overseas, these elements are often the subject of separate charges which can be raised by different authorities, and in some cases they may vary accordingly. Honourable senators will recall that in the 1981 airlines agreement, the Commission and the company recognised that the Commonwealth is entitled to fully recover its infrastructure costs. Both airlines agreed to facilitate the implementation of measures designed to achieve this objective. Their agreement was subject to the proviso that, allowing for minor variations between the years, the Commonwealth did not seek to recover more than 100 per cent of its costs. Moreover, to achieve this objective, the agreement does not limit the level of ANCs which the Commonwealth may impose. The decision taken by Government to increase the rates of ANCs for the domestic trunk airline sector by 12 1/2 per cent is in accord with the agreement and should result in a recovery rate approaching 100 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government decided that there would be no change in the level of air navigation charges for both the regional airline and general aviation sectors. These charges, however, were to be reviewed in the light of the study of the general aviation sector. As honourable senators will know, the Government has not accepted the cost recovery recommendations of that study, although the rate of charges will continue to be reviewed annually. The Government has decided to increase the rate of air navigation charges by 25 per cent and 20 per cent for the regional airline and general aviation sectors respectively. These rates of increase should result in similar rates of recovery to those achieved in 1980-81 for those sectors. For the information of honourable senators, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a paper setting out the cost recovery rates for the civil aviation industry by sectors and in total for the ten years commencing 1970-71. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the interruption by Senator Peter Baume to introduce several Bills the Senate was supposed to be debating the 1981-82 Budget. Having listened to Senator Missen one could be excused for thinking otherwise because the honourable senator did not deal with the subject matter before the Senate. He in no way set out to defend the Budget brought into this Parliament on Tuesday of last week. He set out to discuss matters outside the Budget considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to deflect from my criticism of the Budget other than to say that it is a pity that the speech Senator Missen made this evening was not made during 1974 and 1975 when on numerous occasions he was prevailed upon to cast his vote to deny the Australian Labor Party money Bills and Supply, occasioning two premature elections following two double dissolutions of the Parliament. Instead, of course, he lectured the Senate this evening about the righteousness that the Labor Party ought to have in respect of the way it deals with its responsibilities to the Australian people. He sought to defend his Government and his party's attitude. That attitude was restated as late as last week when Prime Minister Fraser again went on the public record saying that he would do again in 1983 what he did in 1975 when he assumed the leadership of the Liberal Party, when Senator Missen, Mr Fraser and the current Speaker of the House of Representatives, Bill Snedden, moved to defer and defeat money Bills and deny Supply, measures which were essential to the Labor Government's mandate and operation during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite hypocritical of Senator Missen to ignore the fact that he was one of those who denied the Labor Government the money Bill in respect of the Medibank levy, which was part of the Budget strategy for 1975. For him to say that the Labor Party in the Senate ought to recognise the basic principle that the Senate ought not deny to the majority party in the House of Representatives its mandate to rule leaves me virtually speechless. It is hard to believe that a person of his stature in the Parliament can come into this place and suggest that there is something wrong with the Labor Party's attitude when all we have sought from the Liberal and National Country parties is determination that they will not repeat the events of 1974-75, that they will put to the Australian people a referendum which if accepted would enable us to avoid the disasterous events of those years when a government that was given a mandate in December 1972 had to face the people three times in an attempt to stay in office. Mr Fraser is not prepared to give that undertaking to the Labor Party and to the nation. It seems that Senator Missen ought to be raising that question in his own party room and not lecturing the Labor Party about how its members should behave in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are sickened by the manner in which Senator Missen referred to the approach of several of my colleagues to this matter in public debates about problems occasioned by the attitude taken by those who claim the right to rule and uphold the born to rule concept that is so much part of the conservatives of this country. When my colleagues seek in various other public forums to debate these issues their comments are supposedly used to decry the Labor Party's current attitude in respect to the sales tax Bills which will shortly be before the Senate. Any decision that the Australian Democrats take will rest on their shoulders. It has to be said that the Labor Party had a mandate in 1972 to introduce a universal health scheme and it was frustrated by the conservatives in this place. The Liberal Party and the National Country Party do not have a mandate for indirect taxation; quite the contrary, as I will show. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, specifically spelt out that in no way would the Government introduce a new form of commodity tax or retail tax or any other form of indirect taxation during the life of the third Fraser Ministry. I was surprised, saddened and sickened by the hypocrisy of Senator Missen tonight when he devoted the whole of his half-hour speech to attacks on the Labor Party's attitude to a new form of taxation which will affect the underprivileged people in our community and said absolutely nothing about the Budget itself. I will leave the matter at that because I want to speak about the disastrous Budget that has been brought in for the consideration of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Budgets, as we know, do not themselves control the economic conditions of the country. This is especially true for a government like the present one which spreads its economic decisions and announcements over a period. This is particularly so when we think of what the Government has done in recent months-the razor gang's cuts, the recent interest rate changes and the health scheme changes announced earlier this year. All these factors have their effect upon the economy and upon the daily life of people. Nevertheless, the Opposition considers that the Budget remains as a major statement on and enaction of the Government's economic philosophy and its attitude to the Australian people. With the 1981 Budget the Fraser Government has shown clearly that it has a contempt for the people and a callous disregard for their welfare. With this Budget this Government has shown that it is once again determined to ignore the problems of housing, education, welfare and health and the needs of most Australian families. It has shown an utter contempt for the legitimate demands of young people for employment and real unemployment relief. It has shown that the dire poverty faced by the homeless, by invalid pensioners, by Aborigines and by others does not even figure in its scale of concern in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Liberal and National Country Party Government has shown again that it is concerned with the demands of the wealthy corporate sector. It has shown that it is determined to continue the policy of redistributing wealth to this sector away from the ordinary Australians and those in need. This Government has shown that it will maintain a campaign against wages while remaining lax about profits. It will increase the tax burden on wage and salary earners while easing it on company profits. While dampening down overall economic growth, the Government continues to welcome largely speculative and inflationary foreign capital inflow on a huge and increasing scale. The needs of the people are being pushed aside to encourage foreign speculators in an uneven, unplanned development of resources, a squeezing out of local manufacturing industry, a pushing aside of the public sector. The vast majority of Australians are being forced to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the main features of the Government's economic policy as expressed in this Budget. In its summary of economic conditions and outlook in Budget Paper No. 1 the Treasury identifies 'the much heralded resource-based investment boom' as the key in the development of the Australian economy. The Treasurer himself notes that 'the resources investment boom is now proceeding apace'. It is undoubtedly responsible for a major portion of the $6,500m foreign capital inflow in 1980-81. Much has been made of this resource boom and its supposed benefit to Australia. But we had an unusual statement from the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, on Friday when he dealt with the problems of this so-called boom. He was critical of the fact that the Australian people had had their expectations raised by the boom. He said that the effects it would have on the Australian economy were being overestimated. Firstly, it is highly inflationary. Sources, which are as conservative as stockbrokers Bryan Moore Day and Journeaux, have noted this. So too has the business journal Business Review Weekly. In an article this week on resource development Stuart Simpson said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's rhetoric on the boom also fuelled the expectations of foreign investors. The extensive overseas PR campaign by Government Ministers over the last three years rubbed off in 1980-81 with the huge capital inflow . . . The money supply overshot and the Government resorted to the shock tactics of a rapidly appreciating currency and big interest-rate hikes. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, with the rundown in local manufacturing and this capital inflow it further slots Australia into a dependent position in the international economy. I think that is a regressive step. Thirdly, it involves a major dislocation of industry, development and the work force. The article in the Business Review Weekly had this to say on this matter:</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to see how the gains from the development could be uniformly spread. Of the $33,000m (in resource investment by October 1980) two thirds is mining and one third manufacturing. Three quarters of the manufacturing investment is in the aluminium, alumina and bauxite areas . . . Nearly half of the mining investment is in oil and gas, the bulk of which is associated with the North West Shelf project. A similar proportion is in coal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Business Review Weekly went on to explain what this means in terms of deformed regional development. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The investment activity is concentrated outside the more populous States. NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and SA would . . . get at least 25 per cent less of the investment than if the investment was spread uniformly. Victoria will get only 28 per cent of its fair share, but Western Australia will receive nearly four times more investment than its population share, and Queensland nearly double. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary this resources boom will not benefit the mass of Australians. At least Mr Anthony has had the courage to say so. It should be made very clear that the Australian Labor Party seeks to encourage a viable mining and mineral processing industry in this country. But this cannot be at the expense of our welfare programs and policies or of our manufacturing industry. It must be allowed to develop alongside these things in a planned and proper way. Yet this Budget pushes aside these needs to welcome uneven foreign investment and speculation. This is the reality behind the words of the Treasurer when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget will curb public sector demands on real resources at a time when those resources are being keenly sought . . . by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>In reality this is what the Treasury sought to establish when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . on the assumption that appropriate domestic economic policies are pursued, the current account deficit should again be readily financed by capital inflow. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, provided spending on services to the public is cut, wages are depressed and the social wage is slashed, we can allow this inflow of inflationary capital. These are important matters for the future of our society, for the living standards of our people and for the proper development of our community. Yet not a word was said about this by Senator Missen and other honourable senators on the Government side in their contributions to this very important debate. It looks as though those who are waiting for the boom to benefit the vast majority of people had better think again-that is the advice of Mr Anthony-because under this Government there seems no chance that this development will be planned and co-ordinated to meet social need. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at taxation in respect of the current Budget. Both direct and indirect taxation remain a major weapon for the use of the Government in this process of unfair redistribution of wealth. As leader writers in many newspapers have noted, this Budget is again a high taxing Budget. The hypocrisy of Mr Fraser and his colleagues is almost beyond belief. They claim time and again to be in favour of reducing taxes and cutting so-called big government, yet add burden upon burden to the average weekly income. That is so particularly in respect of the wide ranging number of goods that will be affected by the sales tax proposition. Clearly, this Budget emphasises that the Fraser-Anthony Government is a high tax government. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year we saw the introduction, for example, of the petrol pump tax in the form of the oil levy. In April this year the Treasurer announced that the Liberal Party election promise of half tax indexation reiterated by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) only six months before was to be abandoned, and that, to use the Treasurer's words:</PARA>
<PARA> In future, taxation adjustments are to be determined on a discretionary basis having regard to economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he says: 'We will give you tax assistance when we want your votes.' If that is not a form of corruption I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the most disgusting indignity of all. On March 12 this year, Mr Howard stated that the Government would not proceed-I point this out to the Australian Democrat senators-with a new broadly-based indirect tax 'without providing a noticeable offset in personal tax reductions'. For a party that was elected and given support on the basis of keeping the bastards honest, the Australian Democrats are letting down the side by suggesting that they will take a course of action which will lead to the Senate making a request of the House of Representatives to make certain amendments in respect of the Bills on sales tax and that when the Federal Government says it will not play ball, we, on this side of the House, will meekly accept that decision. That, in my view, is not keeping the bastards honest. </PARA>
<PARA> Indirect taxation has skyrocketed in the form of the new sales tax levels announced in the Budget. This over-the-shop-counter tax-that is what it is; it is a broadly-based retail tax-will net the Government an extra $892m in a full year out of the pockets of Australian consumers. I stress the matter of taxation measures in the Budget. This is a Budget which has been described by Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association as the worst he has seen in 34 years. This only adds emphasis to the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) last night in the House of Representatives when he said that it is the worst Budget he has seen in 20 years and is one which, by its taxation measures alone, will increase the cost of living by over 2 per cent this year. So much for a government pledged to an anti-inflationary policy. These taxation measures are important because they place the extra burden upon consumers, the ordinary people buying ordinary goods and not on Mr Fraser's wealthy friends and financial backers. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures can only result in a real drop in consumer spending adding to the problems of an economic downturn. One only has to read the financial comments by persons who have no association with the Australian Labor Party, by people who are normally the backers of this Government, to see the criticism that they are making against this Government's sales tax proposition. On Budget night, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the new revenue proposals which I shall announce tonight will help to broaden the tax base and this . . . will enhance the potential for further personal income tax relief in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>Does the Treasurer really believe that we will be fooled by this double talk? Does the Treasurer really believe that the Australian people can be fooled by having their living standards reduced by these forms of taxation? There has been a vast increase in pay-as-you-earn taxation; there has been an imposition of new taxes on commodities. Does he really believe that we will accept his words which are so contrary to what he said in past Budgets and in pre-election periods, that we will be able to have income tax relief in future years. Does he really think that we cannot see that the small tax handouts that he may give us in a few years time-perhaps just before the next election-will be, in reality, swamped by the huge tax ripoff that he is taking from us now. One newspaper observer noted:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not concerned to stay honest-it is worrying about how best to perform conjuring tricks with the taxpayers' money so he can be made to think he is getting tax relief when he is just paying out in another, less open way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2201) Senator Evans asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity both as Attorney-General and as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The question concerned possible amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948, in particular to those provisions determining citizenship by reference to the person who is the 'responsible parent' described as the father in most circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Citizenship Act 1948 defines the responsible parent of a child as 'the father of that child, or, where the father is dead or the mother has been given the custody of the child by order of a court or the child was born out of wedlock and resides with the mother, means the mother of that child'.</PARA>
<PARA> A review of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 is currently being underaken and, in the course of that review, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has asked for amendments to be prepared in order to eliminate any provisions which now discriminate on the ground of sex.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs have been instructed that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is prepared to use discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to approve the grant of citizenship to children where he is satisfied that the child is in the custody of the mother applying for him or her to become an Australian citizen and where the child would be at a disadvantage if he or she were not granted citizenship.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2797) Senator Watson asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs monitoring the import of textiles and textile goods from New Zealand? If so, is the Department aware of certain dumping practices, especially in the woollen worsted yarn area? I cite the case of twofold 22s worsted, which has a domestic price in New Zealand of $14.97 and which sells in Australia for $10.40, plus or minus 30c. The same Australian produced yarn sells for $12.40. Is the Minister aware that imports of worsteds, excluding handknits and woollens other than handknits, and carpet yarns, rose from 170,495 kilos in 1979 to 359,435 in 1980? I ask:</PARA>
<PARA> What effect is this having on the local industry? Will the Minister take this into account when negotiating the free trade deal wih New Zealand?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs is not currently monitoring imports of textiles and textile goods from New Zealand, although it is aware of an increase in the volume of imports of woollen worsted yarns in the period 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has not received any complaint from the local spinning industry concerning alleged dumping of worsted woollen yarns or similar goods from New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Before the Department can initiate an anti-dumping investigation it is necessary for the appropriate Australian industry to submit a formal complaint substantiating, prima facie, that imports of the subject goods have been made at dumped prices and that these dumped goods have caused, are causing or are threatening material injury to an Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA> If, following a formal complaint, the Department accepts that a prima facie case exists, the New Zealand Government authorities would be notified and the Australian Customs Representatives in New Zealand would conduct the necessary inquiries to establish the normal values for the goods in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> Should these inquiries confirm that exports have been made to Australia at dumped or subsidised prices the provisions of Article 10 of the New Zealand/Australia Free Trade Agreement would be invoked and Australia/New Zealand Government consultations to resolve the dispute instituted.</PARA>
<PARA> During negotiations with New Zealand concerning the development of a closer economic relationship between the two countries, the Australian Government has taken account of the interests of Australian industry as a whole as well as consulting with industries most likely to be affected by a closer relationship. Negotiations with New Zealand have not yet been completed, but any closer economic relationship which might evolve would be expected to bring benefits to both countries.</PARA>
