<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that no implementation details have yet been decided, nor any effects calculated, of the Prime Minister's announced decision of 12 August to drop the 'Buy Australian' policy in government purchasing. How does the Government reconcile this decision with its frequent advocacy of development of high technology industries in Australia, such as the computer industry which was specifically referred to as an example in a speech by the Minister for Science and Technology in July. Does the United States, by contrast, apply a 50 per cent national duty on all imported high technology bought by the United States Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that in fact the Government has stated that its announced policy would have only marginal influence on the overall question of purchases and that financially the effect would be very limited. I will get the actual figures and let the Senate have them. The aim of this Government is to encourage the growth of industries in high technology by higher productivity and by lower inflation in Australia. That is why our thrust is towards beating inflation and getting industries efficient by world standards. For the first time in many years we are capable of trading outwards in effective competition with the world outside. It is present Government policies that have done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a relatively minor matter. Nothing can compare with the decision in 1974-75 of the then Labor Government to cut tariffs by 25 per cent across the board-a blunt instrument which exposed the manufacturing industries of Australia to a violent cold air. In fact in the space of one year directly as a result of that decision 130,000 people lost their jobs. One must get these things into perspective. The really blunt instruments are those which Labor has used in the past. The fine honing which leads to more efficient industries and greater employment, as is being evidenced today, is being done by this Government.</PARA>

Will the Minister investigate this matter with a view to Australia providing these essential items of machinery so that this factory can again operate and provide sustenance for countless starving children in that country?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to a question I asked on 4 June this year in relation to invalid pension appeals. I also refer to a letter which the Minister subsequently wrote to me confirming that where an invalid pension is terminated three months notice of termination is given. I ask: If an appeal is still pending at the expiration of those three months, is the invalid pension still terminated? If so, is it just that a pension should be terminated before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal has made a decision on the pensioner's appeal?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston has asked me a series of questions about invalid pension appeals. Only yesterday I signed a letter advising him that I had just received advice from the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, with respect to the delays in medical assessments, about which Senator Colston has expressed concern. The Minister advised me that with changes in staffing arrangements medical assessments have been brought right up to date and are being done on the same day as the applications are received. I am very pleased to advise the honourable senator publicly on that aspect of the matters he has been raising with me. He correctly stated, in terms of my earlier response, that where an invalid pension is terminated a period of grace of three months is permitted in which an appeal can be heard. Quite frankly, I am not aware whether, after three months, if the appeal is still pending, the invalid pension is continued or there is a move to sickness benefit. I should have that information but I do not. I will get it for the honourable senator as soon as possible. The point I am making is that there is a continuing right to benefit. I am not sure whether it continues as an invalid pension or sickness benefit in the circumstances he has outlined, but I will check that and give him a firm reply, if possible during today's Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Will he indicate the present and future prospects of the phosphate mining industry in Australia? To what extent may taxation or other incentives be necessary to produce the contribution that will be needed in this field in the grazing and agricultural industries in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="379" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will know that Australia is fortunate in having large phosphate rock deposits in north-western Queensland. However, only a small proportion is of direct shipping grade. In the past, one of the problems was that those who produce superphosphate for use in Australia argued that it was not suitable for milling and crushing by existing plants. The Western Mining Corporation, which now controls the Duchess deposits, announced recently that its subsidiary, Queensland Phosphate Ltd, will recommence mining on a small scale, at the rate of, as I understand it, 200,000 wet tonnes per annum. This is an important step in re-establishing the presence of Duchess rock in both local and overseas markets. Now that these deposits are to be reopened I believe it is particularly important for continuing progress to be made in developing the lower grade rock, which makes up the bulk of these deposits, as it could give Australia the opportunity to become self-sufficient in time by utilising our known reserves. An acceptable basis for beneficiation on a large scale has yet to be proven up, and field testing of the economics of upgrading techniques is expected in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Scott referred to the matter of Government assistance. It is my understanding that the Western Mining Corporation is looking to develop the deposits on a commercial basis. Nevertheless, the Government will be looking at this matter continuously. The Government wants to be sure that Australia has, for the long term future, a source of rock for its phosphate industry so that agriculture can have an abundance of the basis for superphosphate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is actually addressed to a Minister of the Government, the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. I refer the Minister to my question without notice of 2 June 1981 concerning the prolonged delay experienced in waiting for the Federal and Queensland governments to reach agreement on the boundaries of the Cairns section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Given that the delay in declaring the section now stretches to more than eight months, I ask the Minister: Firstly, what reasons can be given for the prolonged delay in declaring the Cairns section? Secondly, is one of the prime reasons for the delay the dissatisfaction of the Queensland Government with the boundaries proposed by the Federal Government? Thirdly, when will the reconstituted Commonwealth-State Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meet to discuss the boundaries of the Cairns section? Fourthly, will the Minister assure the Senate that consideration will be given by the Government to using the powers vested in it under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act so as to expedite the development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen's question is in four parts. I can answer some of it but I do not think I can answer the last part. I remind the Senate that the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meeting that was scheduled for 7 November 1980, was postponed because the Queensland election was pending. Since that time, because of the new Queensland Government it has been necessary to take the steps required to reconvene the Council. I am advised that since that time Queensland has nominated its members to the Ministerial Council. I understand that they are to be the Honourable M. J. Ahern and the Honourable J. A. Elliott and that, in fact, steps have now been taken to reconvene the Ministerial Council. Mr Wilson, the Minister whom I represent in the Senate, as convener of the Council has recently had consultations with the Minister for Science and Technology and with the Queensland Ministers. The fourth meeting of the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council is to be held in the very near future, I think some time during or towards the end of September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So I can say that those are the reasons for the prolonged delay. I do not know that one of the reasons is any dissatisfaction by the Queensland Government with the boundaries proposed. I do not think that has come into it. I think I have answered the third part of the question. I have given an indication of when the reconstituted Ministerial Council will meet. I think the fourth part of the question asked by the honourable senator, about the use of Commonwealth powers, may be premature at this stage and is certainly premature until the Ministerial Council has met and attempted to reach agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware of the fact that needless economic hardship is being caused to many couples because the Taxation Office takes a different moral attitude to de facto relationships from that held by other government departments, most notably the Department of Social Security? Is the Minister aware of the fact that, because section 159J (3) (c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act defines a 'spouse of the taxpayer' as a person 'married to the taxpayer', the Commissioner of Taxation is able to, if not actually forced to, penalise individuals who are in receipt of married benefits or pensions from the Department of Social Security-a department which pays the unemployment benefit, for example, at the married rate regardless of whether the relationship is a bona fide de facto one or an allegedly legal married one? Finally, will the Minister undertake to seek to remove this anomaly, by which one government department is able to give while another one takes away, by amending the relevant section of the taxation Act to allow for a spouse rebate for people in de facto relationships?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Treasurer is aware that there are different requirements in the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social Services Act with regard to marital status. I do not believe that the Treasurer or the Minister for Social Security would regard the differences as being related to moral judgments that might be made. This question has arisen on a number of occasions. It is not a question that can be answered as simply as might be suggested in the last part of Senator Haines's question. There are different requirements. I notice that she has suggested removing the anomaly in a certain way. Other people make other suggestions. However, to change the Income Tax Assessment Act in the way in which she has suggested would involve considerable cost. On the other hand, those who suggest that the Social Services Act ought to be changed to bring it into line with the Income Tax Assessment Act would also realise that there are social consequences attached to that. This is not a new matter. It has had some consideration. But I have no statement to make on it at present.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. Although I hesitate to ask a question about Telecom Australia, I feel I should. When increased telephone charges for public phones were being considered was any thought given to increasing the charge to 15c rather than to 20c, which would be more in keeping with public telephone costs in other countries? Was the increase to 20c chosen because the Japanese-made green telephone machines can take only 10c or 20c coins? I think I have seen some that take 50c coins in some areas. Will certain of the public phones that are now being used be made obsolete by this increase? Will the 20c charge mean that we will perhaps see more public phones throughout this country? Finally, has Telecom examined the possibility of producing and installing a less expensive type of public telephone, as is done in many other countries, particularly the United States of America and Canada, so that we can have more public phones throughout this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provision of public telephones, of course, is something which is regarded very highly by people who need the communication facility and who do not have their own telephone. It is some years since the cost of making a public call was last increased. I think that if that period is any indication it may well be some time before the cost is increased again. This increase may carry us over a fairly long period. I am not able to advise the honourable senator whether any requirement within the equipment itself-I take it that that is what he was asking-was a factor in the level of charge being set as it was. I will put that question to my colleague, the Minister whom I represent. I will also put to him the other questions which relate in a more technical fashion to matters of design and choice of equipment for public telephone services.

It relates to the Nabarlek mishap and pollution of the Alligator Rivers system. In view of what is said on page 25 of the first report from the Supervising Scientist, where he conveyed the impression that he could not predict what was likely to happen with unauthorised water releases, will the Minister consider two proposals? The first is that the Supervising Scientist and the managing director of Nabarlek be brought before the Bar of the Senate. If that is too utopian an idea to the Minister's mind, will he make arrangements and delegate any necessary authority so that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment can be sent to Darwin, with the authority of the Senate, and have both those gentlemen appear before it to indicate what was inadequate in the legislation, which we were told was to be the best in the world and would avoid the very thing that happened?

I suggest that a more appropriate course is that the contents of the honourable senator's question be made known to the Minister, and that we await the completion of the Minister's own inquiries and any statement he might wish to make. At that stage it may be appropriate to pursue the matter further if there are matters remaining unresolved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Social Security to enlarge upon a reference to crisis accommodation for families contained in his statement of 18 August, in which he said that he 'in association with the Minister for Housing will be taking up with the States the development of a special program', for which I believe there was an allocation of $2m. Is it intended that this special program will cater for families in the narrow and nuclear sense, or will it embrace all groups which include dependants, such as those currently sheltered in women's refuges? In view of the attitude of the Western Australian Government to refuge funding, as exemplified by this week's news of the arbitrary cessation of financial assistance to the Emmaus refuge, will the Minister seriously reconsider the pre-Budget request from a wide range of organisations to retain Federal management of such funds under a special women's services program?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="382" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not heard of the Emmaus refuge matter to which the honourable senator refers. With respect to the particular matters raised in her question, I say that the Budget included a commitment to allocate the first moneys to a program of crisis accommodation for families. That followed an election commitment to do something in that area in conjunction with the States. Since the transfer to the States of the funds of the Community Health Program, under which women's refuges were funded, the responsibility for the funding of such refuges has shifted to the States. Previously the program was funded jointly by the Commonwealth and the States. In light of the variety of programs which relate to emergency accommodation, the Government believes that in the course of implementing its commitment to do something about crisis accommodation for families it should examine the range of crisis accommodation programs to see whether there would be value in having a more integrated program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one examines what exists at the moment around Australia one finds that a substantial contribution to crisis accommodation is made by State housing authorities. A relatively small contribution is made through the family support services. Those elements of crisis accommodation tend to be available both to what I think were referred to by the honourable senator as families in the narrow nuclear sense and to single parent families. There are also elements of crisis accommodation in the Youth Services Scheme, a joint Commonwealth-State arrangement which is aimed specifically at providing crisis accommodation for the young. Elements of crisis accommodation are provided also under the Commonwealth's Homeless Persons Assistance Act program, which provides funds generally to voluntary organisations over quite a wide range. In that regard, major organisations such as the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul are prominent, as are many other private organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to women's refuges, substantial representations were made following the transfer to the States of the Community Health Program. The Prime Minister met a number of delegations. I saw various representatives of the refuge groups and Mr MacKellar, the Minister for Health, who had been responsible for the funding of the Program, also saw representatives of those groups. The net result of all that was that the Prime Minister indicated that our discussions with respect to crisis accommodation generally would encompass that area as well as other areas of crisis accommodation with a view to ascertaining whether an integrated program could be devised.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the matter raised by the honourable senator, I would not expect any change in the attitude of the Commonwealth to the funding of women's refuges in advance of the discussions that I have indicated. There has been no argument about the value of, and need for, women's refuges. The funds available for that purpose have not been cut. In fact, they have been transferred to the States and I have little or no doubt that continued funding of those refuges will be provided by the States. I would not expect to be able to answer in the Senate specific questions with respect to problems that relate to particular refuges. They were never within the administration of my Department. They were within the administration of the Department of Health. In any event, they will not be within the direct administrative responsibility of any Commonwealth department.</PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that from time to time in the course of the development of women's refuges there have been difficulties with respect to the funding of particular refuges. These have sometimes arisen from the attitude of refuges to government supervision of the expenditure of funds. Disputes have arisen, for example, in Victoria about whether refuges should disclose their whereabouts and so on. I undertake to refer matters raised in this manner to the appropriate State department for reply direct to the honourable senator.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that I was not familiar with the history of Queenscliff, nor was I familiar with the first incumbent postmaster; but I am now quite attracted to visiting Queenscliff following Senator Lewis's enthusiastic endorsement of the district. I believe that at the end of July an item appeared in a Melbourne newspaper in which the Victorian State Secretary of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union was reported as saying that Australia Post intended to close some 70 post offices throughout Victoria in the next 18 months. I understand that the names of the post offices were listed and I can only presume that the post office to which the honourable senator now refers was included in that list, and that that gave rise to some concern within the area-as I understand it, Geelong too far away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that the recent decision of the committee on the Review of Commonwealth Functions is that contracting is to be further extended to the private sector where practical. It is true also that there have been staff ceiling reductions in staffing available for the Australian Postal Commission in anticipation that some of those reductions will take place. However, I am advised that Australia Post does not intend closing the post offices mentioned in that article. If the Queenscliff post office was one mentioned in that article, I can say that I am advised that Australia Post does not intend to close it. It is considering only a change in the method of operation, changing some of the post offices from official to non-official status. It has been put to me that some economies can be achieved by operating small post offices under non-official conditions rather than as official post offices. It may be confusion on this point which has given rise to concern. I hope that we can allay that concern of the constituents whom Senator Lewis so ably represents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Social Security: Why, amongst all the aspects of the new health scheme which can be criticised as far as public availability of knowledge is concerned, is the Government deliberately not publicising the fact that an applicant has the right to request that additional health cards be issued to his or her spouse and children instead of having only a single card for the whole family? Why does an applicant, having gone through all the hurdles of finding out about the scheme and completing an application form, knowing that he can request multiple cards for the whole family, then have to justify that request?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="384" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to be a bit of internal inconsistency in the question asked by Senator Coates. He started off by saying that the cards are available and asked why we are not publicising the fact. He then suggested that there is some hurdle in the way of getting them. I do not have an instant recall on all the material which has been put out with respect to the health scheme. I suppose that the more detail one includes the more criticism one is going to attract for not having information which is clear and concise. Certainly I have not understood it to be any secret that cards are available to dependants of people who are entitled to cards. I will examine the material available to see whether reference is made to that. It is certainly a matter which has been drawn to my attention on frequent occasions and has been very evident to me. I was not under any impression that it was not evident to members of the public who might be interested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reference to hurdles by Senator Coates is part of a series of complaints which have been made by the Opposition about this scheme. I remind the Senate that we are replacing a scheme which depends upon the individual judgment of doctors-a judgment which, from the complaints I have received over the years, varies considerably from doctor to doctor-with a scheme where people who are entitled will know that they are entitled and will have something which is clear and demonstrable. The bulk of the people who are entitled will receive without any effort at all a clear indication of their entitlement. The existing pensioner health beneficiaries have always had to apply for their cards, and I have never heard of any great complaints about that being such a problem. Indeed, the main problem with respect to the pensioner health card, as far as I can tell from the representations I receive, is that everybody would like one. So I am not quite sure what is deficient about the pensioner health card. It seems to be very popular.</PARA>
<PARA> We are now ensuring that the unemployed, the new migrants, and so on, will automatically receive a similar card. I have no doubt that that will be a valued thing as far as they are concerned. It is only with respect to those Australians who are on low incomes, within the benefits which have been set, that there is a requirement that they apply. The scheme is geared so that if those people neglect to apply-we expect that a substantial proportion will do so, for the simple reason that often those people are the last to take advantage of the provisions which are available to them-they will be able to get ex post facto entitlement to a card. It will be possible for them to get the card to cover a period for which they have not had cover because they have not made an application. Despite the rather carping criticisms which have been made by the Opposition, I believe the new scheme is one which will ensure that a larger number of Australians will have a sense of security in this area than was previously the case.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I indicated that one of the major effects of attempts to stop the flow of uranium ore from Australia would be that many countries in the free world would not be able to get an energy balance and that there would be a shrinking of living standards which would lead to a threat not only to economic stability but also to political stability. The International Energy Agency has made it clear that the world cannot get an energy balance without significant resort to uranium. So, those who seek to stop the flow of uranium to other countries, under the strongest safeguards there are for peacetime use, must take the heavy responsibility for saying to the world outside: 'Go about your business. You can go without the energy which is necessary to maintain your living standards'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some difficulty in shipping uranium out of Darwin. Members of the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation sought to frustrate the export of uranium. As honourable senators will know, a shipment of uranium did leave Darwin in early July. Let me make it clear that the Government's firm commitment is to the mining and export of uranium. We make this commitment quite clearly on the understanding that the world outside will need uranium in order to get its electric power.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If those who seek to interject oppose this action they are taking the stance that they are willing to deny to the world a source of energy for which there is no alternative-none at all. When the Government decided in 1977 to permit the development of the uranium industry it did so in the light of a balanced evaluation of all these factors. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry made clear that it would be safe to proceed with the mining and milling of uranium and that the generation of electric power by this means was quite within the safeguards provisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent and there are thousands of people currently employed directly or indirectly in the uranium industry. We have in Australia a handful of militants seeking to deny jobs to Australians and to deny energy to the world. This is a very serious situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is talk, of course, of the dangers with regard to uranium, and so there are if the appropriate safeguards are not undertaken. But those who raise this aspect never query the even greater danger of threat to health if this world is polluted by immense expansion of the use of coal. Country after country today is facing the situation that the use of coal will create an acid rain. That would bring about a change in the ecology of this world and have a profound effect upon the health of the people. It is ideological and not rational to choose one against the other. It is the ideology of the Left that is bringing about this situation.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the International Energy Agency has made it abundantly clear that there can be no energy balance in this world unless there is a significant and growing contribution by nuclear power to peacetime electricity generation. Therefore, those who oppose this action are saying that they are quite willing for the outside world to have less and less energy and therefore lower living standards. I have never heard the Opposition raise the question of pollution from other resources, particularly coal. It is using ideology rather than reason and in doing so is seriously damaging the future stability of other countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that there have been some fund failures throughout Australia and that this is due at least sometimes to the level of rates not being adequate to cover the obligations which those funds incur by way of claims. A report in a newspaper-I do not know which newspaper it was-asserted the facts that have been mentioned by the honourable senator. I presume that the facts are as they appeared in the newspaper and as they were stated, but I have no particular knowledge of that matter. I am aware from memory that over the years the Government has funded Medibank Private with, I think, an establishment grant of some $10m and I think a year or so after that, to bail Medibank out of some trouble, with another $10m grant. So there has been a considerable input of funds. I do know that there is a registration board which is authorised under the National Health Act to approve applications for rate variations by medical benefit funds. This board consists of a Commonwealth actuary and two members of the Department of Health. Its brief, as one would expect, is to protect the interests of the contributors who subscribe to the funds in good faith so that those funds will be able to meet their obligations when their contributors make a claim. To ensure the viability of the funds is clearly to the benefit of contributors. This registration board receives applications from funds for variations in their contribution rates. It then considers the financial position, the membership structure and operating expenses of the funds and then approves appropriate levels of rates. I think it would be most unfortunate, with this system in place, if any fund chose to announce its rates without going through this procedure. The only possible losers could be the contributors. With the experience we have had and with the amount of extra funding Medibank Private has required, I think it is appropriate that it should use this procedure as set down.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, follows a question asked recently by Senator Kilgariff. Is it a fact that trade union movements in the United Kingdom, France and West Germany, and possibly in other countries where trade unions are permitted to operate, actively promote the use of nuclear energy? Is it a fact that those unions campaign against activists who seek to bring the Western world to its knees by denying it cheap, safe energy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is that for the past 25 years in quite a number of countries, in both the Western world and behind the Iron Curtain, nuclear power has been a significant and growing source of electric power generation. Indeed, some 400 or more nuclear power plants are working throughout the Western world and some hundreds more are under construction or contemplation. So the world has had some decades of experience, and indeed some decades of support by the trade union movements of the countries involved. I will repeat what I have said; that is, that the 21 main nations of the Western world which are participating members of the International Energy Agency have indicated unanimously that in order to maintain an energy balance and, therefore, to maintain the living standards of this world in the years and decades ahead, it will be absolutely vital that nuclear energy shall take a larger and very significant part in providing that energy. They have indicated that no substitution by alternatives is capable of filling that void. No one has suggested that it is. They have also indicated the contending dangers of pollution from other orthodox means of power generation. Indeed, if the Senate so desires we can provide the technical papers on pollution by alternatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whereas the trade union movements throughout the world have worked and co-operated in the development of these nuclear power plants because they know it is in the interests of the living standards of their people to do so, we have a division in Australia. For example, trade union leaders in such unions as the Australian Workers Union-I think Senator Gietzelt would agree-and the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia have a viewpoint in support of uranium. So leaders of the trade union movement are earnestly working towards the development of the industry. There are ideological approaches to deny it. I simply say that it is a great pity that political ideologies in Australia are taking the place of the complete compassion necessary to provide the world outside with a source of electric power, a lack of which would cause very severe hardship to the world.</PARA>

<PARA>URANIUM SHIPMENTS FROM DARWIN</PARA>
<PARA> Yes-There has been some difficulty in shipping uranium out of Darwin. Members of the Seamen's Union and The Waterside Workers' Federation there sought to frustrate the export of uranium, but as honourable senators will know, a shipment of uranium did leave Darwin on 10th July.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make quite clear the Government's firm commitment to the mining and export of uranium. When the Australian Government decided in 1977 to permit the development of the uranium industry it did so in the light of a balanced evaluation of environmental, Aboriginal, non-proliferation and health and safety issues. The decision has wide public support and has been confirmed at two successive Federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent and thousands are currently employed directly and indirectly because of the uranium industry. Contracts already concluded for uranium sales will lead to thousands of millions of dollars in export income flowing into Australia. If anyone doubts that the uranium industry is a viable and profitable industry for Australia, this week's press announcements should remove those doubts. QML has posted a profit in excess of $44m in its first 18 months and even the MKU result would have been encouraging except for two major non-recurring adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA> The attitudes of a militant minority cannot be allowed to frustrate these developments. There is no industrial basis for the actions of this minority. They are playing politics and disregarding entirely the interests of thousands of their fellow Australians who rely on the uranium industry for their livelihood.</PARA>
<PARA> Australians generally will deplore efforts to override the carefully-considered decisions of the elected Government. I am sure, also, that the great majority of Northern Territory citizens share my disappointment at the attempts by a minority to disrupt the jobs of the people of the Territory, and the Territory economy, in which the uranium industry plays an increasingly important role. In their attempts to stop such shipments, this minority is also damaging other thriving Northern Territory business concerns.</PARA>

<PARA>SUBJECT: Union Reaction to Alleged Post Office Closures in Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA> An item appeared in the Melbourne Sun Newspaper of 29 July 1981 in which the Victorian State Secretary of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union was reported as saying that Australia Post intended closing 70 post offices throughout Victoria in the next 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The names of 116 post offices were listed, from which it was alleged 70 would close. It was also mentioned that the closure would have a very serious effect on the postal services available to the residents in the areas concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The item also stated that postal workers would be asked to urge their local communities to write to their Members of Parliament and Australia Post for an assurance that their post offices would not close. </PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> This issue must be understood within the context of:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Government RCF decision that contracting is to be further extended to the private sector where practical;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the setting by the Government of an interim provisional staff ceiling for the Australian Postal Commission for 1982, at a level which would represent a 5 per cent reduction on the level of Australia Post's estimated staffing requirements as based on predicted business volumes. In addition, the Government has decided that Australia Post should work at achieving a further 2 per cent reduction in staff numbers over the period to June 1983;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Australia Post does not intend closing the post offices mentioned. It is considering only a change in their method of operation;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) it is more economical to operate small post offices under non-official conditions than under official conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>GENERAL</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Postal Services Act, Australia Post is obliged to meet all of its operating costs and at least 50 per cent of its capital expenditure. It is also required to operate its service efficiently and economically. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post's services and facilities policies are framed in accordance with its statutory obligations and with the objective of meeting the reasonable postal needs of all sections of the community. These policies are reviewed continually in the light of changing community needs. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMENT</PARA>
<PARA> On 7 May 1981, advice was given by Australia Post management to union representatives at a meeting of the Postal Consultative Council, that Australia Post proposed reviewing the basis for the provision of post office counter outlets and other facilities and the conditions under which post offices may operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions were informed also that, in accordance with normal consultative processes, no change would be made to post office provision, withdrawal or conversion policies, without proper consultation with the unions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to policy currently being considered are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Official post offices be provided when there is sufficient work to employ three people full-time (with a workload below that level, the method of operation would be non-official.)</PARA>
<PARA> Currently the criterion is for a workload for two people full-time. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Official post offices be converted to non-official operation when there is no longer sufficient work for two people full-time. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the criterion relates to a workload for one person full-time</PARA>
<PARA> NOTE: At this stage, no decisions have been made on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As a temporary measure, pending finalisation of the current review of post office facilities policies, vacancies of Postmaster Grades 1 and 2 will not be filled on a permanent basis. In the Bendigo area, there are only two such vacancies-at Ouyen and Charlton offices. </PARA>
<PARA> Any changes which may eventually be made to the existing facilities policies will be managed sensibly, with full consideration given to the suitable re-location of staff wherever necessary. Full implementation of any changes could be expected to take three years or even longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to the method of operating post offices do not affect the range or standard of postal services provided to customers. The main difference is that non-official post offices are operated under an agency arrangement, usually by a local business person, and not by employees of Australia Post. At 30 June 1981, 3,635 post offices in Australia were operated on the non-official basis and 1,422 by Australia Post employees. </PARA>

<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 19 August 1981 Senator Button asked me a question without notice in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce relating to the inclusion in the Budget Papers of proposed new works for the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, and the recent sale of a lathe by the factory.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Items totalling $695,000 have been listed in the Civil Works Program as 'proposed New Works' at the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo including, as the honourable senator has pointed out, a new electroplating building for $480,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has offered the Ordnance Factory for sale as a going concern; no final decision as to its disposal will be taken until all offers received have been fully evaluated. The inclusion in the Budget of provision for these works is quite consistent with the 'going concern' approach; retention in the program is contingent upon the progress of plans to dispose of the factory. No commitments have been entered into.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards the sale of a lathe from the factory, this lathe was purchased second-hand in 1943. It had become progressively less accurate and was declared surplus to requirements in July 1980. It was offered to other Government departments and authorities, but was not suitable for them and was sold in June 1981 by public tender for $22,800, the highest offer.</PARA>
<PARA> There was a newspaper report that the purchaser hoped to obtain a price of $165,000 on resale, after he had transported the lathe to Sydney and undertaken extensive, and costly, rehabilitation.</PARA>

<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The damaging effect on economic activity in general, and on housing in particular of the sustained record interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>For almost a year interest rates have been at all time record levels. There is no indication that they will fall in the foreseeable future. There is a soundly based expectation that further rises will occur. Record interest rates have been partly caused by the previous Government's incompetence and political opportunism, which can not be retrospectively corrected. They also reflect deliberate Government policy-a policy of hosing down economic growth and, the Government believes, inflation with a credit squeeze. The two objectives of the credit squeeze are to hose down economic growth and to hose down inflation. It certainly will not hose down inflation. The estimates of inflation given in the Budget Papers of 10.75 per cent for the year-this is not widely known-is the average increase in prices in this fiscal year over the previous fiscal year. The Treasury estimate, which has not been disclosed, for the June quarter 1982 over the June quarter for 1981 is 12 per cent. I invite the Minister to comment on that and to confirm that that in fact, is the Treasury inflation estimate for June quarter 1982 on June quarter 1981. While on that subject I add that the estimated 0.75 per cent increase to the consumer price index arising from the sales tax impost announced in the Budget is again an average whole fiscal year figure. In fact, by the end of this financial year the CPI will have been boosted by about 1.1 per cent because of the sales tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Government's failure in controlling inflation, the credit squeeze policy has already been successful in hosing down economic growth. In the economy generally negative growth was reported in the June quarter. As usual the tailspin is most pronounced in residential building. The latest available figures show that in May 1980 2,591 loans were approved for the purchase of newly erected dwellings. In May 1981 only 2,004 loans were approved. That represents a drop of more than 20 per cent. In permanent building society loans, a component of that larger figure, the decline was even more pronounced. In May of last year 822 such loans were approved and in May of this year 427 were approved. They almost halved. Those figures are not a single month aberration, they are consistent with the figures recorded in the previous month and may be compared with the figures for recent whole years, when total approvals under this category varied between 31,000 and 36,000. At present rates, of course, the figure will be below 25,000. The effect of that downturn in loan approvals does not show up immediately in actual building activity and employment within the industry, although there are clear indications that it is beginning to show now. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the macro-economic effect of the Government's high interest rate, de facto credit squeeze policy. A 3 per cent rise in interest rates, which is the order of magnitude we have seen over the last couple of years, forces the typical family buying a home to pay an extra $65 a month. Of course, taking such a large bite out of otherwise disposable household income is inevitably having a macro-economic feedback. It is adversely affecting total demand and reinforcing the initial suppression of economic activity caused by the interest rates themselves. The previously large proportion of the population with incomes that are inadequate to obtain a building society loan has risen significantly. I seek leave to incorporate a table, which I regret I have not yet been able to show to the Minister. Incorporation is subject to his perusal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table shows that whereas, with an interest rate of 11 1/2 per cent, some 73 per cent of people have inadequate income to obtain a loan, with interest at 13 1/2 per cent the figure rises to 82 1/2 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) continually defends Government policy on the ground that if interest rates do not rise no money will be available for housing loans. Although there is doubtless some truth in that assertion, taken in isolation, the problem is rather being solved at the other end. Supply and demand are being brought into balance not by more funds being made available but by fewer people being in a position to borrow the money for the building that they want to undertake. Virtually four-fifths of the population cannot now afford housing loans. This situation was not unavoidable, but even if it had been its effects could have been substantially mitigated if the Government had committed more funds to public housing for low income earners. However, in the first three years in office the Fraser Government reduced steadily the percentage of Budget funds being devoted to public housing, which have fallen from almost 4 per cent in 1974-75 to 1.1 per cent in 1979-80, 0.9 per cent in 1980-81 and an estimated one per cent this year. Thus, at a time when there is a clear need, a very much greater demand, for funds for public housing, the response of the Fraser Government, consistent with its actions in so many other areas, has been to reduce drastically the proportion of Government funds devoted to this area, and then hold that reduction. It is ironic to recall the following words of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in November 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interest rates over the coming year will fall by 2 per cent. It is a target that can and will be met. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest rates did fall for a few months after that promise was given because the money market, foolishly, chose in the short term to believe the Prime Minister. Of couse it no longer does, nor does anyone else. Interest rates than began to rise and they have risen consisently ever since. They are now between 3 per cent and 4 per cent higher than they were when the Prime Minister made that promise. That false promise is itself a principal cause of the increase. Nobody believes what the Government says about interest rates. There is no reason why anybody should believe anything the Government says about interest rates. There are a vast number of reasons why people should not believe anything that the Government says. </PARA>
<PARA> The false promise delivered in 1977 has been compounded in the last three financial years by very substantial overruns of the Government's announced monetary growth target. There have been overruns in M3 of the order of 2 per cent to 3 per cent in each year. If one looks at a broader definition of money supply in the last financial year, M4, the increase was in fact 16 per cent as against 12.7 per cent in M3. That figure is not widely published but it is known to people in the capital market who influence interest rates. Government policy on interest rates, and on finance generally, has been marked by vacillation, wishful thinking, electoral expediency of the most shameful type towards the end of last year, contortions and contradictions, all to accommodate the redneck economics of the National Country Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Just one year after the Prime Minister gave his promise, we saw the first instalment of the Government's policy. The record wheat crop would impose a huge liability on the Reserve Bank of Australia if the Reserve Bank were to fund entirely the first advance, as it did in previous years. That would add to the money supply. For the benefit of Government members who have an interest in this subject, even though they do not know anything about it, money advanced from the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank in that way is conceptually identical to printing bank notes. The Government says it is averse to printing bank notes. As the wheat crop was very much larger than anticipated, the money supply was likely to blow out by about 1 1/2 per cent. The Government, instead of acting forthrightly as it should have done and instructing the Australian Wheat Board to go to the capital market to borrow the additional requirement, vacillated for six weeks to accommodate the eccentricities of the redneck economists of the National Country Party. It lost credibility in the money market through that vacillation and it has never regained it. </PARA>
<PARA> The excuse repeatedly used by the Treasurer for allowing increases in regulated interest rates has been that if increases are not permitted in a competitive market no funds will be available for lending in those areas. There may be some truth in that argument. However, the Treasurer, and his representative in this House, failed or refused to answer this question. In some areas interest rates are still regulated at well below prevailing market rates. For example, the interest rate on bank overdrafts for people in declared drought areas is supposed to be pegged at 10 1/2 per cent whereas for everyone else it is 12 1/2 per cent. If no money will come into the housing sector if interest rates are controlled or administered at below market levels, will the Treasurer or his representative explain how funds will be made available to people in drought affected areas for small overdrafts at a rate of interest 2 per cent below the market rate? If it can be done for the friends of the National Country Party, why cannot it be done for people who are borrowing money to build houses?</PARA>
<PARA> What does that sort of inconsistency do for the Government's credibility in the money market? We see incompetence and deceit and rising interest rate expectations. We hear a lot about rising inflation expectations but we do not hear as much about rising interest rate expectations which have been induced by the actions of this Government. Of course, the controlling of a substantial area of interest rates in this situation has contributed greatly to the present problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The higher interest rates do, of course, have other causes. A major cause is the record foreign capital inflow which the Government refuses to control. Last year the figure was $6.5 billion. Other things being equal, because this adds to the supply of funds and might be expected to reduce interest rates, other things do not remain equal. Most of the capital which has been coming in is speculative. That in itself is likely to exert upward pressure on interest rates. A speculative boom is always likely to exert upward pressure on interest rates. The other credit squeeze policies which the Government adopts in order to overcome what it sees to be the otherwise damaging effects of this enormous volume of capital inflow force interest rates up in other ways. The major expansion in private sector demand for investment funds over the last year-an expansion in real terms of 20 per cent-has also put pressure on the capital market and forced rises in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A major expansion in capital investment is desirable but the spontaneous demand of the last 12 months has been artificially and substantially boosted by a series of Government taxation policies-the notorious 20 per cent investment allowance and an assortment of investment tax dodges which distort efficient resource allocation, as well as forcing up interest rates unnecessarily. All of the tax dodges, other than the 20 per cent investment allowance, are less than 18 months old. They were produced by the Government in a period when there were already strong pressures in the capital market from growing investment. The most outrageous of all the tax investment rorts-the film industry tax haven which effectively pays subsidies of up to 120 per cent, believe it or not, of the cost of producing a film-is only three months old. Like all the other investment tax dodges, that was a policy produced straight off the top of the Prime Minister's head in the lead up to an election, evidently at the bidding of a television make-up girl. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of recognising these realities and, to the extent to which it is still possible, mitigating them, the Government has floated the furphy that the cause of these highly undesirable increases in interest rates is the rapacious borrowing demands of the public sector, that public sector borrowing has forced interest rates up. That is a hypothesis which is supported by the stoneage ideologues of the Treasury. In fact, public sector borrowing requirements as a proportion of gross domestic product have fallen steadily in every year since 1977-78 and are now at about half of their level in 1977-78. The assortment of primitives and deficit fetishists who populate the Government benches comfort themselves with the belief that as long as they can get rid of the deficit, inflation and interest rates will come down. That article of faith cannot be shaken by any amount of contradictory empirical evidence, and there is an abundance of that. Meanwhile, the people continue to suffer unnecessarily because of the previous opportunism, deceit and incompetence of the Government in this area and its continuing refusal to rectify past mistakes or adopt more appropriate policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh has moved an urgency motion on the following matter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The damaging effect on economic activity in general, and on housing in particular, of the sustained record interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an important matter and the Government welcomes the opportunity to debate the issue. I think it is fair to say that nobody likes rising interest rates, nobody likes taxes, and nobody likes rising inflation. We do not like a lot of things, but we have to look at the realities. We might not like rising interest rates, but nobody likes a government which fails to manage the economy. I think Opposition senators and members can attest to the validity of that proposition. Economic management is quite fundamental to a government's responsibility, and we can claim to have carried that out effectively. Anyone listening to Senator Walsh would not think that Australia is one of the most healthy economies in the world. I believe Australia can justly claim that it is one of the most healthy economies in the Western world today, despite the things that Senator Walsh has said. We have reached this position because of our responsible approach to economic management. It is not a position that is reached easily, and sometimes difficult decisions need to be taken. There needs to be political will if a country is to have sound economic management, and I suggest that that is one of the responsibilities we have accepted. We have accepted that as part of the overall responsibility of government, we have not taken the selective, easy options that some people suggest are available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to suggest that some of Senator Walsh's forecasts on economic activity need to be treated with considerable caution. Most of us can remember very easily the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and his colleagues after last year's Budget. They were busily knocking the economy. As I remember the comments made last year, they seemed to be that the Government was driving the economy through the floor. Instead of that, at the time we brought down this Budget we were able to show that all of the Oppositions' forecasts with regard to the outcome of the economy were dead wrong. We were able to show that during the past year there had been a record of remarkable economic management and growth. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Walsh's predictions on interest rates and their effect on the economy are of no greater worth than some of the comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition last year, and indeed this year. Perhaps we could talk about that matter, as Senator Walsh has raised the subject. The question is: Why are interest rates rising? Anyone would acknowledge that the main reason they have been rising so strongly recently is that there has been a sharp increase in the aggregate demand for money in this country. Senator Walsh's motion speaks about the damaging effect on economic activity. He seems to have some problem with causes and effects. We have seen a staggering increase in the demand by the private sector for funds. Total State and semi-government requirements have risen appreciably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Walsh has made his speech; he should not try to make mine too. He has done his bit. In a year when most industrialised countries are experiencing a recession, Australia's economy is close to the top of the growth league. Maybe Senator Walsh does not like to have that acknowledged, but it is a fact. It is a matter of record. The Australian economy has a strength that few other countries can boast when looked at in terms of economic trends, employment trends, the growth of gross domestic product, and rising real incomes. All of these factors are measurable and sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, notwithstanding the increases in interest rates that have occurred in Australia in recent months, the overall demand for finance is still very strong in this country. This reflects the improvement in the general level of economic activity. This strong demand for finance is evidenced by the fact that during the 12 months to May-the last month for which data is available-net loans outstanding from all major financial institutions increased by no less than 16.4 per cent. I think Senator Walsh incorporated a table relating to the period to May, and I assume he was using the same figures that are available to me. Recent lending figures for certain financial institutions confirm that this strong demand for finance is still evident. Notwithstanding the increases in interest rates during 1980-81, business fixed investment grew in real terms during that year by a noteworthy 21 per cent. Again, that is a fact. The rise in business fixed investment last year was 21 per cent. No one could suggest that that indicates an unhealthy economy. Investment anticipation data suggest further strong growth in real terms in 1981-82 of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As was indicated in the Budget documents, prospects for growth in overall economic activity in 1981-82 are also buoyant. Non-farm product growth of 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent in real terms is forecast, following a 4 per cent growth in 1980-81-the strongest growth since 1973-74. Clearly, whilst the increases in interest rates over the last 12 months have been a necessary part of the Government's anti-inflationary policy, economic activity continues to grow at a very satisfactory rate. In the context of the figures I have just quoted, it is little less than astonishing that Senator Walsh can come into this chamber and try to write down the Australian economy. Apparently the Australian Labor Party is worried less about interest rates than about the fact that this Government is presiding over one of the world's healthier economies. In fact, it is right at the top of the growth rates and any other measurements that one wishes to relate to a healthy economy. Perhaps the electoral consequences of that fact and the promises for the future are all too apparent to Senator Walsh and his colleagues. Perhaps that is why he has brought forward this motion and has talked in the way he has today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget before the Parliament was framed against the background of concern throughout the Australian economy about the effects of rising interest rates. In developing a strategy for the recent Budget the Government was concerned to do everything possible to bring about a reduction in the upward pressure on the level of interest rates. The high level of interest rates is a consequence of the very high level of demand for funds in the Australian economy. Government must be prepared to make a contribution towards reducing that demand, and that is what it did in the recent Budget. It made a significant contribution towards easing the pressure on interest rates by the virtual elimination of the Budget deficit. The best contribution governments can make towards restraining interest rates is to reduce their own borrowing demands. I do not think it should be argued otherwise. The Commonwealth Government has done its part by reducing its need for new borrowings this year. The domestic Budget deficit was reduced steadily from $2,451m in 1977-78 to $567m in 1979-80, and in 1980-81 the Government achieved a domestic Budget surplus of about $400m. This reduction in the need for Commonwealth borrowing considerably reduced pressure on the capital market and prevented interest rates from rising more than they have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government also acted to restrain the borrowing requirement of the public sector through the Loan Council. Maybe some of those decisions were not easy to take, but they were necessary. As has already been announced, new loan programs scheduled for 1981-82 will be about 4 per cent less in real terms than they were last year. Despite what I am saying about reducing the level of demand by governments on the loan market, we hear from Senator Walsh that we ought to be putting more money into this, that and the other. It may be that people might ask for additional funds from the Government for this program or that program. If they are to be put in at the cost of higher interest rates for everyone then I would have to argue that that is not sound economic management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; What do Senator Walsh and the Labor Party want to do about rising interest rates? In 1972-75, the Labor Party had no success in dealing with interest rates in the way in which it seems to want to deal with them today. It appears that the Labor Party has learnt nothing about interest rates, and brings forward the same prescription again. Last Tuesday Mr Hayden prescribed a return to Budget deficits. His high tax, high deficit and high cost prescriptions are exactly the same proposals as were advocated before. Members of the Labor Party have to answer the question: 'How do we finance these things? Do we print money, do we raise taxes or do we raise borrowings?' The effects of all these courses would be predictable-more inflation and ultimately higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party argues for controls on overseas capital. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said recently in the other place, the Government has a preference in the present situation for relying on more general policy responses, including, of course, a reduction in the size of its demands on the loan markets. It is not possible for the Government to guarantee to home buyers or to any other group that they will always be able to borrow funds at rates of interest that are significantly lower than market rates. For those who can obtain loans at concessional rates of interest, artificially low rates are of course a boon. That is if they can get them. If people can get a concessional rate of interest that is artificially low it might be a boon for them. But those who are selected and obtain loans at low rates do so at the expense of many others who are not able to obtain a loan at all. That is the reality of that sort of proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens if we try artificially to hold down the price of money? The lending institutions have trouble attracting deposits. It does not take much sense to know that if they can lend only at low interest rates they can afford only to offer even lower rates to their depositors, and the result will be a drying up of funds that are available for lending. A study that was done recently for the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System claimed that trying to hold down interest rates on housing loans did not just fail to help low income earners get a housing loan. It also resulted in their being the very group which suffered financially. Low income earners were worse off because low income households, particularly those in the older age groups, hold a very high proportion of their assets in savings accounts. I would have to argue that there is no purpose in what Senator Walsh and his colleagues are pretending to do in suggesting that there is a simple solution to the problem of rising interest rates in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the reasons that I have stated, the Government had no alternative but to allow interest rates to increase, and on the basis of an extension of the understanding reached with the banks last December, the increase in the overdraft rate will not apply to farmers and others adversely affected by drought in drought declared areas for the duration of the drought. Senator Walsh seemed to take some exception to assistance being made available to farmers in drought affected areas for the duration of the drought. The information given to me with regard to the drought loans that have been made is that only a comparatively small number of loans have been granted to farmers in the drought affected areas for the period of the drought, and this would hardly distort the competitive market in which others may wish to borrow funds. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had not allowed bank interest rates to increase the result would have been a further reduction in the availability of bank funds to those very groups that the interest rate controls are designed to assist. Although there has been some slowing down in lending for housing by the major housing finance institutions during 1980-81, the overall level of housing construction activity was very high indeed. During 1980-81 private investment in dwellings grew by a remarkable 10 per cent to 11 per cent in real terms. There has not been such a high level of growth in housing activity since the last housing boom in the early 1970s. There was quite clearly a very adequate supply of housing finance available during the period that has just passed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the motion we are debating was treated in a fairly lacklustre way by Senator Walsh. It was he who brought forward the matter of urgency with regard to the damaging effect on economic activity and on housing and the sustained record interest rates that are prevalent at persent. I do not think that what was brought forward by Senator Walsh showed that there was any policy that would provide a solution. As I have said, the management of the economy at present and the level of interest rates result from the fact that the current level of demand for money in the community considerably exceeds its availability. This principle of supply and demand is inescapable in most of the activities that we need to undertake. In these circumstances, interest rates rises are unavoidable unless the Government increases the availability of money, which course would have inflationary consequences. If interest rates in certain areas, for example housing, are held down too far and for too long, investors will take their dollars away from institutions which traditionally lend for housing and the capacity of those institutions to provide housing loans will be reduced. The deposit experience of savings banks and the permanent building societies bears testimony to this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought we had discussed the matter of interest rates, the availability of finance and the demands on the capital market on a number of occasions. Those discussions have shown that at present the level of interest rates results from the factors I have mentioned. The availability of money in the community for housing or for any other activity that we support depends on factors which have been outlined by me. I therefore suggest that those who look at the case that has been made by the Opposition in support of its matter of urgency relating to what it calls the damaging effect of the sustained record interest rates would have to reject the motion. I commend to them the strategy of the Government in its present Budget, the outline that has been given by the Treasurer and the forecasts of our economy for the forthcoming year and into the future, and suggest that they look to this Government to continue its sound economic policies to provide benefits for all Australians in all the areas that we hold as important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr Deputy President, I believe this is the first time I have had the floor while you have been in the chair. Therefore I take this opportunity to congratulate you on achieving your position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased today to support Senator Walsh's motion regarding the urgent need we have to consider the damaging effect on economic activity in general and on housing in particular of the sustained record interest rates. This matter comes forward a little more than a week after the introduction of the Australian Democrats' legislative initiative aimed at curbing the economic damage in this area. I hope that it is an indication that the Australian Labor Party is planning to support the Bill I introduced last week. If it is not, I would like it to give me some indication at some time whether it will ignore it or oppose it completely. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go any further may I remind honourable senators of what I introduced last week. In the second reading speech, which was brought on somewhat precipitately on the second day of this session, presumably because there was an intention to prove that the Australian Democrats were ill-prepared to go ahead with the initiatives I had given notice of the previous day, I indicated that the purpose of the Bill to amend the Banking Act 1959 was to ensure, firstly, that regulations are made under the principal Act for the control of increases in interest rates; secondly, that those regulations grant relief from increases in interest rates to families borrowing funds for the purchase of their first home; and thirdly, that Parliament would have control of increases in interest rates of more than 0.5 per cent. It was, as I said, some small attempt at alleviating the housing repayment burden which is rapidly becoming intolerable, particularly to people in the lower economic brackets in the community. I hope, therefore, that this motion from the ALP indicates its intention to support perhaps the bringing forward of debate on that amendment Bill. The situation is urgent. Fewer and fewer home loans are available for the people who need them most. I refer honourable senators to some statistics provided in the annual review of the residential property market by the Real Estate Institute of Australia. On page 12 it makes this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The sales market in 1980-81 was characterised both by dwelling sale price rises of higher magnitude than in the previous financial year, and by buoyant markets in most of the surveyed cities up to Christmas 1980. The major hindrance to continued buoyancy in these surveyed sales markets was the severe tightening of housing finance, particularly between January and June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>The review goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The year 1980-81 was marked by a tightening in the availability of housing finance. . . . in some cities housing finance began to tighten in late 1980; in others this did not occur until the beginning of 1981. Nevertheless, the finance problem has affected, to varying degrees, activity in all surveyed sales markets. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anybody in the community would not put that factor down to the constant and large increases in interest rates that the Australian community has had to sustain in the last 12 months, and particularly in the last six months. As a corollary to the fact that fewer and fewer home loans are available, rentals are becoming harder to acquire. Those that are acquirable are dearer. Again referring to that same document, I point out to honourable senators what the Real Estate Institute of Australia has to say on the matter. On page 6 it makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA> Private rental markets tightened considerably in all surveyed cities during the year. The vacancy rate (the percentage of surveyed dwellings unlet at the end of each month) decreased by over half in most surveyed capitals between July 1980 and June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on a page or two later to point out that there has been a general increase in rental prices in all capital cities. The Institute said that in Brisbane in the last 12 months the rent for a two-bedroom furnished unit has risen from $55 a week to $60 a week, and for a three-bedroom unfurnished house the rent has risen from $60 a week to $70 a week. It also said that as the private rental market in Perth tightened in the beginning of 1981 the rent levels rose. Of course, that is an inevitable fact of life. Landlords either have their own mortgage with a rising interest rate and therefore have to put up rentals to manage to meet their repayments to the bank or, being in the business of making money, they are aware that the supply is far outstripped by the demand and put rentals up on that basis alone. There was also an increase in rental rates in Canberra of about $10 a week. This increase is pretty well consistent with what is happening across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate result of the fact that people are finding it harder to meet their mortgage repayments is an increasing number of mortgagee sales across the country. However, before people are prepared to resort to selling the roof over their heads, they try to cut back on other measures. Obviously, they start to cut back on the household bills which are easiest to pare; that is food and clothing. Of course this does nothing for their health, their standard of living or for the small business areas around them. The local delicatessen, the local draper and the small businessman are going to be the first hit after householders start to cut back on expenditure. When that saving fails to cover the bills the householders have to resort to selling their homes. In the meantime, and because of the tightness of their finances, they have also been precluded from spending money on things which perhaps are luxuries but which to most people are a way of life, a part of their existence, like a new car, a new washing machine or a new refrigerator. They are putting up with their old ones far longer than they perhaps would in other circumstances. This must have an effect on the white goods and other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week a woman, who would not give me her name-after she finished telling me the story I understood why-telephoned my office. I am sure she is only one of a vast number in her predicament. She is a widow of some five years with only one 10-year old daughter who needs not only to be fed, clothed and housed but also to be educated. When she spoke to me over the telephone she was distraught because she said that if she wanted to maintain her home she had no alternative left to her-she is on a pension-than to seek employment under an assumed name. She said that she had already sold her rings and her late husband's watch in order to continue to meet her $40 a week mortgage repayments. She is on a pension of a little in excess of $80 a week. She maintained that the strain that was being placed on her was causing her to become a criminal in that in order to supplement her income she had to seek employment, but in order not to have the pension cut back she would have to seek it under an assumed name. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we solve the problem inherent in the pressure which is constantly being brought to bear on people by increasing interest rates? The Australian Labor Party sought to solve the problem when it was in power by introducing a limited tax deduction on interest rates. As I indicated in my speech last week, if one or two problems inherent in this area can be overcome, I would be very prepared to support the introduction of something similar. Of course, the major problem is that the income cut-off point Labor introduced was an unreasonable one. It did not catch all the people who needed help. If a tax deduction scheme is introduced, it must have a reasonable or a realistic means test limit. Furthermore, it must be organised well enough to take into consideration the varying house price averages across the country. Sydney's average house price is something like $78,000, whereas that for Adelaide is almost half that figure. It would be grossly unfair to introduce some sort of scheme which captured only those people living in capital cities whose option for buying homes was limited to an average price of $35,000 or less, as occurs in Adelaide or Perth, leaving the people in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne hanging out to dry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second alternative is to do as I suggested last week in my Bill; to introduce a moratorium on interest rate rises for those most in need-that is, couples or individuals buying their first home and their principal place of residence. That alternative is not without its problems because it leaves out of contention people who are equally in need of help, but it is a start. The only other alternative to either of those is for the Government to continue increasing funds for welfare housing. As Senator Walsh pointed out, not only is the Government not doing that, but also it is actually cutting back. The use of either a tax deduction scheme or increased funding for welfare housing would cost the Government-that is the taxpayer-money; not that that in itself is necessarily anything to worry about. But it does avoid placing the problem anywhere within the realms of the institutions which ought to face up to the responsibility-that is, the lending institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I and, I gather, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, have opted for the moratorium system. This forces the banks, and to a lesser extent the building societies, to face their responsibilities with regard to the community and home loan borrowers in particular and to use some of their record profits in facing their responsibilities. Taken in conjunction with the amendment I have suggested to the Income Tax Assessment Act this would have the effect of placing the responsibilities squarely where they should be placed, that is, conjointly between the lending authorities and the Government. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the final speaker for the Government I have a responsibility to refute the arguments put forward by the Opposition and by Senator Haines. I found that Senator Walsh's outburst indicated that a lot of the present trouble is due to the incompetence of previous governments. If he were referring to the Whitlam Government I would heartily agree. He referred also to our Government's attitude towards hosing down inflation. I do not like the use of the terms 'hosing down' and 'hosing down expenditure'. Senator Walsh always appears to me as a free trader. Adopting this sort of philosophy I am rather surprised that in the ambit of his arguments he failed to link Australia with part of a wider world economic system. There was a lack of comment for instance in relating the Australian events with what is taking place overseas, particularly in the United States of America. Unfortunately, all the palliatives he suggested were fairly short term expedients rather than long term solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must be very careful that we do not fall into a situation such as that which President Carter found himself in, when he took a short term view and allowed the economic problems to accumulate. Former President Carter then found himself in the unenviable situation of having to react too late. This had drastic and painful effects. Therefore, we must be careful to avoid a policy of total containment. The Budget does recognise a need to quieten down somewhat inflationary symptoms. If we want further information I suggest that we look at page 49 of Budget Paper No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh throughout his speech tended to state that there were some overruns in money supply targets. But he failed to recognise that under the Whitlam Government no money supply targets were set, and consequently we had a disastrous situation with a money supply running at something like 26 per cent. The inevitable consequence of interest rates rises followed. Senator Walsh also failed to recognise that there is a link between the rate of inflation and interest rates. In the early 1960s when the inflation rate was about 4 per cent it was considered proper to control interest rates. But as the inflation rate has tended to rise around the world appropriate techniques for the new situation have had to be adopted; that is to control the money supply. Hence on our side of politics we are emphasising the need to control the money supply growth. The Government is taking the right measures to try to control money supply growth and hence keep inflation down. We are not short terms operators; we implement long term solutions. Opposition speakers really failed to link Australia with the rest of the world. We are a major trading nation. Australia cannot isolate itself from world affairs. The hard fact is that 70 per cent of Australia's overseas transactions are carried out in terms of United States dollars. This happens regardless of the origin of the transaction, be it Japan or some other country. The simple fact is that those transactions are ultimately reflected in United States dollars. So what is happening in the United States must inevitably flow to Australia. Also United States trade represents something like 36 per cent of trade in the free world. This is further evidence that we cannot isolate ourselves from happenings in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain dangers of having uncontrolled money supply growth. We must therefore endeavour to lower the rate of inflation. We must attempt to control the money supply growth and, in so doing, we will keep the lid on interest rates. If we do not do that interest rates will go through the roof. Instead of having an inflation rate of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent we could well envisage, if schemes advocated by the Labor Party were adopted, an inflation rate of 30 per cent. We on this side of the chamber are quite sympathetic to all those home borrowers who have become locked into a situation of having to pay the higher mortgage interest rates. I was quite interested in the views put forward by Senator Haines. I believe she was the only speaker who attempted to put forward solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> If we in the Senate are to make any contribution to thinking on important matters of our day I think we have an opporunity to be a little innovative. As Opposition senators did not make any innovative suggestions and as Senator Haines was fairly limited in her approach to the matter, I will take a little time in putting a few perhaps novel ideas so that we can at least expand our thinking on this issue. I wish to remind honourable senators that on this side of the chamber we recognise the importance of the problems encountered by many families. It grieves me when people tell me that they have to sell their house. I am looking for solutions. At the same time I am not prepared to put up with a situation in which we allow the inflation rate to rise, which in its wake will lift interest rates. What is the lesser of the two evils? This is really what we have to look at. It is unfortunate that interest rates have to rise but we have to recognise the difference between the two evils. Therefore, I think it is essential that we provide some innovative thinking in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines mentioned the need to maintain a moratorium on interest rate growth. A moratorium can cause problems. How many honourable senators opposite would be prepared to put money in the bank earning interest at a rate of 8 per cent so that home owners can borrow money at, say, 9 per cent? We all tend to follow market forces in our investment decision. That is what ordinary people in Australia are doing. Senator Haines submitted that the banks use some of their profits to reduce interest rates. However, profit in relation to an individual transaction is quite small. I do not think that that would be a satisfactory solution. Many of us are a little concerned that there is evidence of a build-up in inflationary pressure which essentially is coming from the wages area. The consequence will be pressure on wages generally, a squeeze on profits and companies will have to examine their cash flow situation. There will be a fairly strong demand for funds, and borrowing will be needed. Therefore I am not anticipating any short term reduction in interest rates. However, we are creating the environment in which the economy will not get out of hand. This is essentially the difference between the Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look into the future. In line with our Budget strategy this coming year we are going to import more than we are going to export. On current account about $6.5 billion will go on deficit. Therefore, to correct the situation and taking into account the domestic surplus it will be necessary to have an inflow of capital of about $7 billion. This is a necessary anti-inflationary move. We must have an environment in which overseas money can profitably be invested. The Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines ensure that overseas investors do not take us to the cleaners. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and others time and time again have refuted the sorts of arguments used in the rhetoric of Senator Walsh. Let me use the limited time available to be innovative. First, there is room through credit unions or building societies for the self-help scheme under which people could invest at, say, 10 per cent for a certain time before they take out their loan, which they would then receive at a moderate rate of interest. I believe that building societies particularly have an opportunity to be more innovative in their rate structure. For example, building societies could have a scheme under which borrowers could pay back only interest for five years and after that period make some repayment of capital plus interest. It would certainly help the home buyer who is locked into a difficult situation. I therefore applaud some New South Wales building societies for being innovative in this way. We should also examine the possibility of allowing tax deductibility on interest rates in respect of people under a certain age buying their first home. It may be that such a scheme would have to be limited to, say, people 35 years of age and under and to loans of less than $45,000. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reduced the deficit. I think that possibly there is a need to put a bit of a clamp on public utility borrowings such as by Telecom Australia. We have a situation in the semi-government area in which the tail is wagging the dog. Is it more important that we have new automatic telephone exchanges in country areas or lower interest rates for home buyers? Perhaps we should look at our priorities. There is so much pressure from the semi-government area that I believe maybe we should selectively borrow abroad for some of the new development projects. Maybe we have to try despite some exchange risks but we would hedge against such a situation. I believe there should be a greater requirement for overseas people investing in resource development more to provide a greater degree of infrastructure finance. This would then take the pressure off the Australian borrowing program for local government, state and semi-government finance. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to refer to a comment that was made by Billy Wentworth, a distinguished former member of the other House. He believed that penalties or taxes should be placed on multinationals borrowing in the domestic market since they were taking advantage of Australian interest rates being lower than overseas. He believed that this would relieve pressure within Australia. I have very much more to say. However, unfortunately my time has run out. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the fact that once again officials of the Liberal Party of Australia have been travelling on VIP aircraft. I notice that Mr Eggleton, who is the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, was a passenger on the BAC1-11 on 30 January this year, accompanying the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) and many of his staff. I will ask during the consideration of the Estimates whether the Collector of Public Moneys recovered a first class air fare from the Liberal Party for the carriage of Mr Eggleton on that flight. We often hear it said by Government members that they are opposed to public funding of elections. However, when we find that officials of the Liberal Party are travelling on VIP aircraft, no doubt the public would want to know whether they are subsidising those officials to travel the country on VIP aircraft in the company of Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that in the manifest for the period 1 January 1981 to 30 June 1981 only one overseas flight is listed for the special Boeing jet which the Prime Minister said was needed for security reasons. Has the Prime Minister travelled overseas in the Boeing aircraft only once in that six months? I think he has been overseas on more than one occasion in that period. We want to know how he travelled. Is it a printer's error that other flights were not listed in the manifest or did the Prime Minister travel by commercial aircraft? If he travelled by commercial aircraft, it gives the lie to the statement that taxpayers needed to purchase two Boeings, for security reasons, for the Prime Minister's overseas jaunts. Another matter I will pursue in the Estimates is whether the Boeing made only one trip and, if it made more trips, why they were not included in the manifest. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the hour I will make the brief comment that the National Consultative Council of Social Welfare is a body appointed by the Government to give it advice on social security matters. On this occasion, as on all other occasions, the Government has ignored the advice of that body. The members of the Council are experts in their field, knowledgeable in the whole area of social security. They recommend, amongst other things, that family allowances and other payments to pensioners and beneficiaries for children be indexed and that the cost of this indexation be met from general taxation, particularly from the taxation of higher income levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The members pointed to the considerable evidence in the community showing that families with children have been disadvantaged by changes to the taxation structure and by the failure since they were introduced to increase family allowances to any reasonable level, with the exception of the increase in the last Budget of allowances to families with three or more children. Similar recommendations flow through the report. However, once again, the Government has completely ignored these recommendations. We believe this is a pity and that there should be a full debate on this matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I merely want to make a brief comment in relation to the report. I will make more extensive comments later in relation to the minority statement. The report itself seems to fulfil, in a formal sense, the brief given to the Commonwealth Schools Commission by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). However, I believe that the report fails to address itself to the important issues that were raised by the Minister in his directive to the Commission. In particular, although it comments on the differential between government and non-government schools, it makes no point about the divisiveness of that particular recommendation or advice. I believe that within the community at large the major issue that confronts schools, both government and non-government, is the wedge that is being driven between supporters of government schools and supporters of non-government schools. Indeed, I have suggested in a number of places that it might be well for the States to declare their entire school systems private because they would be in a much better position to apply for Commonwealth grants, which are much more lavish than the States can offer to their own schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The directions given the Commission by the Minister are included in the report. That is right and proper, but unfortunately there has been a failure to include the minority statement, which is next in the list of papers presented by the Minister. From all my knowledge of education reports this is the first time that I have seen a minority report not bound in with and presented with a major report. Those dissenters on the Commission were making a valid point in relation to the items raised by the Minister in his brief to the Commission. However, the Commission has seen fit to leave aside that minority view and have it published elsewhere. I assume that now many people will acquire the main report and not know of the existence of the minority report, which makes extremely important statements in relation to the main report. The Commission has limited itself to becoming merely an arm of the Department of Education. It no longer fulfils its function as a critical element within the education structure-to provide not only what is requested of it by the Minister but also to point out directly that when these policies are followed by the Government certain consequences will flow from them. The consequences are spelt out adequately in the minority report, to which I wish to address myself in a moment. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the minority report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission makes excellent reading for those who are concerned about education in Australia, particularly at the school level. As I said in speaking on the main report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission, the Commission has now taken a role which is similar to that of the Department of Education-that is, it acts at the behest of the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), fulfilling his wishes without making any critical comment whatever. The minority report makes some telling points that should not escape the notice of the Senate. First, the Commission has a duty to alert the Government and the Parliament to the divisive effects of the guidelines that have been put down by the Minister. It needs to make clear that government policy is a major contributing factor to the divisions which currently occur within the education community in Australia. Probably it would be easy to be cynical on this issue-I would not wish to be-and assert that this was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to divide the education lobby in this country. The Government made a promise to non-government schools and has fulfilled that promise. However, what it did not tell the electorate at the time was that the Government schools would have to pay for the promise made to non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a varied system of education in this community. That has been pointed out in the report itself. The Australian Democrats support the continuation of the private school system but our policy states clearly that we believe that government schools ought to be made so good that no one would want to go to a private school. At the moment the Government has set in motion a self-fulfilling phophecy in relation to schools. Non-government schools, by being deprived of funds, increasingly are becoming unable to cope with the strains placed upon them in the community. Consequently, parents are withdrawing their children from government schools and sending them to non-government schools. Now that that has occurred the Government is saying: 'People are moving. They are voting with their feet. They are going from government schools to non-government schools'. I believe that that is one of the most blatant results of the Government's lack of regard for non-government schools. It has so deprived them of funds that they are no longer able to compete. If the Government wishes to have free enterprise within the education sector it ought to set to work immediately to boost the only competitor to private schools, that is, the schools of the government sector. </PARA>
<PARA> One conclusion of the minority statement that I wish to emphasise is that successive annual guidelines have moved funds away from government schools. Government schools fulfil functions that are not performed by the non-government schools. If one looks at the total range of educational services which are provided one will discover a number of things. The last time I taught in a school I taught, amongst other classes, an industrial class at the grade 10 level. I had in my class of 32 four pupils who had been expelled from a private school. As a teacher in a government school I was expected to teach those children. They were a major cause of disruption within the class and a major reason for my not being able to give adequate educational attention to the other children in that class whose parents had chosen to send to a government school. </PARA>
<PARA> Government schools pick up so many of our social problems that they need a differential over and above any adequate attention that is being paid to government or non-government schools. They have to pick up the handicapped in much larger numbers than the private schools do. They have to pick up far higher percentages of first year teachers than the non-government schools do. They have to provide services in remote areas, which services are incredibly expensive. Private schools do not have to do that. There is a whole range of issues but I do not want to enter a general debate on government and non-government schools. I confine myself to the fact that government schools need additional funds. They need additional funds to carry out the task, I suggest, that this society wishes to be carried out by our schools, and that is all. All that the teachers and the parents of pupils at government schools are asking for is that these schools be equipped to carry out the task imposed on them by the governments of this country. They are not asking for any special favours or any special handouts. They are not attacking the right of parents to place their children in non-government schools. They merely ask to be treated as equal citizens in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reflect upon that table only briefly as it relates to the minority report that has been tabled here today and the remarks that Senator Macklin has just directed to that report. The first point is that the great majority of independent or non-government schools are in the lowest resource level, according to the categories laid down by the School Commission. That level is 70 per cent of the resources of government schools. They are of a lower resource level than the government schools that Senator Macklin has sought to defend. As a Liberal, I believe that it is important that the community should make available to children adequate educational resources even if they are attending independent schools that have a lower educational resource level than government schools do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point is that these tables give a comparison between funding to non-government schools and funding to government schools over the last four years. I ask honourable senators to give attention to the two pages I have incorporated in the Hansard record. They show that over four years State governments-some are of a Liberal persuasion and some are of a Labor persuasion-have increased recurrent support to government schools by 23.3 per cent and that support for non-government schools increased by 31.8 per cent. In other words, the need is so real that in recurrent terms greater support has been given by the States to non-government schools. The drop in State government funding for government schools over the four-year period was 35.9 per cent and the drop in Commonwealth funding was 32.5 per cent. But there was also a similar drop in capital expenditure on non-government schools. That drop amounted to 32.1 per cent. All of that contribution came from the Commonwealth because the States did not contribute anything at all in those years. So all States over the four-year period had a decrease of approximately 32 per cent in capital resources, irrespective of whether they were provided by this Government or by the Liberal and the Labor governments in the States. In any event, over the four-year period the net total increase in funding for state schools was 10.5 per cent. That is clearly set out on page 261 of the Schools Commission report. The increased funding for an independent school place is a fixed percentage of the cost of providing a state school place. So if funding for an independent school place increases it can be taken that expenditure for a state school has increased by a greater amount. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not welcome the minority report on this matter, especially the way in which on the final page an attempt has been made to blame this Government's so-called discrimination or divisive policy of taking money away from the state school system to give it to the independent school system. The facts of the matter are that there has been a rush of new enrolments in independent schools and this has led to a change in the emphasis of resource allocation from the government school sector to the non-government school sector. In my State of South Australia there has been a 1 per cent increase in the number of non-government school places each year for the last 10 years, and this trend will continue for the next five years because parents with their freedom of choice are deciding that that is where their children will go. The result will be reflected in terms of the financial resources that go to that sector of the community whose children are in independent schools. I bring to the Senate's attention that it is appropriate that provision be made for that group of schools at level 3 of the Schools Commission categories, those with the lowest educational resources. As a Liberal I believe we should provide those schools with something near the resources that are made available through the Commonwealth and the States to state schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Teague was really saying that the Government is doing pretty well. I have news for him. Hundreds of thousands of parents and teachers throughout Australia do not think so, and increasingly they are thinking this Government is doing worse and worse in respect of educational expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are one or two matters specifically in the minority statement on the Commonwealth Schools Commission report which I think are worthy of some comment. First, the minority report is significant because it is only the second time in the history of the Schools Commission that a minority report has been issued. The Schools Commission, by and large, when it was an independent advisory body to government, was a consensus body because when it was first established and for some period after it was the body which was recognised as changing the face of education in Australia and raising standards throughout this country. It concentrated the minds of educationists and politicians alike on the problems of the Australian schools system and on some of the solutions which could be advanced in respect of those problems. Now, under growing pressure from the present Government, the Schools Commission no longer exercises that optimistic and forward-looking function that it exercised in the past. I refer honourable senators to a couple of points in the minority report which illustrate the point I am trying to make. Page one of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission Act also allows the Commission to draw attention to the effects of directives given to it and to evaluate those effects in terms of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Our disagreement with the present report is not with the advice given in relation to the former requirement but in the decision not to refer to the latter in the context of this report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines to the Commission have become increasingly detailed and specific, over-riding its proposals on program policy and structure, and reducing its ability to exercise its own judgment on their implementation. This is a matter of concern for us. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there that that should be a matter of concern to everybody interested in education in Australia. What the minority report is stating there is that the Schools Commission is no longer an independent advisory body, not even to the extent that it can discuss in its report directives given to it by government. That is shameful. That is the sort of thing which one might expect would emanate from a department headed by Dr Goebbels rather than from an instrumentality headed by Professor Tannock. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will need to be; I understand that. The point is that what the report states is that this Government issues directives to the Schools Commission, as it has done for a number of years, but now the Commission is not allowed to comment upon those directives. If Senator Martyr thinks it is a good thing for a body which is set up under a statute to be an independent advisory body to government not to be allowed to comment upon government directives, I hope he will get up in the Senate and say so because if he did that we could have a debate about the matter. But I do not think he will do so because I am sure he does not agree that we should have an independent advisory body to government which is not even able to comment on government directives to it. That is an absurd situation. The minority report went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recent Review of Commonwealth Functions and the cumulative effects of annual guidelines have removed some discretionary powers from the Commission, endangering its ability to act as a statutory body, and suggest a view of the Commission as a department of Government. </PARA>
<PARA>For Senator Martyr's benefit, I stress that it suggested a view of the Commission as a department of the Government, not an independent advisory body to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the razor gang decisions to which the report refers. We have said in the Senate on numerous occasions, and I will say it again, that the razor gang made decisions about education which will have an effect on access to education in this country, not only now but also for the remaining years of this century. These decisions concern fundamental aspects of education policy which should not have been decided upon by four Ministers-four toadies of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-making ideological decisions about money. They should have been decided in the context of education policy. The present Minister for Education (Mr Fife) was probably the last to hear about them and the last to have an input into any decision on what this Government feels about access to education by Australian kids and access to tertiary education by people generally. Those are important matters about which the razor gang should have had nothing to say. It was none of the razor gang's business. It is the business of education policy planners to determine what the future of present Australian children will be and what the future of children, yet unborn, will be in terms of their rights to go to school and their access to education. It was no business of the razor gang, and this minority report is quite right to say so. Later in the report reference is made to the reductions in general levels of funding for government schools over the five year period. We have talked enough about that in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two points which I want to draw from this minority report and which ought to be of concern in any education debate. In the March 1981 triennial report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission, to which Senator Teague referred, considerable willingness was shown on all sides to compromise in the interests of community consensus, especially in regard to government and non-government schools. That was reflected in the 1981 triennial report. It was the last vestige of an effort to dampen down, as it were, the State aid debate which divided this society throughout the 1960s. The professional politicians on the other side of the chamber, who spend their time denigrating the Whitlam Government in the same way as we spend our time denigrating them, should be big enough in moments of great charity or alcoholism to acknowledge the fact that the Whitlam Government ended that State aid debate in Australian society with the establishment of the Schools Commission. The more the independence of the Schools Commission is eroded, as this Government is now doing with razor gang decisions and the sorts of things referred to in the minority report, the more some elements in this society, which I personally would not encourage, are induced to get back into that divisive State aid debate. That is something I would have thought we did not want in a society presided over by a Prime Minister who pledged himself to govern for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reckon Senator Martyr should read the minority report and then we can have an intelligent discussion on it. What I am concerned about-it is not just a concern of the minority but, I hope, also the concern of people such as Senator Martyr-is the fact that there is a danger that that consensus will now be broken, that it will be shattered. That will be the cumulative effect of what has been happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer in slightly greater detail to one section of the minority report, and that concerns the School to Work Transition Program which the report deals with. Honourable senators will remember that the School to Work Transition Program was introduced off the top of the head of a Minister of this Government. If any honourable senators have any doubts about the validity of that expression they have only to ask the Catholic education authorities in the various States, or the departments of education in the various States. They had 10 days notice prior to the introduction of the School to Work Transition Program. They were told: 'We are going to give you this money. Can you work out how you can possibly spend it?' The reason for that was that the Government had been criticised a lot about youth unemployment in Australia and felt that it had to put on a demonstration. It appropriated money for the purpose and then asked education departments in the States and the Catholic education authorities to dream up programs in order that the Government could look good. I suppose an election was looming at the time. That was what happened and most of the State education departments responded and said: 'Thank you very much. We already have our own programs going. They are going pretty well. Can we have some of the money to extend them?' The Government replied: 'No, we want new programs introduced, not programs that you have been working successfully for years. We want new programs introduced under the School to Work Transition Program'. So right from the beginning the program got away to a bad start with a lot of scepticism about it in education circles and a lot of concern about it in the Catholic education system and in the various State education systems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may, I will come to the point. The minority report referred to the decision to earmark substantial sums from the government schools' general recurrent and capital grants as an alternative source of funds as representing a new and serious departure in Commonwealth-State relations in education. The Fraser Government has said to the States: 'You accept our School to Work Transition Program'-a program about which the States have had very grave doubts for a long time-'and you put money into it, otherwise we will knock off money from you for the general recurrent expenditure'. I take it that this is an example of the new federalism at work-co-operative federalism, as it is sometimes called. It is politics with a bludgeon-stand and deliver.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a minute I will tell Senator Teague what some of the State Ministers have had to say about this approach. It is much more important than an education issue. It is important in the education context but it is important in relation to the whole question of Commonwealth-State relations. If a Commonwealth government can say to a State government: 'Do as we tell you or we will take some money away from you somewhere else' then it indicates the end of any notion of federalism as it is properly understood in Australia. Under section 96 of the Constitution the Commonwealth can say to a State: 'We will make money available provided you spend it for certain purposes'. A State government can say to the Commonwealth: 'You keep your money; we do not want it'. As I recall, Mr Bjelke-Petersen said that to the Labor Government. Under section 96 of the Constitution a State can knock back Commonwealth money which is tied in terms of its purpose but, under this procedure of the Fraser Government, it cannot knock it back because it will lose the amount somehow anyway. Let me refer to the passages from the triennial report which deal with this question. Senator Teague will be interested in this because he referred to that report. In its minority report the Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has been unwilling to divert part of the General Recurrent Grants Program to finance other priorities, however important they may be. To do so would be to involve States in a disruptive upheaval of ongoing programs. Severe personnel deployment problems would arise if funds diminished and the hard-won achievements in quality and in standards would be generally jeopardised. Community confidence would be shaken and much of the in-built flexibility available to States to respond to the particular needs of individual schools would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment was endorsed by Mr Mossenson, the Director-General of the Department of Education in Western Australia. Since then his Minister, Mr Grayden, has been highly critical of the Commonwealth Government. Mr Mossenson still signed the majority report and ignored the minority report, which Senator Martyr-I notice that he has left the chamber-has said does not have much credibility. I think it is Mr Mossenson who does not have much credibility. Senator Martyr ought to take the matter up with him when he goes back west. What did Mr Hunt, the Minister of Education in Victoria, have to say about the proposal of earmarking, as it is called; that is, putting a gun at the head of the States and telling them that they will have to do what the Commonwealth wants or they will not get any further money? I wish to refer to a few passages in a statement made by Mr Hunt dated 3 August 1981 which is called 'Resolving the Transition Fiasco'. In that document Mr Hunt set out a policy which was, he said, embarked on without regard to the views of the States or to their lack of financial capacity. It is a policy which, he said, will act to the detriment of existing State policies and programs. Mr Hunt said:</PARA>
<PARA> All Ministers pointed out-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, at the Australian Education Council meeting-</PARA>
<PARA>that in the financial situation which the States were facing, their education budgets were constrained and that the request to provide additional funds from State sources could only be met by dropping other valuable programmes or distorting existing priorities which they were not prepared to do. The Commonwealth accepted that situation. </PARA>
<PARA>At the meeting of Ministers which was held in Melbourne last year the Commonwealth accepted that situation. Mr Hunt further said that the Commonwealth had completely changed its attitude. It has embarked upon a scheme which provides for a completely arbitrary division of the funds between the TAFE sector and the school sector which is extremely difficult for the State education departments to administer and it is not necessarily relevant to the sort of strictures which they have in each of the different States. Mr Hunt went on at great length to discuss the difficulties. It is the constitutional point which I want to stress as most important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have qualifications about them. I do not think one can say that one supports all the transition programs. Some of them are good; some of them are not. In relation to the Victorian Government's stand on the transition programs, Mr Hunt stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite this stand, it should be noted that many educationalists and community leaders have doubts about the program on a number of grounds. Firstly, some consider that the Commonwealth seems to believe it has discovered the concept, whilst the States have in fact been giving effect to it for a great many years! Secondly, they point out that the Commonwealth's contribution in the field has largely been to date by way of high sounding policies oft repeated, rather than substantial effort. </PARA>
<PARA>I recall that the School to Work Transition Program was introduced as a new initiative of the Fraser Government on seven different occasions. Every time the Minister went anywhere he kept introducing it as a new initiative. It was like Mussolini's Air Force: It turned up in all sorts of places but it comprised the same planes. Mussolini thought he had an enormous air force but he had only six planes. That is what the School to Work Transition Program has been like. It was introduced, on my count, seven times as a new initiative. Mr Hunt, the Liberal Minister of Education in Victoria, described it in terms of high sounding and oft repeated policies of the Commonwealth rather than substantial effort. He may be a bit of a cynic about that-I do not know-but that is his view. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Its financial contribution-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Commonwealth's-</PARA>
<PARA>so far has been marginal by comparison with that of the States. Thirdly, some people believe that there has been an undue degree of ''scape-goating'' in the exercise! Some Federal politicians have seemed to use it as an answer to unemployment or as an attempt to throw the blame for unemployment onto education systems rather than the state of the economy and the absence of employment opportunities for the young. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the matters with which I agree. I agree with the Liberal Minister of Education in Victoria about that. Some Federal politicians have used references to the School to Work Transition Program in an attempt to throw the blame for unemployment on the education systems and in an attempt to explain away youth unemployment when, in fact, there are no jobs. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>3rd August, 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Victorian Education Minister Mr. A. J. Hunt</PARA>
<PARA>RESOLVING THE TRANSITION FIASCO</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's ''offer'' to the States on transition education for the year 1982 is unacceptable to every State. It is not an offer at all: it is an attempt to impose a Commonwealth policy on States and to force them to contribute equally with the Commonwealth to the implementation of that policy, without regard to their views or to the lack of financial capacity in the States to take that course without detriment to existing State policies and programmes. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the States must forego their own programmes for the sake of implementing a Commonwealth programme under pain of financial disability if they fail to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines give the impression that the Commonwealth is providing $75m. in 1982 for transition education. In fact, the Commonwealth is providing only $27m. (i.e. $4m more than in 1981) to Government schools for this purpose. $2m. is being provided to non Government schools. The States are being required to provide a matching $27m from their own funds and if they fail to do so their general recurrent grants will be docked accordingly. This is called ''ear marking'', and is a way of reminding the States that the Commonwealth collects the revenues and can call the shots. In other words, if the States do not participate at all their general recurrent grants will be reduced by $27m anyway! If they find only $13 1/2m their general recurrent grants will be reduced by $13m. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the States are being required to find $19m. from their building programmes-which have already been seriously depleted as a result of Commonwealth Loan Council restraints-and to apply this sum towards capital works or equipment which will assist in transition and to do so regardless of the urgency and priority of other building projects. Again, the ''ear marking'' approach is used to enforce compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the so-called $75m for transition is made up as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$m  Commonwealth Transition Funds  27  Contribution by States to programmes enforced by 'ear marking'  27  Similar re-direction of State Capital funds  19 Commonwealth funds for non-Government schools  2</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>  Total  75</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>  Seen in this light, the offer is hardly as magnanimous as may have first appeared. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of forcing the States in this way is absolutely new in Federal/State relations. When a tied grant is offered under Section 96 of the Constitution (whether or not subject to equal or percentage matching by the State) the State has the right to accept or reject it. In this case the State is being given no opportunity even to reject-for if a State says that it is financially unable to participate because of its existing priorities, it loses funds equal to that which the Commonwealth desires it to spend. This is worse than blackmail: it is plain extortion. It is contrary to the concept of the Constitution and of a Federal compact, contrary to the whole course of past financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States and completely contrary to the objectives of the New Federalism policies upon which the Fraser Government came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to be a new Treasury device now tried for the first time in the education field which, if accepted or accomplished, would quickly spread to other fields. It could clearly be applied across the whole gamut of State responsibilities to impose the views and policies of the Commonwealth Government of the day upon the States and to enforce the implementation of its policies by the States, regardless of the results of their own Elections and of the policies and priorities of their Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The course being taken is all the more astonishing in view of the results of a meeting of the Australian Education Council (comprising Education Ministers of the Commonwealth and all States) held in Melbourne last year. At that meeting all States advised the Commonwealth that they welcomed the injection of additional Federal funds into the education system to be used specifically for improving programmes to prepare young people for the workplace and life after leaving school. The States all informed the Commonwealth that they already undertook considerable work and expended substantial funds in this area and could not afford further contributions from their own resources. Thus, only the funds provided by the Commonwealth could enable extra effort in this field and those funds could not be wholly or partly matched by the States. All ministers pointed out that in the financial situation which the States were facing, their education budgets were constrained and that the request to provide additional funds from State sources could only be met by dropping other valuable programmes or distorting existing priorities which they were not prepared to do. The Commonwealth accepted that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The stance now adopted by the Commonwealth reneges completely on last year's accord. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore the scheme as now proposed by the Commonwealth is hedged in with conditions that make it an administrative nightmare or perhaps impossibility. Half must be spent in TAFE and half in schools-a completely arbitrary division which will create serious inflexibilities. It does not recognise the different ways in which the Education Departments of the different States have evolved to meet their respective and differing needs. It does not recognise the system of secondary technical education which is unique to Victoria and which undertakes a very great deal of work entrusted to TAFE in other States. </PARA>
<PARA> Then again, one-third of the $27m. envisaged by way of expenditure in the State school sector must be by way of cash grants to individual schools at the rate of $10 per pupil. This creates serious inflexibility and disregards both the concept of need and the nature and value of the programme in the individual school. To date, transition programmes have been developed for the purposes for which the funds were originally envisaged, viz., to assist those young people who are most likely to be at risk. This has meant that programmes have largely been developed in the areas of greatest deprivation and greatest youth unemployment. They have been specifically designed to assist young people in those areas to seek a place in the workforce and to remedy some of the disadvantage which they suffer as compared with young people in more affluent areas, whom the records show have greater prospects of employment. Furthermore, local and regional committees have co-operated to ensure that of the many submissions made, the programmes adopted and implemented have been those of greatest value to those most in need. No programme has been adopted simply to spend funds; but this will inevitably occur, at least in some cases, in the event of automatic payments to schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflexibility in State educational building programmes which is already of great concern in all States, will now become horrific. Commonwealth control of State borrowings for capital works through the Loan Council has meant progressively less to the States in real terms throughout the last five years. The States' capacities to undertake capital works programmes over that period have been virtually halved. In the education field this has been compounded by a reduction in real terms in the capital funds available to State education from the Commonwealth. The result has been that the State efforts in the capital field have of necessity been increasingly directed to the provision of new pupil places in areas where these are most urgently needed. The progress of major maintenance and the upgrading of old and sometimes sub-standard schools, has already been seriously retarded. The provision of desirable facilities such as libraries, home economics rooms, assembly halls, gymnasiums and activity centres, has been set back. </PARA>
<PARA> All States have found that commitments made in good faith on the basis of past funding, cannot-on the basis of capital funding which now applies-be provided for a considerable time or even in the foreseeable future. The re-direction of $19m. in capital to transition projects will further distort these programmes and further postpone essential works, even where there have been firm commitments. Community expectations may as a result be shattered without any guarantee of corresponding advantage to the same or any other community, or to its youth! And the States rather than the Commonwealth will get the blame! No reason whatever has even been advanced by the Commonwealth for this strange and unnecessary requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Commonwealth clearly still fails to recognise the extent of the very substantial State contributions to transition education in the sense of education for working life. In Victoria, the whole of the apprenticeship programme and the greater part of the work of secondary technical schools are directed to this end, as are substantial programmes in high schools and the majority of TAFE programmes. Victoria now has careers teachers and career education programmes throughout is high and technical schools and conducts a highly successful Work Experience programme as well as Link Courses and Shared Resources programmes. In addition the Victorian Institute of Secondary Education is devoted entirely to facilitating the movement of students from school to work or for further study. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the unique Victorian technical school system-which is almost entirely devoted to transition education-is $270m., whilst the cost of the other activities mentioned takes the direct and indirect expenditure of Victoria on transition to roughly $300m. This surely makes the $7.4m. now offered by the Commonwealth to Victoria look miniscule by comparison and the strictures accompanying it somewhat petty and ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981 Victoria is due to receive $6.7m. from the Commonwealth for transition, unmatched by the State except of course as to the substantial effort mentioned above. In 1982, under the Commonwealth's proposals, Victoria should receive $7.4m. in Commonwealth funds for the same purpose-an increase of $700,000. In return the State must provide $6m. from its depleted capital works programme for transition works or equipment and $7.4m. contribution towards transition programmes, in addition to meeting the increased costs arising from inflation in respect of the substantial existing effort already described. We simply cannot afford to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government fully recognises the vital importance of education for the workplace and for life after leaving school. As it has already demonstrated, it is willing to assist in the Commonwealth's policy of further upgrading effort in this field through the most effective expenditure of additional Commonwealth funds available. Victoria simply seeks the capacity to do so, without shackles that make the task impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this stand, it should be noted that many educationists and community leaders have doubts about the programme on a number of grounds. Firstly, some consider that the Commonwealth seems to believe it has discovered the concept, whilst the States have in fact been giving effect to it for a great many years! Secondly, they point out that the Commonwealth's contribution in the field has largely been to date by way of high sounding policies oft repeated, rather than substantial effort. Its financial contribution so far has been marginal by comparison with that of the States. Thirdly, some people believe that there has been an undue degree of ''scape-goating'' in the exercise. Some Federal politicians have seemed to use it as an answer to unemployment, or as an attempt to throw the blame for unemployment onto education systems rather than the state of the economy and the absence of employment opportunities for the young. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these three criticisms, three new ones have now emerged on the new basis of funding proposed by the Commonwealth: fourthly it is virtually impossible for the States to comply with the financial requirements and the strictures and rigidities which the Commonwealth seeks to impose. To do so would in any event seriously distort State priorities and erode existing programmes of established value. Fifthly, the financing is a three card trick upon the States and misleads the public as to the extent of the Commonwealth effort. As seen, Victoria must find an additional $13.4m. to get $7.4m.-or more correctly, to get a mere $700,000 more from the Commonwealth than it received in 1981. Sixthly, the Constitutional implications of the approach which has been adopted by the Commonwealth are horrendous. It could lead to ''New Centralism'' in place of New Federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The unnecessary and unreasonable inflexibilities inherent in the proposal must be removed, and the requirement for further payment by the States, regardless of their existing effort, must be abandoned as agreed last year. When that occurs, the programme will operate in its true perspective as an effort by the Commonwealth to contribute in a modest way to the achievement of further results in this field. Until that does occur, no State can afford to accept the ''offer''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Last year I and the then Senator the Honourable Justin O'Byrne were representatives from this chamber at the Inter-parliamentary Union Conference in East Berlin. One gains many impressions at conferences such as that, and one of the main impressions I came away with was the high standing in which Australia is held at such an international forum. I think it fair to say that that is a reflection on the delegations that have represented Australia. For the past three years Dr Harry Edwards has been the leader of the delegation and the Honourable C. K. Jones the deputy leader. They are held in high regard because of the way they handle the delegation and put Australia's case. Of course, they do not always agree in that forum. It was quite interesting to note how some of the countries looked aghast at the Australian delegation when the leader got up and put one case and the deputy leader got up and put a contrary case. They could not understand that at the end of the day we were still all basically good friends. Such is the calibre of our leader and deputy leader that Australia's standing there is very high. That is one of the major impressions I received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My position was on the political committee, which dealt with three major matters. The first was the occupation by Russia of Afghanistan. It was interesting that, although we were literally in the front yard of the Eastern bloc, there was no support for Russia's operation other than from its own cohorts. The Third World was quite trenchant in its denunciation of the invasion of Afghanistan. It was quite an interesting battle of tactics because we knew, and the whole world knew, our position and the position of the Western bloc. So the focus of attention was on the delegations from the Third World countries. Because obviously we did not want the Third World countries to appear to be operating in cohesion with us, we literally sat back and noted the position they took. The Third World took a very positive position on this unwarranted invasion. As was the case in this House, even though we had our differences over that invasion, there was a general consensus at the IPU about the condemnation of such an action. As I said before, it was interesting to see how trenchant the Third World was in its denunciation of that action. </PARA>
<PARA> We were asked to come up with a declaration on a zone of peace for the Indian Ocean. I confess that I tried to get out of being on the drafting committee but, as I indicated before, Australia is held in high regard so we were drafted on to that committee. Being on that committee was an interesting experience for me. We formed a small sub-committee of nine members to come up with a form of words with which all people could agree. Recognising the problems that existed, recognising that at that time Iran was holding the American diplomats, recognising that India had exploded a nuclear bomb and that Pakistan appeared to be on the way to doing so, yet we were able to come up with an agreed form of words on a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. To complicate matters, while we were there Iraq and Iran, which up to that stage were arguing, actually broke out into active hostilities. It was felt that we could not come away from such a Union meeting without making reference to that. Of course, that was early days and we did not set out, with the information we had, to apportion blame. The Australian delegation was asked to come up with a resolution-we had quite a few co-sponsors-and the resolution was put to the full plenary session and carried. As I said, we did not apportion blame. Rather, we wanted to acknowledge that there was a conflict between two states, one a member of the IPU, and point out that they should solve their disputes by other than hostile means. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I place on record my appreciation of the two officers who served us. Mr Bert Nicholls, from the Department of the Senate, has concluded his work with the IPU delegation. Miss Sue Boyd, a parliamentary liaison officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs, will conclude her work at the end of the forthcoming meeting in Cuba. Both officers have served us very well. Mr Nicholls, with his unique ability in administration and knowledge of proceedings, saw that everything was done well. Miss Boyd had a great knowledge of Australia's attitude on many issues that arose. More particularly, her ability to speak four languages came in very handy. At one stage when I was in the political committee meeting she was able to converse in French with the Algerians on our left and in German with the Austrians on our right. It certainly made negotiations a lot easier when we were drafting resolutions. As a back-up, Sue also speaks Portuguese, which meant that we had entree to South American delegations when that was needed. I think that should be on record. I place on record my appreciation and, I am sure, the appreciation of all those members who have been a part of the IPU delegations in years past, of both Mr Bert Nicholls and Miss Sue Boyd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators have shown keen interest in scientific work which the Government has commissioned in an effort to answer some of the questions being asked by Australian veterans about the relationship of service in Vietnam to their state of health. At an early stage of these parliamentary sittings I would therefore like to give the Senate a brief progress report. As is well known, the Commonwealth Institute of Health in Sydney has carried out a considerable amount of work in preparation for a major epidemiological survey. An essential precursor to any such survey is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of gathering medical and other information from both Vietnam veteran and control groups, the relative merits of different data collection methods and administrative procedures. The Institute's basic data collection and coding work for the pilot study is at an advanced stage. The response from veterans is considered to have been very good, particularly in the case of the telephone and home interviews. The next phase of the pilot study involves several months analysis before a report assessing the various approaches can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question continues to be posed from some quarters as to why the Government will not be making public the analyses made in the pilot study. For the sake of clarity, let me repeat the reason: The pilot study involves a sample of only 300 veterans who served in Vietnam and 300 who did not. Scientifically valid results could simply not be expected from such a small sample. Some of the information from the Institute's work which will be able to be made public is that which emerges from the mortality study. It is expected that results from this study, which will analyse the causes and rates of death in veterans, should be available before the middle of next year. The Government has been conscious of the need to try to get some additional information on matters of acute concern to the community, particularly since it is likely that most other results from a major epidemiological study would not be available before 1983. After detailed consultation with its scientific advisers, it has identified a possible new line of approach in an area which is perhaps the one of the greatest single worry to veterans and their families, that of birth defects. I have now asked the Commonwealth Institute of Health to explore urgently the feasibility of a study of congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth, by means of a case-control study in which the Institute would hope to have the cooperation of major obstetric hospitals in Australia. If, as I hope, this project proves to be realisable, it will represent a valid, economical and relatively quick means of obtaining guidance on whether service in the Australian Army in Vietnam is associated with an increased risk of birth defects. While continuing work on the projects already announced, the Government will be examining the possibility of initiating any other studies which have the prospect of answering questions about the relationship of veterans' health to their Vietnam service. Along with the array of measures available under the repatriation system, and the newly announced counselling service, this scientific work is seen as an integral part of the Government's total effort to help in the resolution of veterans' problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome at least some statement from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in relation to Vietnam veterans. Veterans in Australia have now been told that they must wait until at least 1983 for anything to come from the study being undertaken by the Commonwealth Institute of Health. It seems at least that the Government has recognised the inadequacy of the study currently under way and is seeking to rectify that mistake by engaging in other studies which are more relevant to the veterans themselves. I have previously characterised as a confidence trick, the start of this study last year for the 45,000 or so veterans of the Vietnam war. I do not withdraw that because I believe that that study, in pure research terms, cannot be substantiated. Nor is it possible that that study will help individual veterans unless the repatriation tribunals accept the results as applying to individuals. As honourable senators will know, any statistical study refers only to the totality and not to the individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is an even more important problem with the study, and I refer to the control group. As honourable senators are well aware, Australia makes great use of the types of chemicals which were used in Vietnam. Indeed, in my own State we dip our oranges in them in response to a recommendation from the Department of Primary Industry. But where precisely are there, even in a pilot study, 300 people who have not been exposed to these chemicals? The whole point of a control group, as anybody who has undertaken any research will know, is to get a group of people who are not subject to the variety of effects that one is attempting to study. How precisely-we are not told in the Minister's statement although we have asked time and again-are the research people undertaking to get a group of people who have not been exposed either to 2, 4, 5-T or 2, 4-D? Where do they exist in Australia and how do we know they have not been exposed? Unless we can get that control group we will not be able to get an effective statistical study. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures that I have available indicate that we use somewhere in the order of 2,000 tonnes of 2, 4-D and 300 tonnes of 2, 4, 5-T annually in this country for a variety of agricultural purposes and for a variety of cleansing operations. It may very well be that even in the centre of Sydney we could pick a group of people who could be affected by a number of these chemicals. This is of extreme concern, I would suggest, not so much to honourable senators here, who are not affected by this problem, but to the veterans and their families. They cannot wait until 1983 for the results of the study. I have met a number of them and I am sure the Minister has also. The personal problems of those families are enormous. There is the problem of the breadwinner not being able to control his temper and the effect that that has on his wife and children. There is the problem of constant rashes and itches and the problem of not being able to concentrate. Those problems affect not only the veterans but also their parents, families and friends. It is their friends who see, as I have seen, a mother become insane because she blamed herself for the death of her child. That happened before she knew that the child's death may have been due to other causes. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to put aside this particular study and wait no longer to assist those veterans; to accept now that we have sufficient evidence that they are being affected by the things that occurred in Vietnam. If it turns out in 1983 that we were wrong, that money still will have been well spent on them. What does it matter? I am sure nobody in Australia would begrudge the expenditure of that amount of money on our veterans, on those types of people who are quite willing to go along with the Government and the Government's policy and to fight for this country in a war which many other senators and I opposed. Nevertheless, although I was opposed to that war I am not opposed to the veterans. I am not opposed to those people who felt it was their duty to serve. I am not opposed to spending money-and neither is anybody else in this country-to assist those people in their hour of need. Their hour of need is now. It is not 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Government no longer seek to continue this study as a mechanism whereby in 1983 we will be able to say that statistically our veterans have a range of problems not of the same order as found within the rest of the population of the country. We already know that. I would much prefer that the Minister put his energies into those other matters which he mentioned within the statement and looked and moved urgently to assist those veterans and their families. He should accept without further study the problems they have and give the Vietnam veterans in this country the type of support and assistance that every senator knows they are appealing to us for every day whether it be personally, by letter or by telephone. If the Minister has not received those requests I am quite willing to supply him with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented by an article appearing in the National Times last weekend headed ' Hung Senate: Fraser's Growing Nightmare'. Referring to the debate about the new Deputy President, this article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there was one single clause of it it was this: in the byzantine world of Tasmanian politics Peter Rae and Brian Harradine are old enemies. In Tasmania, right-wing forces and B. A. Santamaria's National Civic Council have largely coalesced around Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1970s they attempted to infiltrate the small Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Rae fought them vigorously-including with a column he wrote at the time for the Australian. In June, 1977, for example, he wrote a piece entitled ''What, Who and Why is the NCC?'' He questioned its funding, its objectives, and its designs on the Tasmanian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence his relations with Harradine, inside and outside Parliament, have been frosty. </PARA>
<PARA>This view is being assiduously fostered by the distribution to journalists of selective Press reports concerning some internal fights in the Liberal Party of Australia. I wish the Senate to know that I know nothing of these internal fights in the Liberal Party and I have no interest in them. I wish also to assure the Senate and Senator Peter Rae that I have no personal antipathy to him and I certainly did not know that he had any towards me until he advised his colleagues in 1979 not to support me when I was defending myself against the false allegations made in this place by another senator as to Trades Hall funds. I am, of course, aware of the fact that in the context of the last election Senator Peter Rae and the former Tasmanian Liberal President, Mr Wing, expressed the view that my election to the Senate and the loss of government control of the Senate would be a disaster and that the preservation of freedom was at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> My motives relating to my actions concerning the Deputy President can be found in the arguments I put forward in the motion I moved last Tuesday week and in the remarks I made in opposition to the proposition last Thursday. These were based on my consideration of the most cost-effective way the Senate can run and the responsibilities that are imposed on the President by the Senate, the Constitution and Standing Orders and on you, Mr Deputy President, by Standing Orders. Finally, I wish the Senate to know that my decisions in this place are determined solely on the merits of particular cases, the circumstances surrounding them and whether I judge them to be in the interests of the people who elected me, namely, the people of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA>Before I commence the second reading speech I point out to honourable senators that the copy of the second reading speech which has been circulated has a mistake in the page order. Pages 4 and 5 should be reversed and they will be reversed in subsequent printing of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I introduce this Bill as a private member, but with the full support of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and of the Australian Democrats. I am happy to acknowledge the support and co-operation of the Australian Democrats, in particular of the spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Macklin. </PARA>
<PARA>Description of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is specifically designed to respond to the announced intention of the Queensland Government to abolish Aboriginal reserves in Queensland. It will make possible the granting of freehold title to Aboriginals for land which constituted Aboriginal reserves as at 31 March 1978. The major provisions of the Bill are: An optional system of self-management which will not be able to be circumvented by the Queensland Government; the ability to make a land rights claim in respect of the reserves; power for the Federal Minister to acquire the claimed land from the Queensland Government under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955; the setting up of an Aboriginal land trust in respect of each reserve acquired; minerals to remain the property of the State but mining to be allowed only if either the land trust agrees or where both Houses of the national Parliament pass a resolution that mining must go ahead in the national interest; and where mining does proceed the Aboriginal owners of the land to be entitled to compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that none of the principles of this Bill is radical or new. They have all been espoused in legislation enacted by the Parliament; that is, in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 or in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Committees Self-management Act) 1978. The course of action set out in the Bill was recommended by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitution and Legal Affairs, November 1978. The principles upon which this Act is based were also reaffirmed by the Senate when it passed on 20 February 1975 the following motion moved by Senator Bonner:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate accepts the fact that . . . Aborigines . . . were in possession of this entire nation . . . (and) urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership . . . and . . . to compensate . . . Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. </PARA>
<PARA>I must point out that the provisions in this Bill do not attempt to deal with the question of the land rights of Queensland Aboriginals in its entirety, much less with the general question of land for Aboriginals living in other States of Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Those questions remain to be addressed, and it is not intended that this legislation will preclude any further legislative action to provide Aboriginal land rights in Queensland or elsewhere. This Bill applies only to reserve lands. The 3,048,917 hectares comprising the land area of Queensland Aboriginal reserves amounts to 1.8 per cent of the total Queensland land area of 172,000,000 hectares. When the various Torres Strait island reserves are added to the Aboriginal reserves the percentage of Queensland land areas affected is approximately 2 per cent. Surely there can be no argument that the claim of 2 per cent of Queensland for Aboriginals is anything other than a reasonable claim. </PARA>
<PARA>Brief History of Aboriginal Reserve Lands in Queensland</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>We must remind ourselves that a bloody war was waged across the Australian continent by the British colonialists in order to wrest it from its indigenous inhabitants, the Aboriginal people. In Queensland, as in other States, European settlement was achieved by the violent eviction and dispossession of Aboriginal people from every region where white settlers chose to live. Aboriginal resistance was met with brute force by white settlers using the superior power of the gun against spear and club. Mass poisonings were common. For example, at Kilcoy, Queensland in 1842, 60 Aboriginals were poisoned by flour laced with strychnine in retaliation for the killing of two white men and a prize bull. In Queensland alone there are records of mass poisonings at Laidley, North Pine River, McIntyre River, Warrego, Maroochy River, Maryborough, and so the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Even greater numbers of Aboriginal people were murdered by indiscriminate shooting parties. In the nineteenth century it was common practice by squatters and authorities alike to avenge the death of each European with the slaughter of up to 50 Aboriginals-men, women and children. The history of nineteenth century Queensland is riddled with records of such massacres. By 1880 Aboriginal people-deprived of their rivers, their hunting grounds and their land, devastated by alcohol and opium and by introduced diseases such as syphillis and leprosy, and decimated by the murderous vengeance of white settlers-were in danger of total extermination. </PARA>
<PARA> I recount this sad and deplorable chapter in Australian history because to understand the current stand by Queensland Aborigines, their angry refusal to accept leases to their land and their demand for land rights, it is necessary to appreciate the circumstances under which Aboriginal people lost their land. In 1897 the Queensland Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act was passed. This legislation empowered the Government to move Aboriginals forcibly on to reserves and to keep them there. Over the next 50 years the governments of Queensland attempted to move the entire Aboriginal population on to reserve lands. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1897 legislation also embodied a comprehensive legislative denial of Aboriginals' fundamental human rights. The Act provided for control over freedom of movement, the right to seek employment, the right to wages or moneys, the care, custody and education of children and the practice of rites and customs in respect of Aboriginals. Control over most of these was vested in the local 'Protectors'-usually the local police. They could imprison Aboriginals without trial for breaking regulations or for failing to maintain good order. Amendents to the Act were passed in 1901 in order to curtail the rapidly growing half-caste population which the Queensland Government regarded as highly undesirable. Protectors were given the right to control marriage of female Aboriginals, and visitors to reserves were prohibited. Concern over the 'half-caste problem', as it was called, continued until, in 1934, a further amending Act made sexual intercourse between an Aboriginal woman and a non-Aboriginal man an offence. Such was the regime on Aboriginal reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1927 and 1971 a series of Acts was passed through the Queensland Parliament providing and modifying specific laws in respect of Aboriginals. Some of the more outrageous violations of human rights, such as the right to control marriage, were withdrawn in the 1965 Act and in 1966 regulations formally establishing Aboriginal councils were introduced. However, overall the position of Queensland Aboriginals and particularly of those on reserves has remained one of significant disadvantage and restriction of freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acts currently governing Queensland Aboriginals and their life on reserves are the Aborigines Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act, passed in 1971 and amended in 1974, 1975 and 1979. These Acts implement significant violations of the human rights and freedoms of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal reserve councils do not have control of access to reserves; reserve managers retain veto powers over who comes and goes. </PARA>
<PARA> Residence on reserves is a privilege, revocable at any time by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Aborigines on reserves can still be required to work for token payment. </PARA>
<PARA> Transactions entered into by Aboriginals may be varied or cancelled by the Director of the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, a provision which can seriously inhibit people from entering into any agreement with an Aboriginal or an Islander. </PARA>
<PARA> Court proceedings for Queensland Aborigines on reserves are conducted according to rules different from those of other courts; for example, representation is allowed only 'subject to the consent of the court'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the Queensland Acts and their regulations and by-laws represent a fundamental violation of human rights and are in contravention of Australia's obligations under international conventions, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for which Australia voted in the United Nations General Assembly 1948, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights signed and ratified by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Why This Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has come into conflict with the Queensland Government over Queensland's treatment of Aboriginal people on numerous occasions. The passage by the Whitlam Government of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 and the passage by the Fraser Government of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978 reflect attempts by Federal governments, in line with their constitutional responsibility, to protect the rights of Aboriginal Australians. As documented in the reports of the Commissioner for Community Relations, the Queensland Government under Mr Bjelke-Petersen has consistently failed to uphold the rights of Queensland Aboriginals. Mr Bjelke-Petersen's Government is responsible, for example, for the refusal to transfer land titles to Aboriginal land purchasers, thus Aboriginals in Queensland have been prevented from purchasing freehold land. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bjelke-Petersen's announcement during the last Queensland election campaign that he would repeal the iniquitous Aborigines and Torres Strait Islander Acts was welcomed by the Federal Opposition. However, Mr Bjelke-Petersen's indication that he would also abolish Aboriginal reserves in Queensland by de-gazettal under the Queensland Lands Act, was not. Aboriginal people in Queensland have made it quite clear that a system of 50-year leases, proposed by the Premier is unacceptable to them. Such a system fails to give Aboriginals any security of tenure. It also fails to recognise the Aboriginal people's prior ownership of the land and the injustice of their present dispossessed state. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already stated, this legislation embodies only those principles already enacted in pieces of legislation that have passed through this Senate. It is in line with, and is in fact a logical consequence of, Senator Bonner's 1975 motion passed by the Senate to recognise the prior ownership of the Australian continent by the Aboriginal people. It has been drafted in response to calls from Aboriginal people and it has been drafted in consultation with Aboriginal people. Not only did Aboriginal people lobby for this Bill, but I also had representations from hundreds of fair minded non-Aboriginal Australians, and from numerous churches and other organisations, including: The Uniting Church; the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace; the Australian Council of Churches; the Aboriginal Advancement League of Victoria; the National Campaign for Land Rights and Self-management in Queensland; Action for Aboriginal Rights, Victoria; the Jamieson Division of Social Justice and Ecumenical Mission-Uniting Church, Victoria; the Diocesan Synod-Anglican Diocese of Rockhampton; Fairplay, Queensland; the Australian Student Christian Movement; Tamaresk Presbytery-Uniting Church in Australia; the Queensland Association of Professional Anthropologists and Archaeologists; and the Northern Queensland Land Council. The Bill is in line with the major recommendation of the recent World Council of Churches report entitled 'Justice for Aboriginal Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA> The necessity for Federal action on this issue has been exhaustingly investigated by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1978 Report on Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on Queensland Reserves. That bipartisan Committee found:</PARA>
<PARA> 74. The Committee notes that, since the amendment of the Constitution in 1967 to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to Aboriginals, most attempts have failed to achieve any co-operative arrangement with the Queensland Government regarding management and control of the affairs of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in that State and the current agreement in respect of local government arrangements cannot, as yet, be seen as successful or as generally acceptable to the residents of Aurukun and Mornington Island. The Committee accordingly bases its recommendations regarding Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland on the assumption that co-operation between the Commonwealth and Queensland is not likely to provide a full and sufficient discharge of Commonwealth obligations to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland and that some unilateral action by the Commonwealth will therefore be likely to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> 75. In cases where the effective management and control of their own affairs by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders requires the continued occupation of specific lands by those people, the Committee considers that some acquisition of property must form part of the legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is entitled to an explanation of why I am introducing this private member's Bill in this form at this time. The answer is that Queensland Aboriginals living on reserves are facing a crisis, a crisis which is likely to be resolved against their interests by the Government of Queensland, a crisis which can only be resolved in their interests and in the interests of justice if the Federal Parliament acts. </PARA>
<PARA> I have documented the long history of abuse and oppression of the residents of Aboriginal reserves in Queensland. In recent years this Senate has had further evidence of the determination of the present Government of Queensland to deny to Aboriginal reserve dwellers the two things they asked for, the two things to which they are indisputably entitled. They asked for and they are entitled to, self-management; they asked for and they are entitled to freehold ownership of their land. Neither of these requests will be met unless the Federal Government meets them. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw in the events affecting the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities in 1978 that the Queensland Government was not prepared to allow a system of untrammelled self-management. We know, because the Premier of Queensland has said it publicly time and time again in recent weeks, that he and his Government are bitterly opposed to freehold title for Aboriginals on reserves. We know that whatever leasing system he is prepared to introduce after the degazettal of the reserves, that leasing system will not meet the demands of Aboriginal people for fair and just treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking this action I am acting in accordance with the constitutional responsibility of the Federal Parliament as established by the referendum on Aboriginal rights in 1967. I am acting according to established legal principles and the recommendations of a standing committee of this Senate. I also have the support of a number of major church and Aboriginal welfare organisations. Further, I am acting in accordance with the policy of the Australian Labor Party and in co-operation with and with the full support of the Australian Democrats. Most importantly I am acting according to the expressed wishes of Aboriginal people in Queensland at a time when their own State Government refuses to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no constitutional reason, no legal reason, no philosophical reason, why Government senators should not support this initiative. There is an overwhelmingly practical political reason why they should. If the Senate passes this legislation and sends it to the House of Representatives for consideration by the people's House then surely the Government will respond positively. There is an urgent character to my initiative. The threatened degazettal of the reserves is imminent and we saw in 1978 how quickly the Queensland Government can act in order to pursue its policy of denying land rights to its Aboriginal citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Also contributing to the urgent character of this initiative is the imminence of an important international event to be held in this country. I refer, of course, to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Melbourne from 28 September and hosted by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The recent history of the Commonwealth, and a very honourable history it has been in recent years, has been one of eliminating colonialism, supporting independence for indigenous populations of former colonies and opposing racism in all its forms, including its most obnoxious form of apartheid. I believe it is entirely proper and timely that this Senate should act in accordance with this recent proud history of the Commonwealth. By supporting this Bill, the Senate will contribute to the banishing of the remnants of colonialism in this country, to the recognition of the rights of the indigenous population and to the elimination of racism and the conditions in which racism can flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> I present this initiative as a positive step in a spirit of co-operation. I have acknowledged the full co-operation in this matter by the Australian Democrats. I believe that they are to be congratulated and that their action in this matter so early in their history as a political party of significance does them great honour and credit. I hope for the co-operation of Government senators, many of whom have expressed in this place the same sentiments which motivate my action. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were quite unaware that this contingent notice of motion would be moved. I say to Senator Georges that if there is a desire to rearrange or change the business, it would help us on this side of the chamber if we had notice of it. This matter has come upon us totally unexpectedly and we have had no chance to consider our position or consider what it means for the whole Senate. The motion represents a desire on the part of Senator Haines to alter the General Business order to give precedence to a motion of concern to the Australian Democrats. The order of business was determined by arrangement between some groups within the Senate. The motion I moved and the order of business agreed upon represent a concensus view of what is fair for the whole Senate-to try to group some of the business for the Senate's consideration. I say to Senator Haines that if the Australian Democrats put to us, when drawing up the program, that there is a reason for a particular matter to be raised, it may well be that we would want to agree to it. Coming as this motion does, and following the consultations which have taken place, I indicate that it is not our intention to support the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this motion. I agree with Senator Baume that there is a great need for consultation. This morning Senator Harradine raised a matter concerning the order of General Business for tonight which caused me concern. I discussed that matter today with one of the Party Whips, but only after the Notice Paper had been issued. No consultation was carried out with us prior to that. There is no point in Senator Baume's statement. If there is to be consultation, it will have to be all ways. Of course, Senator Haines is perfectly within her rights to move this motion. It is of interest to the Australian Democrats, and I regard it as within my rights to second that motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words because I have an interest in this matter. I thought my interest was indicated the other day by a vote in the Senate when the matter was put to it. Although the vote was in favour of the proposition, it was not sustained because there was not an absolute majority of honourable senators. Some honourable senators were not present and so the motion went down. Senator Chipp then indicated that under another Standing Order he would give contingent notice so that when the matter came back before the Senate it would be a matter of a simple resolution. There is an urgency about this question. That is a proposition which the Senate supported. I do not remember the exact vote.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The vote in favour of the proposition was 30 to 29, but it failed to carry because the statutory majority was not attained. An expression of view has been given by the Senate. It is now desired that that be formalised and the Australian Democrats have pursued the course of giving notice of motion. I would have thought, such notice having been given, that Senator Haines would be in order in proceeding to have the matter brought on again before the Senate and that both the Australian Democrats and the Opposition would have an opportunity to speak and vote on it without being obstructed by the requirement as to the statutory majority. I repeat, the matter is urgent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Senator Peter Baume uses the term 'ambush' he shows that he has not been reading the Notice Paper. The matter is on the Notice Paper. He should have been aware that the Australian Democrats had placed the motion on notice and that it was to come up today. As far as I was concerned, there was no ambush. In fact, I was eagerly awaiting an opportunity to vote on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that the motion has the effect of bringing on the matter during the time set down for Government Business. We have already set aside Government Business in order to accommodate Senator Siddons. It is now almost 4 p.m. and it is clear that we will not be able to deal today with very much of the Government Business that is listed on the Order of Business paper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this matter I take the view that I took on the previous occasion. I am not happy about a situation in which an agreement is made across the chamber for the rearranging of business and for that course to be followed without honourable senators being given any real notification except, I admit, in respect of Orders of the Day being taken instead of General Business notices of motion. At least an indication in that regard was given on the Order of Business paper released this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have, under General Business notices of motion, a matter of substantial importance which I thought would be coming before the Senate tonight. I had asked that certain work be done on it and had myself done certain work on it. Upon reading the Order of Business paper this morning I learned that, presumably, it would not come before the Senate. A similar situation arises here. I am not in a position to vote in favour of Senator Haines' proposed motion. I say that with regret because at some stage a discussion, if need be, on the substance of that motion can take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this week, discussion took place on the proposed matter of public importance but this proposition has come up at such a time and in such a manner that I had no knowledge it was to be brought on. For those reasons I am not able at this stage to support the proposition presented by Senator Haines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to parade my views about how I might vote. That is not relevant to what we are talking about at the moment, but I must make one or two comments with respect to what has been said. Firstly, in regard to what Senator Harradine has said, no rearrangement at all was made. Arrangements are made in the morning when the Whips meet. An invitation is extended to the Australian Democrats to become involved when these arrangements are made. It is absolutely essential that we have such meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision arrived at is published in the Order of Business paper. If the honourable senator seeks prior information he can follow the same course. If he has a Whip in his party, that honourable senator could by all means be invited to the meeting. It is not a matter of rearrangement, a term which suggests that something untoward has been going on. Obviously, the business of the Senate must be arranged in the full sense of that word in order to get through the day's work, but I resent the implication that rearrangement has been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second point, the Orders of the Day, instead of General Business, have been brought on today at the request of the Opposition. As is understood by the Government, and generally understood by those who have been here for some time, Thursday night is set aside for Opposition activity. On this occasion the Opposition wanted the Orders of the Day to be brought on. I need not go into the reasons, but they were put forward at the Whips' meeting. Had honourable senators been present they would have heard the explanation. I was grateful that the Government acceded to our request to have Orders of the Day rather than General Business brought on today. If that does not suit everyone in the Senate it is to be regretted, but those who were making the decisions decided that it ought to happen. That is why the decision was made and the information published in the Order of Business paper. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to Senator Haines's motion, it appears that the Minister was caught somewhat with his pants down because he allowed the matter to go through. Senator Haines should not have said that she did not want to debate the matter. Obviously, if she puts it on notice and brings it on for debate she has little choice but to debate it, however briefly. Perhaps that is what confused the Minister. But despite what Senator Collard has said, Senator Haines is quite entitled to bring the matter on. If we vote in favour of its coming on that will happen, whether it pleases the Government or not. We are wasting an awful lot of time. We ought to take the vote, bring on the matter, have it debated, however briefly and come to some conclusion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, which I foreshadowed in my maiden speech, is designed to encourage the introduction of industrial democracy in Australian enterprises. The Australian Democrats believe the participation of employees in making decisions which affect their work place is a basic democratic right and as important as the right to vote. It was Lawrence of Arabia who said: 'We were fighting for freedom, the second of man's creeds'. He was, of course, referring to the desert battle that eventually won political freedom for the Arabs. Those who have read The Seven Pillars of Wisdom will have some appreciation of the excitement and exhilaration of that struggle. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, another freedom equally important which can be won only by careful thought and attention to detail. I refer to the humanisation of the work place, to an organisational structure that frees people to use their qualities of imagination, initiative, technical expertise, sociability and leadership during the eight-hour working day. Nothing, certainly not money, can compensate for eight hours of monotonous, mind-killing work. If people are not free to use their human qualities during the eight-hour work day, continued industrial strife is inevitable. The humanisation of the work place is one of the greatest challenges facing Australia and the Western world today, and likely to face it for the rest of this century. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules on how this can be achieved, but there are principles which, if adopted, lead us in the right direction. This Bill is designed to encourage companies to adopt these principles and work out how they can be specifically applied in their organisations. The principles are: A cellular organisational structure, profit sharing, employee share ownership and consultative councils. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill calls for the setting up of a seven-member industrial democracy board which would have three members nominated by the Minister for Industrial Relations, three nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and one nominated by the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, all for terms of three years. The board would be supported by a small secretariat. The board would create and maintain a register of industrial democracy enterprises, which would be available for public inspection. The register would list each enterprise which, in the opinion of the board, substantially complied with the criteria laid out in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> These criteria are: That at least 14 per cent of the issued share capital of the enterprise is owned by employees or held by employees under contract of sale through an employee share purchase trust; that the activities of the enterprise are carried out through autonomous working groups based on profit centres within the enterprise; that a profit sharing scheme has been established in the enterprise; and that a consultative council has been established. We believe these criteria are achievable, but we recognise that in virtually all enterprises considerable reorganisation would be required. In this legislation's first year of operation it is thus likely that only a small number of enterprises would be able to satisfy the criteria, but over a period of years more and more would see the value of this enlightened approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to examine the criteria in some detail and to discuss briefly the reasons why they have been advanced. Fourteen per cent of the issued share capital of the enterprise, or about one-seventh, seems to us to be a reasonable proportion which most companies and their employees could afford. For example, a company which had 1,000 employees and 20 million 50c shares would be required to sell 2.8 million shares to its employees, which means they would receive 2,800 each. If these were bought over five years, it would cost the employees $280 a year or $5.39 a week. However, under the procedure we have outlined, they would receive a dividend on the shares in full, so they would not be out of pocket to any great extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, the shares could be bought over a period of 10 years, in which case the company would have to declare only a 12.5 per cent dividend, allowing for average income tax of 20 per cent, for employees to enjoy a rate of return equal to their cash outlay in the first year. Once the shares were fully paid for, the employee shareholders would continue to profit as would any shareholder. Employee share ownership achieves an important synthesis between labour and capital. For too long Australia has been bedevilled by a confrontationist approach to industrial relations. Industrial democracy is an important step on the road to industrial relations sense, of which this country desperately needs a large dose. </PARA>
<PARA> Employee share ownership is not enough by itself. We believe worker involvement should and could go further, to the shop floor and throughout the enterprise. Overseas and Australian experience has shown the enormous value of autonomous working groups based on profit centres within the enterprise. One need cite only the example of Japan to be aware of the advantages of such an approach. Experience has shown that these groups are most effective when they have between 10 and 50 members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a consultative council to have half of its members elected by secret ballot of employees and half nominated by the management of the enterprise, with an alternating chairman. The council will have the function of discussing, and making recommendations to the management in respect of such things as working conditions, safety, long term planning, budgeting and internal decision-making processes. The council-I stress this-will not discuss, or make recommendations in respect of, matters directly concerning awards or rates of pay, or other matters which should be considered by trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The board would have the power to refuse registration, or to deregister enterprises which did not provide such information as the board considered necessary to inform its judgments with reasonable notice. The key point of the Bill is that tax payable by companies which satisfied the criteria of the board would be reduced by 8 per cent. Before honourable senators jump to conclusions about the cost of such a proposal, let me explain that we believe the cost to the Commonwealth would be nothing like $400m, which is what the cost would be if every company immediately met the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> Many companies, particularly multinationals, would not be willing to issue 14 per cent of their share capital to employees, or to Australians at all. The reaction of Shell to a suggestion that it sell to Australians 25 per cent of its equity in Australia presumably is typical. Our own estimate is that in the first year not more than 5 per cent of companies would meet the criteria at a cost of no more than $20m. Fortunately, however, these companies would tend to be labour-intensive companies and would therefore benefit most from the introduction of these principles. The Government would not necessarily lose out in the long run. Experience has shown the introduction of industrial democracy greatly increases efficiency and productivity-that is a most important point-and it is thus quite probable that profits, hence tax, will rise also. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill which I have presented today is simple and logical. If enacted, it would bring Australia to the forefront of those countries that have adopted an enlightened approach to industrial relations, for example, the Scandinavian countries, Germany and Japan. I commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not speak for very long on the Export Grants Acts Amendment Bill. The Opposition wishes to ask a number of questions pertaining to clause 7. The Bill changes the composition of the Export Development Grants Board so that the Chairman will be drawn from one of the four part time members of the Board and the executive officer will be the only full time member of the Board. Previously the chairman was a part time member. It is stated in the second reading speech, brief as it is, that this is in conformity with the constitution of other statutory authorities. I observe in passing that this is not entirely correct. The four major statutory marketing authorities are not constituted in this way but other statutory authorities, which are more comparable to the Export Development Grants Board-such as the Snowy Mountains Corporation and the River Murray Commission-are constituted in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has made a major amendment, although it has post-dated the operation of that amendment, to the Export Market Development Scheme and the Export Expansion Grants Scheme so that the rate of payments will be halved after June 1982. However, because of the enormous backlog still existing-it is likely to exist also at the end of June next year-under these schemes, it is unlikely that the cost to revenue will decline significantly in the financial year 1982-83. It could be questioned whether, given a deliberate policy of export disincentive by way of protection of domestic industry, it is rational to have export incentives simultaneously. In other words, it could be argued that it is quite irrational having one brigade of bureaucrats administering tariff and quote policies, which are export disincentives, and another brigade of bureaucrats administering other schemes to distribute export incentives, and then wrapping them up in the same package and mislabelling it 'small government'. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, the specific questions which I want to ask pertain to clause 7 of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum which was circulated by the Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, states that clause 7 provides for the Minister to appoint an acting member to the Board. On more detailed consideration and because of prior amendments I can see that it does do that. However, it also deletes old section 29 (9) which ensures that the validity of an action taken by the Board cannot be called into question because of technicalities concerning the time of appointment of an acting member. The new sub-section retains that provision by adding a line which guarantees the validity of actions taken by the Board, or by an acting member of the Board, where there is a defect or irregularity in, or in connection with, his appointment. This adds to the previous safety net, if you like, pertaining to the date of appointment. The Minister's explanatory notes make no mention of that change. This seems a little strange. A provision which is identical to that is contained in the Snowy Mountains Corporation legislation. There is no such clause in the River Murray Commission legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now ask the following questions: Why is it necessary to add that provision? Will it have retrospective application? In other words, if there is an irregularity or defect pertaining to the appointment of an existing or previous part time member of the Board, will that provision be relevant? Why is there no similar provision, so far as I can see, to cover actions taken by people who are regular members of the Board as distinct from acting members of the Board? The Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bill but would like to have explained those points which I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating you on your election to the office which you now occupy. This is the first opportunity I have had so to do. I understand the points raised by the previous speaker, Senator Walsh. I too believe they are worthy of consideration. I think that the importance of the Export Market Development Grants Act has to be taken into account to really appreciate that although these are only, by any standards fairly minor amendments, they are amendments to a fairly important piece of legislation that has been running since 1974. Since that time it has been of great value to the export industries. The legislation has been responsible for an enormous number of new exporters entering the field and has encouraged both people in primary industry and manufacturers to go into export.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These days world trade is affected very substantially by inflation and by the variation in currency valuations. Although there have been many variations in these areas, both up and down, since 1974, we have been able to ride them out. By controlling the inflation rate in this country as well as we have, we have been able to maintain reasonable continuity. We have become recognised around the world as a fairly reliable supplier, subject only to our industrial problems. As our economy has tightened up and has got much stronger, so has our currency value also. We have now reached the stage where selling on the world market is a far greater art than it has been in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The original Act, it must be remembered, covered a variety of areas in which expenditure could be claimed. At this juncture it is worth looking over that to see the way in which the Bill before us is covered by the original Act. Section 4 of the Act refers to expenditure incurred primarily and principally for the purpose of creating or seeking opportunities, or creating or increasing demand, for the sale for export, or export and sale, of eligible goods that have been manufactured, produced, assembled, processed or packed, or graded or sorted in Australia. It covers a very wide range, including the carrying out of market research and advertising, as well as expenses directly attributable to samples, for the making of investigations, for the selection and design of materials for packaging and labelling, and expenses for the grant and registration of rights. The assistance that has gone into the various industries concerned has been considerable. The delay in the recoupment of these amounts has always been a cause for complaint, and still is. I have many inquiries every year from people who would like to receive payment much sooner than they do. I hope that with the amount allocated in this year's Budget-$84m compared with $60m last year-we will be able to catch up considerably in those payments. </PARA>
<PARA> As the chairman of the Government members sub-committee on trade, I have had discussions with a great number of manufacturers, producers and potential exporters. I would specifically like to mention the apparel industry, with which I have had considerable contact. This industry, which has all sorts of problems on its domestic market, has really tried to start a worthwhile and meaningful export arrangement. I am chairman of the Australian Clothing Export Council, and I give the members of that body considerable credit for what they have done to get Australian goods firmly marked in the various international spheres. There are many other areas where Australia's high skills and top technology can, with effort, find new markets. We have only to look at the skills in this country to see that they would find a place anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Many industry groups, organisations and others appreciate the encouragement that the Export Development Grants Act and the Export Expansion Grants Act provide. We have much discussion about our commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. I find that more and more organisations are starting to ask what advantages apply to Australia from its participation in those areas. We find that too often Australian industries suffer both ways. We recognise the various regulations of GATT in particular, but people with whom we deal do not. I believe that any trade discussions we have in this area should take that factor into account. Any arrangements we make with other countries should take into account relationships to GATT requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also to consider that since 1974 many changes have occurred in the export trade, and I believe that incentives to export are necessary and desirable. We should look at what has happened since then to see whether the Export Grants Amendment Bill now accords fully with today's situation or whether alterations should be made to suit the current requirements. I think an announcement of a 5-year extension would be appropriate. However, if alterations are to be made, no less than two years should be the requisite minimum. It usually takes about 18 months in the pipeline before any change to an exporting program really comes to fruition, and that sort of time span would be highly desirable. We have to consider that the costs of market development have grown tremendously since 1974, and very substantial increases are necessary to restore the position, if it is the wish of the Government to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to keep our industries export conscious, and I believe consideration of the increased cost is desirable. An increase in the gross amount needs to be considered. For instance, an amount of up to $250,000 would not be an inappropriate level. In addition, an allowance to exporters for personal expenses for accommodation, meals and so on of up to $100 day could be a worthwhile inclusion. It is of great necessity to Australia that employment be retained and extended. It is also recognised that our domestic market is unlikely to increase and so export will become more important than it is now. We have no alternative on a national basis but to provide the incentives for our industries to go out and pursue the markets of the world. I look to the amendments to provide a stronger background to the Export Development Grants Board, and I certainly support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been debating the second reading of the Export Grants Acts Amendment Bill 1981. The Bill provides for the restructuring of the Export Development Grants Board so that the chairman and deputy chairman are drawn from the part time members of the Board, with the full time member being responsible for the carrying out of the Board's decisions and the day to day operations of the secretariat. The effect of this change will be to bring the Board into line with the structure of boards of other statutory authorities. Currently the Board consists of a full time Chairman and four other members who are part time, and they are drawn from a cross-section of the Australian business community.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will bring the comments made by both honourable senators to the attention of the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony). Senator Walsh asked some specific questions on clause 7. I am unable to respond immediately, for two reasons. Firstly, for some reason which I do not know the officials from the Department of Trade and Resources are not at hand. Secondly, I would need to read the original Act together with the amendments. I have noted the specific questions and I will ask the Department to give a written reply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, the Opposition has circulated three amendments for debate in the Committee stage of the Bill. All of the amendments relate to clause 29 of the Bill, and I seek the leave of the Committee to have those three amendments taken together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 14, sub-clause (2), line 12, leave out 'without warrant', insert 'in accordance with sub-section (3A)'. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 14, sub-clause (3), line 15, leave out 'without warrant', insert 'in accordance with sub-section (3A)'. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 14, after sub-clause (3), insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(3A) A constable or Officer of Customs may seize an article pursuant to sub-section (2) or (3) if, and only if-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) He acts in pursuance of a warrant properly issued by a judge or magistrate; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) He believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to act without the authority of a warrant in order to prevent the loss or destruction of the article.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, all of the amendments relate to clause 29 of the Bill, which deals with the identification of forfeited articles and makes provision for their seizure without warrant. The definition of articles forfeited to the Commonwealth appears in the extensive sub-clause (1) of clause 29, and includes such articles as not only counterfeit money itself or counterfeit prescribed securities but also, as shown in sub-paragraph (b):</PARA>
<PARA>all machines, engines, tools, plates, dies or other instruments . . . that are known to have been used, to have been adapted for use, or to be intended for use, in, or in connection with, the making of counterfeit money or counterfeit prescribed securities-</PARA>
<PARA>It also covers items known to be intended for use in that particular respect. Further down in clause 29 there are references to bullion, paper, metal, ink, die or other material that again is capable of use in this fashion and has been extracted, or is known to have been extracted, from a mint. There are further items relating to material obtained by stripping the edges off a genuine coin so as to diminish its weight. There is further provision for disfigured paper money to come into this description of forfeited articles. Finally there is a catch-all reference to articles that have been or are intended to be used in connection with the commission of an offence against this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be appreciated from this recitation of the matters contained in clause 29 (1) that quite a large array of articles are encompassed by the definition of articles forfeited to the Commonwealth and that not all of these articles can be objectively identified in advance of some proper inquiry by a judicial body as to whether in fact they are forfeited. The scheme of the provision here is to identify these things as forfeited, to make provision for their seizure, and then to allow a further procedure by which a court can actually determine, if the matter is contested, whether they satisfy this description of being forfeited articles or not. That is the background against which the Opposition's amendments must be considered. The Opposition's amendments relate to clause 29 (2) of the Bill, which provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>A constable may, without warrant, seize any article that is forfeited to the Commonwealth--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, an article that comes within the definition that I have just set out-</PARA>
<PARA>or that he has reasonable grounds to believe is forfeited to the Commonwealth, under sub-section (1). </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's concern is with this unqualified power in all cases for a constable to seize forfeited goods or goods which he believes to have been forfeited without going through the procedure of obtaining a warrant. The remaining part of clause 29, which is not the subject of this amendment, provides for a procedure whereby, as I suggested a moment ago, someone who has had an article seized in this way can in fact require the court to determine whether or not the article in question is in fact forfeited. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions contained in clause 29 providing for seizure without warrant do not in fact, I readily concede, change the existing statute law. To this extent I suppose it could be argued that they are unnecessary in this Bill. They do not change the existing statute law because section 9 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act already contains a general provision not confined to counterfeiting law relating to the seizure without warrant of goods that are forfeited to the Commonwealth under any Commonwealth statute. What this Bill does do is allow an opportunity for the legislature to improve the law and this, I suggest, is an exercise which the Senate, particularly with its new composition, should be about and which we can now be about in debating Bills of this kind. Certainly an attempt to improve the existing statute law is what this particular amendment is about. It may be that there will be further opportunity to improve the law generally in respect of search and seizure when the proposed criminal investigation Bill is debated in this Parliament. But we have been waiting for the appearance of a criminal investigation Bill for something like six years now, since the carriage of such a Bill was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission, and I am afraid that I will believe in the existence of such a drafted Bill and the present Government's commitment to it only when I see it. I suspect that that Bill is still a long way away. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, and will be, I suppose, a temptation, even with the enactment of a criminal investigation Bill-if it ever happens-to leave existing pockets of exception or exemption to new rules about search and seizure alone. There will always be a temptation, for historical reasons, I suppose, to treat Customs matters, revenue matters and perhaps also the kind of matter that we are dealing with in this Bill as being in some kind of exceptional category. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. I want to explain why it is that I am anticipating that I will be met with the argument that if the law is at fault here it should be left alone and dealt with in the context of a criminal investigation Bill-if our patience extends that far. I make the point, firstly, that our patience may not extend that far and, secondly, that even when a general law of this kind is in fact passed clarifying, rationalising or updating the law of search and seizure along the lines that have been recommended by the Law Reform Commission, there may be a disposition to leave in place existing pockets of statute law for which there is perhaps some historical rationale, if not a rational rationale. It is for those reasons that I argue that the Senate, if it can be persuaded that there is merit in these amendments, ought to make the move now to improve this particular small area of the law dealing with forfeited goods in the context of counterfeiting law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coming squarely to the amendments, the basic approach that is adopted in the amendments is simply to follow the recommendations or the approach of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its second report 'Criminal Investigation' of 1975. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA> The requirement of a warrant properly applied for, properly issued, is an important safeguard of liberty, liberty of the person, liberty of the property, and it should be required unless there are exceptional circumstances that can be identified which make the requirement of a warrant inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the short point of the Opposition's amendments is to delete the reference to the power of seizure without warrant and to replace it with a reference to a seizure with warrant, or if the seizing constable or officer 'believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to act without the authority of a warrant in order to prevent the loss of destruction of the article'. This is in conformity with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and I will give a little bit more detail about it. In paragraph 197 of the Commission's report the recommendation is put in summary form in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that all searches and seizures be unlawful unless made pursuant either to a court order or warrant, or, if made without a warrant, in accordance with one of the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in response to circumstances of such seriousness and urgency as to require and justify immediate action without the authority of such an order or warrant;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at the invitation, or with the consent, of the person occupying the premises or in charge of the vehicle in question, a signed acknowledgement being prima facie evidence that such an invitation was made or consent given, the absence of such acknowledgement being prima facie evidence that it was not; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) pursuant to specifically designated statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The key exception which is identified and which is relevant in the present context is that referred to in paragraph (a), that is, that the primary circumstance in which the power to seize without warrant ought to be acknowledged is where it is 'in response to circumstances of such seriousness and urgency as to require and justify immediate action without the authority of such an order or warrant'. The Law Reform Commission goes on to identify with a little more precision exactly what those circumstances may be, that is, circumstances of seriousness and urgency. These are identified in general terms in paragraph 198 of the report as, firstly, circumstances in which the search or the seizure that is made is incidental to arrest. That is further qualified in another part of the report. I will come to those qualifications in a moment. The second category of urgency justifying, in the opinion of the Commission, a search or seizure without warrant is:</PARA>
<PARA>emergency searches necessary to prevent loss of evidence;</PARA>
<PARA>The third situation that is identified is:</PARA>
<PARA>searches of persons and vehicles suspected on reasonable grounds to be carrying any article which is an offensive weapon, or is either the fruit, instrument or material evidence of the commission of serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA>The third case is the kind of stop and frisk power which is common in the United States and which the Law Reform Commission decided would, in fact, be an appropriate additional weapon of law enforcement in this country-a not uncontroversial recommendation. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that the ground we have taken in paragraph (b) of the proposed amendment to clause 29-the addition of the new clause (3A)-which refers to the seizing officer, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to act without the authority of a warrant in order to prevent the loss or destruction of the article. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a stop and frisk situation which is being contemplated. To give a stop and frisk power of the kind I have just identified would be going further than the existing law allows. That is not an area which I think it is appropriate to get into at this point. Arguably, however-and this is the point I want to make-the criterion we are specifying in the amendment straddles the two other situations which are identified in the report, that is, 'searches incidental to arrest' and 'emergency searches necessary to prevent loss of evidence'. I argue that by the language of our amendment, it is clear that the prevention of the loss of evidence is covered. However, it may be suggested-and this is the final point I want to answer-as it has been suggested to me by officers of the Attorney-General's Department with whom I have been able, thanks to the courtesy of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), to discuss this matter, that the power to make a seizure incidental to arrest, which is recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its report and which is in fact available as a matter of common law, is a wider power than is allowed by the language of the second part of the amendment. It has been suggested to me that as a matter of common law the power to seize incidental to an arrest is wider than a power to simply seize in circumstances where the object of that seizure is to prevent the loss or destruction of the article. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to meet that point by referring to a couple of other parts of the Law Reform Commission's report in which it is made clear-and I would hope that it would be accepted by the Attorney and his officers-that on a proper analysis of the existing common law the relevant part of the common law goes no further than the language which the Opposition has set out in its amendment. The situation of search and seizure incidental to arrest is articulated in paragraph 58 of the Law Reform Commission's report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It has always been the case at common law that a police officer could lawfully search the body, clothing and property in the immediate possession of a person arrested, if such search was reasonably believed to be necessary either (a) for the purpose of discovering a concealed weapon or any article which might be used by the person to injure himself or others or to assist him to escape, or (b) to secure or preserve evidence with respect to the offence for which the person was in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>The short point I make-which I can elaborate perhaps, if necessary, in a second go in a moment-is that the power to search incidental to arrest in cases where there is suspicion of concealed weapons is manifestly not relevant to the particular circumstances of seizure of forfeited counterfeiting materials. The latter justification as a matter of common law for arrest-this relates to a search incidental to arrest in order to avoid loss or destruction of evidence-is exactly the language to which this part of our amendment is addressing itself. </PARA>

The scope of it has been the subject of a degree of controversy. Paragraph 193 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the narrowest view, search incidental to a lawful arrest extends only as far as the physical area within which the person arrested might obtain weapons or evidentiary items of a destructible character. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that refers to items within the physical arm's reach of the person in question. Certainly that is the very narrow view which has been traditionally adopted by the American courts. Paragraph 193 goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Another view is that it can extend as far as the seizure of any goods in the arrested person's 'possession or in his house'. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it refers to goods within the physical property which the person happens to be occupying at the time of his arrest. The authority for that is the rather controversial decision of Lord Denning in the English case of Ghani v. Jones in 1970. There is yet another view which is even wider than that-even more extreme-and that is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . pursuant to an arrest the police may seize any property they find which is evidence of a crime committed by anyone. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the 1934 King's Bench case of Elias v. Pasmore. I think it has been conceded by anyone who has ever written about this matter that that went further than any authority before or since, and it is simply not accepted. In any event, none of those authorities counter the basic point in issue, which is that as a matter of common law the power to seize incidental to arrest did extend and was available only in circumstances in which either the seizure was believed necessary to get hold of some weaponry that might have been in the possession of the person in question or it was necessary to avoid the loss or destruction of evidence. Those points are succinctly made in clause 45 of the draft legislation which the Law Reform Commission produced. The proposed general rule is this:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) A Police Officer may, upon taking a person into lawful custody in respect of an offence, search his person, the clothing that he is wearing and any property under his immediate control if the Police Officer believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is concealed on his person, in his clothing or in that property a weapon or other article capable of being used to inflict injury upon a person or to assist him to escape from custody; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for the purpose of preventing the loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Reform Commission took the view that was the essence of the common law power that ought to be acknowledged and codified in statutory form. The Opposition is suggesting that the present forfeiture provision involving, as it does, counterfeit money and machinery used in the production of counterfeit money or securities, does not raise questions of armaments or weaponry. It does, however, squarely raise the question of the possible loss or destruction of the article in question if time off is taken to obtain a warrant. The amendment acknowledges that there may well be many circumstances able to be envisaged where that time off simply cannot be taken, that as a result there ought to be acknowledged at least some power in the statute to search without warrant. But the basic principle ought to be maintained that unless there is a circumstance of that kind-namely, a lack of time to obtain a warrant in order to secure the evidence or article in question-a warrant ought to be obtained in the normal way. That is the principle embodied in the Opposition's amendment. Thus explained and, I hope, thus understood, and with the language in the Opposition's amendment which I hope is now better understood by the Attorney-General than may have been the case before, I hope and believe that the Attorney-General and his Department could not possibly as a matter of principle object to anything in the Opposition's amendment. It is a simple amendment that is proposed. I suppose it is quite a small amendment in terms of the large corpus of criminal law we have to deal with, but it is an important affirmation of a principle which, as I say, I believe we all accept and which this Parliament should accept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to what Senator Evans has said about the amendment he has moved. I agree that he has a point in wanting to redefine clause 29 of the Crimes (Currency) Bill. I am not sure that his amendment is correct or that we should adopt it in its present form. Many of the things he has referred to in the course of his speech have been strangely inapposite to the matter that is before us because we are dealing with the Crimes (Currency) Bill and in particular the forfeiture of articles. To talk about common law rules, concealed weapons and so forth as grounds for forfeiture, is not relevant. I think it is worth reminding ourselves that this clause deals with the forfeiture of articles, which include counterfeit money or counterfeit prescribed securities, machines, engines, tools, et cetera, if they have been used in the course of counterfeiting. It also deals with bullion, paper, metal, ink, die and other materials. Those may be substantial and valuable items and the person who is making the arrest may be mistaken, or the things taken may have no connection with the matter or may belong to someone else. I think we ought to be pretty careful about the inclusion in this Bill of a provision which allows taking of items without a warrant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not satisfied that Senator Evans's amendment is the appropriate one. It seems to me that if we take the two cases in which the Australian Law Reform Commission suggests that this might be done-or where there may be concealed weapons and things of that sort and where there may be grounds for preserving evidence-we might be nearer the point. But these may not be the only reasons why the arresting officer wants to retain the items involved. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to those. We may agree with the points in Senator Evans's amendment which, in part, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a warrant properly issued by a judge or magistrate; or . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to act without the authority of a warrant in order to prevent the loss or destruction of the article. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that that may not be the only reason why the article should be seized. I looked up the definition of the word 'loss' in the Oxford English Dictionary. It is rather hard to come across opposite definitions in the legal dictionaries because 'loss' has all kinds of meanings relating to various matters. The Oxford English Dictionary has a couple of definitions of 'loss' which I think are worth recording. One definition is:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of losing . . . The being deprived of, or the failure to keep (a possession, appurtinance, right, quality, faculty or the like). </PARA>
<PARA>The word 'loss' in that sense means the loss of the possession of something. Another definition is:</PARA>
<PARA> Diminution of one's possessions or advantages; detriment or disadvantage involved in being deprived of something, or resulting from a change of conditions;</PARA>
<PARA>One comes across expressions like 'destruction' and 'loss' in the case of a will being destroyed or partially destroyed. We then have a rather limited situation-a situation where somebody must be shown to have intended to change his mind and not want to go ahead with the disposition of his estate as set out in the will. Therefore 'loss' and 'destruction', in the general understanding, are to be taken as language in the same category. Under the legal ejusdem generis rule the words must be regarded as related to the fact that if the person does not have a warrant and, therefore, does not arrest anyone, the particular article may be destroyed or lost to him. </PARA>

Today we are trying to persuade the Committee of the Whole to accept that the amendment covers the ground Senator Evans seeks to cover. I do not think it does. I think other situations may arise.

The point Senator Evans has raised is certainly worthy of considerably more discussion and consideration than it has received. I do not propose to support the amendment because it seems to me it does not go far enough and does not cover those circumstances in which it could be necessary to seize such articles. As this matter has yet to be considered in another place, I hope the Government will give further consideration to the arguments raised by Senator Evans and to trying to make a provision whereby if an officer takes goods, even though he thinks the people concerned are guilty, he does not take goods of great value which belong to someone else. I think it therefore behoves the Parliament to be very careful that it limits the power of taking articles without warrant, and I hope that it will look into this matter further.

We therefore ought to be very careful that we do not give too great a power to the arresting constable to seize goods without warrant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are, of course, dealing with not only an interesting but also a very important question. Since we last considered this matter in this place I have had the opportunity of discussing it at some length with Senator Evans. I have become aware of his arguments. Discussions have taken place with officers of my Department as well as with me. We have had the further benefit today of hearing Senator Evans's argument fully stated. I think that the matter has been now given very full consideration. I believe that the provisions contained in the sub-clauses of clause 29 of the Bill should remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would be prepared perhaps to give further consideration as to whether the drafting may be improved or whether some incidents that have not been fully covered, although I cannot offhand see in what respect the provisions are deficient. Of course, there will be opportunities before this matter is finally passed through the other place and through the Parliament to take up any suggestion of that kind. However, I am not prepared to accept the proposals contained in Senator Evans's amendment. The reason for this is very much along the lines that Senator Missen has expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with the basis on which forfeited goods may be seized by a constable or officer of Customs. To understand the matter we need to look at the specific provisions of the sub-clause of clause 29 which set out what are forfeited articles. Senator Missen has already referred to them in general terms and I do not propose to repeat what he said. Counterfeiting of currency is very serious. We are dealing with a situation in which a police constable is concerned with arresting people whom he proposes to charge with very serious offences. There may well be counterfeit money. There may be means by which counterfeit money is being produced -the machines, the dyes and so on. Ultimately, of course, these matters have to be proved in a court. The forfeiture of goods may be involved. An arrest may be made in an emergency situation. If the machines are churning out money the police officer ought to be able, in that emergency situation, to take action and not have to go to get a warrant before he can act. </PARA>
<PARA> The law does not operate, and never has operated, in this way. Senator Evans does not propose that we should have a general provision in the law that police officers cannot act without warrants. Obviously they have to arrest without warrants. They can and they always have been able to do this. Senator Evans and the Law Reform Commission-this chamber has heard from Senator Evans and other senators about the now famous report of the Commission on criminal investigation-recognise that fact. They recognise that there are a number of cases-Senator Evans has detailed them already-in which police may act without warrant. One of the proposed clauses of the Criminal Investigation Bill is annexed in the report of which Senator Evans is an author. I do not know whether he was the draftsman as well; he might have been. Proposed section 64 (2) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> A Police Officer who believes on reasonable grounds that a person is carrying an offensive weapon or anything connected with an offence (being a serious offence) may stop that person and seize any such weapon or thing that is found on the person. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of general principle--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a general principle. Here I am applying that general principle to the specific situation in which a police officer is arresting a person whom he has caught red-handed printing off counterfeit money on some machine. That is the situation with which he is presented. The police officer obviously believes that on reasonable grounds he can make an arrest, that he should be able to seize the forfeited property there and then. Under the terms of the amendment he could arrest but he would have to go off to get a warrant and come back again. By that time more damage may have been done.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is another question. Circumstances in which the machine would be destroyed would be covered by the amendment; however, the prevention of the exercise going on would not be. The position is simply this: For a number of situations at common law and statute law-even under the much vaunted proposals of Senator Evans and the Law Reform Commission-there will always be, for very good reasons, provision for arrest and seizing of property without warrant. We are saying that the provision is in the legislation for a good reason. We are saying that in circumstances which involve the forfeiture of property the police should be able to seize that property there and then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People are not without any redress in relation to this matter. The other sub-clauses in clause 29 provide a person with rights, the question of whether it was forfeited property having been determined. So it is not as though the right of people to have that question determined is not protected. All it would mean, as I said, is that under Senator Evans's amendment the police officer would have to get a warrant. Before he could seize the property he would have to say to the person issuing the warrant that he believes on reasonable grounds that the property is forfeited property. Having seized it he has again to establish before a court that he was entitled to seize it. So I really think that the provisions in this clause are reasonable and in accordance with general principles in relation to actions taken by police officers without warrants. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that the clause should stand. I think there are some other problems with the drafting of the clause. Obviously, if this chamber agreed in principle with Senator Evans rather than with me, I would suggest that there ought to be some changes in the wording of the amendments. At this stage I would like the Senate to express its view. I do not want to go into those sorts of technical details about the wording of the amendments, although, as I said, I have some criticism of them. I think the Senate should resolve the matter of whether it wishes to support the principles of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise now in the hope that some of the things I say might be able to be dealt with by Senator Evans, if that is convenient to him. As I see the situation, even if we pass the amendments moved by Senator Evans, the right of seizure without warrant of forfeited items would still not be denied. Surely that matter is dealt with in the principal Act. I raise this point because I think that as a Senate we ought to determine these matters. If we are to make decisions then those decisions ought to be effective. As I understand the position, section 9 of the Crimes Act allows for seizure without warrant of forfeited items, and, I am advised that that has been so since 1914. I think Senator Evans adverted to this in his previous comments in the Committee of the Whole. I therefore cannot see the value of this debate other than in raising the issue of the importance of the principle of the rights of the persons engaged in these activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we come to the general debate and discuss these matters in substance, our decisions will in effect lay down the principles upon which officers of the law should proceed. At that time I think we should also have regard to the vicitims of the crimes. I do not know whether any honourable senator has had the unfortunate experience of having a dud $20 note-or a dud any amount of money-unloaded on him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator MacGibbon. It is a bit like musical chairs. The last person who cops the package opens it and he gets hung with it. I view this sort of crime in a slightly different fashion from some other types of crime. The victims of this crime are generally little men such as shopkeepers and even bookmakers, although I do not cry any crocodile tears over bookmakers. Generally it is someone like the small shopkeeper who has to bear the brunt of the dud currency circulating around the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I for one would hesitate to limit the powers of the police to obtain the evidentiary material necessary to ensure a prosecution. In this case I would be very hesitant to limit police powers, unless evidence were placed before the Senate showing that those powers had been abused. In both the second reading stage and the Committee stage no evidence was adduced in respect of currency crimes to show that the police had abused their rights under the legislation. I congratulate Senator Evans and Senator Missen in raising the general and broader issues in relation to warrants. I feel that voting against these amendments and for the Bill will not put close to the debate. Ultimately the matter will crop up when the principal Act is under consideration at some future time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the gentlemanly atmosphere in which this debate has so far been conducted, it does rather appear that everybody has his mind made up on how he will vote. Nevertheless, I think there is some utility in replying briefly to what I see as being the three major sorts of objections to the Opposition's amendments that have been advanced from around the chamber. The first of them, put by Senator Harradine a moment ago, was to this effect: 'Isn't this all a bit useless, given the fact that you retain in the statute book section 9 of the Crimes Act, which confers a general power of seizure without warrant of all forfeited goods'. That is true, and it may be that in the clean-up of the statute book we will need to do later on we will need to take account specifically in section 9 of the existence of other pieces of legislation of the kind I am endeavouring to get through today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the meantime, I suggest to Senator Harradine that, as a matter of proper interpretation of statutes, these particular amendments were they to go through today would, I believe, take precedence. A lot of Latin has been thrown around this chamber in the last two or three days, but the particular maxim that would appear to be relevant here is generalia non specialibus derogant. In other words, general things do not take precedence over special provisions; general provisions in legislation do not overrule the much more specific provisions made elsewhere. There is another rule about later statutes taking precedence over earlier ones if there is any potential conflict. Although the cause of long term statute book neatness might be advanced by dealing with section 9 of the Crimes Act to make it clear how it relates to these provisions, nonetheless these provisions would in fact take precedence. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objection made around the chamber appears to be that there is something rather special about forfeited goods, articles which makes them significantly different from the goods or articles involved in ordinary criminal law search and seizure situations. I suggest that that is simply not so, and I will make several points in explanation of that. In the first place, it is not as if the statutory definition here makes it absolutely beyond doubt that the particular article we are talking about that will be seized will be properly seized. All that is involved is a requirement that the seizer have a reasonable belief that the good or the article in question satisfies the description of being forfeited. there is no one to test the reasonableness of the belief of the constable or Customs officer involved. He just has to do his own thing, by definition, in the absence of a warrant requirement. It is that very question as to whether he does have a reasonable belief that the particular pile of money in the shopkeeper's till is counterfeit and therefore forfeited, a reasonable belief that a particular printing press is intended for use for counterfeiting purposes, that is very much here in issue. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That provides a defence to the defendant when the issue comes before the court, does it not?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the second thing to take into account is that the person whose goods are seized in this way does not get an opportunity to test the reasonableness of the seizer's belief until the matter is prosecuted, if indeed it is prosecuted at all. Of course, that might be months or a year or more ahead. Even if a prosecution does not proceed, even if the police decide, having seized the notes or the machinery in question and having had a good look at them and all the circumstances, that there are no grounds for prosecution under sub-clause 4, the seizer can hang on to the notes or machinery for fully 90 days-three months-without having to return them. That is the sort of situation we are talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing to bear in mind, of course, is that the value of the articles seized may be very substantial. The face value of the notes seized might be very substantial indeed, or relatively substantial, given the income or assets of the person from who they are seized, even if they amount to only $20, $50 or $100. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in the context of a printing press being seized it can amount to someone's whole livelihood. It can simply be extracted from him; taken away for 90 days without there being any grounds on which subsequently a prosecution can be mounted. He will get his machinery back when the matter is tested, as is provided for in these later sub-clauses, but in the meantime he will have to do without his machinery. Senator Harradine says that he is interested in the small man rather than the kind of character that is likely to be caught up in counterfeiting situations but I ask him to have regard to the way in which these things work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By a judge or a magistrate. Yes, there is a judicial determination as to whether there is a degree of objective reasonableness about the situation. That is the crucial significance of having a properly working warrant situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot bring forward particular cases in substantiation, but what can be involved, in this malicious and hostile world that we all inhabit, are situations in which tip-offs are given to the police-entirely without substantial, verifiable foundation-purely out of personal malice. There may be a family feud. Service stations across the road from each other may be having a price war brawl which has become pretty emotional. One of the proprietors may ring the police and say: 'The fellow across the road has a till full of forged $20 notes'. It is not an entirely fantastic situation; something like that could happen. It cannot just be assumed, because of the nature of these offences, that we are necessarily talking about corporate crooks of a high order who are almost certainly likely to be guilty of something or other if the police proceed against them using the powers that are available in this legislation. In these circumstances, all sorts of changes can be rung. It is easily possible to envisage circumstances in which goods will be unfairly seized. That is the reason for the argument that this warrant procedure ought to be followed. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category of objection was that which asserts that the language of the proposed amendment is simply not good enough to cover all of the possible contingencies that one might envisage as justifying seizure without warrant. There is another variation on that argument-that the language generally might not be good enough; that perhaps it is technically not proficient; that we should have defined 'judge', 'magistrate' or something of the kind. But if the objection is of such a purely technical nature, it can certainly, as the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) himself acknowledged, be sorted out quite easily. I took it that the Attorney-General was not suggesting that any possible technical deficiencies of this kind would be a ground for the Senate's voting against this amendment. But he did suggest, as did more particularly Senator Missen that the term 'loss or destruction' was simply not adequate, even at very obvious face value, to cover the situations that might be involved. I cannot accept that that is so. I am prepared to accept that it may be useful to add to the formula here not just a reference to prevention of loss or destruction but also such words as 'to secure the preservation of'. Then the sub-clause would read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . without the authority of a warrant in order to secure the preservation of or prevent the loss or destruction of the article. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that would cover the situation that Senator Missen had in mind. If not, perhaps again that is the kind of matter that can be cleaned up at a later stage before the Bill departs forever this Senate, never to be seen again. I doubt that that is necessary. I believe that the notion of preservation is inextricably the mirror image, if you like, of the language 'loss or destruction'. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other situation that the Attorney-General felt able to identify as not clearly covered by the language of 'loss or destruction, was that which he postulated of the printing press continuing to pound out $20 notes while the police officers in question toddled off to get their warrant. True it is that the printing press would hardly be lost or destroyed in the interim. The danger is that it would be possible to create more obnoxious articles while the police officers were away. However, I ask the Attorney-General whether he believes that life works quite like that-that it would be possible for a police officer, having entered premises under some lawful authority and knowing that the machinery in question was pounding away producing counterfeit notes, to do other than, even if he did not stay in the building, to place a cordon around it. These days they have two-way radios. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hiding or removal from jurisdiction is squarely contemplated, on any view, in the language 'loss or destruction' as found in this proposed sub-clause. I put it to the Senate, and in particular to Senator Harradine, if he is still likely to be moved by considerations of this kind, that the arguments that have been advanced by Senator Missen and the Attorney-General on the question of the linguistic range of this sub-clause are simply not persuasive; that they have all the character of a desperate search to find some ground on which to rub out as unnecessary or insufficiently comprehensive the Opposition's proposed amendment. It lacks credibility that the kind of consideration that Senator Missen has advanced could be a ground for voting against this amendment. If Senator Missen thinks that we are on a good thing, as far as the principle of this is concerned-which he seemed to be clear about--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Doubtless much more could be said about the amendment because, although it is a relatively small matter in many ways, it does raise large questions of principle, but perhaps what I have said is sufficient to convey to the Senate at least the flavour of the reply that the Opposition advances to the points that have been made. I hope that that reply will be persuasive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make two very brief comments. Firstly, I understand what Senator Evans has said about forfeited articles which, under sub-clause (4) of clause 29, can be retained for a period of 90 days after seizure. It is clear from what has been said that some of these forfeited articles may belong to a person or persons other than the person who is arrested, charged and presumably subsequently convicted. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) mentioned in his previous comments that such persons have some means of redress. Will the Attorney-General explain to the Senate what means of redress an innocent party has in such an event? If there is no such redress, has it become evident that there is now some need to amend the legislation to establish procedures for redress?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, I am still not convinced that there is a need for this legislation. I repeat, whether or not a warrant is used there may be need for redress. I agree with both Senator Evans and Senator Missen that such redress should be available not merely post-factum but ante-factum, before the event. Surely all of the relevant information is not available to the magistrate at the time. If there is to be redress, surely there is need to spell out the procedures to be followed. Perhaps I am missing something in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, although provision for seizure without warrant has been in the legislation since 1914, no evidence has been placed before the Senate that the police have acted beyond their powers or that those powers have been to the substantial, or even minor, disadvantage of the people concerned. If we are to talk about the rights of individuals surely we ought to be talking about the rights of the victims of the crimes. The person who gets the dud $20 note ought to be able to go to John Stone and demand 20 bucks to make good his loss. This is the sort of attitude that I adopt to these things rather than giving to criminals an additional ability to bleed the public, the little man.</PARA>

The principle under this type of legislation has always been that even though the person who owned the goods was innocent of the crime the goods should be forfeited. That is the provision. In the event that it is established that the person with the goods was involved innocently, I imagine that the Treasurer would return them to the person who owned them. This sort of thing has arisen from time to time under the Customs Act. I do not know about the case referred to but I know that under the Customs Act this question arises. There is provision for returning goods to the innocent owner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will look this evening at the report entitled 'Children and Television', which relates to the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of children, and the second report, entitled 'Children and Television Revisited', which is a review of the original report. It is rather interesting that the second report has been called 'Children and Television Revisited'. I wish to speak very briefly on the first report. It was my privilege to serve on the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts when both the original report was compiled and when the review was undertaken. I think it is fair to say that this is one of the Senate reports which created a good deal of interest. There have been a number of them over the years. Some create more interest than others and this was one that attracted a lot of interest, not only from the media, from which there was a good deal of favourable comment, but also from a number of parent groups, teachers, service clubs and so on. This interest was expressed in a number of ways and I know that I, certainly, as one member of the committee-I am sure the other members were involved in the same way-must have spoken to 25 or 30 such groups. The interest shown when I spoke with those groups was most commendable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought it might be interesting for the Senate-particularly for the newer senators who were not members of the Senate when the report was compiled and perhaps have not been able to read it yet with the amount of material they find in front of them-to look at the topics of the first report which attracted a great deal of attention as shown by the comments and the questions put to me by the groups that I have mentioned. We can then perhaps see why these topics form the basis of the review or second report. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that the major topic which attracted attention was what we called the 'Emery thesis'. I will read from the first report, that is, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of children. Page 46 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> This thesis is the main thrust of a published work 'A Choice of Futures: To Enlighten or Inform' by F. E. and M. Emery. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Emerys postulate that by its very nature, the television signal produces a temporary numbing of the left hemisphere of the brain which is the perceptive or thought processing function, thus allowing other parts of the brain to dominate. In other words, television viewing induces a passivity or mental torpor in the viewer which leads to an impaired capacity to process and remember information, thus limiting the medium's active ability to familiarise the viewer with something but not to inform him about things. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the reason that this was of such interest to the groups to which I spoke was that they were either parent groups, teacher groups or service clubs interested in education. Of course, we can think immediately of the effect of television in the classroom situation. It is quite clear that, if television is used as an audio-visual aid, for an hour or longer after such viewing the child loses the capacity to process the information. I do not want to go into detail about this; it is a fascinating subject and one on which I could speak at great length. But I will leave it at that. If the television set is used as an audio-visual aid in the classroom the child is not able to process either material which comes out of that program or which is presented to him afterwards. Whilst this is still an hypothesis, the suggestion is that it might be an hour or an hour andd a half before the child is able to react to and work on material given to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we as parents might also think of the effect of television on home study. If we allow our children to watch television for an hour before they do their homework, quite clearly they will not be able to work effectively on that homework. Because this was of so much interest to us, and because quite clearly if the hypothesis were correct it would have had a dramatic effect on education, we recommended a further study to test the hypothesis. It was a great disappointment to all the members of the Committee-I mention also former Senator Davidson who was Chairman of the Committee and who spoke at great length on this subject-that no grant was made available to the Emerys. In fact the Committee took what I think might have been almost an unprecedented step of recommending to the Commonwealth Grants Commission that money be made available. A letter went from the Committee, over the Chairman's signature, asking that money be made available to the Emerys. I am glad to say that some money was made available and some work is going ahead at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The second topic which was of great interest was that of media education. The Committee recognised, as certainly did the people who discussed it with us, wrote to us and questioned us during our lectures, the need to train young people to watch television critically. I sometimes wonder whether this capacity to watch critically is more important than appreciation. It is quite clear that children need to be able to handle the material, in the full sense of the word, if they are not to be affected adversely by it. Of course, the corollary of this is the need to train teachers to do the job of media education. During the inquiry we saw good work being done, but much more needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that television is a very intrusive medium. It comes into the home and there seems to be no way of keeping it out. Many of us will have seen our children, other children, or adults for that matter, on whom television seems to have a sort of hypnotic effect; they are not able to tear themselves away from the screen. I cite a personal instance: I visited a friend of mine and as I walked through the front door into the room where the television was situated, he said: 'Thank goodness you have come. I can turn this thing off'. Such was the effect on him that, if the television was there and there was no one to talk to, he had to watch it. I do not think that he is an isolated example. </PARA>
<PARA> Another topic which attracted our attention in the inquiry, and one which certainly was put to us during questions, was the effect of violence on television. The violence that we spoke about was not the sort of violence one sees in films. It seems that children and young people, but children particularly, are able to cope with the cowboys and indians approach. They are conditioned to seeing somebody get shot and fall over because they know that, as in their own games, the hero will get up and carry on with his business after the film is over. We call it the sort of 'count 100 and get up' syndrome. Children seem to have this capacity. But the sort of thing that is disturbing is the amount of violence which one sees on television news and on television documentaries. Many of us, both members of the Committee and those who appeared before us, were frightened that children were becoming desensitised, almost immune to suffering and violence. In fact, as one witness put it to us, children seem more concerned about the plight of a cat in a tree which is not able to get down than about people being killed or dying as a result of natural disasters such as floods, famine and so on. This desensitisation is a very worrying aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The topic which perhaps was of greatest interest was the effect of advertising during what we might call 'children's viewing time', that is, the time between 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m., depending on the State. I refer to the sort of advertising that encourages children to get their parents to buy expensive toys, the pressure of advertising to raise the expectations of children perhaps beyond their parents' buying capacity or buying power. I refer also to the encouragement of the television commercials for children to eat trash foods. I use that word carefully because it was a word used very much by people during our inquiry and in the questions that were asked later. A problem with many of the young people was that they were not able to differentiate between advertisements and programs. It was feared that when the hero of the children's program came forward to suggest that they buy product X, they would not be able to differentiate when that hero is speaking as the forecful figure he plays in his ordinary programs and when he is appearing in a commercial. I do not want to mention a name, but the point I am trying to make is that a hero in a program at one time might encourage children not to light fires in the bush or not to play with glass and then a few minutes later the same person is saying 'buy product X'. It is difficult for the young child to separate the two situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to mention is a topic of great interest. I refer to the quality of programs. Quite clearly it is very difficult to define what we mean by the 'quality' of a television program. Most of us would know what is meant by that, particularly those who have been involved in teaching or who are parents. We know what quality television means. Many of the people who came before the Committee said there was a real need to establish some sorts of criteria by which programs might be judged. The teachers of English said we should judge them in the same way we would judge a novel; the teachers of drama or those involved in drama said we should assess them on other criteria, on the same sorts of things by which we would judge a play. I think something different is involved. I do not want to go into this matter of definition. The problem we saw was that children were being conditioned to accept third rate programs. The reason they are getting third or fourth rate programs is that such programs are cheap to buy or to make. The situation comedies that are 30 years old or more are being pumped out over the air waves because they are cheap to buy. Let us face it, the advertisers do not care what is on television as long as their advertisement is at the beginning of the program, the end of it or in the middle. </PARA>
<PARA> One must make the point that if programs are made cheaply it usually follows-though not necessarily because of the cost-that they are of poor quality. As a matter of fact, in our first report we used that delightful phrase from Shaw, in which he said: 'Take care to get what you like, or you will be forced to like what you get'. </PARA>
<PARA> We were very concerned to think that children are being conditioned to want to like or to want to see third rate programs. These and other matters were looked at in the review. The five points I have mentioned, and others, were the basis of our review, the report of which we are discussing tonight. A commitment was given at the time the report was put down. Page 1 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> At the time of tabling this report on 23 November 1978-</PARA>
<PARA>That is referring to the original report-</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Committee made the following statement-</PARA>
<PARA> 'Because of the great amount of interest in this inquiry and the likely continued public interest, I inform the Senate that we will be looking at the subject of children's television again in about eighteen months.'</PARA>
<PARA>It was because of that commitment by Senator Davidson and the pressure of interest from parent groups and others that we undertook the second inquiry. I will draw attention to a number of aspects of its report. No doubt speakers to follow will draw attention to others. I firstly remind the Government-I do this very sincerely-of Senator Davidson's extreme disappointment that the Government did not see fit to act on the recommendations of the first report. Very little has been done as a result of the first report, which is entitled 'The impact of television on the Development and Learning Behaviour of Children'. Despite the fact that educators, parents and others throughout Australia commended the report and said what excellent suggestions it made, the Government decided-I cannot say in its wisdom, I would have to say in its folly-not to accept the recommendations and do something about them. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of televised violence is the first matter that I mention which we dealt with in the second report. I suggest that we look at the original recommendation in the first report. We have done nothing about that. The recommendation in the second report is that we proceed to fulfill the terms of the original recommendation. Program classification is another area in which nothing has been done. We had to make virtually the same recommendation in our second report. Virtually nothing has been done in regard to advertising. The Government is prepared to say: 'Let the industry regulate itself'. We can see the effects of that. In other words, a great deal more needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to three or four other major areas in which we have made recommendations. The first involves the Broadcasting Information Office. I express the real disappointment and concern of the whole Committee, both Government and Opposition members, that the decision was taken by the Government not to establish this office. Originally, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications said:</PARA>
<PARA> The BIO will be headed by a Director with an independent status similar to that of the Commonwealth Statistician. It will be a statutory office charged wih the collection of broadcasting data and research which will be available to the industry, the public and to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>We recommended that the Broadcasting Information Office be set up as a research body to study the whole field of broadcasting and that it be given full resources to fulfil that function. We saw the research function of the BIO as concentrating more on the social science side rather than the technical side of broadcasting. We wanted to see the Broadcasting Information Office appoint an advisory committee to advise it on the allocation of research priorities and we wanted to make sure that the information collected by the Broadcasting Information Office would be made freely available to the public, to all those people interested in education and television. Unfortunately, the Broadcasting Information Office is not to be set up. A half-hearted attempt was made by the Government to establish it but it was given almost no resources and was still-born. One has to say that the Government bent to pressure from vested interests. There is no doubt that there is a place for the Broadcasting Information Office and it should be established. It has support from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and it has support from public interest groups. This support was shown in evidence to the Committee and is mentioned in the report. Page 16 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are of the opinion that there is need for such an organisation as the Broadcasting Information Office with a status similar to that originally approved by the Government and that because of rapidly changing circumstances in broadcasting the need is even greater now than it was when we made our recommendations in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA>The 'we' in this situation is the Committee. Once again, on behalf of the Committee, I call on the Government to support the establishment of the Broadcasting Information Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Children's Program Committee of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. We had discussions with both the Program Committee and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Tribunal praised the achievements of the Program Committee. There is no doubt that evidence which we got from teachers, from media experts and from parents showed the need for the Program Committee to have formal and independent status. It cannot be subordinate to the Tribunal, doing only what the Tribunal tells it. It cannot operate effectively under the present conditions. The report calls for the Committee to be given formal status with appropriate legislation taking note of the recommendations of our original report and of the present review. There is a great need for the Children's Program Committee. This is the committee which looks at children's programs-those imported and those produced locally-and which makes recommendations to groups that want to produce programs locally. It makes clear guidelines available to anyone on what should be done in this area. Let me pay tribute to the members of that program committee. I will not mention them by name, but they are all experienced people. They have a fine chairperson, and as a group they would know as much about children's programs as does any other group in Australia, and I would suggest more. It is a great pity that they are not given the opportunity to work effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also made certain recommendations about a children's television program production unit. Recommendations 5, 6 and 7 state:</PARA>
<PARA> 5. That the Commonwealth Government supports the Australian Children's Television Foundation and that this support encompass financial contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. That Films commissioned by the Foundation for local production qualify for tax concessions under the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. That financial support to the Foundation from the private sector qualifies as a tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA>Both of the inquiries that were conducted indicated strong support for the establishment of a children's television program production unit. The purpose of the unit, of course, would be to produce high quality programs which would be made available to the ABC and to the independent television channels in Australia. I do not think it would be going to far to say that such a unit would replace the rubbish that is being imported, and it would complement the few good programs that are being imported and the few good programs that are being produced. The commercial channels made it quite clear that they would be happy to use the material produced by such a production unit. I will not go into the details of how this unit might be set up, but quite clearly it would need to be funded as we have suggested, and it would need to have certain tax concessions to encourage its development. I see it as a vital unit to lift the expectations of children-in other words, an education in developing the standards of children. Again, I have to express the concern and the disappointment of the Committee at the lack of Government response. </PARA>
<PARA> Without being too complimentary to the reports, because after all I was a member of the Committee which produced them-although only one of six members of course-I think it is fair to say that the reports have been accepted as giving some sort of lead in this area. Let me remind honourable senators that Senate standing committee reports are unusual in that they are a collection of ideas which have been brought together and collated by a group of six lay persons. There is no suggestion that the six people sitting on the Committee had any particular expertise. There is no suggestion that the reports are the ideas of those members. They are a collection of the ideas of those people in Australia who ought to know something about the field. We had the advantage not only of excellent witnesses and excellent submissions but also of excellent advice from those people who were commissioned to help us in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be worth while making the point that in some areas we have had people say to us: 'What do you know about it? Have you got a degree in education?' In the national resources area they might ask: 'Are you qualified in this area?' I made the point to them, and I make it again now, that it is not the function of the members of committees to be expert in any particular area. It is up to the expert witnesses who come before committees to break down the academic nature of some of the evidence and to present it to us as representatives of the Australian people. I think the committee system, and I am a great supporter of the committee system, is valuable in collating the best available data and condensing it to make it available to the Government in the form of recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has an opportunity to make a real contribution in this area. I call on it to resist the pressure from vested interests and once again look at the recommendations of this bipartisan Committee, and that is not a word that I fling around like some people do. The Committee is bipartisan. We had a consensus report. Both sides of the political spectrum, shall I say, or both sides of the political field, supported this report. I ask the Government to look at both reports-the first report, which has plenty of recommendations that have not been worked upon, and the second report, which is a review of the first. I think if the Government implemented the recommendations contained in both of these reports it would improve the quality of children's television in Australia. There is no doubt about that. Many of the witnesses who came before us made the point that television has great potential-potential for great good or for great harm. It seems to me that it would not be becoming emotional about it or even stressing the point too strongly to say that the choice of whether television in Australia is going to be for good or for harm lies firmly with the Government at the present time, and it is a choice from which it simply cannot back away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like first of all to make some comments of a general nature on the report and then a more specific comment relating to violence on television and its effect on children. In reading some of the reports, I have been amazed at the capacity of honourable senators on committees to produce such quality reports while they are under so much pressure from other contending areas. Unfortunately, this report and its predecessor, as Senator Robertson has said, have not been taken up. Nevertheless, I think they have provided a useful forum within the community to discuss a range of issues about television, which must be accepted as one of the major changing elements within our society. Unfortunately, in many ways the whole education debate often takes place in an atmosphere in which it is assumed that something like television never occurred. The changes that have been wrought by television since its introduction into Australia in the 1950s are immense. Yet many people, in criticising schools, refer back to their own time, which in fact was pre-television and quite a different type of society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a specific comment about what I see as the rather simplistic view that is taken in the report in relation to violence on television. The report quite correctly points to the majority view, and it is the majority view according to the research that has been carried out in the area, that the observation of violence on television is, if not a determining factor of subsequent violent behaviour on the part of children, at least a contributing factor. I think that is probably very much the accepted view and one about which there is very little dispute. However, there are two minority views, firstly, the view that the observation of violence on television may in itself be cathartic, and, secondly, the view which tries to draw a distinction between it being provocative and cathartic. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of very useful work has been done, and the report refers to this, on trying to distinguish between the various forms of violence as they appear on television and the different levels of portrayal of representation of violence. Senator Robertson referred to the fact that children seem to be able to make a distinction between, for example, watching the old style cowboy and Indian movies and some of the newer television shows and watching the news. In fact, younger children find it very difficult to distinguish between the news and what went before and what follows after. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I believe this useful work should continue, I want to make a point about the simplistic view that the report takes on violence. Violence is really a very notable example of the effects of socialisation on our thinking about any matter. An assumption is made in the report that violence is undesirable in that it contradicts the accepted social norms. However, if we have a look at real societies, we observe that this indeed is not the case. Interestingly enough, most of the research work referred to in the report was done in either America or Australia at a time when both of our societies were engaged in violent action. I think that violence was authorised violence-authorised by a political decision-and such violence is acceptable. It was acceptable at least at that time in this community and in America. However, at the same time within those countries research was being done in relation to a different type of violence-for example, violent protest or armed robbery in which violence occurred. All of these types of violence were considered to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> If we really want to make a distinction-which unfortunately the report does not make-we can say that unauthorised violence is inadmissible and not authorised violence. This type of distinction exists between approved and non-approved or impermissible forms of violence. We have an interesting situation, to which much of the research failed in its methodology to address itself, that the law in Australia and in America at that time could say: 'You will be punished if you refuse to kill in a foreign war' while at the same time it could say: 'You will be punished if you kill in the course of internal political struggle'. Unfortunately, it seems to me that we really have not taken sufficient cognisance of that social aspect of violence, and neither does the report. Basically, the whole argument about violence depends ultimately not on television but on the social structure and the social norms.</PARA>
<PARA> I will specifically refer to television in Australia. The argument, which unfortunately is accepted by the report, runs something like this: This society discourages violent behaviour. Violent behaviour is constantly represented and reported on television. We need to study, modify or prevent its effects on children. I suggest that we look analytically, at least for a while, at those first two statements and the extraordinary relationship we have been able to get ourselves to accept-that is, we can accept that this society discourages violent behaviour and, at the same time, accept the truth of the statement that violent behaviour is constantly represented and reported on television. If we really address ourselves to that extraordinary contradiction we must seek some type of resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> One conclusion which comes to mind is that the controllers of television are really motivated by greed and indifference and are not at all concerned about the effects of anything that happens on television on those who view it. They are governed-if we are to run that argument to its end-only by the profits that can be made by showing violence on television. Unfortunately, such an explanation does not really go to the heart of the matter. The problem is that we have a view that the society discourages violent behaviour. I believe that is really where the false element in that argument lies. To take the other view is to suggest a situation which does not get us out of the dilemma at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Control over television viewing habits in this country, over the television systems, a major communication network, is vested in those people who want to be called-at least in churches on Sunday-the pillars of society. In other words, it is not true that this society discourages violent behaviour. I believe it is much more reasonable to say that this society encourages violent behaviour and that violent behaviour is constantly represented and reported on television, its major communication system. I believe that this report fails to face up to the eventual nature of the problem of children viewing violence-that it is not ultimately a problem for television; it is ultimately a problem for this society. </PARA>
<PARA> If we continue attacking only the symptom-as unfortunately this report does in a couple of places-and not the cause, there will be no solutions to the problems of violence in our society. Not only will there be no solutions but also we will see in Australia, as have people in other countries such as the United States and more recently Britain, an increase in violence. We may continue to blame that on something like television, which is only a symptom of the situation, rather than go to the heart of the matter and say that the society is structuring and organising itself in such a way as to make violence inevitable, to make violence the only way out for many people within our society. Unfortunately, in Britain it was mainly young people who were involved in those violent incidents. </PARA>
<PARA> Violence stems not from viewing violence on television. The real violence in our society stems from the degradation, the poverty and the oppression of so many groups within our society. That is where the real violence lies and that is the violence which will ultimately cause the breakup of our type of society. Therefore, I wish that a report such as this, rather than constantly bringing forward the problems at a superficial or simplistic level, would address itself to the ultimate cause of violence in our society, and that is the structure of wealth and the distribution of that wealth in this society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw attention to the fact that sufficient emphasis has not been put on the danger to children of the actual act of watching television. When Senator Teague was speaking about education the other night he drew attention to the large number of students who lacked the ability to master the basic skills, particularly the skill of communication, communication being the ability not only to communicate information and ideas but also to imagine, to grasp, to understand, to listen and to hear. In various places in the world many people such as doctors, teachers, psychologists and neurologists are seriously questioning whether young children should be watching television at all. Indeed, the British Broadcasting Corporation has a childrens' program which says: 'Switch off and go and climb trees'. It recommends that children go and do something else altogether. It is not just the effect of what is on the program that is important but the effect of the child sitting before a television set for many hours at a time. The simple act of watching encourages passivity, poor concentration, distortion of perception and reality and a lack of development of the child's whole sense of perception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A book by Marie Winn, published in the United States of America in 1976 entitled Plug-In-Drug points to the fact that television watching is inimical to healthy child development, mental, physical and psychological. For the young child, seeing is imitating. What models do we give to young children who sit in front of television imitating what they see? Often by the time children start school they have already been damaged by watching too much television. Young toddlers are sat in front of televisions, sometimes for quite a number of hours and I do not think parents are aware of the dangers that this can do to them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said that television is a time stealer. It steals the childhood from children-that time when they should be active, playing, developing their imagination and their social interaction, reading and talking with other children and with their parents. That is when they develop the capacity to communicate. Many young children who just watch television are denied that period in childhood whey they should spend their time drawing, writing and doing all the things that little children do to try to express what they have seen in the world around them. A child imitates the every day happenings in the world around him, in his home and his neighbourhood and then he recreates them in his play. His play is a vital part of acquiring social skills and co-ordination, the activity of exploring, just having fun and living in their own individuality, instead of just sitting in front of a television set living through some fantasy on the screen. Television deprives small children of these experiences. It also affects their whole central nervous system so that they develop in an unbalanced way. This is where the problems arise when they later go to school. They are then not able to picture things, as they have lost the ability to develop vocabulary and to think. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise of the senses is very important for children to be fully conscious and fully awake. Unless they can develop their total senses through their childhood up to the ages of seven or 10, they can be very badly deprived of the things that are necessary for their proper development. Work has been done in this area by Dr John Ott, who became famous for his work with X-rays and television. He has done tests with rats and plants in the same room as a television set. The effect on the rats was that they became very aggressive and hyperactive for about 10 days and then they became totally passive because their system had been damaged. The plants that were put before the television became distorted, their roots growing upwards and their leaves huge and out of proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other danger to young children is that watching too much television develops a consumer mentality. It also develops anti-social attitudes. I think previous speakers have spoken of those matters. When we think of a suitable environment for children, we think of play and grass, trees, flowers, the beach, sand and animals. We think of living things. These are the things children should be playing with and using in their development. </PARA>
<PARA> I think many parents who watch television are not aware of the dangers it creates for their children. I would like to see a report emphasising these dangers. I would also like to see further research into the effects of the very act of watching television and the results publicised in the community. I think half the problems we are experiencing in the field of education are caused by the uneven development of young children and by the fact that they are not able to develop that area which is normal for their development. When they eventually come to school they are lacking in those experiences which enable them to be educated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly about the report of the Select Committee on Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania, which has already been spoken to by Senator Peter Rae and Senator Tate. I, along with Senator Grimes, was on the Committee with those honourable senators. I do not know how many different inquiries have been held into Tasmania, but on looking into the history of the matter we found that there had been almost continual inquiries. Keeping Tasmania and Tasmanians connected to the mainland in one way or another and as cheaply as possible is something that all governments have always taken seriously. As we went around Tasmania, even though I suppose each of us had more of an interest in the particular area in which we lived-though we represent the whole State-we learnt a tremendous amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We received some very good submissions and heard many very good witnesses. We became aware of the particular problems of particular areas from right down south to the islands just west of north-west of Tasmania-King Island and Flinders Island. People gave us submissions, most of which I think are covered in the report and in the speech which Senator Peter Rae made. I think we were upstaged a little by the Government bringing in the 10 per cent subsidy for Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines following the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, because I think that the subsidy is one of the things we might have been able to recommend. Had we recommended it, it would have been at a higher rate than 10 per cent. In some ways I do not think subsidies are the answer because they can be left at a certain level in money terms and therefore be eroded by inflation or they can be removed altogether by a government, though a government would need a lot of political courage to remove some subsidies applying to Tasmania. Nevertheless, subsidies can be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the application of that subsidy to the air fares acknowledges the disadvantage of living in Tasmania and the disadvantage that Tasmanians have in having to travel in the majority of cases by air from Tasmania to the mainland. Those who live on Flinders Island and King Island are at an even greater disadvantage. Our Committee recommended that those people be favourably treated. The subsidy has certainly shown that the Government acknowledges the disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is realised that in most areas 70 per cent of the people drive to their holiday destination, it can be seen that Tasmanians are at a disadvantage because they have to fly or sail to their destinations. That is something which worried the Committee a great deal. We spent a great deal of time looking at shipping to and from the different areas of Tasmania, and we came to the conclusion that sooner or later, and most probably sooner, the Government will have to make some decision about the Empress of Australia, which sails between Melbourne and Devonport. I think the situation is due to be surveyed in about five years time. Although some of the people travelling on the ship told us that they felt that it was in quite a good state and could continue for a lot longer, there must be concern about a replacement. To replace a ship such as the Empress of Australia these days would cost in the order of $36m. The interest on that money is perhaps more than Australia can really afford to pay. Therefore we looked at some way of combining the capacity of that ship with some of the freighter ships that go back and forth between Tasmania and the mainland. That is why we suggested that two ships, not one should operate. We suggested that one of the ships carrying 450 passengers, cars and freight could ply between Melbourne and Devonport. We looked at the other alternative destinations, such as Westernport Bay and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether anybody has tried to swim to Tasmania. However, if aircraft travel becomes much more expensive I can imagine a lot of the people of Tasmania would like to swim away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, we decided on two ships, one of which would carry 450 passengers, freight and cars between Melbourne and Devonport and the other which would be used at times perhaps to level out the peaks if there were not enough passenger demand to keep it operating all the time. I think there would certainly be enough freight demand between Melbourne and Burnie. I am not convinced that enough passenger demand could not be generated to keep two ships in operation between Tasmania and the mainland all the time. Our suggested total passenger capacity of just under 700 people is somewhat less that I personally would have liked. I was a little hesitant to agree with this proposition. However, I did agree. I should say that the two Liberal and two Labor senators on the Committee were in unanimous agreement on the report. Not once did the deliberations of the Committee get down to tribal warfare of the kind that I have occasionally seen in this place between Tasmanians from different sides of the political fence. It was a pleasant committee on which to serve. The Committee took a lot longer to report than I thought it would. In due course I suppose we will find that for some reason or other yet another inquiry with regard to Tasmania will be instigated. I hope that this will not happen for quite a while. However, if another committee is set up and I happen to be a member of it, I hope it will be made up of people as pleasant to deal with as those senators on this Committee. I thank members of the Committee for their co-operation. I thank also all those who helped us, and particularly the Committee staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I reiterate that we felt that air fares could be brought down quite markedly if Tasmania operated a single airline across the Strait. From evidence we know that regional operators in the United States of America which operate with pretty full loads are able to charge lower fares than exist in this country at the moment. But such an arrangement is a long way off. I hope that the north-west Tasmanian situation is looked at very urgently, particularly in regard to the upgrading of one or both of the airports to small jet standard. I am pleased to see that Hobart airport is already being upgraded to enable larger aircraft to operate into that port. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few remarks on a couple of aspects of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania. I was not a member of the Committee but I congratulate the four senators who served on it for the work they did in producing yet another report on Tasmanian transport. I regret that only Tasmanian senators have spoken in this debate. I would have liked to think that other honourable senators would have read the report and would have wanted to make some contribution. It seems to be very much a closed shop discussion-I think that is a pity. Perhaps one or two non-Tasmanian senators should have been included in the membership of the Committee in the first place to ensure that there was some outside observation. I suppose it is a little difficult to gauge what the Government's response is likely to be or what the response on the mainland is likely to be when senators from other States have not spoken in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not criticising the report. I am saying that it is good. I am glad that at least the Minister has seen that there are tables in the report even if he has not read every word of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There would have been no need for this Committee to be established if one of the actions of the previous Labor Government had been followed up by this Government. The Senate may recall that before the 1972 election Labor promised to set up an inquiry into all aspects of transport to and from Tasmania and to legislate to re-establish the Inter-State Commission as is provided for in the Constitution. The report before the Senate recommends that the Inter-State Commission be re-established. In fact, legislation in respect of the Inter-State Commission was passed in 1975 and was to be proclaimed. However, the legislation was not able to be proclaimed by the time this Government came to power, and it has still not been proclaimed. The Inter-State Commission would have been a permanent watchdog on the needs of transport between all States but in particular between the mainland and Tasmania because air and sea transport are so crucial to Tasmania's communications. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though this report is concerned with passenger fares, I would like to make a side reference to the Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania-the Nimmo report. Unfortunately the Commission did not report before we left office. However, it was the Labor Party which initiated the whole idea of freight equalisation between Tasmania and the mainland. That report came to the present Government which certainly gained quite a lot of kudos from implementing a freight equalisation scheme. I remind the Senate that this freight equalisation scheme was established as a result of a Labor Government initiative of establishing the Nimmo Commission before the 1972 election and during its time in office. I recall that there was not unanimous support from our opponents when the Inter-State Commission Bill was being dealt with a few years ago. Therefore I hope that the recommendation that the Commission be re-established is not shot down in flames. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main recommendations of the current report on passenger fares to Tasmania is that either the two existing national airline operators be replaced by a single regional operator or a third operator be allowed to compete with the existing national airlines. I appreciate all the reasons for this recommendation. To have so much parallel scheduling is so wasteful, especially from Tasmania's point of view. We all know the stupidity of such an arrangement. One of the small victories that I can remember in our time in office was changing one set of parallel scheduling by agreement between the airlines. One of the daily services out of Hobart was changed. Previously both services went either straight to Melbourne or to Melbourne via Launceston. After the changes the airlines altenated, one flying Hobart-Launceston-Melbourne and the other direct to Melbourne. As I recall, it was a battle to get even a small change to the parallel scheduling. But that was achieved. It ought to happen more often. It would be preferable, in my view, if there were only one operator, as long as that operator was the publicly owned one, Trans Australia Airlines. I doubt that Ansett Airlines of Australia would agree to that. That is why there is the suggestion that an entirely different company be the single operator. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some reservations about this recommendation mainly because of Tasmania's image with the rest of Australia and overseas for that matter. There is some advantage in its being seen as part of Australia and so as part of the national trunk network served by the same airlines which serve the major cities of the rest of Australia. Enough people have the attitude already that Tasmania is a separate entity not quite part of the rest of the nation without the further obvious separation involved if it were to be served by an entirely different airline almost as though it were an overseas country. With that indication of a slight reservation on my part I state my support for the thrust of the main recommendations of the report and congratulate the Committee on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another aspect of the report. I do not mean to deal comprehensively with Tasmania's transport problems or even just the subject matter of the report, but perhaps not everyone remembers in thinking about Tasmania the Bass Strait islands. Even if people recognise the problems of Tasmanian transport they forget about the Bass Strait islands such as King Island, Flinders Island and others of the Furneaux group. I will read the commentary on the Bass Strait islands from the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania's problems of isolation are compounded for the residents of the Bass Strait Islands because not only do they lack many essential services, but they are also completely dependent on air travel. </PARA>
<PARA> Submissions to the Committee from the Bass Strait Islands argued for a subsidised air fare. Commissioner Nimmo--</PARA>
<PARA>I referred to this earlier-</PARA>
<PARA>in his report on transport to and from Tasmania in 1976, recommended that the Commonwealth Government subsidise air fares to the Islands. The Government rejected that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received details of various employer schemes for travel concessions for residents of the Bass Strait Islands. Commonwealth, State and local governments, as well as some large employers, had a range of schemes, some quite generous. However, not everyone on the Islands received these concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that compensation is justified for travel to and from the Bass Strait Islands and recommends that a twenty per cent concession on the air fare be immediately introduced, to be funded by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I strongly support that recommendation. I remind the Senate of the existence of those islands and of the Australian citizens who live on them. I hope that the Government in its response will take up that recommendation amongst others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator Walsh asked me a question without notice this morning about possible loss of Government revenue resulting from proposals contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 standing in my name. The money affected by the Bill referred to by Senator Walsh this morning is made up of money held in both savings bank accounts and building society accounts. In the savings bank accounts the relevant details are as follows: An amount of $9,715m is held in investment accounts offering 10 per cent interest per annum. There are some 1,998,000 of those accounts, with an average account level of $5,000. This provides an annual interest bill of $971.5m. Other bank accounts, averaging between 3 3/4 per cent and 6 1/4 per cent interest, involve 20.5 million accounts with an average account level of $655, giving an annual interest bill of $655m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the building societies $9,081m is invested in accounts offering 8 1/4 to 9 per cent interest, providing $817.2m in interest annually. Therefore, the total annual interest involved is in the vicinity of $2,443.7m. Not all of this money is subject to taxation since a component of these accounts comes from small depositers whose annual income is not large enough to put them into a taxation bracket. We estimate that this component accounts for something like $947.1m, leaving a potential for tax on the remaining $1,496.6m. The interest on the major part of this money is at the base tax rate so the estimated loss to revenue is in the vicinity of $500m from funds already in savings banks or building society accounts paying 10 per cent or less interest per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> A further potential tax loss of up to $300m could come from people transferring funds from higher interest bearing accounts which are not tax exempt to the lesser interest bearing accounts which do offer a tax concession. The estimated total loss of revenue to the Government from the scheme outlined by me in my second reading speech last Wednesday is therefore in the vicinity of $800m. This is reasonably in accord with the amount mentioned by Senator Walsh this morning. However, some $200m of this loss should be offset by probable increased welfare housing costs resulting from an increasing inability of people to buy or build privately. This estimate is contained in a recent Housing Industry Association paper by Dr Ron Silberg entitled 'Measuring Need for Rental Housing Assistance'. Interested honourable senators can consult that at their leisure, but the figures are set out in it. Therefore, we estimate that an actual revenue loss of $600m would occur. However, if this amount were used for low interest home loans at least 10,000 extra families each year could buy or build a home of their own. The influence this would have on expenditure and employment in the building industry would justify the implementation of the scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few remarks on the subject of transport, a vital industry whose future we should consider seriously. Australia's transport is possibly the dearest in the world. The Senate should undertake serious measures to investigate just what can be done to develop and improve this country's transportation system. If that is not done, Australia will lag far behind many other countries. For many years transport has been treated on an ad hoc basis. When we consider what the State governments have done and the different rail guages that have resulted we cannot help wondering just how long such a system could or should last. Australian National, as I believe Australian National Railways is now called, should progressively take over rail transport. Many lines in Australia are totally inadequate as well as in the wrong place. A complete review should be made of the country's rail system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, we should consider seriously improving our shipping and out air transport. This is a very large country with a very small population, and unless we can improve our transportation system I do not believe that we will be able to compete on world markets. The Senate should consider seriously setting up a body, probably a committee, which can consider the improvement of our transport system over the long range. All political parties should contribute. If we are to improve out transport system that will not be achieved in the short term. Probably it will take 50 years to complete and for that purpose ongoing funding will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> It may surprise many to learn that Australia had the first pure container ship in the world. Much could be done to move cargo from one port to another in ships. Again, there is need to consider seriously just how we should go about that. More thought should be devoted to the subject. It cannot be approached haphazardly. Long term planning is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that air transport is the only way for Australians to travel any distance. The major airlines, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines, should get out of commuter air transport services and concentrate on catering for the major trunk lines. Smaller airlines can service country areas far more satisfactorily. They can procure more suitable planes and provide a better service to country people. Whereas the Government provides financial help to the major airlines to purchase aircraft, it does very little or nothing to help the smaller airlines. I know of one company in South Australia that wanted to buy a Nomad aircraft. It found it impossible to raise finance in this country for that purpose. The company was obliged to go to Brazil to buy an aircraft. It was able to obtain financing from the Government of Brazil at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Australian airlines that wish to buy local aircraft such as the Nomad should be given some financial assistance to do so. I repeat, no help whatever is extended to the small companies, which provide the major growth area for employment in Australia. The Government has said many times that it will help small business people, but when it really comes to the crunch no help whatever is given. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the subject of land transportation, we should not simply rely on interstate semi-trailers to move goods. It is a very wasteful system. Our rail systems should be improved. Main lines between capital cities should be electrified and duplicated, and a fast service between the States provided in order to overcome present difficulties. The lines that go out into the country should be upgraded and placed in the right areas. Feeder services should be provided to rail heads. </PARA>
<PARA> Better planning co-ordination should exist between the States. Roads that are used to provide feeder services to rail heads should be upgraded and widened. A whole range of improvements should be under way, but no one has yet begun to think about, or plan for, the long term. Unless this is done the nation will regret it in the years to come. As fuel becomes scarcer and dearer, our transport system should increasingly be the subject of planning. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, we have allowed ship building to get away from us. It is cheaper, we are told, to buy ships overseas. I disagree with that theory. This nation should participate in the building of its ships. If the shipyards at Whyalla and Newcastle had been upgraded and modern technology introduced we would have been able to build not only our merchant fleet but also the warships that we buy overseas. I believe those vessels should have been built here. This country has a tendency to buy overseas. The more this is done the more we lose the techniques and skills of our workers, a trend that is to Australia's detriment. Transport is vital to us, as are our communications. More thought could have been given to those subjects. If it had, I believe Australia could have come up with the right answers. Australians have invented many things. I believe we could lead the world in some of these fields. Because Australia is a large country with a small population there is a need to build ships and trains suitable for this country. We have a sufficient number of people with the intelligence, given encouragement and financial support, to come up with the right answers. Unless long term planning is introduced I think this country will be in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps at some future time the Senate may care to look seriously at our transport system. I hope the Australian Democrats will support any move in this direction. Irrespective of what side of politics one supports, I believe there is a desperate need for ongoing planning to be supported by us all. There is a tendency in this country to plan only for the short term and I believe it is inadequate. We have to plan for many years ahead. Our objectives cannot be achieved overnight. Because of the mistakes that have been brought about by the rivalries that have existed between the States, our transport system today is a shambles. That is simply not good enough. I hope in the future that in a Federal parliament such as this we will be able, with common sense, to reach a consensus on bringing about a reasonably economical transport system. I believe it is in the Senate that we may be able to reach the consensus necessary to achieve that end. I leave it at that. It is food for thought. I believe this to be a serious matter and we should all be starting to think about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, this is not what I had intended to speak about before dinner, unfortunately. For the great benefit of the people of Australia, this general aviation study has been thrown out by the Government. It would not have been of any value at all to the people of Australia. The presentation of the report was accompanied by record and unprecedented protest crowds involving members of a very law abiding section of the community, namely the pilots and engineers. The report received universal condemnation from them, and well it might have because it displayed a very marked philosophic bias, a lack of objectivity, poor scholarship and contained quite a large number of errors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> General aviation is defined under Air Navigation Regulation 191 as embracing four broad categories. They are private operations, aerial work, charter, and regular public transport. The first three of those categories-private, aerial work and charter work-fall into the general aviation section. In the general aviation study, that functional breakup was split into several categories. The first contained community services like the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the Air Ambulance Service, shark spotting and search and rescue operations. The second category is commuter services. For the benefit of honourable senators I would differentiate commuter services from charter operations because they are virtually an RPT service-a regular passenger transport service-operating under several exemptions which are provided for under ANR 203 which allows some concessions in respect of equipment performance standards. Another category is charter services, which are freight services and non-scheduled passenger traffic, followed by private, commercial and ancillary operations, personal flying, agricultural aviation, flying training and, a very minor category, international general aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> The general aviation sector is a very large sector of the industry. It is the dominant sector in the aviation community in Australia. In 1979, out of 5,997 aircraft on the Australian register, 5,865 were in the general aviation category compared with only 132 in the RPT airline category. </PARA>
<PARA> The general aviation study is based on the simple argument of the cost recovery doctrine. Very simply, that looks at taking the whole cost of providing aviation services to Australia, grouping the users of those services, attributing a ratio to those users in the aviation community and dividing that into the total cost, thus coming up with a percentage for the cost recovery figures. By this formula the Department of Transport computes that the general aviation sector is paying only 12.6 per cent of the costs attributed to it. The general public, naturally, is very concerned that only 12.6 per cent of the costs attributed to a sector is being recovered but it is a most specious argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look at some points in relation to that argument. First of all, is the concept of cost recovery a valid concept? Secondly, how is the grouping, which leads to how the ratios are set, determined? I have a substantial point of divergence from the concept of cost recovery, or the user pays doctrine. The concept of cost recovery involves no recognition at all of the place of aviation in the defence infrastructure in this country, the economic benefits that accrue to the whole of the community or the improvement in the quality of life that aviation services bring to the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have an aviation industry in this country-a maintenance organisation and a flying organisation-gives us a very real infrastructure, both in human terms and in hardware, from a defence point of view. The economic benefits to Australia from the general aviation industry are hard to measure. But there is a gain to business because people are able to use private aircraft to travel around the country. It might surprise some honourable senators to learn that aircraft are as fuel efficient as many cars and they are certainly a good deal quicker. In a vast country such as Australia, the ability to move around it in a direct line is one of the great advantages provided by the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is also very dependent on the aviation industry. It depends on international services, the trunk services, the regional operators and the general aviation sector. There is a great multiplier effect. The people who are employed as a consequence in motels and in the tourist industry generally benefit Australia's economy. As to quality of life, this country is a large one. There are many isolated country areas. In times of flood, and even drought, the ability to move equipment and supplies by air adds immeasurably to the quality of life of people who live in the distant parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept the user pays concept in its bald terms because I think it denies the advantages that I have been talking about. After all, we do not use the user pays concept for education. Whenever the Government has tried to bring it in, as we did in respect of fees for the higher educational degrees, we have met quite a community reaction to it. But somehow or other we tolerate it for the--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in agreement with it for higher degrees. I think there is a valid economic argument for it there. But that is a diversion and I would thank you, senator, to be quiet for a while. As to the groupings, we have got to get the operators in the commuter sector out of the general aviation sector because, really, they are mini airlines. That is the sector that places demands on the Department of Transport for navigation aids, airfields and all the infrastructure support that the rest of the general aviation community does not need. I exclude charter operators from the commuter service sector because many charter operators live away from the main airports such as Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. They are based out west. They might move across the length and breadth of the country but they never go into controlled air space. However, it is essential that we regroup the bodies which the Department of Transport at present put into the general aviation sector if we are to go down the path of cost recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now we come to the actual costs which have been attributed to the sector. The report does not address two very important factors. First of all, there is really no control by the users of the services given to them. There is no way that the users can challenge what those ratios are. The Aviation Industrial Advisory Council is a body set up to advise the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) on this matter, but the general aviation sector is represented on it by only one member out of five or six members. It really is a case of taxation without representation. A consequence of that is that we have a body which is vastly over-regulated. Pilots really do not need that much regulation. Usually they are people with quite a degree of common sense. They recognise the difficulties and the dangers of the environment in which they are operating. As one of the great literary figures of the modern age, Ernest Gann, who was a professional airline captain for most of his life, said in one of his books: 'Pilots really are very simple, direct people, or they die sudden, violent deaths'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has many talents. I return to the point of the excessive regulation of the industry. The facilities that are provided for the general aviation sector-the airports and the navigational aids-are way beyond what that sector requires. As the report establishes, most of the operations of the general aviation sector are VFR operations, undertaken under visual flight rules on the basis of see and be seen. In the worst sense, that is a case of over prescription.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To learn the ratios assigned to the sector by the Department we turn to page 165 of the report, where we see a table headed 'Allocation of Costs by Aviation Sector and Location 1977-78'. The top line lists six types of airports ranging from competitive airports and to special airports. On the vertical side of the scale are balanced international airlines, trunk airlines, rural airlines, commuter operators and other general aviation operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The attribution of costs there just does not make sense. For example, the first column deals with competition ports, which really are the international airports such as those at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, where the facilities are set up primarily for regular public transport operations, both internally and internationally. The cost attribution is $33.8m for the international airlines and $38.1-$5m more-for other general aviation operators. If I want to fly to Sydney I will run out of fuel before I get to the airport there because it is not an accessible airport for the average general aviation traffic. It is nonsense to have that kind of attribution of costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the classification of commuter airports, which are airfields specifically for commuter operations. We find that the cost attribution to the commuter airlines is $1.9m, yet $11.5m, nearly six times more, is attributed to general aviation. That is nonsense. Those sorts of figures cannot be justified. A bunch of bureaucrats who do not understand what is going on just fill in a report to keep themselves in a job. I believe that the commuter airlines need to be shifted out of this sector because they are the ones leading to the high cost attributions. They are the group that must have navaids around the country. They are the ones that must have sealed runways for all weather operations, passenger terminals and all the other infrastructure. The VFR sector, the true general aviation sector, does not require any of that. All it requires are grass airfields and to be left alone by the bureaucracy. That sector has had enough of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why they fly. They fly to get away from people on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, the general aviation sector is being financed by what are known as air navigation charges, which are similar to the registration charges on a car. One pays an annual registration fee for an aircraft, and that has covered the levies by the Department up until the present. Again, that is a rather absurd classification because it is based on aircraft weight. It requires a peculiar mind to say that, if one aircraft in a small category-that is, the small, single engined fixed undercarriage aircraft-is a little bit heavier than another, it should pay more to fly, even though both aircraft are doing similar tasks. Something like that cannot be substantiated. There should be a uniform charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The report proposed quite a severe increase in air navigation charges and a movements charge. It was really the movements charge which infuriated the industry because it meant that every time an aircraft landed or took off at any one of a large number of airfields around the country, a fee would be charged for it. If anyone has ever been in a control tower at a busy secondary airport, where aircraft are taking off and landing the whole time and departing to parts all over the Commonwealth, the mind boggles at trying to work out a bill for each one on the basis of movements, of landing and taking off. It is so impractical that I cannot understand how anyone could propose it. It is also ruinously expensive for anyone who wants to fly and maintain competency, who wishes to go in a circuit and maybe do 10 or 15 circuits in an hour. It is just a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a history of deteriorating advice to the Minister from the Department of Transport ever since we got away from the Department of Civil Aviation and had this huge conglomeration called the Department of Transport, which worships the idea that if anything moves it is transport and that if one understands how something moves one can handle any sort of movement. That is nonsense. I give an example as I believe you are a Queenslander, Mr Acting Deputy President and you will appreciate this. When I learned to fly we flew out of Archerfield, an airfield one mile square. It was a grass airfield known as an all over field. The only thing the tower told a pilot was the landing directions-north-east, south-west or whatever it was, depending on the wind. There could be half a dozen or a dozen aircraft on final approach at the same time and they automatically spread themselves out over a one-mile front and landed. There were no problems and no hassles. One man in the tower controlled the whole lot. If a pilot wanted to file a flight plan he just went to the tower and while the controller was announcing a landing direction he took the plan. Then what happened? Progress came. We went to a strip system. Series of strips were designated. They were not sealed strips; they were just areas pegged and marked with cones. We were told that if we did that we would be guaranteed the use of the airfield in the future because no one would build on the approach paths, there would be no noise problems-shades of last year and the protest movement around Acacia Ridge. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we went to a triple runway system. Three runway directions were designated and three runways were put in in three directions. That led to the most horrendous air traffic control problems because one landed on one strip, took off from another and did touch and goes on the third. The circuit, which was a nice stable and safe place, became like peak hour in a busy city, with aircraft cutting in and doing all sorts of unpleasant and potentially dangerous things. Incidentally, while we had a triple runway system we had to increase the manning strength in the tower. We had to have a whole lot of people in the tower. We had to have relief staff in case someone was sick or not available. We had to have shifts. Therefore, the cost of operating the airfield went up astronomically. Although I have attended hearings of the appropriate Estimates committees, I have never been able to find out how much it costs to run Archerfield. The only progress we have made has been in bumping up the cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The final proposal is that we are to have two runways instead of the triple runway system. We will have conflicting counter-rotating circuits. Can anyone imagine a more dangerous situation than a training airfield with two aircraft on base leg flying towards each other and turning on to two runways? I cannot imagine it. It is an example of the bureaucratic mind at work again. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing concerning the aviation industry is this business of biennial flight checks. Again, the snake oil merchants in the Department of Transport are saying there is a high accident rate in general aviation and that the cure for it is to bring in biennial checks. They say they will make everyone with a licence do a flight check every two years; after all, all the professional pilots do it. It is a very plausible argument. It is so simple one wonders why it did not occur to them before. However, it is just as false and just as falacious as the general avaition study that the Department produced. They are dissembling; it is a half truth. The accident rate for private pilots, or the general aviation sector, is not very high. More importantly, the accident rate is coming down. Statistics cannot be taken on a year by year basis because the accident rate is so low, but over a 10, 15 and 20 year period even blind Freddy could see that in proportion to the number of hours flown the accident rate is coming down. But we are told that in the interests of safety there has to be a biennial review. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if one can strike the mantle of safety when dealing with the Department, anything can be got through. I have served on hospital committees in many parts of the world and whenever we could not get a piece of equipment we had only to say that a patient would die if we did not have it, and immediately the money was made available. Precisely the same is true with the Department of Transport. All the people in the Department have to say is that it is a matter of safety and that lives will be lost unless we have the biennial flight checks. So the most horrendous and draconian legislation is introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right, but I want to inform honourable senators about that. Every two years a pilot must renew his licence but before he can do that he has to undergo a quite stringent medical examination. That is quite different from a flight test. This flight test is a real harassment to me. It is a real harassment to me, coming from Queensland, and to the people I represent. It places a very high economic penalty on them. As I will show, it serves no purpose whatsoever. Quite typically, it was introduced without reference to this Parliament. It came in as a regulation from the bureaucracy and we just did not have any say about it. The recency criterion, of so many hours-three or five hours, or whatever it was-spent in command before renewal, will be removed. The proposal is that every two years before a licence is renewed a pilot will have to show that a flight test has been done with and A1 flight instructor. The air navigation regulations do not define what that test will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What will the test do? The Department says it will not gain from any financial or empire building aspect because the tests will be carried out by designated instructors in flying schools and organisations such as those. The Americans have had this requirement and have seen that it does not work. They have evidence over about 10 years to prove that it does not work. At least the Americans do not require a pilot to prove he has done a flight test. The Department will have to have proof that a pilot has done the flight test, so there will be more bits of paper coming in and there will be a bunch of clerks handling them. There is also postage and other things to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some points about this matter. What is being tested and what are the causes of accidents in general aviation? The first point about testing is that a pilot will merely do a flight test before an instructor. I have only ever flown with one instructor who in my judgment was dangerous as an airman. I think all the other instructors I have flown with have been excellent airmen-way above the average. But the almost universal failing they have is that they cannot teach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They cannot teach. That is rather different from not being able to see. I cannot see the point of having pilots who cannot fly very well going before instructors who created the situation because of the fact that they could not teach. The problem will not be made any better. The correct approach to this is to put the instructors through a central flying school, which we should have. We seem to have no shortage of money for building colleges of advanced education and things of that nature to teach people basket making, pottery and that sort of thing. The Victorian and New South Wales countryside is littered with monuments to this sort of hobby endeavour. We should be putting money into things like a central flying school so that we can lift and standardise the level of instruction in the general aviation sector through the flight instructors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any flight test will be of a practical nature and will be likely to test no more than aeronautical skill. It will not test the judgment of the pilot in any way. Judgment is the crucial thing; that is what we want to get at. Having read the Aviation Safety Digest, the excellent publication that the Department has produced I suppose for over 30 years, I am driven to the firm belief that accidents fall into four categories. The most common category is weather-related accidents. The second category is improper judgment of operational conditions, often by very experienced pilots. The third category-it is a minor category-is mechanical failure, and the fourth category, which is even smaller again includes unforeseen circumstances. No flight test will cope with those basic causes of accidents. A flight test will not assess the competence of a pilot to avoid a weather-related accident, flying into bad weather and into instrument conditions. At best this flight test would look at a limited display of aeronautical skills. </PARA>
<PARA> The accident history of training flights in Australia indicates that pilots flying solo with very limited experience have a surprisingly low accident rate. Not many pilots are killed in training. I am driven to this conclusion: What is the need for this test? What are we trying to do with it? Earlier I said that the accident rate was surprisingly low, and it is falling. The figures I have been able to get show that there were 42.28 accidents per 100,000 hours flown in 1976. That figure fell to 28.16 accidents for 100,000 hours in 1978 and in 1979 the figure was down to 19.19 accidents. That is a very short data base, only three years, but I have looked at the situation over longer periods of 10 and 15 years and quite clearly the accident rate is diminishing. I come back to the question: Why are we introducing this biennial test, unless it is just to harass the ordinary citizen?</PARA>
<PARA> A very real economic cost is involved in this. I was speaking to someone in my electorate the other day and he told me that to fly from Charleville to Brisbane to do this biennial flight test and back again will cost over $400. That is an imposition that he should not have to bear. One of the people in the aviation organisation told me of a person in the backblocks of Western Australia who will have to travel to Darwin to do his biennial review, and he estimates that it will cost him $1,000 just to renew his licence. Not all pilots own their own aircraft. In fact, the very great majority of them do not. Over 25 per cent of general aviation operators are in located rural regions. Let us look at fuel consumption. We have a national energy policy; we are trying to conserve fuel. Over 24,000 pilots are on the private pilot section of the register. If half of those, 12,000 have to do a biennial review every year, they will each burn 7 or 8 gallons of fuel an hour-30 litres an hour-so we can work out for ourselves what a huge and absolutely unnecessary cost that will involve. </PARA>

People in the community do not understand that the Government can support a department that goes on in this way. Of course, the final insult added to the injury was the business that went on last week with the air traffic controllers in the State of Queensland. They are prepared to close Mount Isa, they are prepared not to open Proserpine on Thursdays, because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, and they are proposing to close Brisbane airport from 9 o'clock until midnight seven days a week. If that does not show bad management or a lack of planning, I want to know what does. It is time we had an inquiry into the whole of the departmental operations in aviation in this country. Things have just gone from bad to worse ever since the Labor Party consolidated the Department of Transport and appointed the present administrators to senior positions. Once upon a time we had people in the Department of Civil Aviation who had a superb level of professional skill and expertise. They have now gone. They do not want to be running light houses, they do not want to be running trains. They have moved away from the area and we have people in their places who are just career public servants, people who know nothing about a very specialised field of operation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1-9) 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>These Bills will give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech to increase the various rates of sales tax by 2 1/2 percentage points. The Bills will increase the respective rates from 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent, from 15 per cent to 17 1/2 per cent and from 27 1/2 per cent to 30 per cent. The nine amending Bills are necessary because sales tax is imposed by nine separate Acts in order to meet the constitutional requirement that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of Taxation. Increased rates of tax are proposed for all goods other than those covered by the first Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, and which are thereby exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Schedule to that Act identifies the goods at are to be taxed at the top rate, now to be 30 per cent. Goods embraced by the second Schedule include radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, films and photographs, watches, jewellery, cosmetics, fountain pens, certain goods made of precious metals and furs. Goods in the third Schedule to the exemptions and classifications Act have attracted a rate of 2 1/2 per cent, which is not to be increased to 5 per cent. This covers household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and range of household goods. Motor cars and commercial motor vehicles are in the fourth and fifth Schedules to the exemptions and classifications Act and they, together with goods not coming within the terms of any schedule to that Act, have been taxed at 15 per cent. It is proposed that they be taxed in future at 17 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Other goods also now to be taxed at 17 1/2 per cent include boats, confectionery, stationer, computers, soft drinks, potable spirits and imported wines and beers. It is customary for changes in the rates of sales tax to take effect on the day following the introduction of amending Bills and these Bills, when enacted, will accordingly operate on and after 19 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax is basically a tax on sales at the wholesale level and, in the ordinary case of sales by a wholesaler to a retailer, the increased rates of tax will accordingly apply to sales made after Budget day. As usual, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the bills and providing, on this occasion, a detailed listing of the goods affected by these measures is being made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget Speech last week three separate sales tax changes were announced. Two of them-an increase of 2 1/2 percentage points in existing rates and the correction of a number of anomalies and inconsistencies that have crept into the law-are before the Parliament in other Bills. The Bills I am now introducing complete the legislative package and will, with effect from 1 January next, impose sales tax of 2 1/2 per cent on a range of goods that are now exempt from the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking last week, I drew attention to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes. I spoke about, and again emphasize, the potential that such a change generates for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax, as economic and budgetary conditions permit. It is said by some that the Government's Budget decision is at variance with what was put in the general statement about taxation last March. Nothing could be further from the truth, as a fair analysis of that statement and a consideration of the modest change now proposed will reveal. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know it is, for constitutional reasons, established practice to enact nine separate Acts when imposing sales tax. The approach in each of the present nine Bills is to impose tax of 2 1/2 per cent on goods that are identified by reference to items in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act that at present exempt the goods from tax. These exempting items, along with a large number of other exemptions that are being retained, are contained in the first Schedule to the Exemptions and Classifications Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The technical effect of the Bills will be to tax at 2 1/2 per cent, on and after 1 January 1982, goods which are at present exempted by items 51, 53 54, 58, 60, 82 to 90F (inclusive), 96, 105, 107, 113F, 120 and 120A in the first Schedule. The broad classes of goods which fall within the scope of the items other than 107 and 113F are books, magazines and newspapers, building materials, packaging and wrapping materials, hand tools, clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings and manchester goods. The goods covered by items 107 and 113F are, very broadly, motion picture films, servicing equipment and construction equipment. I emphasise that goods falling within any of these categories will still be exempt from sales tax if they are sold in circumstances in which an overriding exemption in the first Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act applies. By way of example, where a school entitled to exemption under item 63A purchases books for the school's use, the books will remain exempt from tax. Similarly, where a manufacturer purchases hand tools for use as ''aids to manufacture'', as defined, the tools will remain exempt under the ''aids to manufacture'' head of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that I need to go into greater detail at this stage. As usual, however, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills is being made available to honourable senators and this provides details of the goods affected by these measures. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $132m in 1981-82 and $330m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, changes in sales tax are a significant part of this year's Budget; indeed, they are an integral part of it. As I indicated earlier, the present Bills complete the legislative framework for the changes, and it is desirable that they soon become law. I therefore trust that the Senate will give these and the earlier Bills a speedy passage. In that spirit, I commend the present Bills-the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981-to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to alter the sales tax classification of certain goods. Honourable senators will be aware that the Exemptions and Classifications Act not only classifies particular goods as exempt from sales tax, but also places other goods in one or other of the tax rate categories. The present Bill is primarily concerned with the alteration of those sales tax classifications. In all, there are some 36 substantial changes. In a sales tax system that has exemptions and a number of rate categories it is inevitable that at the borderline between one category and another there will be anomalies, real or apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> There has in fact been no general review of the sales tax classification of goods for many years and a review that has been carried out has brought to the Government's attention a number of anomalies and inconsistencies which we think should be remedied. In carrying out the review we have given attention to representations that have been made to the Government by parliamentarians and other interested people. The sales tax system operates according to a number of principles. In our review, we have endeavoured to work within these. We have been concerned to remove anomalies in classifications that give some goods a competitive advantage over other products and to achieve a greater measure of uniformity in classification. We have necessarily had to keep an eye to the revenue consequences of the possible solutions that have come up for consideration. We have found in our review that certain exemption provisions have not kept pace with technological changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions of the courts and administrative experience have highlighted weaknesses in the law that allow exemptions beyond what was intended when the law was first framed, or that result in an unacceptable lack of clarity in the law. Some exemption items have become redundant due to changes in other laws, such as those relating to customs duties and laws covering the manufacture of motor vehicles. A number of amendments resulting from the review will bring into the taxable field goods which, for technical reasons only, have had to be accepted as exempt, although the exemption does not fit in with the general policy of the tax. Other amendments will, for consistency's sake, move goods into a higher tax bracket. However, it is not all a one way street and in some instances anomalies and inconistencies are being removed by exempting goods that are at present taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking in more detail, one of the important changes relates to the treatment of containers for use in marketing soft drinks. Under present law, non-returnable bottles used in marketing taxable soft drinks are exempt from sales tax, while cans used for the same purpose are taxable. Manufacturers of cans have urged the Government to remedy this inconsistent treatment. We propose to correct it by removing the exemption for non-returnable bottles and containers used in marketing soft drinks. Returnable bottles will remain exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Photographic materials and products are generally taxable at 27 1/2 per cent, or 30 per cent as it will be from Budget night. However, the particular item, which was intended to cover all photographic materials, does not catch instant-type film packs which have become popular in recent times. These packs compete with conventional films and it is appropriate that they be taxed on the same basis. Similarly, photographic cameras and equipment have been taxable at 27 1/2 per cent, while projectors and other viewing equipment have been taxable at 15 per cent. Both will now attract tax at the new rate of 30 per cent. Projection equipment of the kind used for commercial purposes, such as in theatres, will remain taxable at the lower rate. Further alterations relate to the unusual position of cathode ray tubes for TV sets and motor vehicle seat belts. </PARA>
<PARA> A general principle of the sales tax law is that goods are classified according to their commercial identity, and not on the basis of the component parts of which they are comprised. Television receivers, of which the picture tubes form a major part, and motor vehicles, in which seat belts are fitted, are taxable as such. </PARA>
<PARA> However, for reasons relevant at the time but no longer applicable, provisions were introduced into the law some years ago to exempt cathode ray tubes and motor vehicle seat belts from sales tax, even where they form an integral part of taxable goods. The reasons for this special treatment having disappeared, it is proposed to repeal the relevant exemption provisions. This will result in these goods being taxed according to the identity of the product of which they form part, or in their own right when sold separately. </PARA>
<PARA> Foodstuffs for human consumption, but not including confectionery, are exempt from tax. Due to deficiencies in the law, the exemptions relating to foodstuffs have in some instances not operated as intended. They were never intended to exempt manufactured pet food, but exemption for this has had to be conceded under the present law. It is proposed to restrict the foodstuffs exemption to goods for human consumption, with the result that manufactured pet food will again become taxable. Food for livestock will remain exempt under other provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar problem has arisen with certain chocolate-coated confectionery. As a general rule, confectionery is taxable. However, some confectionery lines have gained exemption on the basis that they are biscuits which are exempt under the general foodstuffs exemption. These lines compete directly with others of the same basic type and are sold as confectionery. They are now to be taxed as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Some industry-related exemptions in the law which are couched in wide terms do not specifically exclude road vehicles and this has led to some industries being able to obtain vehicles free of tax, while vehicles for use in other industries remain taxable. A particular problem has occurred in connexion with road vehicles used for bulk handling of grain. Relevant exemptions are to be amended to exclude road vehicles, so as to place industry use of vehicles on a more equitable footing and to prevent continuation of abuses that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the overall philosophy of the sales tax law in relation to motor vehicles, it is proposed to tax oil, greases and other lubricants used for motor vehicles. These goods are at present exempt whereas motor fuels are subject to excise. Mr President, these comments outline the more important alterations to sales tax classifications that will result in increases in revenue. There are others, but I think what I have said sufficiently illustrates the kind of adjustments that are to be effected by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The other alterations will result in the withdrawal of minor exemptions and the restriction of certain business exemptions to restore them to their original intention. I think that I need not go into all of them in this introductory speech. They are fully explained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated to honourable senators. There is one further point, however, that I should mention. It is a feature of the sales tax law that aids to manufacture-goods used in manufacturing processes-are exempt from the tax. The Bill makes a number of amendments to the definition of aids to manufacture to clarify its meaning and to remove weaknesses. I indicated earlier that there are measures in the Bill that will reduce sales tax revenue and they are also covered in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three I would like to make some comment about at this stage. The first relates to log forwarders for use in timber-getting. The expansion of logging of softwood forests has led to the development of specialised equipment called log forwarders to haul the felled logs from the felling point in the forest to road-side pick-up points. These vehicles perform the same function as tractors, which are exempt. It is proposed, in the interests of equity and consistency, to provide an exemption for log forwarders also. I am sure the timber industry will welcome the Government's decision, both because it recognises technological advances in the industry and because log forwarders give better protection to forests than less sophisticated equipment does. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided that protective clothing of a kind used for sport or recreation, such as helmets, guards, gloves and mittens should no longer be taxed at the general rate. Clothing in general, including sporting clothing such as football jumpers, cricket trousers and swimwear, is at present exempt. The protective headwear, pads, gloves and mittens are worn primarily to protect participants from injury and it is proposed to bring these goods into line with clothing in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption is also being proposed for compressed natural gas. This is consistent with the Government's energy policy. Natural gas supplied through a reticulation system is already exempt. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at $142m in a full year and $107m in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> It is customary for sales tax changes to come into operation on the day following the introduction of the amending Bill and the Bill therefore provides that the amendments are to be effective from 19 August, 1981, the day following introduction of the Bill. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today the Remuneration Tribunal's 1981 Review was tabled in the Senate. The Government has accepted the Tribunal's report on judges' remuneration and the following determinations: allowances for members, Ministers and office-holders of the Parliament, and remuneration payable to holders of offices in the first division of the Australian Public Service and holders of public offices. The Government accepts the merit in the Tribunal's decisions with regard to the increases in salaries for Ministers, members and office-holders in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions recognised the real decline in Parliamentary salaries that have already occurred in comparison with the wages earned by the average Australian. It is important to note that between March 1975 and December 1980 average weekly earnings rose by 84 per cent while the salaries of members of the federal parliament rose by 50 per cent. It should be remembered that members of parliament did not automatically receive the cost of living increases which flowed to most wage and salary earners as a result of national wage case decisions. It is also significant to look at the restraint that has already been exercised by the Government on its own ministerial salaries in the interests of setting a national example. </PARA>
<PARA> Salary increases recommended for Ministers by an independent inquiry in 1971 were not implemented until 1973. Increases recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal in 1974 were not implemented. Increases in ministerial salaries recommended in 1975, 1978 and 1979 were not implemented. In 1978 the Tribunal recommended that Ministers' salaries be increased by 4.9 per cent in line with national wage increases over the previous twelve months, but the Government did not accept this recommendation and no increases were given. In 1979 the Tribunal recommended increases of 9.1 per cent but the Government approved a rise of 7.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government believes that the inflationary threats posed by excessive wage increases are so serious that an example of restraint must once again be set. Thus, as a lead to the rest of the community the Government has decided that the salary rise recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal for all senators, members, parliamentary office-holders and Ministers will not be taken at once, but spread over two years. I express the hope that the community will take full note of this example being set by the Government and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill gives effect to these views where action is required to implement or modify the Tribunal's decisions. Part II provides that members and office-holders of the Parliament will receive in 1981-82 salary or additional salary increases amounting to half those determined by the Tribunal. The rates which appear in the Bill reflect the total amounts which will be received in 1981-82. Part III deals with the salaries of Ministers and provides for the sum appropriated under the Ministers of State Act to be increased to provide for half the increases in the Tribunal's report. The Tribunal's report on the remuneration of judges is implemented by Part IV of the Act. Finally, Part V provides that the power of disallowance in the Remuneration Tribunals Act will not apply to the Tribunal's 1981 determinations, including those proposed to be modified by this Bill. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The explanation for this Bill is set out in the second reading speech which has just been incorporated in Hansard. It is now late on Thursday night, and I suppose I have lost my courage for the fight. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. I want to make two or three observations about it. Of course it has been the cause of tremendous Press speculation and so on. There are one or two facts I think which should be remembered. The salary rises were fixed by an independent tribunal and then reduced by political decision because of political pressure. When politicians voted for their own wage rises, the community called for an independent tribunal. When politicians' salaries were fixed by an independent tribunal, the decision of that tribunal was likewise condemned and political pressures were applied to government in relation to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the second reading speech points out, the salaries of politicians in relation to community movements have fallen behind over a considerable period, some five years, and in a sense it can be argued on behalf of some politicians at least that their salaries compare unfavourably with those of people with similar skills or responsibilities in the corporate sector of the community. That of itself, I suppose, is not necessarily a persuasive argument in relation to all salaries, but it is an important matter to consider in the overall context. As I have said, this matter has received a great deal of speculation and so on in the Press, much of it ill-informed. For the reasons I have stated the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting this Bill I would like to draw attention to what I consider to be an anomaly which is increasingly affecting allowances, particularly as they relate to the chairmanship of the Senate Committees. I am sure that those members who are looking at the Bill will notice that the chairmen of the joint committees receive an allowance far in excess of the allowance received by the chairmen of Senate standing committees. I think that that is an anomaly that this chamber should look at in the future and should not allow to go unnoticed. As far as I am concerned it is a slight on this Senate. It is a slight on our standing committees, the committees of the Senate which have been built up over a period. As I move around the community I note that those who are interested in the parliamentary system pay a lot of attention to those committees. In the schedule of allowances on page 2 of the Bill there is a vast difference between the allowances paid to the chairman of joint committees and those paid to the chairman of the standing committees of the Senate. I think it is an insult of the greatest order and something that should not go unnoticed for any length of time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats made their position in relation to this Bill clear when the report of the Remuneration Tribunal originally came forward. Unfortunately that was in an era when indexation was still operating but made it clear that we would have preferred that parliamentarians' salaries should rise by the same amount that the salaries of all other Australians rise, and that those rises be dictated in the normal course of events by tribunals other than the specialist tribunal for the salaries and allowances of parliamentarians. However, since that date the indexation package which was available to all other workers within the community has been abolished. So it is no longer possible to argue along those lines.

We believe that parliamentarians should be subjected to the rigours to which everybody else in the community obviously will be subjected. The percentage should be worked out in 12 months' time, and it should be the average of the amount other workers in the community receive.

<PARA> In relation to allowances we believe that the full rise in the allowance is justified. Indeed, the allowances and provisions made to parliamentarians are inadequate on a range of issues. Certainly, the ability to be able to perform one's duties depends very much on one's research staff and one's capacities in various offices, both here and in the electorate. The primitive nature of some of those types of provisions obviously dates them back to the last century. It is not possible in this day and age to make comprehensive evaluations of complex matters unless these issues are updated. Therefore, we support the inclusion of the total allowance package. </PARA>
<PARA> We disagree with Part IV of the Bill, under which judges will receive the full rise granted in the original Remuneration Tribunal 1981 review. We believe that the link between parliamentarians and judges ought to have been maintained and that judges also ought to receive only half the rise. Their rise ought also to be linked to the rises of other workers in the community, as this Bill links parliamentarians' rises with those of other workers. We do not agree that judges should receive the full rise and parliamentarians half the rise. We believe that both ought to receive only half the rise. Lastly, I refer to Part V, which contains the miscellaneous provisions. It seems gratuitous in many ways that this Bill does not allow for disallowance of sections of the Remuneration Tribunal's determinations made on 18 June. With those qualifications, we support the Bill. </PARA>

It makes the determinations which Parliament decides it will review through the Executive from time to time taking control of what happens. One wonders about the extent to which the fact that a compromise was able to be developed was a result of the extreme advantage of the Executive achieving increases which were vastly disproportionate to those of the majority of the division fodder of this Parliament. I wonder for how long the cannon or division fodder of this Parliament will look to the increasing disparities without question. I wonder for how long the Remuneration Tribunal can continue the farce of the consultation that takes place between the Minister of the day and the members of that Tribunal, which I am told has taken place repeatedly in the past before the determination is made. I wonder for how long we will continue to put up with the situation which was so eloquently described by Lord Glenamara. I wonder whether the points made by Senator Collard and Senator MacGibbon, and I have no doubt they could be made by others, about the increasing disparities between the power and influence and patronage that exist in the Executive, in comparison with the position of the Parliament will be tolerated by this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refrain from taking up more time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the problem with the salaries of Ministers is that the amount recommended by the Tribunal has to be taken out of the amount which is available. It is necessary to increase the total appropriation so that the amount available will meet the salaries which have been set down. Quite frequently we have to increase the amount shown to provide a pool from which Ministerial increments can be paid. In answer to Senator Macklin's question, my understanding is that the way in which the correct annual scale of salaries will be achieved will be to set a lesser amount for the remainder of the year. For a private senator or member, a salary of $33,000 will have been achieved at the end of the year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Part III deals with the salaries of Ministers and provides for the sum appropriated under the Ministers of State Act to be increased to provide for half the increases in the Tribunal's report. </PARA>
<PARA>In looking at that explanation of the increase from $400,000 to $452,000 one could expect that will be the amount or the pool or, as someone on this side of the House called it, the slush fund that will be available for the salaries of Ministers. How do we know that that $452,000 is the sum that is necessary to provide for only half the increases recommended in the Tribunal's report? I would like to know why the salaries of Ministers were not outlined in this Bill in the same way that salaries for members and office holders were outlined. If Ministers' salaries could not be outlined in this Bill, why were they not outlined in some other appropriate Bill? It seems to me that we have a Remuneration Tribunal report which, amongst other things, has details of salaries of Ministers. But as far as I can see, this Bill does not say anything about reducing the amount for Ministers which was mentioned in the Remuneration Tribunal's report. All the Bill states is that an amount of $452,000 will be made available. I do not know whether that is the amount that is necessary if the Minister is asking us to trust that that is so. Why are not the Ministers' salaries, which are allegedly going to be cut to only half the original increase, not laid out in this or some other Bill? As they are not in this Bill, what is the status of the Remuneration Tribunal's report in relation to Ministers?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin asked another question which I thought was of some significance. If Senator Peter Baume will permit me may I give him a break for a moment and refer to that question. It was about retrospectivity. As I understand it, the legitimisation of retrospectivity is that under the legislation establishing the Remuneration Tribunal there are dates from which determinations made by the Remuneration Tribunal take effect. The Remuneration Tribunal made a determination which took effect from 1 July. That being so, the legal determination was part of the law of this country from 1 July. The interference, the readjustment or what have you that is being made tonight is not an increase retrospectively but a decrease. So that the adjustments being made tonight will take effect from the time of the commencement of the determination. Therefore, if anybody is to suffer it is those who will be the subject of downward adjustments. It is not a case of retrospectivity imposing a penalty either on the Consolidated Revenue or on anybody but the recipients of the benefits or otherwise of the determination that was made. In those circumstances it is not offensive retrospectivity but rather the opposite. It is imposing a penalty on the recipient and not on anybody else and backdating it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its courtesy. I regard what happened tonight as a rather extraordinary thing indeed. I have seen the Bill for only a few minutes. I heard Senator Rae speaking and I had the impression that he was speaking on a Bill in connection with the remuneration of members of parliament. I have taken part in discussions on this matter constantly but I had no knowledge that the Bill had been introduced in the Senate. I looked at the Notice Paper today. I was assured that tonight General Business would be taking precedence of Government Business. There was no reference of course on the Notice Paper to the fact that the Bill was to be brought forward. Nor did I have any knowledge that it had passed the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to say a number of things about the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1981. I support the Bill. I am prepared to vote for the Bill. I am very sorry to see that the Bill overturns some of the decisions made this year by the Remuneration Tribunal. For years I have supported the fact that we have a tribunal which is supposed to take out of politics the question of the remuneration of members of parliament. Unfortunately, nearly every time the Tribunal makes a decision there is some interference on the part of government which determines-sometimes it then changes its mind-that it will alter the decision made by an independent tribunal. It is high time we respected the umpire's decision and decided that these matters be taken out of the realm of politics. Of course, in the last few days a very considerable objection has been raised by the overwhelming number of members of government parties to what has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of this Bill members of parliament this year will take a $3,000, more or less, reduction in the amounts which the Tribunal determined. After very close consideration and after massive submissions were made to it, the Tribunal established the considerable need and entitlement of members to increases in salaries. That view was expressed in the submissions made by the party committee of which I am a member and which put substantial facts before the Tribunal. It can be seen from the Tribunal's judgment that those submissions were generally accepted. It was not as though the decision of the Tribunal was a generous one; I think it was a moderate one. It is not as though I find myself in complete agreement with everything the Tribunal did. Amongst other things-I think this was referred to by Senator Rae this evening-the chairman of the party committee made representations to the Tribunal. Senator Rae and I appeared before the Tribunal and argued our case. In fact, the Tribunal decision made no reference whatsoever to those submissions. I think that is an extraordinary omission. I do not know to what extent Senator Rae has spoken on this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see. As far as that is concerned, we are not all that happy with that part of the Tribunal's decisions which is concerned with the requirements of the Senate office holders and the Chairman of Committees. Nonetheless, as far as I am concerned that was the decision of the Tribunal. I think it should have stood. I think it would have stood and I think the initial decision of the Government would have been upheld but for some members of parliament who sought to climb on a bandwaggon of indignation created by the Press. It is interesting to indicate that the Press, which told the community how terrible it is that there should be increases in parliamentarian's salaries, did not take into account their own salary increases. One can make a comparison between what has happened to parliamentary salaries and the salaries of Press people. Over the last seven years I think Press salaries have increased by 109 per cent, but parliamentary salaries have gone up by 50 per cent. If one looks at the profits of newspapers one finds that in the period from 1974-1980 their profits have ranged from 142 per cent for Advertiser Newspapers Ltd, 274 per cent for Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd and 355 per cent for the News Corporation Ltd. These are enormous increases in the profits made by newspapers. Yet they have the audacity to tell members of parliament that it is all right that they receive only a 50 per cent increase on their salaries. If I had been in the country when that controversy was going on-unfortunately, I was spending my money elsewhere trying to acquire information to come back here to serve the people-I certainly would have had a lot to say about the way the Press handled the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important that the community should know the facts so far as comparative salaries are concerned. As an indication of comparative salary rises I desire to incorporate in Hansard two documents prepared by the Parliamentary Library. One of the documents is entitled 'Indicators of Newspaper Company Profits, 1974-1980' and the other is entitled 'Movements in Salaries for Selected Occupations June 1974 and March 1981'. It is indicated, for example that a professor's salary had gone up on the average by 104 per cent. A senior tutor's salary has increased by 109 per cent. Of course no other groups on the list compares with parliamentarians as regards the level of salary increases. Medical fees have increased in that period by 138 per cent. Similarly, pensions and benefits have gone up by 146 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the documents I have referred to so that these facts will be known to people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of the representations that were made and the evidence that was heard the Tribunal came to certain conclusions. Although we may accept the decision which has now been made and which I presume is contained in the Bill-I saw the Bill only a few minutes ago so I have not had time to read it-one can conclude that there are dangers when we appoint a tribunal and ask it to determine the salaries of members of parliament and then overturn its decision. One wonders how long a tribunal will put up with that sort of treatment of its efforts. So far as this matter is concerned, I believe members of parliament have been much too meek and quiescent in accepting the constant abuse and blame which they have received. Tonight I intend to announce the commencement of a campaign for shorter hours for members of parliament. I think we should aim for a 65-hour week. In my opinion most members of parliament work much longer hours than that. For many jobs we are talking fashionably now of a 35-hour week but this Parliament sits for a crazy 65-hour week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it will be a good idea if we change the working hours. The illnesses which have fallen upon parliamentarians, even this week, ought to make us think about why people are not seeking to enter parliament and why people are frightened off contesting the pre-selection ballots in the various parts of the country. I say that we ought not to be quite so silent about the criticisms which are made of parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now have before us a Bill in which the only change effected to the determination is the reduction by $3,000 of the remuneration to be paid to members. The purpose is said to be to encourage the community to exercise restraint. I do not think that it will have that effect. It never has had. Whenever we have refused any increase it has had no effect on the community whatsoever. The reduction is not being applied to judges or to public servants. There are now some 1,500 Commonwealth public servants earning more than are the members of this Parliament. They treat those members with a fair amount of contempt because money is what matters to quite a lot of the members of the Public Service. If the original proposal had been followed through, I understand that there would have been only 700 members of the Public Service earning more than do members of parliament. They are, of course, untouched by the gesture that we are now making. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, insofar as we accept this reduction as members of the Parliament, and get the Government off the hook, having in mind the awkward situation that it is in, we recognise that next year the Tribunal will meet again in the normal course and that submissions will be made to it. We expect that by then the full 20 per cent increase, as of right, will have come to members of parliament and may expect that the Tribunal will take into account the changes in inflation levels which will occur in the interim. So next year there will also be a fairly large increase in members' salaries. If the Press again attacks us on the basis of what we are doing, I can assure honourable senators that I will be in the forefront of defending what members of parliament are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that my colleagues in this place and in the other place, on both sides, are doing a fine and excellent job. They are working under terrible conditions and do so because they are interested in their work and are concerned to be in the Parliament. They are not in it to make money, and they do not. Although I will vote for the Bill, I say that it is a pity that it comes about in this way and I am sure that next year we will be hoping that justice will be done the members of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In closing the third reading debate I wish to respond briefly to the remarks of Senator Colston. There is a very simple explanation. Section 7 of the Remuneration Tribunal Act, which refers to senators and members, provides that the Remuneration Tribunal 'shall, from time to time . . . inquire into, and determine . . .' certain matters. It makes determinations in relation to senators and members. Ministers are in a different situation. Section 66 of the Constitution sets out their position. Section 6 of the Remuneration Tribunal Act provides that 'The Tribunal shall, from time to time . . . inquire into, and report . . .' upon the salaries of Ministers. The Tribunal does not have the power to make a determination in regard to Ministers' salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1 July Ministers have been receiving only half of the increases recommended by the Tribunal. As the determination of the Tribunal did not automatically apply it was decided that Ministers should take only half of the increases recommended. The provision of $452,000 made in the Bill is sufficient to pay only half of the increases proposed for Ministers. I believe that is the assurance that the honourable senator sought. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills propose to amend the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act and the Television Stations Licence Fees Act 1964 to vary the basis on which commercial broadcasting and television stations are charged for their use of a limited public resource. Honourable senators will be aware that those Acts impose fees in the nature of a royalty charge, thus following the practice common to all governments of ensuring that the public gains some benefit from the commercial utilisation of public resources. The present Acts provide for a lump sum payment on the original grant of a licence and for a lump sum and a percentage of the gross earnings of the station in respect of each year after the grant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills propose an increased fee of $500 on the grant of a licence and tying the annual fee simply to a revised percentage of gross earning. That percentage varies in relation to increases in gross earnings. Royalties on resource use are based on the value of the resource used, rather than on the ability of the management of a particular user to make a profit from the utilisation of that resource. Accordingly honourable senators will know the charges are based on the gross earnings representing commercial value of licence use. There is of course a correlation, given competent management, between profitability and gross earnings. Those stations with higher gross earnings based as they are on the use of the public resource in general do enjoy higher profitability. It is equitable then that these stations should contribute a higher percentage of those earnings than much smaller stations. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been the practice in the past and continues with the present proposal. In fact, stations with gross earnings of less than about $2 1/2m will pay lower fees than under the current provisions. This will benefit approximately 120 of 130 commercial broadcasting stations and 20 of 50 commercial television stations. The Government hopes that this will enable stations benefiting by these changes to improve programming and services to the public. It does not believe that these aspects will sufer in the bigger stations. Advertising revenue is the life blood of commercial broadcasting and television. It is directly related to the audience share of a particular station and obviously this relates to the programming appeal of the station to the general public. No station can, therefore, afford to lower its programming standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the proposed rates are clearly shown in the Bills. The changes will take effect on 1 September 1981. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced in the other place on 18 September 1981, the new structure of fees for commercial radio and television station licences will raise revenue from this source to an estimated $31.5m in 1981-82. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where Senator Chaney is. This morning I left at his office a lengthy question and the answer I received on a serious industrial matter. The question is No. 866. Senator Chaney's office staff would have seen the document. I will seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. It deals with sexual harassment of people in the Australian Railways Union. The members are car cleaners in the Sydney metropolitan area. I received a fairly comprehensive answer although, to put it bluntly, I had to ring the office of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) persistently to get it in the recess. The reply said that on 16 July a further decision would be made. A Tribunal or Board of Review was elected to sieve the allegations of a serious nature. A report of the board's findings was promised on 17 July. Conciliation and Arbitration Commissioner Walker was to receive the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is time that he informed the Senate of that report. I understand that he was sick for a while. So are other people but they have to pick up the slack. It is an insult to the Senate that Mr Viner should adopt a lethargic approach in giving answers to questions on industrial relations. I seek leave to have the question and answer incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The investigation is being conducted by a Local Industrial Board established under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Department of Industrial Relations is not involved in that investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Commissioner Walker of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is entrusted with resolving the dispute. He established a Local Industrial Board pursuant to section 44 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 on 9 April 1981 to assist him in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) The Local Industrial Board comprises:</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Suzanne JOBSON, Chairperson</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Dorothy BUCKLAND, representative of employees</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harry SHIRLAW, representative of the State Rail Authority of New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Jobson is a member of the Anti-Discrimination Board of New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Buckland is a Commissioner of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Shirlaw is a retired associate manager, industrial section of the State Rail Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Chairperson is paid a fee of $100 per sitting day by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If the sitting is for less than three hours in any day, the payment is $50. Payments for fees and expenses to Ms Jobson have totalled $2,677.63 to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The other members are, as far as is known, paid by the organisations they represent, but do not receive fees from the Commonwealth Government for their attendances at Board meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) See (b). </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Local Industrial Board's proceedings were not open to the public. A report of the Board's findings is due to be presented to Commissioner Walker on 16 July 1981. The course of the dispute and the question of whether the Board's report will be made public will be within the Commissioner's discretion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stress again that I took the trouble of giving Senator Chaney 12 hours notice to liaise with Mr Viner, the Minister for Industrial Relations. It is typical of Mr Viner. He is very good at criticising the trade union movement. There are well paid conciliation and arbitration commissioners on the Board of Review. I think I am entitled to better service. If I get the opportunity I will raise the matter on the appropriate Estimates committee with people such as Mr Linehan. I want to know why they are so sluggish. Perhaps they could get into a track suit and do a bit of training. That goes for Commissioner Walker too. The Senate is still sitting at 10.45 p.m. Commissioner Walker is probably at home in bed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is time we had a look at the physical fitness of conciliation and arbitration commissioners like Mr Walker. It is a pretty poor show. I hope that I will hear something on this matter when the Parliament resumes in a week's time. If not, I will raise the matter again. It is not asking too much for Mr Viner to be decent enough to phone me by next Wednesday and give an explanation. I assure honourable senators that I will start a vendetta against Commissioner Walker, as I did against Commissioner Gough when he was sluggish and he got kicked out. I think Commissioner Walker is a bludger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter in relation to the Department of Defence, where I believe a gross assault on personal liberties is taking place. I say personal liberties because I do not know that one can talk about civil liberties in a defence setting. Normally, this would be a matter of civil liberties. I was astounded earlier this year when I was contacted by a member of the Army who told me that she was in a de facto relationship with another member of the Army and that the relationship had been recognised for almost three years by the service, but due to new regulations this couple is likely to lose that recognition. After being contacted by the member, I made inquiries and I found that the circumstances arose because of a determination made by the Minister for Defence, the Hon. D. J. Killen, known as Determination No. 1 of 1981. The citation for the Determination reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Determination may be cited as Determination 0114, Married Trainee's Allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Determination raises a number of matters, many of which, frankly, I find difficult to understand. One of the consequences seems to be that this young lady and her partner will lose a right which previously was guaranteed to them, namely, recognition of their de facto relationship. A Department of Defence memorandum issued on 7 April takes 10 pages to explain the Determination. On pages 4 and 5 the memorandum notes in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Recognition of a de facto relationship will not be considered where any of the following conditions apply:</PARA>
<PARA> A. Where both partners to the application are unmarried and there are no children in the care of the member or de facto spouse. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that this will prevent continuation of the recognition of my constituent's de facto relationship. Part of a statement which this servicewoman gave to me states:</PARA>
<PARA> 6. X and I met late in 1975, and began seeing each other regularly from early 1976. In the August of 1977, we were both posted to Queensland and began living together on a permanent and bona-fide domestic basis. Twelve months later, we applied for Service Recognition of our Defacto Relationship, which was granted on the 28th August, 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Our domestic situation has not changed, and our Original Statutory Declarations are still valid, and yet, over four (4) years later, we are now confronted with the fact that if we do not conform with the Policy laid out by some moral expert or 'Heavenly Body' in Canberra, we will no longer be recognised as a Service Couple. The most drastic consequence of this new situation is that both being re-categorized 'O', we are not eligible to be re-posted together. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems incredible. The couple have been living together for four years, the relationship had been accepted by the Army for three years, and now they face derecognition. I wrote to the Minister for Defence about this matter, and in part he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to your personal representations on behalf of a servicewoman, concerning Service recognition of de facto relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that new criteria for recognition of de facto relationships by the Services were brought into effect from 13 January, 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The new criteria are more stringent and this was seen as necessary to correct an unacceptable situation which previously allowed some young Service people the financial benefits of married status, where in some instances, no genuine or potentially lasting relationship had been formed. </PARA>
<PARA> Following a transitional period of twelve months, all de facto relationships which were recognised before 13 January, 1981 are to be reviewed on 13 January, 1982, to determine whether recognition may be continued. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to re-state part of that reply. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The new criteria are more stringent and this was seen as necessary to correct an unacceptable situation which previously allowed some young Service people the financial benefits of married status, where in some instances, no genuine or potentially lasting relationship had been formed. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should leave aside the question of who determines whether a genuine or potentially lasting relationship has been formed. Is it the moral expert or the heavenly body to whom my constituent refers? Even if I leave that aside, surely a relationship which has continued since 1977 should be accepted as a lasting one. Why now take away from two members of the Service who have a genuine relationship the recognition previously given? I suggest to the Minister that he have this matter re-examined and bring forth a regulation which allows previously recognised de facto relationships to retain such recognition. In making this suggestion to the Minister let me quote one further telling point made by my constituent. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Service seems to lose all reality at times, and continually forgets that the little 'cogs' in the great wheel are in fact individual people with individual beliefs, goals, and standards. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe we should regain some reality and recognise those individual beliefs, goals and standards of Service members. I look forward to an early comment from the Minister on my suggestion that he have the matter re-examined and bring forth a regulation which allows the recognition which this couple had to continue. </PARA>

I suggest to the honourable senator that we pass on the Hansard report, when it appears, to the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) into whose area it falls and that we seek for Senator Colston a re-examination of the kind he has requested.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Government required the Australian Optometrical Association to conduct such a survey before it would consider an adjustment in optometrical consultation fees in 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not ignore the findings of the survey, in fact it used the information from the survey to develop an index of optometrical consulting practice costs and incomes. This index formed the basis of the increase of 9.6 per cent in fees that came into effect from 1 January 1981, twelve months after the previous increase.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did, however, disagree with the Australian Optometrical Association about the way in which the Association had used the data from its survey in presenting its submission for a fee increase in excess of 30 per cent over a twelve month period.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The cost of the survey was borne by the Australian Optometrical Association, and, as advised by the Association, the direct cost was approximately $30,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Optometric Extension Program, Australia, has made representations regarding time-tiered items, for optometrical consultations for conditions such as visually related learning problems, amblyopia, strabismus and low vision. The Australian Optometrical Association has also recommended the introduction of brief and extended consultation items.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. I met with representatives of the Australian Optometrical Association on 17 February 1981. I expressed some concern about increasing the number of items because this could lead to abuse. The Association advised that it would write further to me regarding this matter, however, to date no such submission has been received.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested to the Optometric Extension Program, Australia, that they liaise with the Australian Optometrical Association to ensure that the Association's submission represents as fully as possible the views of the optometrical profession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the 1980 Index of Disadvantage, in relation to the Disadvantaged Schools Program, assume that if a non-government school is located in a disadvantaged district it should be regarded as disadvantaged for the purposes of aggregating numbers in non-government schools; if so, how does this take account of the selective nature on non-government schools which may draw their enrolments selectively from that district and other districts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Index of Disadvantage was recommended by the Commonwealth Schools Commission as the basis for distributing funds between States and between the government and non-government school sectors for the Disadvantaged Schools Program. The Government has accepted this recommendation. The Index itself did not classify individual government or non-government schools as being disadvantaged. It provided a measure of disadvantage, in terms of socio-economic criteria, for each collectors' district in Australia-the collectors' district being the smallest area of collection used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in its national censuses. Student enrolments in both school sectors in the most disadvantaged collectors' districts, the lowest 16 per cent, were then used as the basis for the Commission's recommendation for determining the block funds to be made available to the government and non-government school sectors within each State.</PARA>
<PARA> Once these block grants have been established, State and non-government school authorities at the local State level, determine the individual schools that will participate in the Program. In the case of Catholic systemic non-government schools, representative committees in each State, the Catholic Disadvantaged School committees, establish their own criteria for selecting schools.</PARA>
<PARA> Individual non-systemic non-government schools are invited to apply for inclusion in the program where they feel they are eligible. The Commonwealth Schools Commission through its State Planning and Finance Committees assesses these applications in terms of socio-economic information provided by schools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 April 1981 (Hansard page 1543) Senator Tate asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, concerns the callous refusal of the Government to permit sailors who served on HMAS Sydney and its destroyer escorts during the Vietnam war to share in the benefits of our repatriation system. Is it a fact that the coastal waters off Vietnam through which those vessels moved was declared a war zone? Is it a fact that the port in which the vessels were anchored was defoliated in order to clear the area of Vietcong snipers? Is it a fact that on occasions when they were at anchor the sailors were closed up because of the dangers of their situation? Is it a fact that diving teams were constantly sent down to ensure that the hull and anchor cables were not in jeopardy because of mines? Why does the Government, led by a Prime Minister who was a Minister for Defence during that Vietnam war, continue callously to refuse to recognize the fact that these sailors were, indeed, exposed to danger and ought to receive the benefits of our repatriation system?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The coastal waters off Vietman were declared a special area under the Repatriation (Special Areas) Regulations. My Department is unaware of any defoliation operations being conducted in the Port of Vung Tau during the Vietnam war. It is confirmed that the armament an sensor systems of the ships were manned while transiting and at anchor within the special area. Precautions were taken against enemy swimmers by having the ships divers work in a two watch system so that one diving party cruised around the ship continuously, carrying out searchers of the hull and anchor cable as required.</PARA>
<PARA> The crew of HMAS Sydney and escorts were not allotted for special duty under the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962-67. The reason why HMAS Sydney and escorts were not allotted was because their voyages to Vietnam were of a transitory nature only. They did not remain thre for operational duty. Although the crews of HMAS Sydney and escorts were not normally allotted for special duty, they did not have a latent protection under the Repatriation Act for any possible occurrence from enemy action during the period of their journey.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1565), Senator Grimes asked me, as Minister for Social Security, the following question without notice concerning the new rules for people seeking disadvantaged status under the new health arrangements:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How will these people claim for previously paid hospital and medical bills, as was stated in the Minister's answer to Senator Button's question last Thursday?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How can they ensure that the doctor they see will participate in the disadvantaged scheme?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does the Government expect that in levying in-patient and out-patient charges the States will levy charges in hospital pharmacies?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If so, will this remove an option for free pharmaceuticals which are at present available to the disadvantaged patient?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) See Hansard (5 May 1981, page 1565).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Health, that the Commonwealth lacks any power to compel medical practitioners to participate in arrangements such as the disadvantaged persons scheme. However, the medical profession has a long tradition of providing care to needy patients at concessional charges. By and large the profession has co-operated in the present disadvantaged persons scheme, whereby under the bulk billing system the Commonwealth pays benefits to the doctor of 75 per cent of the Schedule fee. Under the new bulk billing arrangements the inducement to the doctor to treat the patient at disadvantaged rates will be greater because the benefit will be 85 per cent of the Schedule fee (and this will be the full charge to the patient). Moreover, doctors will be able, if they do not wish to bulk bill, to bill the disadvantaged patient for the full Schedule fee and medical benefit funds will pay a Commonwealth benefit of at least 85 per cent of the fee, leaving the patient to pay a maximum of $5 for the service, so long as the Schedule fee is charged.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Health, that under the new funding arrangements, the Commonwealth will make a health grant to each State as the Commonwealth's contribution to that State's public hospitals, and community health and school dental programs. As in the past, the charges are expected to cover provision of pharmaceuticals to hospital patients which are necessary for their treatment. This matter will be one for States. Free public hospital in-patient and out-patient services to eligible pensioners and disadvantaged persons and their dependants as defined will also include pharmaceuticals necessary for the treatment of such persons without charge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 March 1981 (Hansard, page 785), Senator Mulvihill asked me without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until Nabarlek ceases operations in about six years time and proves that its effective sealing of its tailing deposits is not a future environmental threat to the Alligator Rivers system, will the Minister give an assurance that no mining operation leases will be granted other than those which are now in operation? Alternatively, will the Minister suggest to those self-same mining operators that they do their prospecting in the former pastoral leases of Sir William Gunn rather than in the Kakadu area? Finally, as the Minister will well know, if my suggestion is followed we will only be emulating the United States policy in Alaska where 40 per cent of that State is for evermore unavailable to any mineral prospecting whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision of 7 March 1979 to approve the development of the Nabarlek uranium deposit was taken following full consideration of the project's environmental impact assessment and the consequent recommendations of the then Minister for Science and the Environment. A detailed account of the environmental conditions applying to uranium mining operations at Nabarlek, the arrangements for ensuring compliance and the stage reached in regulation, research and development of standards, practices and procedures is contained in the Annual Reports of the Supervising Scientist.</PARA>
<PARA> Government policy on further exploration and development in the Region is that exploration in the Stage I area of the Kakadu National Park should not proceed for the time being and that future exploration will be carefully controlled in accordance with the Park Plan of Management.</PARA>
<PARA> Government policy in respect of the Stage II area provides that, before being incorporated in the Park, it will be declared a conservation zone, and exploration to identify the resources of the area will be permitted only under strictly controlled conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal land claims have been lodged over the Stage II area and assurances have been given to the Aboriginal people that until these have been determined, the Government will not permit the granting of mining interests without their prior consultation and agreement. A report on these land claims by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey, was released on 22 July 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Gimbat and Goodparla properties formerly owned by Sir William Gunn, the Government accepted the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry's recommendation that they be considered for later addition to the Park. The properties were acquired by the Commonwealth in June 1978. A land use study of the leases is currently being undertaken jointly by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments in order that decisions might be taken on their future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1884) Senator Missen asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will consideration be given by the Government to the proposal put forward by the Council for Overseas Aid that Australia should move for a United Nations study of the possibility of introducing an international tax, including a tax on arms production, to raise funds for economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government shares ACFOA's concern to improve the predictability of international aid flows. The Government is aware of a number of proposals for some form of international taxation including a variety of means of automatic transfer. However, it notes that the weight of expert assessment is that such proposals have substantial disadvantages, both of a conceptual and practical/administrative nature.</PARA>
<PARA> An important aspect is that automatic transfers through forms of international revenue raised from taxation have far reaching implications for relations among nations. A commitment to the principle of international taxation by levies on activities of sovereign states would involve a degree of derogation of sovereignty which most States at this stage are unprepared to accept. While it would seem highly desirable to divert to international economic development some of the enormous resources devoted to arms expenditures, it is a regrettable fact that while there are continuing threats to international security States are simply not, at this stage, prepared to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of international taxation has already been widely canvassed. The Government has serious doubts that a special UN study on the matter would assist in overcoming the essential problems associated with the proposals, including the lack of preparedness by Governments to accept international taxation. It would prefer international attention to concentrate more on other measures to assure volume and continuity of funds for economic development.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provide the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Although it is agreed that many nourishing, moisturising and revitalising skin creams could be beneficial in harsh and dry climates, I could not support the proposal to remove all such creams from the luxury class of cosmetics which attracts a high rate of sales tax. However, in March 1978, the Government decided to remove sales tax from sunscreen preparations that provide effective protection from damaging ultra-violet rays. Since that time, any preparation which is marketed for use as a substance to be applied to the skin for the purpose of screening out solar ultra-violet rays and which is certified by the Director-General of Health to provide an acceptable level of protection from solar ultra-violet rays qualifies for sales tax exemption under Item 38A of the First Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. Some of the preparations in question do contain sunscreens and have met the required criteria for exemption from sales tax by the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>

<PARA> My questions emanate from the CITES Conference held in New Delhi in March this year which considered the subject of restrictions to curb the alleged illegal black market export of ivory tusks from various African countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) What instructions have been given to Customs officers to check for illegal tusks?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What role are we playing at the United Nations?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has any illegal traffic been detected and have any prosecutions been launched?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) At the Conference held in New Delhi last March, Contracting Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) expressed concern about the depredation of some populations of African elephant by illegal trade in ivory. The Conference decided the African elephant should continue to be listed in Appendix II to the Convention to allow some strictly regulated commercial trade.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of CITES are enacted through the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations. These Regulations are being amended to include the African elephant and products of this species. Customs officers have been instructed that imports of products of the African elephant, including ivory articles, are to be permitted only after the Australian scientific authority for CITES, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, advises that the importation will not adversely affect the survival of the species and the importer has produced official documentation from the CITES management authority in the country of origin declaring that the ivory was legally acquired.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia is one of 67 countries who are members of CITES. Since the inception of the Convention in Washington in 1973, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has represented Australia at all CITES Conferences.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No illegal traffic of raw ivory has been detected in Australia. There have been a few isolated instances where small consignments of worked ivory, for example bangles, rings, et cetera have been imported without proper documentation and seized by Customs as prohibited imports. In these cases, because of the small quantity involved forfeiture of the goods concerned was considered sufficient penalty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At 29 May 1981 a total of $60.4m had been committed to the Program since its inception in 1978. The figure of $18.4m refers to the value of the grants approved in 1980-81 to 29 May. Funds for the Program are provided from appropriation and associated approved forward commitment and also from the Coal Research Levy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The value of the grants approved in 1979-80 was $7.9m higher than the value to 29 May in 1980-81. However this apparent decrease resulted from the fact that the bulk of the funds expected to accrue from the Coal Research Levy over the period 1979-82 was committed in 1979-80. Actual expenditure from both the Coal Research Levy and appropriation has continued to increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Precise details of the costs of paying all Commonwealth employees are not available. I am, however, able to provide estimates based on a departmental study undertaken some years ago, of the costs of paying wages and salaries in cash to staff employed by Commonwealth departments under the Public Service Act (that is, excluding major statutory authorities) who were paid in this form. Estimates for the past five financial years, derived by updating the results of the study by relevant cost indices, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1976-77-$2m; 1977-78-$2.181m; 1978-79-$2.346m; 1979-80-$2.476m; and 1980-81-$2.521m.</PARA>
<PARA>These figures include estimated enveloping, delivery, and security services, computer processing costs and staff resources costs involved in distributing and acquitting pays.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the case of staff employed by Commonwealth departments under the Public Service Act, the estimated cost which would have been incurred in each of the past five years if those who were paid in cash had been paid by cheque or bank transfer is shown in the following table.</PARA>
<PARA> These estimates, which are based on the study referred to in the answer to (1), include enveloping, stationery and postage costs, computer processing costs and the savings bank transaction fee. They should be regarded as approximations only-in particular, they assume that the average cost incurred in respect of these employees would have been the same as the estimated average cost of paying those employees who were paid by cheque or bank transfer in each of those years.</PARA>
<PARA> 1976-77-$0.712m; 1977-78-$0.776m; 1978-79- $0.901m; 1979-80-$0.916m; and 1980-81-$0.908m.</PARA>
<PARA>I also draw the honourable senator's attention to a document entitled 'Cashless Pay', which reports the results of a study by the Central Policy Review Staff in the United Kingdom. The study concluded that there were significant advantages, including cost savings and increased security for employees, in the movement to 'cashless pay'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1807) Senator Thomas asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question, without notice, concerning tax sharing arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Carrick undertook to refer the question to the Treasurer, who has provided the following response:</PARA>
<PARA> The matters raised in the letter from the Premier of Western Australia to the honourable senator were given careful consideration by the Government in the formulation of the revised tax sharing arrangements which have now been embodied in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The new tax sharing arrangements reflect, inter alia, the need to restrain the growth in the public sector in order to make more room for the expansion of the private sector to proceed in a manner consistent with containing and reducing inflation. The Government considers that assistance to be provided to the States in 1981-82 and subsequent years represents an appropriate balance between the financial needs of the States and the requirements of responsible economic policy. As such, the Government sees the new arrangements as in the basic interests not only of Australia as a whole but also of individual States.</PARA>
<PARA> There was no 'assurance' given in 1976 that the States would continue indefinitely to receive any specific share of income tax collections. In fact, the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976 made specific provision for review of the tax sharing arrangements before 30 June 1981 and, at the Premiers' Conference in June, 1980, the Commonwealth gave clear notice of its view that the tax sharing arrangements established in 1976 had been unsustainably generous and that they would be reviewed in 1980-81. There were, therefore, no grounds on which any State Government could have based any expectation that the personal income tax sharing arrangements would not be modified.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the provision in the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976 requiring consultation was fully met. The arrangements decided at the Premiers' Conference held on 4 May took account of the detailed submission on tax sharing that the States presented in February 1981 and of the views expressed by Premiers at that Conference. In turn, the arrangements decided at the 20 June Premiers' Conference reflected consideration of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Report on State Tax Sharing Entitlements 1981 and of views expressed by Premiers at that Conference.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> In a Press statement of 12 July 1979 I announced that the Government had decided not to introduce the scheme of national superannuation recommended by the majority of the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry. I also indicated in that statement that the Government had established a task force to consider the role of occupational superannuation in providing for retirement and whether there was a need to revise or impose new standards for schemes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (8) The Department of Veterans' Affairs is continuing to examine its operations to determine where it might be practicable to contract out services to the private sector. This examination relates to the overall decisions about contracting out of services and involves consultation with those departments charged with the co-ordinating responsibilities for the particular decisions. Until this review is completed, it is not possible to comment on the number of issues raised in the question. However, on the specific decision relating to increased contracting out of limbs and appliance manufacture to the private sector, I can say that a number of new applications for contracts under the Free Limbs Scheme have been received from persons interested in establishing new businesses, particularly in regional areas. As these enterpises are established there will be an increased number of limbs and appliances manufactured outside of the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres, with some reduction in capacity in the centres. There will be some staff savings which will be achieved through normal wastage. Financial savings are not expected but the advantages will be greater access for patients to a more decentralised orthotic/prosthetic service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In the two tables set out below the Australian Electoral Office has provided information in answer to parts (1) (i) and (2) (i).</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office does not, however, maintain statistics in a form which would enable precise answers to be given to parts (1) (ii) and (2) (ii). Electors' names are removed from the rolls as a consequence of objection action on the grounds of non-residence within Divisions concerned, pursuant to the provisions of sections 52 to 55 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and regulations 26 to 31 of the Electoral and Referendum Regulations. The main sources of objection on the grounds of non-residence are habitation reviews and follow-up action in respect of non-voters at elections but the statistics maintained by the Electoral Office do not so differentiate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office does not maintain statistics which would enable precise answers to be given to parts (1) (iii) and (2) (iii)-electoral rolls are maintained on a sub-divisional basis. To assist the honourable senator transfers out of sub-divisions have been totalled. However, the statistics maintained by the Australian Electoral Office do not differentiate between transfers between sub-subdivisions within a Division and transfers to sub-divisions in other Divisions. The figures supplied therefore must not be interpreted as transfers from Division to Division.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence the statistics show that in the year to December 1980 the names of 285,393 electors were removed from the electoral rolls following objection action on the grounds of non-residence. What has to be realised, however, is that during the same period some 1.5 million names were added to the rolls thoughout Australia. Of course, as the honourable senator will appreciate, these were not all new arrivals in Australia or persons turning 18 yeas of age. But this figure clearly takes into account people who have moved from one address to another, whose names have been removed from the first address by the required objection process, and whose names have been re-entered on the roll at their new address-many of them as a result of habitation review work in the area to which they had moved.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) (i) and (ii) The Australian Electoral Office has advised that habitation reviews are normally conducted on an annual basis (during each financial year). Officers who conduct the reviews are employed on piece rates (i.e. they are paid an amount in respect of each habitation reviewed) and are not employed on an hourly basis. To assist the honourable senator an assessment of the total hours worked by review officers within each of the Divisions has been made on the basis of the number of habitations they could be expected to have visited in one hour.</PARA>
<PARA> The following table sets out, by Division, the number of staff employed on habitation reviews together with an estimate of the monthly total hours worked in each Division during 1980. No habitation review work was undertaken in December.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) The Australian Electoral Office advises that it is not normal practice to review the same areas twice in any one financial year. However, in cases where a review and the follow up work associated with it have been disrupted by, for example, an election the Office may arrange for further reviews.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) Objection procedures are such that Notices of Objection are not forwarded to any elector until at least one month after completion of the Habitation Review process within the sub-division. The elector is then given 20 days to reply to the Notice of Objection.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore if an elector has moved from an address it would be about 60 days before his or her name was removed from the roll on grounds of non-residence. Generally in that time the elector should have established the statutory one month residential qualification in another sub-division and have either re-enrolled of his or her own accord or have been picked up by the Habitation Review in the new sub-division.</PARA>
<PARA> Although it is compulsory for an elector to re-enrol at a new address some electors do overlook this requirement until an election is announced or until they are picked up by the Habitation Review process. In this regard it is important to remember that Habitation Reviews are aimed as much at ensuring that all eligible electors are correctly enrolled, i.e. getting electors on the roll, as it is at removing the names of electors who have lost their eligibility for enrolment in respect of a particular address.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to Habitation Reviews the Australian Electoral Office has a continuing electoral enrolment campaign through schools, and the use of posters and displays. In the run up to every Federal election it conducts a concentrated media campaign to ensure that as many eligible electors as possible are given the opportunity to get their names on the rolls. Nevertheless responsibility for enrolment ultimately lies with the individual.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office does not have any information regarding the time or average time taken by eligible electors to enrol.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I would again refer the honourable senator to answers to parts (1) and (2) of the question above, where it is shown that in the same period in which some 290,000 electors' names were removed from the rolls in 1980 as a result of the objection process, 1.5 million names were added.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) 'Toxic neurosis' is not a term which appears in the International Classification of Diseases and it is not used by medical officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> While it has no scientific accuracy, the term may be used colloquially, as some medical conditions can be caused by various toxic agents.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Bureau of Industry Economics undertakes particular research projects that have priority ranking in terms of their medium to long-term significance for the Australian economy and in consultation with the Council of Advice consisting of representatives from business, the academic community and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The costs of individual projects depend on the number and status of research officers assigned to a project team at any time, the duration of the research task, the requirement for computer-based analysis and field work and the form of publication selected for disseminating the research findings. A large proportion of Bureau operating cost is due to overheads relating to administration, office accommodation and secretarial services and executive functions, thus making it impractical to allocate them to separate projects.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) While the Department of Science and Technology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have interests in the development and application of technology suitable for service activities, the Bureau's work on the economic impact of technological change in the finance and retailing industries is the only known research on this particular topic. To avoid unnecessary duplication, the Bureau's officers liaise with other Departments and instrumentalities as well as with academic researchers and have widely disseminated their research objectives to industry associations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As for (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Bureau's research priorities are determined by the Director, who reports to the Minister, in consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Council of Advice and members of the Bureau's senior staff. The Bureau has professional independence in the conduct and reporting of its research. Its working papers contain preliminary findings and are designed to elicit constructive comment and debate.
