<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 15 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That on the 10th December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, 'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration. . . .' (Article 2) that 'Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives . . . The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures.' (Article 21 (1) and (3).)</PARA>
<PARA> Elections for Senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be.</PARA>
<PARA> However the provision of the Electoral Act that compels voters to show preferences for all candidates on the ballot paper interferes with the free expression of the will of the voters, and is unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and Freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow freedom of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators.</PARA>

The purpose of the meeting is to establish contact between an official of the Treasurer's Department and the monetary authority of Saudi Arabia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. In view of the fact that many pensioners are very concerned about the prospect of the Government's proposal to limit the money they can keep in non-interest bearing bank accounts before having their pensions and fringe benefits cut and bearing in mind that some pensioners use this system to obtain the pension and the fringe benefits, can the Minister assure the Senate that pensioners who are in genuine need will not be disadvantaged by the Government's proposals in this regard?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2437" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made a number of statements on this matter. I have tried to make it clear that pensioners who are in genuine need will not be disadvantaged by the Government's proposals. I think a deal of the concern in this matter has arisen from the fact that some pensioners have drawn the conclusion that the only asset they can have is the $2,000 or $3,000 referred to in the second reading speech in this chamber on the Social Services Amendment Bill, whereas in fact the reference there was to any additional amount held over and above other assets of the pensioner which are returning income. I have issued a number of statements recently making clear the different levels of income which can be received by a pensioner without it affecting his pension or fringe benefits. It is not proposed that there should be any change in those limits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment a single pensioner may get $20 a week in income and a married couple may get $34.50 a week and still be entitled to the full rate of pension. The effect of the tapered income test is to ensure that one can then receive a part pension over a quite wide range of incomes. For example, a married couple may receive a part pension when they have a non-pension income of up to $266 a week. There is a very large range of incomes over which a pension or part pension can be received and there is no proposal that that should be altered.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the fringe benefits, I have said in the Senate before that I think that they are probably more critical for many pensioners. There are existing income limits with respect to those benefits. A single pensioner can have investments or something returning income of up to $40 a week without losing the fringe benefits and a married couple can have up to $68 a week in earnings or other income before they lose their entitlement to the pensioner health benefit card. Amounts which are held in an interest bearing account are amounts over and above amounts which produce that sort of income. It is a fact, however, that some pensioners do keep very large sums of money in non-interest bearing accounts. I have had some quite extraordinary reports over recent months of people holding amounts as high as $80,000 or $50,000 in interest free accounts simply to obtain fringe benefits. That, of course, is a very nice gift to the organisation that is holding the money because there is certainly no value to the pensioner compared with the interest forgone in that situation. It is indeed a field in which, I think, many pensioners are worse off because they arrange their affairs in a way which reduces their income far more than they would lose in pension benefits. The real difficulty in this area, as I have said before, is the fringe benefit situation. It is a situation which I have under examination. I would like to see that problem reduced for pensioners, if not entirely removed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question also is directed to the Minister for Social Security. It relates to the industrial dispute between his Department and the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association in which officers have been stood down in Victoria and other places because they have refused to do work on overpayments ahead of other departmental duties. Is the Minister aware that many of the staff who have officially stopped work and are therefore, not being paid are anxious, nevertheless, to attend their offices in the next day or so in order to issue emergency cheques and process continuation claims so that pensioners and beneficiaries will not suffer? Will they be allowed to do this work so that payments can be made to claimants? If not, what action does the Minister propose to prevent unpaid staff from doing such urgent work?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was one inaccuracy in the particulars which were put forward in the question asked by Senator Grimes which I think I should clear up. He suggested that the bans related to a refusal to do certain work on overpayments ahead of other duties, whereas in fact there has been a simple ban on the carrying out of certain work. It is not a question of whether the work is ahead of other duties, although the union has chosen to try to present the position in the light in which Senator Grimes put it in his question. The fact of the matter is that for a period of 12 months members of the union refused to do part of the work for which they are employed. Notwithstanding repeated requests, those bans were retained in New South Wales and Victoria. That is the central difficulty in this dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the performance of unpaid work by officers, I am aware that a number of them, after they have been stood down or gone off the job, have returned to complete certain work in the interests of clients. As I understand it, that represents a desire not to see clients ill-affected. However, I distinguish between positive actions of that sort and the sorts of threats which were made in the motion which was carried in New South Wales yesterday which refers to additional and varying action at the work place being intensified and random rolling stoppages being continued. I have no doubt that the reference to additional and varying action at the work place relates to the sort of obstructionist procedures which are set out in the booklet produced by Mr Bunn, to which I referred in the Senate last week. I make it quite clear that those officers who engage in activity which obstructs the work of the Department will be required to desist.</PARA>
<PARA> A further threat has been made that a regional office will be opened by union action. It is obviously quite unacceptable to have groups of shop stewards indicating which offices shall be opened and which shall not. The work of my Department, which is being carried on by the majority of officers, who have remained at their posts, will continue for the benefit of clients. It is not possible for the Government to accept that decisions will be made by committees of shop stewards as to what offices shall be opened and when they shall be opened. If that is the sort of co-operation Senator Grimes suggested in his question, it is the sort of co-operation the Government simply cannot accept. Although it is put forward in the guise of co-operation it is, in fact, merely an attempt to take the running of the Department out of the hands of the management.</PARA>

The answer Senator Chaney gave demonstrated the attitude that he has taken on this dispute all along in his refusal to consult and everything else. I ask the Minister: Will officers of the Department be allowed to return to perform their tasks of issuing emergency cheques and processing continuation claims, unpaid, so that payments can be made to claimants who need them? If not, what action does he propose to prevent the staff from doing this unpaid work?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any officer who is prepared to work according to the directions of the management of the Department in the office in which he is employed will have the opportunity to work. Any officer who believes that he can work as he wishes, when he wishes, doing what he wishes will not be tolerated within the Department. That is quite a straightforward matter. As I said in August, I am more than happy to talk to the union when the bans are lifted. I think it is time that the Opposition declared whether it agrees that a trade union is entitled to demand what the level of staffing will be, what work will be performed within a department and what programs will be introduced by a government. I do not believe that any government, or indeed any opposition, can embrace the proposition that a trade union is entitled to take those matters into its own hands. Certainly, that is not a case where the Government would tolerate that happening. As far as my talking to the union is concerned, I again make it quite clear-as I said in August and as I have repeated over and over again-that I am very happy to talk to the union when the bans are lifted.

There is no human foetal tissue bank in Australia at the present time nor is there any intention to establish one. Experimentation on foetal pancreatic tissue to test its viability for transplantation-the idea of that was to try to reverse juvenile onset diabetes, a serious illness in children-is very much in the developmental stage. No transplant of human foetal tissue into diabetic patients has so far been undertaken. All experimentation to date has involved animals only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Martyr previously has raised the question of a tissue bank in the Australian Capital Territory. The only work being carried out in the Australian Capital Territory in this development field is by Dr K. Lafferty of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Dr Lafferty has received a grant from the Tertiary Education Commission for this research. Accordingly, in case there is any other answer that can be given, a copy of Senator Martyr's question has now been referred to the Minister for Education for a response. But in view of the very real concern in the research community and in the public generally concerning human tissue transplants the Minister for Health has referred the question to the Attorney-General for his consideration as to whether the matter could be referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission. If the matter is so referred the National Health and Medical Research Council would be happy to refer to the Commission.

I address it to him, not in a banking sense but in a political sense; hence I ask him rather than Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I draw the Minister's attention to last week's announcement by the Bank of New South Wales that its annual profit had increased from $124m to $165m during last year, which is a rise of 33.3 per cent in one year. Also, did the Minister see the announcement by the Australia and New Zeland Banking Group Limited that its profits increased from $136m to $175m during the same period, a more modest rise of only 29 per cent in one year? Other banks in the process of merging have also reported recently the following profit increases: 33.7 per cent for the National Bank of Australasia Limited, 27.1 per cent for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited and 19.3 per cent for the Commercial Bank of Australia Limited. In view of those announcements, will the Government urgently review the Australian interest rate structure which makes it possible for the banks to achieve those record profit levels? In particular, will the Treasurer act immediately to reduce the savage interest rates which currently apply to home buyers' loans? Finally, how can this Government possibly justify a situation in which banks are charging home buyers interest rates of 17 to 20 per cent on home loans but are allowed to have the gall to achieve such massive increases in real profits?</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a policy matter and I will therefore direct it to the attention of the Treasurer. As honourable senators know, the whole question of interest rates and of banking and bank finance is now under review. The Goverment has directed its budgetary policy fundamentally towards two things, namely, getting the inflation rate down and suppressing interest rates. There are aleady signs that the policy is having an effect on interest rates. This is the main direction that one should take in order to alleviate the burden of interest charges upon people.

It was a very odd news release to make because the figures for the week, of course, were not available at the time it was made, the week consisting of five days and not of four. The suggestion that there had been this great drop was, therefore, previous, and on the same day I issued a statement pointing out that the Friday figures were not yet available and giving an estimate that the figure would be in excess of 65,000 for the week. In fact the advice I have had this morning is that the number of cheques issued for the whole week exceeded 70,000 and was in excess of the average of the preceding three weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a real difficulty in dealing with this dispute that there has been what appears to be a positive campaign of misinformation. It is sometimes difficult, even when the correct information is issued almost immediately, to ensure that the people who are reporting on the matter have both sets of information before them. Indeed, in a discussion on Friday with someone from the Australian Broadcasting Commission the view was put to a member of my staff: 'We are entitled to put the views of the other side'. I respectfully suggest that in matters such as this we are dealing not with views but with facts. It is not a bad idea to get the facts straight so that the public can be a judge of these matters. The fact is that last week the number of cheques issued was larger than the average number of cheques issued in the previous three weeks, notwithstanding the disruption caused by a minority of the people in my Department.</PARA>

Was the takeover of the operations of Aspect House by the Tasmanian Mental Health Services Commission a condition of the provision by the Commonwealth of a once-only $50,000 grant to the Tasmanian Government for the centre?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter about which a number of questions have been raised in the Senate. There was very understandable public interest because the Aspect House matter affected the care of a group of children, and a group of parents, for whom there would be very great public sympathy. There was, in my view, excellent co-operation from the Tasmanian Government in dealing with what was a very difficult situation. I remind the Senate that originally, as part of the family support scheme which is funded by the Commonwealth, it was agreed that we would provide $60,000, I think it was, to a group of people to provide respite care for severely mentally retarded children. That got under way some time after the original approval. It became apparent very early that the level of expenditure by those operating Aspect House was substantially in excess of the funds which had been granted. There was a further difficulty in that the funds had been made available for a one-year project only and clearly the parents were concerned about the long term future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was agreement between the two governments that fundamentally the matter was the concern of the Mental Health Services Commission rather than my Department or the Community Welfare Department in Tasmania. Therefore, after the review had been undertaken-a review in which both governments participated-there was an agreement that the Mental Health Services Commission would be responsible for the respite care of these children. Because there were financial difficulties for the Tasmanian Government in immediately assuming full responsibility, the Commonwealth agreed that it would make what I think Senator Harradine described as-and what was described at the time as-a one-off grant of $50,000 to the Tasmanian Government to assist it in picking up that responsibility. At the same time it was agreed that the Tasmanian Government would also make available funds of a similar order. I have the Press release which was put out at that time and some of the correspondence undertaken at that time. I indicated that we would be providing funds in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth will provide an amount of $50,000 for the rest of this financial year as a one off grant in order to assist in the provision of care to run a service for severely handicapped children with behavioural difficulties. This is on the basis that the Tasmanian Government will also provide $50,000 for the Mental Health Services Commission to take over the respite care service at Aspect House that was previously operated by Colony 47.</PARA>
<PARA>I should mention that it is my understanding that the premises on which this was conducted were actually the premises of the Mental Health Services Commission. Unfortunately, I think there is some continuing dispute because some of the parents are not satisfied that that is the best course to be followed. I can say only that after very careful examination, firstly by review of the program and secondly, by the Tasmanian authorities, this was thought to be the most appropriate course to follow to provide the sort of care originally sought for these children, namely, respite care which would enable their parents to have some break from the very heavy responsibilities they have for the care of such children.</PARA>

I was able to point out last week that probably Australia has one of the lowest tuberculosis rates in the world, that the overall community rate is still extremely low, and that as our population has aged a bit and those who have suffered from tuberculosis in years past have aged, the elderly population seems to have had concentrated in it the residual effects of tuberculosis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of the honourable senator's question seeks a legal opinion which, in accordance with Standing Order 99, I do not care to offer. I think her question arose out of an article in the Age newspaper this morning. I understand that the authority over sacred sites rests both with the Commonwealth's Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976-clause 69 of that Act relates specifically to sacred sites-and a Northern Territory Act, which is complementary to the land rights Act, called the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1978 (Northern Territory). Both Acts operate for the proper protection of Aboriginal sites. The newspaper report is not completely accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has written to the Prime Minister and to the three land councils advising his intention to amend the complementary legislation, the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1978 (Northern Territory). Mr Everingham has indicated his Government's desire to introduce legislation very soon into the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and to allow it to lie on the table for some months in order to invite public comment with a view to having it considered some time during the first session in 1982. In other words, there is no intention to proceed to any precipitate action. I am given to understand that the Northern Territory Government believes that, by adopting this course of action, a comprehensive and public consideration of the issues will ensue.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not seen any detailed form of the proposed legislation. I do not know in detail what it will contain. If, when it is tabled, there are problems which are identified as a result of the public discussion and if those problems cannot be resolved by reference to procedures which are already provided for under existing legislation-I refer the honourable senator back to clause 69 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act-there may be some case for considering amendments to existing legislation. I want to assure honourable senators and the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory that the Commonwealth will not support any proposed amendments dealing with sacred sites unless there has been full and comprehensive consultation with the Aboriginal people through the land councils and that adequate opportunity has been given for the councils to make known their views, both to the Northern Territory Government and to the Commonwealth Governments. At the moment, all I have to go on is a general statement. I am still waiting to see the form of legislation which may be tabled for public discussion in the Legislative Assembly.</PARA>

There is a proviso to that approval and that is that the operation must be carried out in accordance with the relevant law. That law is the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981, which honourable senators will know received its assent a few months ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the composition of any board or company, and that would include that of the Australian Ballet Foundation, is made up following an election by the members of that board or company. Under the Victorian Companies Act there are approximately 250 members of the Australian Ballet Foundation and these 250 members elected the current board. An Australia Council condition of grant for any company receiving more than $50,000 per year is that the company should have open membership, and the Australian Ballet Foundation does have open membership. I think it is correct to say that perhaps none of the Board members elected has professional experience either in ballet or in the arts, and I concede that point. But the Australia Council is most conscious of the roles and responsibilities of all the boards of all the companies it subsidises. It welcomes and encourages the inclusion of arts practitioners and people associated with the arts on such boards. The honourable senator seems to ask: Should there not be a more active intervention by the Government in the composition of that board of management? Such is not the intention of the Government at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am answering that question, I am reminded that last week I was asked a question about inadequate funding of the arts and while I talked about the continuing substantial general support for the arts, and that is something over $17.25m this year, I did not include, and Senator Hamer has brought this to my mind, the $1.5m or more that is going to the ballet, the $3.33m going to the opera and $2.7m going to the theatre, making a total of over $29m going in support of the arts. I reiterate: The Board of the Australian Ballet Foundation has been elected by its membership. Perhaps what are required are more professional practitioners in that membership.</PARA>

If so, what legal justification is claimed to exist for this procedure? Thirdly, what is the Government's attitude toward the extension to State police forces of a much wider range of telephone tapping powers for criminal investigation purposes than is presently entitled to be exercised by those forces? Those matters, of course, have been the subject of recent strident claims in meetings of police associations and their commissioners. Finally, while he is about it, would he mind telling me when I can expect answers to a question without notice concerning indiscriminate telephone communications interception in Queensland, which I asked on 13 October, over a month ago, and one on the tapping of Melbourne radio stations during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which I asked on 15 October and followed up with a letter to him, again over a month ago, on 22 October?</PARA></TALK.START>

Whether I am able to give an answer on any aspects of it within the usual restrictions that we apply to answering questions dealing with the operations of ASIO is a matter which I will also have to consider further.

I am aware of some expressions of support for this view not only by police commissioners but also by other people. I have not yet formed any definite view on the question. Certainly, it is a very sensitive issue indeed. It is one which I think ought to be seriously considered, and I suggest that that includes consideration by Senator Evans and the Opposition as well. I would certainly be very pleased to know what views Senator Evans has on this subject. There are arguments on both sides.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security but also concerns the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer to the Community Development Employment Project, which, despite a number of improvements which could now be made, has been welcomed by remote Aboriginal communities because it has proved to be a more constructive alternative to individual unemployment benefits, or 'sit-down' money, as it has been called. Does the Minister recall discussing some 18 months ago the need for reviewing and extending CDEP, as raised by a Pitjantjatjara delegation which met him when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and when he was accompanied by his predecessor as Minister for Social Security? When will consideration of the particular requests put at that time, and well received by Ministers, be concluded? When it is recognised that CDEP is a much better program for remote communities than individual unemployment benefits, and that the costs are similar, why cannot a revised, strengthened and extended CDEP be implemented now or at the earliest time in 1982?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am, of course, very familiar with the matter raised by the honourable senator. He is right in saying that it is a concern not merely of me and my Department but also of my friend and colleague Senator Peter Baume and his Department. I think in terms of current consideration one can also include the previous Minister who was at the meeting with the people from the Pitjantjatjara council in this building about 18 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CDEP is one of a number of mechanisms which have been used to enable Aboriginal groups to have some alternative to unemployment benefit or 'sit-down' money. The CDEP is a mechanism whereby the Department of Aboriginal Affairs provides the equivalent amount of unemployment benefit which would otherwise be payable, plus some small additional loading for administration, plant and so on. Work to the value of that amount is then provided in the community to improve the general situation of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague, who has taken a very close interest in this matter, is right in describing it in benign terms, although its effectiveness has varied from place to place. I think it has been very successful in the Torres Strait. I think it has been sometimes successful and sometimes less successful in Central Australia. It has been very useful in the north and in such places as Elcho Island. So whilst it is not an unmixed result, yes, there have been many favourable aspects of CDEP. In addition, my Department has been involved in some arrangements for the bulk payment of individual benefits, particularly in some northern Western Australian communities, the general objective of which is similar to the objective of CDEP. There have been both administrative difficulties and some difficulties of principle. Some people would take the view that because social security benefits are an individual entitlement it is not appropriate to provide mechanisms which interfere with the direct receipt of those benefits by beneficiaries. But in fact it would be the general view of the Government with its experience of CDEP that there is benefit in communities which wish to follow that track in having something like CDEP available to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The discussions which have followed the meeting referred to by Senator Teague in his question are discussions which have been extensive and have involved the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, my own department and the Department of Finance. There have been several discussions between Ministers over the last month. I can only say to Senator Teague that it is my expectation that a decision will be taken shortly as to the path we will follow with respect to the further development of CDEP. In the meantime funds will continue to be provided in support of the existing schemes through programs under the control of my colleague, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 November Senator Gietzelt asked me a question about the position of the Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales. I have obtained some information for the honourable senator. The situation is that in July of this year the Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales, Mr White, who has just passed his sixty-first birthday, told the Chief Australian Electoral Officer that he intended soon to exercise his option of retiring. Mr White has still not decided the date on which he will retire and there is no pressure on him to do so. I emphasise that there is no pressure because Senator Gietzelt's question referred to pressure being put on Mr White. Nor, for that matter, has there ever been any pressure on him. The suggestion which Senator Gietzelt has made is a complete and total fabrication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Geitzelt also suggested that Mr Coleman, the Australian Electoral Officer for Queensland, was to be appointed to New South Wales. The Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales is equivalent in status to a level 3 Public Service Second Division officer. The position of Australian Electoral Officer for Queensland is equivalent to a level 2 officer. When and if the position of Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales becomes vacant, Mr Coleman's claims for the position would quite clearly merit consideration if he were to apply for the position. Certainly the implications for staffing within the Australian Electoral Office, were that move to take place, have been considered by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer. They have been brought to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services. It would be poor administration if this were not the case. However, in considering the possible New South Wales vacancy, the Minister for Administrative Services has already instructed that the position should be advertised. Indeed, I am informed that a draft advertisement was prepared as long ago as August. It has not appeared in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette because, as I said, Mr White has not yet decided on the date of his retirement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October Senator Robert Ray asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question, one part of which related to the take-up of health care cards under the new health arrangements. I referred that part of the question to the Minister for Social Security who has provided me with a reply. To put things in context, the great bulk of people covered by the new health arrangements do not have to apply for cards. Of the estimated three million people who are covered by these arrangements, about two million are eligible pensioners and their dependants for whom pensioner health benefit cards are automatically issued. Of the remaining one million or so people estimated to be eligible for the new health care cards, approximately half are unemployment and special beneficiaries or their dependants. They do not have to apply as they also are issued with cards automatically, in this case every two weeks. The automatic issue of these cards has so far proceeded smoothly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the take-up rate by those people who do have to apply-namely, the 200,000 or so individuals or heads of low income earning and migrant or refugee families-up till 6 November 1981 the Department of Social Security had received nearly 120,000 claims. The Government is pleased with the general level of response from those who are required to apply for health care cards, particularly since some people eligible will not claim until after they have received health care. At the same time we are conscious that any income tested scheme may involve take-up problems, particularly in the early stages. It is for this reason that the Government launched a large publicity program in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this report is the culmination of a long and involved inquiry. The forestry and forest products industries cover a diverse range of economic activities, and the difficulties experienced by the industries in recent years are exemplified by the fact that more than 30 public inquiries into various aspects of their operations have been conducted in the last 10 years. So in this report the Committee has attempted to draw together the threads of all these various inquiries and reports. The Committee notes with concern that many valuable and well-founded recommendations of those inquiries have not been taken up and it seriously questions the merit of conducting further inquiries while recommendations such as those to which it refers go unheeded. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth Constitution, the responsibility for forest management rests with the States. Accordingly, it was not surprising that we were often asked why a Committee of the Senate should become involved. In accepting the reference the Committee believed it to be a proper function of the Senate to investigate areas involving all States' policies and where, perhaps inadvertently, situations arise which are not in the best interests of Australia-wide industries, nor of the nation as a whole. In this context the Committee found that in Australia's quest for national self-sufficiency in wood production each State has also set about achieving self-sufficiency within its own borders. While the goal of national self-sufficiency implies a considerable degree of specialisation and each-way trade between the States, current State policies fail to ensure that this is so. </PARA>
<PARA> This is well demonstrated in the States' administration of softwood plantation development. Based on assessments of future demand, recent studies have recommended plantation establishment rates in the region of 20,000 hectares annually as being adequate. However, actual establishment rates in some years have exceeded 37,000 hectares-almost double the recommended rate. Such plantings will result in increasing surpluses of forest products, when already sizable surpluses of softwood pulpwood are beginning to emerge. Evidence available to the Committee suggests there will be very limited opportunities for the profitable disposal of this material, either on the domestic or export markets, with the end result that plantation development will be more costly than is necessary to achieve self-sufficiency, and returns will be less than adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> In our investigations we devoted particular attention to the vexed question of timber royalties. We found that the present methods used by the State forest services to determine royalties are the result of a patchwork of historical precedent, arbitrary valuations and impulsive responses to political pressures. In most cases, royalty levels bear no relationship to the true costs of growing wood. For instance, we found that the margin between royalties applying to rare rainforest species and to more common timber species fail to recognise the much higher inherent value of the rainforest timbers. The absence of a greater margin encourages the use of rainforest timber in applications where more common timbers would suffice. The methods of royalty determination need to be thoroughly overhauled. We hope this will be done on an Australia-wide basis. This report recommends that royalties should be directly related to the State forest services' costs of managing the plantation forests and should also recognise the scarcity value of the rare native species. </PARA>
<PARA> In a related aspect of forest management, the Committee found the accounts published annually by the forest services to be quite inadequate. They do not distinguish between the costs of growing wood and costs relating to other functions, such as tourism, welfare, fire control, et cetera, which the services perform. Thus it has not been possible for us to compare the relative costs and efficiency of public and private forest management. The Committee is satisfied, however, that insufficient recognition has been given to the role of private forest development, and accordingly we have recommended that decisions about future public funding of plantation development should recognise the advantages of the integration of forestry with wood processing by providing processing companies with financial incentives to establish and operate plantations. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, the wood processing industries have depended largely upon the native hardwood forests for their raw material. In future, however, the industries will depend increasingly upon softwood plantations for their raw material base. As softwood processing lends itself to the establishment of large integrated processing plants, many of the existing small hardwood mills have a limited future. Together with technological advances and changing cost structures, the forest products industries, and particularly the sawmilling industry, face a further period of considerable structural adjustment. The Committee has recognised that this adjustment process has serious implications for many small rural communities which depend upon hardwood sawmilling as a major source of employment. However, we are of the opinion that restructuring of the industry is essential, and inevitable, if it is to compete successfully against non-wood products and imports. It is evident that this restructuring is presently occurring. We also believe that if the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission regarding the level of tariffs on the import of panelboards and mouldings were to be accepted at this stage then a number of additional firms in those industries would be forced unnecessarily into insolvency. We have recommended that any decision to reduce tariffs on these products should be deferred for five years to allow these industries to operate efficiently and profitably during the restructuring process. </PARA>
<PARA> The final section of the report deals with specific Commonwealth responsibilities in the area of forestry and forest products. Among other things, the Committee found that there are certain anomalies in the Income Tax Assessment Act which actually discourage the proper management of forests on privately-owned land. It would appear that while the Commonwealth has invested considerable sums in the development of plantations, the tax Act penalises landholders who manage their forests to provide timber on a continuing basis. Yet, if the landholder completely clears the forests from the land, no such tax penalty is incurred. The Committee has recommended that this and similar anomalies-such as that applying to depreciation of forestry equipment-should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that 1982 is to be the International Year of the Tree. I think I speak for the entire Committee when I say that it would be our earnest hope that the world's attention should be focused on the total value of the forests, that is, their value for wood production, water catchment, recreation, scientific study and education, as a wildlife habitat, the production of honey and essential oils, for their aesthetic values, and the list goes on. Australia can be proud of its recent achievements in forestry. Within the next 20 years we will be self-sufficient in timber products, and this from a perpetually renewable resource. Yet at the same time massive areas of the forests will be excluded from timber production in recognition of the many other values of the forest estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I pay tribute to the former Chairman of the Committee, Glen Sheil, and to the members of the staff. Especially I must record the tremendous contribution of our Secretary, Robert Alison, whose maturity, dedication and ability were of invaluable assistance throughout the entire project. It has not been an easy task. We have assessed masses of information and to the best of my ability I believe the facts, as presented, to be accurate. There are areas where the findings clearly indicate that action is absolutely necessary. Other reports have made some of the same comments. It is of concern to the Committee that some of the identifiable difficulties that the industries now face can be attributed to lack of the attention that those matters should already have received. It is the hope of those associated with the production and presentation of this report that our findings may benefit everyone involved in the many aspects of the forestry and forest products industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Resources I want to add my words to the Chairman's report on the Committee's inquiry into the forestry and forest products industries. I believe it was unfortunate that at a vital stage of the Committee's work two of the original members of the Committee were discharged. This made the work of the two senators who replaced them even more difficult because the new members then had to catch up on what the Committee had already found out since the beginning of the inquiry and to try to make themselves conversant with the matters that were before them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two recommendations that I particularly want to draw to the attention of the Senate. One is recommendation 54 in which the Committee recommends that each State forestry service publishes, at regular intervals, a forest management plan. It recommends that the plan should be formulated with the benefit of full public comments on its intentions; that it should describe the detailed management regime to be adopted for each and every area of forest under the service's control; that it should be explicit in its requirements so that those responsible for its implementation are in no doubt as to their responsibilities; and that it be binding for a specific period. Perhaps we could hope that implicit in that recommendation would be the ability of the State forest services to recognise that where public comment and opinions are such that it is considered environmentally or otherwise damaging for such a project to go ahead they would forgo a specific project. The other area of importance is that related to rain forests. In recommendations 57 and 58 the Committee has recommended that specific minimum standards apply to these valuable areas. One would hope once again that State forest services will implement those minimum standards, recognise that we have a valuable area to protect and do their utmost to ensure that these areas will remain for future generations. Two areas of major concern, I believe, to the Committee were the number of reports, which the Chairman of the Committee has already mentioned, which have already applied to the forestry industry-one could almost describe it as a glut situation-and the number of advisory bodies which provide information and advice to the Commonwealth Government. The recommendation in paragraph 97 calls on both the industry and interest groups to rationalise this area of advisory bodies. We recognise that it is difficult where there is a State operation, a Commonwealth government operation plus public interest operations, and we hope we will not see a plethora of these associations or organisations all offering advice and sometimes offering the same advice to the same types of committees that are being set up to investigate the industries. But I think it is important that the industry and those interest groups get together and rationalise the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also looked at the application of both tariffs and taxation to the industry and recognised the problems that exist, particularly the taxation problems. We have recommended that the Government initiate within six months an examination of all aspects of taxation as they apply to the industry. The Senate, as you, Mr Deputy President, will be aware, has seen occasions when the Government has been dilatory in responding to committee reports. I hope that this report will not be one of those occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I wish to raise is the one that was brought to the Committee's attention by the Australian Council of Furniture Manufacturers which related particularly to the availability of hardwood for furniture manufacture. Let me just make the point that with all the advice and information we have had and still have available to us there is no way we can truly estimate the irreparable damage that has already been done and is perhaps still being done to our hardwood forests particularly with such diseases as dieback which has hit the Western Australian jarrah forests so badly and now I understand is attacking the tuart forests in the south-west of the State. I think it is imperative that the Government should now look at what is happening and establish whether in fact it wants to leave hardwood forests for future generations. I do not believe that we can ask industry to establish trial plantations, but evidence was given by the Australian Council of Furniture Manufacturers that at the moment the majority of hardwood that is being used for our furniture and buildings such as the Canadian redwood, is being imported. Of course, this timber attracts a tariff and makes it extremely expensive for the ultimate consumer. As there would be no return-I think the shortest time in which a hardwood industry could be established would be a period of some 20 years; the best possible average growth would be achieved somewhere between 50 and 70 years-I do not believe we should expect industry to undertake such initiatives as investigating whether we have the capacity to grow these plantations or whether they are a viable concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Being a parochial Western Australian, I make the point that we in that State have a large area in which large tracts of land are available-I refer to the Ord River area-with ample supplies of water easily accessible to them. There are, of course, a wide variety of hardwoods which could be the subject of some research. I am thinking of woods such as teak, ebony, cedar, jarrah, karri, wandoo, marri and tuart which at this moment do not appear to be attracting very much interest by way of research. Such an initiative would provide not only vast areas of viable forests but also large areas with tourist and recreational potential. The Chairman has already expressed the concern of the Committee that many of the existing small hardwood mills have a limited future. Perhaps this is one way in which the Government could undertake its activities during 1982, the Year of the Tree. The Chairman has touched on his concern that many valuable and well-founded recommendations of the previous inquiries have not been taken up. I sincerely hope that this matter will receive a fairly prompt response by the Government and that the recommendations that have been so carefully undertaken and the conclusions that the Committee has come to will be acceptable to the Government and will be put into operation at the earliest possible opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this report is to canvass the concept of 'threat' within the Australian context. The report is intended as a forerunner to further reports covering particular aspects of the terms of reference given to the Sub-committee on Defence Matters on 26 February 1980, which are 'to monitor the implementation of the Australian Government's announced defence programs'. The report also seeks to provide a framework for public discussion of the subsequent issues. It is the Committee's view that no analysis of the defence program can proceed without thorough understanding of the types of threats and contingencies which may be faced by the Australian defence forces. It is the Committee's hope that a frank discussion of such matters will dispel unnecessary fears, lead to an informed appreciation of Australia's regional relationships, and improve the climate of understanding between Australia and its neighbours. Moreover, it is hoped that this report brings into the public arena a more sophisticated and mature debate on Australia's security. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has considered threats to Australia under four headings: Firstly, potential for global conflict and its implications for Australia; secondly, invasion of Australia; thirdly, intermediate level threats to Australia's interests; and, fourthly, low level contingencies. With regard to each category of threat, the report discusses the level of capability needed to pose the type of threat, which nation might have the motive, the likely warning time involved, possible deterrents and matters that require further study. While the report devotes substantial space to the issues concerning global conflict because of the importance of this subject, I draw the attention of honourable senators to the importance for defence planning of the issues canvassed in chapters 3 and 4. These deal with intermediate level threats and low level contingencies which might require an Australian response independent of the actions of our allies, and have serious implications for the structure and capacity of our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that Australia would be a difficult invasion target. Australia is separated by oceanic distances from other countries. It has, even now, a considerable capacity to deter potential aggressors and its alliance with the United States of America involves the threat of retaliation against a major aggressor. In the world today, only a power with the immense military and economic resources of the United States would have the physical capacity to launch a full scale invasion of Australia, which is to say that Australia at present need not fear a mass invasion from any country. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Soviet Union, even if it were in a position to contemplate an invasion of Australia, it currently lacks the appropriate equipment in the form of large attack aircraft carriers and large scale amphibious forces. The Soviet Union would also require South East Asian staging bases, which it currently does not have, to mount an invasion of Australia. It is difficult to envisage any conditions outside general world war which would lead the Soviet Union to contemplate an invasion of Australia. The Committee believes that an assault on Australia would involve a very difficult military operation, as chapter 2 of the report explains in detail. Even for an economically advanced regional power it could be expected to take at least five years to develop a capability. Other regional powers would require at least 10 years. Nevertheless, the Australian Defence Force needs to continue to sustain a technological level relevant to those of regional powers to include those long lead time capabilities which act as a deterrent to hostile action. Australia also needs to maintain the skills relevant to operations in the region and to have the capability for timely expansion of its forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee believes that there is no discernible threat of invasion of Australia on which force structure can be based, there is a danger that the emergence of such a threat may take less time than is likely to be required to obtain long lead items of important equipment and increased trained manpower. There is, therefore, a heavy responsibility on our intelligence agencies and on those responsible for planning for a smooth expansion of Australia's Defence Force. A nation that spends relatively little of its gross national product on defence requires a relatively large and competent intelligence effort to keep Australia informed of developments in our region that could emerge as a threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, the Sub-committee on Defence Matters received significant evidence on the need to have appropriately trained intelligence analysts. In the south-west Pacific, for example, the political transition of small states has been peaceful and smooth, with the exception of Vanuatu. However, the situation in New Caledonia is also of concern to the Committee. Here there is growing movement for independence among the indigenous Melanesian population. The Committee is hopeful that following the election of the Government of Francois Mitterrand a peaceful solution can be found to the grievances of these groups. Particularly encouraging was the visit by the Secretary of State for Overseas Departments and Territories, Mr Emmanuelli, to New Caledonia, where he spoke of the need to re-examine French attitudes towards the Melanesian development which included economic and culture aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also discusses elements current in the world situation that contribute to an uncertain global strategic outlook. A potential threat to Australia's security at present lies in a global context, rather than in our own regional situation-in the possibility of world-wide conflict or disruption of the strategic balance between super-powers. The deterioration in the global relationship between the super-powers, or possible conflicts in our region-which might attract the support of one or both of the super-powers-could affect adversely Australia's strategic prospects. It is difficult to envisage a serious strategic threat to Australia which would be unrelated to a major breakdown of the existing world order. Regrettably, the Committee believes that there is likely to be continuing and perhaps increased tension and competition between the super-powers, particularly in regions where there is instability or confrontation. Yet, on all rational calculations, nuclear war between the super-powers should be regarded as an unlikely eventuality because of the immense devastation which would result from such a conflict which would wipe out any conceivable benefits to the warring states. </PARA>
<PARA> In a nuclear war between the northern hemisphere powers, even if Australia were not directly targeted, we would be disastrously affected. One of the consequences of such a war would be a complete breakdown in international trade, which would have catastrophic consequences for Australia's economy. Even if Australia were not seriously affected directly by radioactive fallout from the northern hemisphere, there would be ecological consequences for the whole world which would also affect Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report discusses the joint Australian-United States facilities at Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape. It points out that there is a possibility that these installations could become targets in a nuclear war. It also points out that attacks on these installations would not affect major population centres. The presence of these installations may be justified in terms of their contribution to the central balance between the super-powers. It could also be seen to confer additional advantages on Australia in its alliance with the United States. On this issue, as in the case of other threats, the Committee flags the parameters of issues that should be addressed in public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the risks associated with nuclear attack on Australia have to be weighed against the value of those installations in ensuring a stable central balance, the verification of arms control agreements between the super-powers and the alliance's deterrent value against hostile actions against Australia which are beyond our capacity to resist. Our role as host obliges us to argue strongly in international forums for effective arms control agreements. Australia is more likely to suffer from low level contingency-type threats than from the threat of outright invasion or from what the Committee has called intermediate level threats. Low level threats could arise at short notice and pose challenging problems. If such a situation were to arise Australia would almost certainly be required to meet such threats from its own resources, with little or no allied support. This calls for continuing emphasis on self-reliance and on the possession of well-balanced defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of whether significant threats to Australia develop, the Defence Force must be capable of undertaking current tasks. They include contributing to coastal and maritime surveillance. In the course of its inquiries, the Sub-committee on Defence Matters devoted considerable time and attention to this question. Evidence was taken in many parts of northern and western Australia. Support for the law enforcement agencies against terrorism is an important current task for the Defence Force. The Australian Defence Force should also have the capability to contribute to United Nations and other international peacekeeping forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The report stresses that the relative absence of short and medium term threats arises not only from Australia's fortunate geographical location, but also from the success, so far, of the war prevention strategy of the Western alliance, and from the comparative strength of Australia's own defence forces within our own region. Indeed, the primary aim of a defence strategy is to prevent war and not to fight it. Reassurance as to Australia's security is available only so long as the perilous balance between the super-powers is maintained or their armaments are dismantled and also so long as we continue to play our part in contributing to the Western alliance and in improving our self-reliance within the region. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of all the members of the Sub-committee and the Joint Committee, I wish to thank Mr Claus Ducker, Mr Robert King and all the staff who worked under great difficulties to finalise this report and whose enthusiasm and dedication was essential to producing it. I commend the Committee's report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although this report has had a great deal of public attention in the last few days, I believe the opportunity should not be missed to discuss some further very important implications of it. I will do that briefly at this stage. The aspects of the report that have rightly received major attention in the media and the public are those concerning the risks to Australia of nuclear attack directed at the United States bases at Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape. I am not at this stage proposing to open up the immense subject of the presence of the bases in Australia, which is not really relevant to this matter. What concerns me are the likely consequences of a nuclear attack, now that there has been a clear statement that we are at risk in that direction. I would also like to know what the Government is prepared to do about it in rather more detail than we have had from the Government in the past. I will add a word or two on that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a number of occasions over the last two years in the Senate I have raised the need for specific civil defence mechanisms in Australia which have a relationship to our peculiar geographic need. I have especially drawn attention to the fact that Australia's position in the event of nuclear war would be very different to that of more closely settled regions, particularly the nations of Europe. The basic point that our cities are widely dispersed and sprawl over huge areas for their population size means that the likeliest form of nuclear attack, which would be single missiles presumably launched from submarines, would destroy with great certainty several square miles of the city centres and kill everybody within but leave the areas in which most of the population live subject mainly to the risk of their inhabitants suffering radiation sickness due to fallout. This would vary with individual places depending on wind speed and wind direction at the time. I was interested to note that in Friday's Australian there was an article on a report prepared by the Director of Defence Studies at the Western Australian Institute of Technology, Dr Geoffrey Williams, a former consultant to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia lags markedly behind most other Western nations in its civil-defence preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA> He says it is essential for the nation to overcome the 'Myth' that nuclear war would mean the end of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Williams uses Perth as an example of what would happen to an Australian city hit by a nuclear bomb. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Even if we take the worst case nuclear scenario for Perth, a one-megatonne ground burst with 50 per cent fission component delivered on the Perth Concert Hall at midday on a working day, the survivors would still exceed the dead and injured by a considerable margin,' . . . 'The immediate death toll out of a population of 902,000 would be 57,999, with 122,750 injured and over 154,693 temporarily affected by radioactive fallout. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Yet 576,378 would survive. </PARA>
<PARA>I will repeat those figures: More than half a million people would survive opposed to an immediate death toll of 57,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It is clear that with rudimentary civil-defence measures, those killed and injured could be drastically reduced by perhaps as much as 80 per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Williams says Australia must include civil defence as part of a single defence posture because it is now a major factor in nuclear deterrents. </PARA>
<PARA>I have made the point in this place several times that a nation which is known to be unprepared offers itself as and begs to be a target because it is a place where the utmost destruction and damage can be inflicted. The country sort of chooses itself in that way. At this point I mention that I take strong exception to the very odd answer that Senator Durack gave earlier in answer to a question from Senator Kilgariff on the Government's likely response to nuclear attack. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said the civil disaster organisations-by which he meant, I take it, organisations which deal with bushfires, floods and the like-would be able to handle a nuclear attack because the circumstances would be similar. With respect to the Attorney-I know his answer was written by some public servant somewhere-that is complete and dangerous rubbish. Nuclear attack would require very different responses, and highly specialised ones. It would require rapid mass evacuation from the suburbs of large cities and complete mechanisms on computer able to carry that out quickly. It would require the decontamination of individuals and property on a huge scale. It would require major and specialised medical measures such as the availability of blood for transfusion in enormous amounts to persons affected with radiation sickness. That is the front line of defence for those people. They must be decontaminated and their symptoms can be overcome only by giving them blood transfusions. </PARA>
<PARA> As it happens I have not been in consultation with Dr Williams but honourable senators who care to check Hansard or who have heard me speak on the subject before will see that his comments are in very fair agreement with my own and, indeed, in complete disagreement with the Government's view which has been expressed many times. It says that we must throw our hands up and that if there is a nuclear war we can do nothing because we are all doomed anyway. Of course, this is what Dr Williams meant by referring to the myth when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is essential for the nation to overcome the 'myth' that nuclear war would mean the end of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>Other countries do not take this point of view. Many other countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Russia and Switzerland have hard-headed governments which have taken the view that it is very much worth while spending tens, and hundreds, of millions of dollars protecting their people in the best way they can. I suggest we must do that too. Many other organisations and individuals that also agree have been in touch with me. Now it is plain that the threat to Australia is real. I plead with the Government to pay some attention now to this matter, which so closely and so basically involves the lives and welfare of millions of Australians, which could involve us all at any time and for which we must be prepared. It is no good saying that we will take steps once the attack is launched or when it is imminent. Then it is far too late to take the kinds of measures that I have suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the new Parliament House building in Queensland has an efficient nuclear shelter which will house members of the Queensland Cabinet. As Ministers here will know, I am not one of those who normally give notice of questions they propose to ask in the Senate, but I hereby give notice to Senator Messner, who represents the Minister for Housing and Construction, that tomorrow or the next day-whenever I can get the call-I will ask him just what is the situation with the new and permanent Parliament House being built here. If it is going to make provisions for elaborate civil defence measures, basements and the like for the Cabinet members and other high ranking individuals in this country, I will want to know and the Australian people will want to know why the Government takes it upon itself to put itself in safety while it leaves the rest of society at risk. I give notice that I will ask that question before this session is finished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When these appropriations were last before the Committee Senator Chaney responded to my inquiry about the permanent head of the Department of Primary Industry conducting a dry run for the Senate Estimates Committee which included all the first assistant secretaries. Since that action was unprecedented I concluded, not unreasonably, that the purpose of the dry run was to ensure that the FAS's all got their lines right for any embarrassing questions that might be asked, especially embarrassing questions pertaining to the Australian Dairy Corporation scandal. I was told by Senator Chaney, by way of explanation, that Mr Duthie was a new permanent head and that that was the reason for this unprecedented action having been taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since then I have checked to see just when Mr Duthie became the permanent head of the DPI. It was in fact 20 April 1980. At the least, the Estimates committee hearing held last month was the third since Mr Duthie had become head of the DPI. I suggest that he could not reasonably be regarded as a new permanent head under those circumstances. The conclusion that I fear I must draw from that is that it is unwise to believe anything that Ministers in this Government say unless it is independently corroborated. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I wish to raise concerning the Department of Primary Industry relates to two questions on notice asked by me, the first of which was answered on 24 February. The question sought details of consultants being retained by various statutory corporations. The answer to that question was that Geoff and Mary Wilson were retained as consultants by the Australian Dairy Corporation. When the matter was raised in the Estimates committee I was told that Geoff and Mary Wilson had worked for the Dairy Corporation for a short period in 1980 but were not employed in any capacity by the Corporation in 1981 and, therefore, were not employed in any capacity by the Corporation on 24 February 1981 when the answer to my question on notice was given. That prompted a further question on notice, the answer to which appears in the Senate Hansard of 12 November at page 2179, in which I sought an explanation of the apparent contradiction between the answer to the earlier question on notice, which said that Geoff and Mary Wilson were retained by the Corporation, and the subsequent Estimates committee answer that they were not retained by the Corporation at the time that question was answered. In the answer which appears in the Hansard of 12 November the phrases 'apparent conflict' and 'broadest possible interpretation' are used to explain the discrepancy. Since then I have received a letter from Mr Wilson in which he complains-in my view, justifiably-about the inaccuracies of the earlier answer from the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), and explains:</PARA>
<PARA> The answer given on 12 November by the Minister appears to be accurate in everything except the description of Mary and me as public relations consultants. We regard this as a slur and I would be most grateful if you could use your good offices to remove this slur. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to explain that he was asked by the marketing director of the ADC, given that the ADC had no Press liaison officer, to do particular work. The work was to be writing up news and features from material supplied by the Corporation. I do not want to read out the entire letter, but I think it is quite reasonable for Mr Wilson to request that this matter be put straight. I think he has some grounds to complain. Certainly he has grounds to complain for having been inaccurately described on 24 February as being employed by the Corporation in any capacity whatsoever. From what purport to be the facts available to me now, he was at no stage employed on the basis of a retainership or as some sort of permanent consultant. He was employed by the Corporation just for a short period to do a particular job. I think he has some justification for complaining about that. I am complying with his request to set the record straight. </PARA>
<PARA> The last observation I want to make on the matter is that this is apparently typical of the Department of Primary Industry and of the sort of slothful administration in this National Country Party bailiwick which has been evident for a number of years. Very much more serious matters have happened in that Department. In closing I say that the excuse presented by Senator Chaney last week for the unprecedented dry run of the Senate Estimates Committee which was conducted the day before the first sitting of Estimates Committee H is certainly not satisfactory because Mr Duthie could not by any reasonable stretch of the imagination be regarded as a new permanent secretary as his officers appeared before the fourth Estimates committee hearing to be held since he in fact took over that office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 October this year I wrote to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) on behalf of the St Vincent's Gulf Prawn Boatowners' Association regarding the matter of the management of the Investigator Strait and St Vincent's Gulf fisheries. On behalf of the Association I put to the Minister a number of questions about which that Association was concerned. I asked whether the Commonwealth Government was giving consideration to closing off know areas of small prawns on the eastern side of Investigator Strait; what stage the State deliberations, which were involved, had reached; whether, when the Commonwealth Government handed over the Investigator Strait fisheries to the State Government of South Australia, it attached conditions regarding Commonwealth boats from that fishery being allowed in the main State fishery; whether Commonwealth licensed boats fishing in State fisheries would have to pay the difference in licence fees to the State Government-something in the vicinity of $1,480; and whether owners of licences to fish Investigator Strait would be entitled to compensation in the event of a decision being made to ban or severely restrict operations in the Strait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 20 October I received a short letter from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister stating that the matter was being examined and that a reply would be sent directly. The October edition of the Professional Fisherman carried an article from the president of the Western Waters Prawn Boat Owners Association, Mr Mike Puglisi, who I understand resides in Port Lincoln, an area which is also very much concerned with fishing and prawn fishing in particular. In a statement to the Professional Fisherman Mr Puglisi enlarged on a theme that limited entry with strict management controls was the only effective way to protect and harvest a resource such as our prawn industry. He is reported in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, the method attracts a lot of criticism, but one must bear in mind at all times, it is the resource that must be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> It is elementary, when you have a reliable and profitable fishery, and profits it generates are shared throughout the community via taxes, boat maintenance, equipment purchases and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Puglisi went on to give examples of problems stemming from lack of management of what he defined as 'the top end'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Gulf of Carpentaria should have been managed from the commencement of prawn trawling there. He also referred to the recent problems in South Australia's Investigator Strait, for which prawn licences were issued by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Puglisi is reported in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> In this case, there was no management, boats were thrown in to the fishery and the guts ripped out of it. Now it has collapsed the Commonwealth wants the boats it licensed transferred to South Australian managed fisheries. No way!</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has to have an urgent look at its licencing system, as the problems it is causing in the industry are becoming very serious. </PARA>
<PARA>A week ago I received another letter, from the St Vincent Gulf Prawn Boat Owners Association. I had sent it a copy of the reply from the Minister's secretary. The Association wrote that, being aware that the South Australian branch of the Australian fishing industry had been pursuing the same line of questioning for over a year now, it believed the Minister was stalling. It added:</PARA>
<PARA> It would also appear that the Minister is either extremely neglectful or does not appreciate the seriousness of this matter. A valuable State resource, one that with care and good management would show infinite benefits is already part way to destruction. Every day that corrective action is delayed it becomes more difficult to rectify the situation, in fact it may be possibly already too late. The matter has dragged on for five long years and it really is a disgraceful affair. </PARA>
<PARA> The prawn season commenced October 20th and already prawn vessels are tied up because they are unable to cover fishing costs in what should be a lucrative fishery. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of urgency and I urge you to pursue it. Therefore, I am asking as a matter of urgency whether I can have some answers to the questions that I raised with the Minister over a month ago, which these associations have been raising with him for a large number of years, which are causing grave economic problems around both the Investigator Strait and Port Lincoln areas and which are quite clearly contributing to both unemployment and the demise of a very valuable South Australian industry. </PARA>

<PARA>CANNED FRUIT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of debate on 19 November 1981 Senators Walsh and McLaren commented on the financial difficulties facing deciduous canning fruit growers and processors. Senator McLaren referred to the particular problems of the Riverland region of South Australia. Senator Walsh implied that a Government decision in respect of assistance to the beef industry in 1977 and a current proposal to introduce an underwriting scheme for sultanas were evidence that an IAC inquiry was not a prerequisite to Government assistance to the canned fruit industry. I would like to clarify the position for honourable Senators, although I am somewhat surprised at the apparent suggestion opposite that advice should not be sought as to the form of assistance likely to be most effective in dealing with the difficulties confronting the canned fruit industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973 allow for financial assistance to be provided to an industry for up to a period of two years without a mandatory IACS report provided that the period or sum of the periods of any previous financial assistance since commencment of the IAC Act has not exceeded two years duration. As such, it was possible to extend short term assistance to beef producers in 1977 through the animal husbandry incentive scheme in the absence of a prior IAC report. The canned fruit industry has received assistance through the Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Scheme which operated from 1972 to 1977 and special carry-on loans provided to canneries in 1976. These measures have precluded the provision of any further assistance without an IAC inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Senator Walsh's analogy with dried fruit underwriting, I point out, by way of clarification, that in 1977 the Government rejected a central finding of the IAC that the dried vine fruit stabilisation scheme be phased out over three years. It decided that the stabilisation scheme should be extended for the three seasons 1978 to 1980 and that at the end of the second season the scheme be reviewed with a view to determining long-term action. That review resulted in the proposal to introduce an underwriting arrangement for sultanas, the details of which were set out in the Minister's Second Reading Speech in the other place on 29 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that it is clear that there is nothing unique about the Government's decision to seek a report from the IAC before addressing the question of assistance needs of the canned fruit industry. The fact that there may be hardships for particular people or regions which warrant urgent consideration has been recognised by the Government and, accordingly, the IAC has been asked to provide an interim report by 31 March 1982 on the nature and extent of any short term assistance considered appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach on this matter is a responsible one and is entirely consistent with its continuing emphasis on sound management of Government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA>DEREGISTRATION OF STEIGER'S EST. 775</PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> During estimates hearings on 19 November 1981, Senator Primmer expressed confusion over certain aspects of the deregistration for export of the independent meat establishment located at Northcote, Victoria, and operated by Steiger's Meat Supply (Australia) Pty Ltd. This confusion arose because:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Bureau of Animal Health meat inspection staff located at 775 have not found any evidence of out-of-hours activity, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a press report quoted a Director of Steigers as saying the horsemeat was found in cartons sampled in an establishment neither owned by nor under the control of Steigers. </PARA>
<PARA>SUGGESTED RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA> The export registration of Steiger's premises at 82 Bastings Street, Northcote was cancelled on 23 September 1981 by the secretary of the Department of Primary Industry. This cancellation followed the finding of horsemeat in cartons of beef mince in a cold store at Brooklyn operated by Klari Meat Export Pty Ltd. The mince concerned was packed in sealed plastic tubes, which in turn were packed in cardboard cartons. The plastic tubes and cartons were labelled and marked to show their origin as being establishment 775, Steiger's Bastings Street premises. Accompanying documentation showed that the consignment had been transferred from establishment 775 to the cold store at which sampling took place. All the samples taken were positive for horsemeat. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never been suggested by the Bureau of Animal Health that horse carcases or quarters have been boned at the Bastings Street premises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only notes on the third matter. On 19 November Senator McLaren raised a series of questions about money being recovered by the Australian Government from the sale of confiscated Taiwanese fishing vessels and whether the Government would consider tightening the fisheries laws to make the penalties much higher and deter foreign fishermen from depriving Australian fishermen of their living. I pointed out at that time that in the example given by Senator McLaren the inability of the fishermen to pay the fine meant simply that there was a larger burden on the taxpayer because of the pending imprisonment of the fishermen and that the imposition of an even higher fine would simply increase the loss to revenue. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has given me some more information on these matters. I advise the Committee that-as I am sure it will be aware-the decision whether to order the forfeiture of foreign boats involved in breaches of Australian fisheries laws rests with the courts. The Department of Primary Industry has implemented procedures to give effect to the recommendations in paragraph 2.44 of the 187th Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts concerning the disposal of forfeited boats, to establish a criterion based on anticipated net realisable value. If the cost of a forfeited boat's disposal exceeds the anticipated sale price, it should be disposed of promptly by destruction. The sense behind that is fairly evident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For Senator McLaren's information, the sale of forfeited boats back to former owners ceased at the Minister's direction in October 1976. The Department is currently examining the question of sale of forfeited catches back to former owners but that can occur only when the court has not ordered forfeiture of the boat. By leaving the catch in the boat the Commonwealth saves the cost of unloading and storing ashore. The former owner would be entitled to make a bid in competition with any interested Australian buyers. Consideration of the former owner's bid would take account of unloading and other costs. It has always been open to former owners to tender for the repurchase of forfeit boats. If their bid were satisfactory it may be successful in accordance with normal tendering practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry some time ago reviewed the penalties which Senator McLaren raised in Committee. The monetary levels are considered satisfactory. The maximum fine in summary jurisdiction is $5,000 and the maximum fine on indictment is $250,000. These are among the world's highest for the offence of unlicensed use of a fishing boat in exclusive fishing zones. In addition to that monetary penalty, the courts at their discretion may also order forfeiture of boat, catch, fishing gear and so on. The Department of Primary Industry is currently reviewing the policy with regard to forfeitures to determine whether a different basis for forfeiture is appropriate as between licensed and unlicensed foreign boats. This review is part of a more general review of the fisheries laws currently in progress. Under the agreement with Taiwanese commercial interests, the Tiawanese are to meet Commonwealth or State government costs following apprehension and conviction of licensed or unlicensed vessels. The Taiwanese have complied with this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the penalties imposed under Australian fishery laws, the Taiwanese have, under the agreement, imposed their own controls which are designed to eliminate illegal Taiwanese fishing activities in Australian waters. These controls involve the suspension or cancellation of licences, fines, and even imprisonment and have resulted in a sharp downturn in illegal activity. There is no instance in which foreign fishermen are fishing out many of the areas on which Australian fishermen depend. The recently concluded tuna long-line fishing agreement with Japan excludes that country's boats from a wider area of the Australian fishing zone than ever before so as to further reduce competition with Australian tuna vessels. The Taiwanese are the only people trawling on the North West Shelf and gillnetting in northern waters. If Australians gear up to enter either of those fisheries they will be given preference and Taiwanese activities will be reduced accordingly. The existing regulatory and enforcement measures are designed to protect the living resources of the Australian fishing zone and continental shelf consistent with the effective and economical allocation of assets to implement those measures.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Senator Walsh raised again the question of the 'dry run', as he described it, of the Department's appearance before the Estimates Committee. I repeat what I said in the Senate on 19 November: I do not see anything vaguely wrong with officers preparing themselves for what can be quite intensive and rigorous questioning. If one looks at the record of the questioning of the Estimates Committee this year one will find that for a number of departments senators chose to ask questions in extremely harsh terms and in great detail on a variety of subjects. I think that any prudent department would come to the Estimates Committee hearings equipped, as best possible, to deal with the questions which are to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry if in any sense I misled Senator Walsh or the Senate when I advised that there was a new Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry. Senator Walsh has drawn my attention to the fact that the Secretary took office in the first half of 1980. I agree that the inference from what I said would be that he was perhaps newer than that and hence had not had experience of Estimates committees with respect to this Department. My advice is that the Secretary to the Department had not previously attended the Senate Estimates committees in 1980 or for the Additional Estimates in 1981. The point I made was in that context and on the basis of advice that he was new. It now appears that he was new in the sense that I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, it is possible to see a problem, a conspiracy, something wrong in almost any act if one is so minded. It is not unusual for there to be preparation for Question Time, in the case of some Ministers. It is not unusual, I think, for departments to prepare for the Estimates committees, where they publicly appear before the Parliament to answer whatever questions are put to them by members of this Parliament. </PARA>

The Department and its present and previous Ministers were under the hammer because of scandals which had previously been disclosed. In short, this was a department with something to hide. It still is a department with something to hide. Although the Department has escaped full exposure so far that may not last forever.

I notice that the shadow Attorney-General is in the chamber. I would have thought that he would be able to inform his colleague on the front bench that, in any situation where people have to rely on oral evidence and put quite detailed evidence before any body-be it the Parliament or a court-there would be nothing unusual in examining the evidence and checking to see that departmental officers have all available and required information at their fingertips before they appear.</PARA></TALK.START>

On 12 October, as reported at pages 662 and 663 of Estimates Committee H Hansard, questions were asked concerning the Australian Trade Commissioner Service; in particular, what policies were adopted by Australian trade commissioners towards corruption and bribery in foreign countries. A statement was cited from the Trade Commissioner in Jakarta who had been reported on the Australian Broadcasting Commission News as saying: 'Australian businessmen will have to accept graft and corruption as a fact of life in dealing with Indonesia'. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, who was present at the Committee hearing, undertook to ascertain the policy from Mr Anthony.

For example, he explained that to say no one does not actually say 'no'; for purposes of politeness one says 'yes, but . . .' and then explains the situation. He gave a fairly lengthy and very careful address. It is unfortunate that the Press extracts, taken out of context, have given an impression which was not the impression meant to be given by the Trade Commissioner in the address he gave.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am at a disadvantage in that I have not had time to read the letter properly. The question as it was raised originally did not just concern Mr Allegrove's statement, whether it was reported accurately or otherwise by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It went beyond that; it went to the guidelines which the Department of Trade and Resources has towards this sensitive question in foreign countries. I am not sure whether that letter goes into that matter. I may get a chance later to look at it with more care. In the meantime I will pursue a couple of other issues. Firstly, I observe in passing that the hearing of Estimates Committee H revealed that throughout 1980, despite the continuous propaganda campaign being waged against the Soviet Union by the Australian Government and the alleged existence of what some people call trade embargoes but what would more accurately be described as meaningless limits put on the volume of trade which would be permitted in certain Russian products, the staffing level of the Australian Trade Commissioner Service in Moscow was maintained at full strength. This does seem to be rather extraordinary for a government that claimed to be imposing some sort of trade sanctions or trade restrictions against the Soviet Union. The other question I want to take up concerns breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I want to take up concerns breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and misleading information given by the Department of Trade and Resources to Estimates Committee H on 12 October. I will not go into all the background of this question but the issues I want to take up now are not specifically related to the broader issue which was under discussion at Estimates Committee H. But it is a fact that in March of this year arrangements were made under which, in exchange for a purchase of an Australian commodity, rebates on import duty were granted to particular firms. The commodity purchased by the firms that were granted the rebate on import duty was subsequently exported which, by any reasonable definition of course, is an export subsidy. That was introduced in March of this year, and those facts are not in dispute. I asked a First Assistant Secretary of the Department, Mr Webb, whether our trading partners had been formally notified of the operation of the scheme, and in reply he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no obligation to notify them formally, to the best of my recollection. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as the response from the Department of Trade is concerned, that remains the case. The Department of Trade sticks by that answer. I shall quote article XVI of GATT, the first paragraph of which states:</PARA>
<PARA> If any contracting party grants or maintains any subsidy, including any form of income or price support, which operates directly or indirectly-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the critical line-</PARA>
<PARA>to increase exports of any product from, or to reduce imports of any products into, its territory, it shall notify the Contracting Parties in writing of the extent and nature of the subsidization . . . </PARA>
<PARA>An inducement was offered to a number of firms to buy an Australian product. The inducement was a remission of duty which would otherwise be payable on their imports. The product was subsequently exported. Those facts are not in dispute. A First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Trade said there was no obligation to notify other signatories to GATT, formally or informally, to the best of his recollection, of those arrangements. The Department of Trade still stands by that answer. I repeat what is stated in Article XVI:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any form of income or price support, which operates directly or indirectly to increase exports of any product from . . . it-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the contracting country; in this case, Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>shall notify the Contracting Parties in writing of the extent and nature of that subsidization . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That presumably was not done. That is one thing; to have attempted to mislead the Committtee in the way the Committee was misled is another and, from the point of view of this Parliament, an even more serious case. Certainly that product would not have been exported from Australia had the arrangements which were concluded in March not been made. This whole exercise was organised by Mr Anthony, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources, the fellow who pre-empts all Cabinet decisions on any subject on which he chooses to pre-empt Cabinet decisions. Most recently, he has been running around the country pre-empting Cabinet decisions on the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. Our trading partners were not notified of this arrangement, under which an indirect subsidy was paid to increase the export of an Australian product, in clear breach of Article XVI of GATT. The offence was then compounded by misleading advice given to the Senate by First Assistant Secretary Webb. He was obviously very uneasy while he was giving the advice. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a secondary matter on the same subject in which the Department came clean. I asked whether any complaint had been received from any of our trading partners about this arrangement. As recorded at page 657 of the Hansard Estimates report of 12 October, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Has the United States made any complaint or any formal protest about the arrangements for the rebate that was introduced at the beginning of this year?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Webb replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Off the top of my head I cannot remember. I cannot answer that categorically. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to ask whether the information would be available and whether it would be supplied and the answer was yes. That information subsequently was supplied. A letter dated 14 October received by the Committee from the Department of Trade and Resources stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department advises that representations were received from the United States after announcement of the concession . . . In response, Australia advised the United States that its assertions were formulated with insufficient detail to permit a specific response. </PARA>
<PARA>On that issue one could say that certainly the relevant First Assistant Secretary should have known of such a complaint. However, further accurate information was supplied to the Committee subsequently within a reasonable time. That is not the case with the arrangement itself and our clear obligations under Article XVI of GATT and the equally clear obligation of officers to tell the truth to Senate Estimates commitees. If they find that they made a mistake at the time the Senate Estimates committee was sitting, it is the obligation not of the department, but of the Minister, to see that the truth is told to the committee. In this case that clearly was not done. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention also in regard to the way in which this whole arrangement was set up that I have been given information-I have no doubt that it is correct-that at least one firm was 'stood over' by officers of the Department of Trade and Resources, acting as enforcers for the National Country Party Mafia which set up the deal. This firm was threatened with bureaucratic retaliation unless it behaved in the way in which the Government wanted it to behave. There was a number of items of specific bureaucratic retaliation. One was that this firm, which also imports German wine, was told that every second bottle might be opened unless the firm complied with the Government's wishes. The firm also imports coffee and it was told that there would be delays in the processing of excise returns which would entail the company having an extra $2m or $3m outstanding at particular times, and so on. That incident happened. It was denied before the Committee by the officer from the Department of Trade and Resources. I asked whether it would be possible to obtain a statutory declaration from every First Assistant Secretary in the Department, stating that they had no knowledge of that having been done. The Minister then intervened. He said he found the question quite inappropriate. It is inappropriate if one is trying to protect the Minister for Trade and Resources but it is not an inappropriate question for this Parliament to ask. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the Minister to comment on the misleading answer given, and not subsequently corrected regarding our obligations under Article XVI of the GATT. Secondly, I invite him again to obtain statutory declarations from all the First Assistant Secretaries of the Department of Trade and Resources to the effect that they have no knowledge of what I have called at various times the bureaucratic harassment or blackmailing of the firm concerned. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Baume,</PARA>
<PARA> Following consideration of the Department of Trade and Resources' estimates for 1981/82, you referred to me for advice, a question arising from a report by the Australian Broadcasting Commission concerning an address made by the Senior Trade Commissioner, Jakarta to a group of businessmen in Darwin (Hansard: 12 October, 1981, Estimates Committee H, p. 662). </PARA>
<PARA> It is standard practice that Trade Commissioners, while on briefing programmes in Australia, meet with Australian businessmen to inform them of the market conditions and normal commercial practices in our trading partner countries. </PARA>
<PARA> During a recent visit to Australia, the Senior Trade Commissioner, Jakarta, spoke to a group of Australian businessmen in Darwin for this purpose. He spoke from notes and, as is usual in these circumstances, no transcript of his address was taken. I am informed that, during the course of his address, the Senior Trade Commissioner quoted from two pieces of publicly available material relating to Indonesia, the first a speech given by an Indonesian at a Stanford Research Institute Meeting in September 1974 and the second, a feature article in the Melbourne 'Age' issue of 25 April, 1981 which reported comments attributed to an Indonesian. </PARA>
<PARA>Quotation One</PARA>
<PARA> ''Conflicts in words and conflicts in feeling should be avoided even at great personal and psychological cost. In conversations and negotiations with others all parties should try to emphasise the items everybody agrees with, whereas conflicting matters should not be discussed for fear of hurting the feelings of others. This type of relationship makes it almost inevitable that a clear and outright 'no' as an answer to some suggestion is taken as crude and unrefined behaviour. If one wants to say 'no' the polite way to do it is to say 'yes, but . . . . '</PARA>
<PARA> What comes after the word 'but' really carries the negative message. More difficult to catch is the Javanese 'no' formulated in the word 'yes', but denied by facial expression or behavioural rejection. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Javanese . . . . 'yes' in most cases means 'I do understand you', and is far from 'I agree with you' and even farther from 'I promise to do what you want me to do'. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the subtle feelings of the Indonesian and particularly those of the Javanese, it is advisable never to make him ashamed in the presence of others. In fact the feeling of shame is a function of degrading of respectability in the eyes of other people.

<PARA> ''Everyone has to bend to corruption, it's the system. You play it by ear as to when to pay, how much and when to refuse. Sure you can take a great moral stand against it-and lose your credit rating, your job, your liberty and even your life''. End quote</PARA>
<PARA> I would draw your attention to the fact that the Senior Trade Commissioner was quoting from a newspaper article. He offered no comment on, or elaboration of, the article and, thus, cannot be said to have advocated or condoned the practices referred to in that newspaper article. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the Senior Trade Commissioner made no reference to bribery or corruption in his responses to questions following his address in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the inaccurate and misleading report by the Australian Broadcasting Commission of his address in Darwin the Senior Trade Commissioner deleted the second quotation from his subsequent talks in Australian capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for businessmen to make their own judgements as to the approach most likely to achieve their commercial objectives. This is not an area in which they are, or should be, susceptible to influence by Trade Commissioners or officials. What they do have every right to expect of Trade Commissioners and officials, however, is the provision not only of market information that is both accurate and complete but also advice on customs and practices which the businessmen encounter. Trade Commissioners and officials would be failing in their duty if they were to withhold information that could be crucial to businessmen in making their commercial judgements. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said this, I should stress that it is not Government policy to encourage firms to engage in activities overseas that would be in breach of the laws of the countries with which they are trading. In this regard I would point out also that, in administering the export incentives legislation, the Export Development Grants Board does not allow unusual payments to overseas buyers as being eligible payments for the purpose of export market development grants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I well remember the Estimates examination. I have some information for the honourable senator. I have a letter from the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, dated 27 October 1981 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the meeting of the Senate Estimates Committee H on 12 October 1981 you-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, I-</PARA>
<PARA>agreed to refer to me a request that a statutory declaration from all the First Assistant Secretaries in the Department of Trade and Resources stating that they have no knowledge of 'Douwe Egberts being blackmailed in that way' be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Anthony goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I have read the report of the Committee Meeting in question and note that Mr Webb, the Departmental Officer responding to the Committee, categorically denied any knowledge of 'harassment' and 'threats'. Since that time my Department has advised me that no officer of the Department of Trade and Resources has attempted to 'blackmail' Douwe Egberts or any other company on the issue of tobacco which was raised in the Senate Estimates Committee. I believe that this answers the question raised by the Committee and accordingly I do not consider that the question of Statutory Declarations arises. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, J. D. ANTHONY</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first lot of information I have. In essence, what has happened is that the matter raised by the Committee has been taken seriously. It has been taken back to the Department, it has been investigated and inquiries have been made of other officers. We now have an assurance from the Deputy Prime Minister that no officer has attempted to blackmail Douwe Egberts or any other company. I hope that resolves that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be some different understanding on the other matter. I understand the issue is not so much whether or not the policy line decided on by the Government was appropriate; Senator Walsh's concern is whether or not we had an obligation to notify our trading partners. I take it that is the issue?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The information I have been given is as follows: The officer's reply on the question of Australia's obligations under GATT to the points raised by Senator Walsh in the Senate Estimates Committee which considered the estimates of the Department of Trade and Resources necessarily shorthanded what is a complex issue. I think Senator Walsh will acknowledge that. In elaboration of the matter I can make the following points: Firstly, the GATT is a multilateral treaty setting out rules relating to the conduct of international trade to which contracting parties, including Australia, agree to subscribe. Secondly, there is no arbitration machinery which evaluates each action by contracting parties in terms of GATT rules. I think the next point will add a gloss to that. Thirdly, the customary practice is that any contracting party which believes its interests are being harmed by specific measures which it-that is the aggrieved contracting party-judges to be inconsistent with the GATT may take the matter up at the regular monthly GATT meeting held in Geneva to discuss such matters. Fourthly, in respect of the tobacco issue raised by Senator Walsh, no contracting party has brought this issue before GATT. Fifthly, Australia believes that its actions on tobacco, which followed ministerial consideration and an IAC report, are completely consistent with its obligations under GATT. The fact that no contracting party has challenged our measures in GATT would seem to support that view. I add that the proposal for a concessional arrangement to apply to imports of manufactured tobacco in respect of purchases of Australian leaf merely brought into line the position of manufactured tobacco with that of unmanufactured tobacco. I emphasise to the Committee that it was done after consideration by the Cabinet and after inquiry and report by the IAC. I also point out to the Committee that the level of concession finally agreed to by Ministers was lower than that recommended by the IAC. The IAC actually recommended a more generous concession. I stand by the view we have taken that concessional import duties are not regarded as export subsidies. The Australian decision was announced in a public statement and I emphasise again that no contracting party of GATT has formally requested Australia to table the matter for consideration by GATT. If it does so, I imagine it would be considered in the way I have outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Western Australia) (5.26)-Mr Anthony's letter dodges the issue. It is framed in terms of no complaint having been made by any other signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The section of Article XVI I quoted deals with the obligation of any of the contracting parties which have granted or maintained any subsidy, including any form of income or price support which operates directly or indirectly to increase exports of any product, to notify the contracting parties in writing. This is the primary issue here and Mr Anthony's letter does not deal with that. No such notification-at least none that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Baume) has read-was submitted to our trading partners. It is not a question of whether they complain to us; it is a question of Australia's obligation to notify them of a policy change-an obligation which, according to the evidence given to Estimates Committee H and reaffirmed today, Australia did not take up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The key phrase is whether an arrangement 'operates directly or indirectly to increase exports'. I put the question in its very simplest form: Would Douwe Egberts be exporting something like, I think, 350,000 kilograms if these arrangements had not been introduced? Does the Government believe that Douwe Egberts would have exported any tobacco at all, or that quantity of tobacco, if those arrangements which came into force in March had not been introduced? I might add that they were supplemented later by some other action. Unless the Government says that that had no effect on the volume of exports from Douwe Egberts, it is clearly an arrangement which operated indirectly to increase exports of a product from Australia and of which Australia did not notify its trading partners, in clear breach of Article XVI of the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Minister is waiting for an answer, but in case he is I will give him an opportunity to get it and will comment on a couple of other items in Mr Anthony's letter. The Industries Assistance Commission, to which reference has been made, in its report advised the Government that the arrangement it proposed did breach the GATT. Incidentally, it did not recommend either that the Government do what it did or anything else. It actually said that if the Government was determined to do so, having sent a loaded reference to the IAC in December, this method would be less obnoxious than any other which had been proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question is: If Mr Anthony is so confident that no improper pressure was brought to bear on Douwe Egberts in the way that I have outlined, why will he not ask for statutory declarations to be made by all the first assistance secretaries? We got an assurance from one FAS, who was obviously uncomfortable at the time he was giving it, before a Senate Estimates committee-not on oath-that this had not been done. We have had Mr Anthony's assurance that it did not happen. We on this side of the chamber at least have an idea of how much that assurance is worth and I venture to suggest that at least half of the Liberal Party back bench shares our view. If Mr Anthony is so confident that no such improper action took place, why will he not ask the first assistant secretaries to make statutory declarations? I will tell the Committee why. In that case the first assistant secretaries would get a chance to speak for themselves-would actually be obliged to speak for themselves-instead of being spoken for by Mr Anthony. The second reason, of course, is that if it can be proved that a statutory declaration is false there are very heavy penal sanctions. I think the penalty for a person making a false statutory declaration is up to seven years imprisonment. Mr Anthony is not game to ask-he very prudently refuses to ask-his first assistance secretaries for such an assurance because he is frightened that one or more of them will tell the truth. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Baume finds my statement offensive I am quite happy to withdraw it. I will rephrase it. My sources are in vulnerable positions and they know very well that if they were to go public on an issue such as this they would subsequently be victimised by the Minister who is in control of the Department of Trade and Resources. Given that situation, I have sought a meaningful guarantee from all the first assistant secretaries-I have no doubt that at least some of them know about this matter-that it did not happen. The Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) did not ask them for it. He refused to pass on the request, I repeat, because he is frightened that at least some of them will tell the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first part of Senator Baume's response, we are back into the same impasse. Senator Baume keeps talking about what is and what is not a breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I leave that matter aside because it is a much more difficult question to determine. The Industries Assistance Commission said that there was a breach of GATT; somebody in the Department of Trade and Resources is saying that there was not. I must say that I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Baume in these circumstances. He is being called upon to account for actions for which he is not responsible and over which he has no control. I would be delighted to have the relevant Minister here so that he had to accept the responsibility for his own action instead of leaving Senator Baume to be the fall guy. But the question at this stage is not whether there was a breach of GATT. It is a question of Australia introducing an arrangement-since Senator Baume ducked my earlier question-the consequence of which was the export of some 350 tonnes of Australian product by Douwe Egberts which would not have been exported had that arrangement not been introduced. That is an indirect measure which increased exports of a product. Article XVI says that any contracting party that does that shall notify the other contracting parties in writing, and that the Australian Government has failed to do. On several occasions there have been several opportunities to come to grips with that issue and it has been dodged every time and for very good reason-because the Minister for Trade and Resources is guilty. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that in some ways this Government is a lucky government. Here we are on 24 November, departments are running out of money, the Advance to the Treasurer is being used, the Government is off trying to borrow on the Arab loan market, we have an innumerate Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) who gives to the Senate information which is not only incorrect but also is the exact opposite of what is correct. This Government is indeed fortunate that the present Governor-General is not a toady of the present Opposition as was the Governor-General of six years and two days ago. This Government is also lucky that the Chief Justice at that time was motivated by political prejudice rather than objective legal criteria. This Government is very lucky that a fortnight after the non-passage of the Appropriation Bills, the fact that the government of the day did not have control of the Senate was used by assorted toadies and politically prejudiced people who hid their political prejudice behind a smokescreen of legalistic rhetoric. This Government is very fortunate that it does not have those sorts of people sitting in judgment over it today. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose this Government is fortunate in that Mr Anthony will at least for the time being probably get away with what he has orchestrated and engineered within his Department-breaches of GATT, the attempts to cover them up, at the very least the breach of the notification obligations of GATT and, I believe, a breach of the substantive provisions of GATT, but I will not go into that at this stage because it is very much more difficult to prove. It is proven that the notification conditions of GATT have been breached. I draw attention again to the fact that the Government has not attempted to come to grips with that issue as a tacit plea of guilty. Of course there was the First Assistant Secretary from Mr Anthony's Department who attempted to mislead Estimates Committee H when these questions were raised. The Department and the Minister have allowed that misleading answer to stand for six weeks. They might get away with it this time--</PARA>

<PARA>I do not know whether Mr Webb has a faulty memory. I do not pass any judgment on whether he was consciously misleading the Committee. The point is, it must be known by very many people in the Department and it must be known by the Minister that the answer was not correct and that there is a very unequivocal obligation to notify the other contracting parties when such a policy has been introduced, without necessarily passing judgment on whether the policy itself breaches GATT. The Committee was misled. The misleading answer has stood uncorrected for six weeks and the Minister for Trade and Resources is responsible. He might get away with this. He has got away with so much, I suppose, that he might be almost entitled to believe that he can get away with anything, but he will not get away with it forever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the problems here is that the Government and Senator Walsh seem to have different perceptions of our obligations. I am assured that our understanding is that we did not have an obligation, under the circumstances that existed here, to notify the other trading parties. Of course, I did announce that we made a public statement as to what was going on and since then we have no doubt that all the other contracting parties know of the arrangement that was made. The question is, to some extent, academic-I am not trying to minimise what Senator Walsh is saying-but they all know of the arrangement that was made and the conditions under which people are operating in this country. There has been ample opportunity for other contracting parties to have made their positions known either to Australia or at the monthly meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if that had been their wish and their desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There appears to be a different perception of what was necessary here. I do not believe that the officer and the Department-I was in attendance at the Estimates Committee-were misleading the Committee. I must say that it is very difficult for public servants when they come before a committee, in an atmosphere and a context that is unfamiliar for them, in an adversary situation with which they are neither familiar not comfortable, to deal with politicians who operate every day in this atmosphere and who are quite used to it. In this situation, where the politicians are asking the questions and they are answering, they are placed at a considerable disadvantage. I believe that some of the questions that were asked on 12 October-Senator Walsh and I had a few words to each other on that day and I will not bore the Committee with a repetition of them-were too vigorous and, in fact, were not fair to the officers. Mr Webb did not say-I think these were Senator Walsh's words-that no complaint had been received from the United States to the best of his recollection. He said:</PARA>

I do not expect an answer today but I am giving notice of this matter in the hope that I will get an answer when the Senate resumes for the Autumn session. It has been drawn to my attention that departments who want to hold conferences can approach the Department of Administrative Services, which is responsible for buildings and conference centres in the Australian Capital Territory, for the use of those centres. However, instead of using the conference facilities owned by the Government, departments often hire conference centres, such as the Lakeside Hotel, at enormous expenditure of taxpayers' money. I am given to understand that the Government is the owner of any number of places in Canberra where these conferences can be held. I will say no more about it at this stage, but I should like the Department of Administrative Services to bring down a report on the number of suitable conference centres the Government owns and which are available in the Australian Capital Territory and are being by-passed by Government departments in favour of the Canberra Rex and the Lakeside at enormous cost. They could be using Government-owned premises, so saving a large amount of taxpayers' money. I will leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate we are now beginning is really a continuation of a previous debate in this place. The legislation before us is the result of the Government's response to decisions previously taken in this place. The Government has set aside the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981, which was amended by the Senate, and has introduced two new Bills-the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 (No. 2) and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. The first Bill provides for federal assistance to tertiary education and is similar to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981. However, provisions for the charging of fees have been removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition, of course, has no objection to the provision of federal assistance to tertiary institutions contained in this Bill. In fact, as the Opposition has made clear on many occasions in this place, it would like to see increased Federal Government expenditure on tertiary education. We are only too well aware of the difficulties that tertiary institutions are labouring under throughout this country. Of course, we are not opposing the Bill insofar as it provides funds for tertiary institutions. Indeed, it is our wish to see those funds increased. However, the other issue raised by this Bill is the amalgamation of tertiary institutions. In the view of the Opposition the current proposals for amalgamation of certain tertiary institutions cannot be supported. They are poorly thought out. They seem to have been motivated by the desire to save public funds rather than by the desire to improve education. Like many of the recommendations of the Lynch committee, of which this is just one, they will not achieve any greater efficiency or rationalisation of the resources they are attempting to rationalise. In fact, they will create a lot more confusion and we believe they will harm the quality and diversity of tertiary education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we are very concerned about the amalgamation proposal for the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education. When I say 'in particular', we are concerned about other amalgamations but the particular amalgamation in Townsville is one which is not defensible in terms of efficiency or educational standards. We are very concerned about the fact that a Bill to effect this amalgamation is now before the Queensland Parliament. The Queensland Government has indicated its opposition to the amalgamation arising from the Lynch committee recommendation but under pressure has introduced the Bill providing for amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the College of Advanced Education in Townsville will be incorporated into the University as an autonomous institute, that new courses will require ministerial approval and that there will be the appointment of an advisory council consisting of five government appointees and four members of the University Council. They will, firstly, implement the Act; secondly, maintain standards in north Queensland; and thirdly, generally supervise advanced education in north Queensland. It will not come as any surprise to the Government to hear that we are particularly concerned at the erosion of autonomy of the newly amalgamated institution. In particular, we object to the fact that new courses to be introduced into the University of Townsville will now require ministerial approval at State level. That seems to us to be totally opposed to the principle of university autonomy and totally to cut across the concept of expertise and specialist decisions being taken by those who are properly able to take them. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, we are very concerned at the provision for State Government appointment of advisory council members. In fact, five appointees to the new council will be appointed by the State Government. Again, that provision seems to us to be totally contrary to the principle of university autonomy. I believe there is no valid argument for saying that these kinds of appointments are in the interests of the best standards of education. I understand that Senator Macklin, who of course represents the State of Queensland in this place, will want to make more detailed comments on this proposal. Therefore, I will make general points on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in regard to the amalgamation in Townsville. We recognise that the amalgamation will mean great difficulty for the University and CAE. In New South Wales, other institutions have been granted a further 12 months to finalise the amalgamation proposals. This indulgence of a period in which to re-organise circumstances should have been extended to Townsville. The Federal Government has washed its hands of the issues and the difficulties involved. The budgets for both the University and the College have gone to the University. In determining the size of the budget it has been assumed that there will be a reduction in costs and consequent savings. Under the arrangement if a college insists on carrying out its traditional function there will be no saving in cost in the college area. The saving will be made in the area of traditional university activities. It is our view that the Government has rushed this proposal through to the detriment of higher education in north Queensland, that the Government ought to be able to assure us that there will be a full range of higher education facilities in Townsville and that the Government ought to assure the Parliament that there will be no interference in the autonomy of the university. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, of course, it must be said that we regard this ad hoc method of handing over tertiary institution functions to State governments as totally unacceptable. In allowing the Queensland Bill to go before the Parliament in its present form the Federal Government has abandoned its responsibility in respect of ensuring the qualitative development of higher education in north Queensland. The other general objections we have with regard to the amalgamation I think can be extrapolated from the example I have given of the problems that will arise in Townsville. In view of our objections to many of the amalgamations proposed and the way in which many of them have been pursued, I now move on behalf of the Opposition an amendment to the second reading motion in respect of the Bill. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately three Bills dealing with appropriations for tertiary education. I turn my attention to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. This Bill attempts to reintroduce the provisions for charging fees which the Senate removed from the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981. The Opposition will oppose the motion that the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 Bill be read a second time. I remind the Senate in a summary manner of the reasons for our opposition to the provisions for the imposition of fees in tertiary institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our view, the imposition of fees would reduce access to education. That is our fundamental objection. It is an objection that can be sustained by various surveys that have been carried out by the Australian Union of Students and other organisations. It is not in the interests of this society or in the interests of individuals in this society to have the opportunity for higher education removed. That is our fundamental objection. We also fear that it is the intention of the Government to impose fees for all tertiary students and that this provision to impose fees for second and higher degrees is merely a first step in that direction, although perhaps I should say a second step in that direction since fees for overseas students have already been imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no economic justification for the provision, no financial argument in favour of it. The amount to be collected as a result of the imposition of fees for second and higher degrees is estimated by the Government to be $8m in a full year, a figure which in our view is an optimistic estimate. That figure will be eroded by administrative costs. The Senate should be reminded that that figure of something less than $8m, which could be gained by the imposition of fees compares in an insignificant way with the Budget appropriation for education of $1.865 billion. Therefore, there can be no argument that the collection of fees in this way would have any significant effect; it would have only the most miniscule effect on the provision of funds for education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be pointed out that the money to be collected through the reintroduction of fees would not be used to assist lower or middle income people to undertake tertiary education. It is not a matter of redistribution from the wealthy, or those able to pay, to those not able to pay, as perhaps the Government would like to pretend. It will not be used, for example, to increase funding for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, which is so low as to prevent many potential students from undertaking tertiary studies. This Bill seeks simply to take money out of education and to allow the Government to redirect it elsewhere. Of course, we are very concerned that, at a time of rapid technological and economic change, the Government should be encouraging people to acquire new skills and to upgrade their qualifications. This is not happening. The contrary is happening. The Government is discouraging people from undertaking the kind of specialist studies which would enable them and enable our society and our economy to cope with structural and technological change. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, as I have pointed out before in this place, an anomalous circumstance that students can drop out of higher studies and get more money by way of the unemployment benefit than by way of tertiary education assistance. In other words, the financial strategies of this Government in regard to education funding are actually encouraging people to seek unemployment instead of advancing their skills and knowledge and making themselves more able to contribute to the society. By comparison with other nations, the Australian Government ranks education as a low priority and, in the view of the Opposition, it is of no benefit to the community to have vast numbers of people unskilled and undereducated, which is the situation at present. For these reasons, and the reasons which my colleagues have set forth in the previous debate on this matter, we will oppose the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill before the Senate this evening is the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981. This Bill attempts to reintroduce provisions for charging fees at the Australian National University which the Senate removed from the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. The Federal Opposition will oppose this Bill for the reasons I have just stated with respect to the previous Bill. There is a separate Bill, of course, because the Australian Government directly legislates for the Australian National University. But because we are equally concerned to see an increase in access for students to that university, we will be opposing this Bill at the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak for only a few minutes on part of this legislation-the section in relation to tuition fees. I believe there is in the community quite a misconception regarding the intention of this legislation because the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have been speaking as though it is the general intention to bring in tuition fees for all students studying for second and third degrees to cover the total costs of those courses. That is why the misconception arises. I will just go over what the taxpayer pays for education in this country. The taxpayers, some of whom are on very low incomes, pay for the education of a person from five years old right through to completion of matriculation. Not only that, but in Australia we also have completely free primary degree courses. The taxpayers have also been footing the bill for someone who wants to go further to get a second degree. The taxpayers also foot the bill at the moment for higher degrees, including masters degrees and doctorates. I believe the taxpayer has had enough of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The taxpayer pays an allowance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme to a student whose parents come within a certain means-tested bracket. If that university student wants to live a full life and get married, the taxpayer will foot that bill too. Indeed, the taxpayer will then support the wife of the university student. If he wants then to have children, the taxpayer again foots the bill. The taxpayer will support those children, no matter how many the student desires to have. At our universities there are people who become professional students and who do degree after degree. A certain number of students decide to do a primary degree, a masters degree and then a doctorate. That is fair enough, and those who indulge in research would possibly go through those three degrees. The taxpayer can be asked to pay a living allowance to the wife and children of the student who wants to do that. In 1980 an estimated 13,250 students did such courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, of which I am Chairman, has been investigating over the last few months a group of homeless young people who have been living in refuges and who, as soon as they get a job, start paying tax. They are a very disadvantaged group of children who, no matter how bright or intelligent they are, would never think of doing a university course. They must look at us in absolute wonder when we say that they, as low income tax payers, will pay not only for a university student to do a second or third degree but will also pay a living allowance for the wife and children of that university student. </PARA>
<PARA> These people, with the accumulation of all these degrees, can then set about earning a considerable amount of money-indeed, pay tax on that-having been given this education completely free by the taxpayers of Australia. The Government is asking that the taxpayers be relieved of about 17 per cent to 18 per cent, on average, of the cost of the second and third degrees. This is what the fuss is all about. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats make great play of justice in this country. This Opposition says that it believes that the poor of this country should have justice. There is no justice in getting these people on low incomes to pay this tremendous cost in the area of education. I believe that if it is just a principle which is attached to this Bill that university students, who will end up having a considerably higher income than any of the group-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Georges has bitten and said that they will be paying higher taxes. That is not his usual cry. Yes, they will be paying higher taxes. When Senator Georges goes around the shelters, sees the children who are on the lower incomes and finds the sorts of jobs they are doing in the factories he will see that they certainly do not have any job satisfaction. But the university students who have second and third degrees and who are doing research will never be asked to work in the factories and just press a button all day long. They will go ahead and do jobs which give them complete and utter satisfaction. The will be paying higher taxes because they will be earning more, but they will be getting complete and utter satisfaction out of their jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I ask is that the Opposition thinks again and thinks of that group of people who are being forced to pay taxes for this elite group of university students who have the world before them. They will have jobs in which they will have complete satisfaction. We are asking them to pay just $2,000 over the whole time they are studying for a masters degree or $3,000 over the whole time they are studying for a Ph.D. It is estimated that only 17.7 per cent of the 13,250 students doing second and third degrees are full time students. The rest are part time students well able to pay that paltry amount. We are asking the students to pay a small amount. I believe that the Opposition and the Democrats, if there is any sincerity at all in their cry for us to help those underprivileged people, should pass these Bills in this chamber tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On 14 October I spoke in this chamber in relation to education, mentioning specifically the problem of biotechnology. I raise that matter again in relation to these Bills, specifically the funding of universities and colleges of advanced education, because interestingly enough in the last week there has been a conference on that matter in Australia. I wish to refer to a report in the Weekend Australian concerning the visit to Australia of Dr Herman Lewis, Director of Human Cell Biology at the National Science Foundation of the United States of America, who came here this week for the conference and has made a number of pronouncements on the importance of biotechnology to the American economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In outlining his plan he gave four points for the development in Australia of a climate which would be conducive to the fostering of this high technology industry. The plan is aimed at attracting high risk investment in biotechnology-we all admit that it is a necessity-and encouraging company research. One of the main planks of his plan was to boost linkages between universities in which the most valuable genetic engineering studies are currently taking place. The point I was making on 14 October, a month ago, was precisely that-that our universities have been in the forefront of world development in this area, yet we are letting slip through our fingers the opportunity to capitalise on that work by not developing a viable and productive industry in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Lewis is also reported to have said that in the last six months in America over 100 new companies had been formed and over $1,000m had developed in those industries annually; that the vast importance of those industries to the American economy, not only now but also in the future, was such that the type of expenditure needed to go on. In Australia we have few opportunities to look towards such high risk capital and company investment in research, but to date we have been in the forefront of world advances in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have not been able to capitalise on those advances. Indeed we are now setting about destroying that base by the way in which we seek to fund university research and development. Indeed, that point was a fundmental reason given by the Australian Democrats for our opposition to the imposition of fees. It had nothing to do with the moral qualities or otherwise of students paying or not paying for their higher degrees, or whether some students would go on to do higher degrees when they ought to be doing something else. We were looking at the much broader and far-reaching implications of destroying our research base when we needed it most. Contrary to what Senator Walters has said, when we took that particular stance, we were concerned about the underprivileged and the poor. We believe, and I thought until Senator Walters spoke that the Government also believed, that the development of a healthy economy provides the best basis for the support and succour of those who are in distress, and the provision of genuine and useful programs for those who are disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that, whilst there has been an increase in funding under the States Grants Bills, which we applaud, it has not been sufficient. It certainly has not been sufficient to meet the types of demands that the universities have made upon them and the types of things that, given their infrastructure and capital development to date, they are capable of achieving. By making use of the vast base that we have developed in Australia our universities could indeed contribute much more to our economy. This is what we should seek to do as rapidly as possible and with as much foresight as we can manage. To date we have not been noted for looking much beyond the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Williams Report on Education, training and employment, which was handed down and which, unfortunately, did not receive the type of attention it ought to have, pointed out a very interesting fact, namely, that the highest proportions of graduate students are in agriculture, engineering, education and the natural sciences. Post-graduate research in agriculture, engineering and science in particular, is exacting and make heavy demands on the students concerned. If fees are added to the existing commitment as is proposed under the amendments, both to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act and to the Australian National University Act, the deterrent effect could be considerable, especially as the problems of inflation and unemployment have already made post-graduate study in this country far less attractive than it has been, even in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stated and the Australian Democrats have pointed out time and again that the prosperity of Australia for the remainder of this century is closely linked to the welfare of primary industry and the development of our natural resources but, more importantly, to the ability of industry to adjust to rapid technological change. In those circumstances, we believe that to discourage graduates seeking advanced expertise in relevant areas is remarkably ill-considered and certainly runs against the whole tenor of responsible economic management. Therefore, we do not support, on that basis alone, the proposition of the imposition of fees. We remain neutral as to whether that will assist the moral advancement or otherwise of students. But we do not consider that to be a relevant point when one is looking at the overall economic development of this country into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills have now been brought forward in a new form. The Australian Democrats find it regrettable that this chamber has not yet seen fit to debate its powers in relation to these Bills as has the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, we have not yet had a statement from the President of the Senate on this matter although the Speaker of the House of Representatives has made a couple of statements in relation to the power of that chamber. We hope that at some time in the near future this chamber may be able to discuss this issue and make its point of view clearly known. But, we do, in fact, applaud the Government for bringing forward these Bills at last in the correct form. The 1967 compact very clearly made the point that new policies, when brought forward, ought not be included in money Bills but ought to be brought forward in separate legislation and discussed purely on their merits. We applaud the Government for at last undertaking to do that and for having brought these Bills forward in this correct fashion as they ought to have been presented in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that we had the original debate on the Bill in that form which did not enable us to tease it out. I am sure that Senator Ryan would have welcomed the opportunity to have had a much more in depth and discursive discussion in relation to States grants and the whole issue of university funding whereas previously we had to concentrate on the new policy area and look at that. We hope that in the future, certainly in the next session of this Parliament, the Government will bring forward Bills, drafted in that way, in agreement with the compact of 1967 so that we are able to discuss the new policy developments of this Government on their merits and not have this type of situation arising again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will support the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill (No. 2) and also the Australian Labor Party's amendment. We will oppose the Bill to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act and the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 in relation to tuition fees. The other Bill which was originally part of this package and which related to the Canberra College of Advanced Education of course, was concerned solely with fees. It has already been rejected by this Senate and doubtless has enabled the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to start counting the months to when he can pull the trigger. We believe that it is not a relevant issue in relation to this. Unfortunately, the whole discussion about a double dissolution or whatever has tended to cloud what we believe is an extremely important and relevant issue, not only now in Australia, but also in the future. We must come to grips with the vast technological changes that are now occurring in the world. We must provide sufficient moneys so that Australia can at least remain with, if not ahead of, other developed countries in this area. We again urge the Government to look at its priorities and see whether or not we have been underfunding our universities and college of advanced education for the next generation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I point out what a very eminent Australian said in relation to this matter. Professor Passmore stated: 'There is a real prospect that we will lose not just one but two or three generations of scientists and scholars who will find it impossible to get a permanent university appointment'. The real problems facing a steady State university are such that in 1990 we will find that we will be without an adequate tertiary education base to provide not only the type of research that is needed for our industry but also an education for our citizens. I believe that we must give much more urgent attention to this matter. We would have wished to debate those types of long-range principles instead of having had to deal with what seems to be purely a short term political move on the part of the Goverment, namely its decision to impose fees. We certainly hope that in the future we will be able to move to those broader matters of principle and economic planning so that this country will know that there will be sufficient people to provide for those who are retiring and those who are unemployed. Unless we have developed technological industry we certainly will not be able to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate we are dealing with the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 (No. 2), the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 and the fees Bill, the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981. As far as the first two Bills are concerned, the funding Bills, I make it perfectly clear-I have mentioned this to the Government-that it is very important for the Government and the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) to understand that in a small university there is a degree of diversification. The costs of such a university providing a service would, so far as economies of scale are concerned, in normal circumstances be higher than those of other universities. Of course, that applies to the University of Tasmania. I believe that there is a very substantial situation to which the Government must face up in respect of that type of university. In a State such as Tasmania, tertiary educational institutions must, of course, serve the whole of the State. There is, as has been said in this chamber on a number of occasions, a problem relating to the north-west coast of our State. I intend to take up with the Government the cause of constituents within the tertiary institutions in my State in the hope that the Government will ensure that special recognition is given to the needs of tertiary education in the State of Tasmania. Whilst there has been an increase in the amount of funding for educational institutions it is perfectly clear, not only in my State but also right throughout Australia, that the academic community is extremely worried that the quality of education could be affected as a result of the level of funding. I have heard it said, quite openly, that quotas will need to be applied in certain faculties, and maybe they already apply in certain faculties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That leads me to the fees issue. One of the concerns I have is related to quotas. If permanent students who are taking up places in facilities are doing their third, fourth or fifth degrees, or whatever, we must surely give to the institutions the right to make some sort of decision as to the contributions those persons should make towards their degrees. Senator Mason on behalf of the Australian Democrats has indicated that their oposition to fees is based on the fact that a determination made by the Minister requiring institutions to impose fees in fact could be directed and could strike at the heart of the research base in Australia. I agree with that. I do not think it is necessary for me to canvass all the points that were canvassed two weeks ago when this legislation last came before the Senate. Suffice it to say that some higher degree students-we are talking about higher degree students here-who are on scholarships are living in penury as a result of inadequate scholarships which have not been indexed. Sufficient evidence has been provided to me to convince me that the imposition of fees on higher degree students could have a substantially deleterous effect on the amount of research work, work of excellence, being undertaken in universities, which, as has been said, ultimately benefits the whole of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sort of case cannot be mounted in respect of the imposition of fees for non-meal-ticket second, third and fourth degrees. I deliberately use the phrase 'non-meal-ticket second, third and fourth degrees' because some people need a second degree for a meal ticket. When certain employers and certain areas of expertise require maybe two degrees, then it is a question of meal ticket. Nevertheless, as to the other degrees, the same argument cannot be mounted as can be mounted to protect those students who are attempting to achieve higher degrees and are involved in the research that has been referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not have any illusions about where the Senate is heading on this matter. As has been said, the Government is moving towards a situation in which it can have the loaded section 57 constitutional gun in the locker. I am not at all fussed about that. I am not fussed about the implied threats that are being thrown around from time to time in the Press by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), but by the same token I consider it is the duty of the Senate to exercise its scrutiny powers in a manner which is palatable all round, if that is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason I moved the amendment that I did on the last occasion this Bill was in the Committee stage and that is the reason I will be moving the same amendment to this Bill in the Committee stage. It will provide for the Senate the scrutiny which, as Senator Macklin mentioned on a previous occasion, is important. In other words, prior to any institution being forced to impose fees the determination made by the Minister would need to be placed before both Houses of Parliament, and either House of Parliament would have the right to disallow that determination by the Minister. In that way we would have the best of both worlds. If, for example, the Minister included in that determination a requirement for the imposition of fees, say for higher degree students or those meal ticket students I was referring to, of course this chamber could disallow it. </PARA>

So I put it to the Senate that we again have the opportunity of exercising our proper scrutiny-our proper audit and control functions-in a manner consistent with the review rights of this chamber, but nevertheless providing the ultimate protection against the imposition by the Government of unwanted fees; fees that by definition are not desired by the majority in this chamber. If I read things correctly, no such fees would be able to be implemented. In those circumstances, and only in those circumstances, it is my intention to vote for the second reading of all these Bills. I will reconsider my position in respect of the two fees Bills in the event of my amendment being defeated at the Committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn briefly to Senator Ryan's amendment. I am in a difficult situation in that I would like to have seen it in the form of a suggestion, along the lines that the Minister for Education consider paragraphs (1), (2) and (3). From what Senator Ryan has said, I certainly have not formed an opinion which would persuade me that what is implied in paragraphs (1) and (2) is what I would do. It is very difficult for the Senate to formulate an opinion on a matter such as this which, of course, must have been the subject and which has been the subject of considerable discussions between the institutions concerned and the Minister for Education. If Senator Ryan's motion were preceded by the words 'but the Senate requests the Minister to take into consideration paragraphs (1), (2) and (3)' I certainly would support it. But I have not heard sufficient in this debate to form an opinion as envisaged by the preamble to the second reading amendment as it relates to paragraphs (1) and (2). </PARA>

I will deal with them separately and I will be brief because there has been extensive debate in this chamber before on the subject matter. The first Bill has now been separated so that it does not contain the fee component.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has moved an amendment relating to the amalgamation of universities and colleges. The Government will oppose that amendment. Let me make it perfectly clear to the Senate that the principle of these amalgamations came as a recommendation from an expert technical academic body, the Tertiary Education Commission, which was set up as an advisory body to the Government, to the Parliament and the people of Australia. The Tertiary Education Commission is an apolitical body headed by one of the great educationists of Australia, Professor Peter Karmel, a man whom both sides of politics have relied upon for judgments. The Commission is associated with three councils-the Universities Council, the Advanced Education Council and the Technical and Further Education Council-again with technical and expert people. It is very important indeed to understand that the amalgamations as a principle were recommended; in other words, the Government, in bringing forward its requirement for the consolidation of 30 colleges of advanced education, had taken account of specialist advice. The Tertiary Education Commission, in volume 1 of its report for 1982-84 recommended that institutions which are predominantly concerned with teacher education be consolidated into larger units. That is the basis for what has happened. The Government also recognised the need for a re-allocation of resources in education away from teacher training and towards the technologies and business studies. So the principle is one that was recommended by an expert academic body. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan directed her attention primarily to the Townsville College of Advanced Education and the James Cook University and suggested that some bad education principles were involved. I direct her attention to the fact that the Tertiary Education Commission in its recent report supported the integration in north Queensland of the two institutions under a single governing body on the grounds that-to quote its words-'this would produce the best quality of education and the widest ranges of choices for students'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan directed her attention to the fact that State governments have some responsibility for courses. Education, as she must know, is in fact constitutionally a State matter. The provision of courses within all institutions can be under the total sovereignty of the States because they have a constitutional responsibility in this respect. There is absolutely nothing at all new about that situation. When universities were set up around Australia, the State governments indicated the faculties to be established. In fact, when the colleges were set up, the State governments had their say. There is a bilateral discussion between the States and the Commonwealth as to courses. There is nothing new at all in governments deciding what courses will be undertaken. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that there is something politically wrong, that there is some tainting of academic freedom in governments indicating the courses. I repeat to the Senate that academic freedom is the right of teachers to teach and students to learn freely without an imposition from outside of dogma or doctrines whether false or accurate in themselves. It is in the detail of what is taught, in the philosophies, the dogmas and the doctrines of what is taught, that freedom exists and there is no taint of that at all. Let me make it clear that there is nothing new at all and that what is happening in respect of amalgamations comes from an expert academic body. So much for the first part of the honourable senator's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part, the approach has been that there is an opposition to fees. It has been widely argued that, if we impose fees, we will reduce access to education and therefore lower the quality and quantity of people coming forward. Attention has also been drawn to that fact that Australia has fewer people in the higher tertiary education situation than have some other countries. But the fallacy of the argument that is being put forward is this: In almost every other country, very heavy fees are imposed at first, second and higher degree levels. Those fees do not debar people from moving into the university and tertiary education systems. What is more, few if any other countries at the primary degree level not only provide education without fees but also provide assistance through a scheme such as the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of a course with no fees and a supporting allowance to students is almost unique in the world. So, if we are talking about barriers, this country in that regard has fewer barriers than almost any country with which we might wish to compare ourselves. If we are not attracting people to this part of the education system, the fault lies somewhere down the scale. One of the things to be looked at, and to be looked at very carefully-and this is not relevant to the Bills before us-is that in Australia the retention level between the ages 15 and 19 years sadly is lower than those in many other countries. It is not within the higher situation that the fault lies. </PARA>
<PARA> So the imposition of fees on those undertaking higher degrees certainly will not reduce access if in fact it has not done so overseas. It has been suggested that the Government ought to have brought in these two Bills in the way it has done now in the first place. I make it clear that there is no constitutional power standing alone for the Commonwealth to impose fees. Therefore it cannot bring in a separate Bill imposing fees. The imposition of fees rests on section 96 of the Constitution, which relates to specific grants. That must lean upon the main Bill itself. In every one of the States grants Bills that has come before there has been a section 96 imposition. There was nothing new in what we did and the first Bill, which removed the provision of fees, said that we would give the universities and colleges money only if they did not impose fees. That was contained in the one Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have viewed Senator Harradine's amendment. When last that amendment came before the Senate I was able to indicate that the Government was willing to consider supporting the disallowance principle in place of the proposed amendment to the original Bill but, sadly for Senator Harradine, his amendment applies not to the first Bill presented here tonight but to the second Bill. I understand it has been indicated that the second Bill will not get into the Committee stage because the intention of the Opposition, sadly enough, is to defeat it at the second reading. So the Committee stage will not apply and therefore the amendment will be irrelevant. I indicate that if it were moved in the Committee stage the Government would support it. I sum up simply by saying that what we are doing on amalgamations is in line with advice and what we are doing in regard to fees is minor compared with what is being done overseas. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills replace earlier Bills dated 18 August which were passed by the House of Representatives. They have passed the first reading stage in the Senate and the Minister for National Develpoment and Energy (Senator Carrick) has delivered his second reading speech. The Opposition did not oppose the first set of Bills because they were an improvement on the existing means by which fees were collected from television and broadcasting stations. The schemes which were apparent in the first set of Bills introduced provided a greater amount of equity. For example, under the proposals the licence holders with the smallest revenues would pay less than they did under the existing legislation and those with the largest revenues would pay more than they did under the existing legislation. So a principle of equity was introduced into the legislation. The Opposition accepts that licence holders ought to be taxed in accordance with the access which they have to the airways. There is an economic rent involved in the holding of these licences and thus the public should get a return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say at the outset of my remarks that the Australian Labor Party accepts that profitability in the broadcasting industry is very important. It says that it is a necessary but perhaps not sufficient condition for providing good programming. If we look at the Australian commercial television industry over the last ten years or so I think it is probably fair to argue that over the last four or five years programming has shown a steady improvement. One of the reasons for that steady improvement in the last four or five years is that television stations have become more viable in an economic sense and have been able to spend more money on Australian programming. The levels of Australian content on Ausralian television are probably better than they have ever been before. So the notion that profitability in the industry is important is basic to our view that good programs will result in part, although it may not be a sufficient condition for good programming in total. We have the same attitude to the introduction of cable television in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons we are not opposing these Bills. A sufficiently superficial and trivial charge is involved. But I want to draw attention to some important aspects in the changes in this legislation. The Senate will recall that a set of Bills dealing with licence fees for broadcasting stations was passed by the House of Representatives and introduced into the Senate. Then something happened and the Government decided not to go on with that scheme of imposing a new system of charges on television and broadcasting stations in respect of the licences they hold. We are rather bemused as to why the Government suddenly abandoned this series of legislation which arose from the Budget. It was mentioned in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). We are bemused that sudden changes could be made to a Budget which has been described by this Government as a Budget of great integrity. I use the word 'bemused'. Perhaps it is the wrong word. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word 'bemused' as 'stupefied' or 'confused'. I do not think we are stupefied. Nothing Government members have done in the Senate this session reveals stupefication on behalf of anybody but themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether the word is 'stupefaction'. I think 'stupefication' will do. The point is very clear. Whichever is the correct word, it applies to the Government rather than to us. The point I am making is simply that although we are neither stupefied nor confused by what the Government has done in this change of tack, we are, in a strange way, wryly amused. We understand precisely what has happened. Let me tell the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) what has happened in relation to the television licence fees which the Government announced in the Budget. Nothing illustrates better what the Fraser Government is about in the way it does business, if that is the appropriate expression, in Australia than this legislation. The Government of Malcolm Fraser moves in a most extraordinary way its wonders to perform. As I said, this legislation illustrates that very much.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again and again Senator Collard and his colleagues have told us how important is the integrity of a Fraser Budget. In this case representations were made on behalf of the big television stations to change the system of collecting licence fees. The macho, tough Government of Malcolm Fraser caved in when the big television channels asked for a change in the formula under which licence fees are collected. When representations come to this Government from organisations it perceives as being important to its electoral success, in other words, from organisations it fears and which have, in this Fraser Government society, the character of medieval private armies of which the Government is afraid, it caves in and the integrity of the Budget, which is talked about so often disappears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is very tough on matters such as sales tax. It will not give in on sales tax on shoes for children or building materials for new home buyers. It will not give in on the yawning deposit gap and high interest rates for new home buyers. It will not give in on sales tax on books, newspapers and periodicals. It will not give in on any of the areas which affect the living standards of the average Australian. To put it in the terms of a well-known American expression, the moment the media proprietors in Australia say 'frog' the Fraser Government jumps, and it has jumped on this occasion to accommodate those interests. That is why we have this bizarre situation of legislation being withdrawn from the Senate and new legislation being brought in which satisfies particular media proprietors. When it comes to doing favours for great and powerful friends, the flexibility of the Fraser Government is unbounded. No doubt it would be called accommodating to political realities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill sets a limit of 7.5 per cent of gross earnings for television and 5 per cent for radio. For example, for television the limit cuts out at about $47m which is 7.5 per cent of gross earnings of a television station. By our calculations the changes will involve a cost to revenue of some $100,000 this year. This is $100,000 which the Government is prepared to throw back to those companies but which it is not prepared to throw back to all sorts of other things important to this community and to the majority of Australian people. The loss to revenue by 1983-84 could possibly be $3m when a number of Sydney and Melbourne stations will exceed the cut in point. I make the point that this affects only the big proprietors; for example, it affects the Channel 9 network for Kerry Packer, the most profitable and best run television network in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the legislation do not affect the television industry generally; they affect the high fliers, the high profit earners. I would doubt very much the claims of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) that the Government reconsidered the measures in the light of representations from the broadcasting and television industry. I do not think the broadcasting and television industry was concerned about these proposals. I think the 9 network was concerned about these proposals, as were one or two of the other major networks. I think the representations which altered this Budget of the Fraser Government came from a few well placed individuals representing the biggest stations. </PARA>
<PARA> My scenario of what happened is this: Some of the big media proprietors were concerned about sales tax on books, periodicals and newspapers. They expressed their concern to the Government. I think the Government said: 'We can't do anything about that without losing face so can we do a trade off with you and do something about broadcasting licence fees instead?' That is what has happened in the context of this legislation. The effect will not be felt equally throughout the industry. It is of concern to the major stations only. A question of principle relating to the conduct of this Government is contained in this legislation. In a sense that is all that is really important about it. We, when in government, will have the opportunity to look at licence fees again as indeed this Government has the right, so long as it survives, to look at licence fees again. Probably with increased profitability it will be something that governments of all political persuasions will want to do. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents incompetence, muddleheadedness, ad hockery and a preparedness to reverse fundamental decisions, as they were described, on behalf of particular individuals of considerable wealth in this community. It represents in a sense a further question mark over the credibility of the Minister for Communications. There are so many question marks over his head he looks like a row of asterisks at the end of a sentence. Of all the administrations of this Government there is no more incredible, rather than credible, administration than that of the Minister for Communications. </PARA>
<PARA> Why have decisions been made by this Government against the advice of the Department of Communications and the Treasury in areas such as that affecting the decision as to whether Telecom Australia should develop videotex? Why have those decisions been made against the advice of departments and of everybody concerned with the proper development of industry such as that in Australia and, of course, at the final instigation of the Minister? Why were these changes made? What representations were made to the Department of Communications about these changes on behalf of the big television proprietors? Was it all done in a back bar of the Australia Club in Sydney? That is where I suspect it happened. If it happened there the Minister for Communications would be running true to form-not that I think he is a drinker; that is about the only thing that he does not do. However, what concerns one about this, the real argument that emerges from this sort of legislation is how long this country will tolerate this sort of thing going on without public declaration of donations to political parties. That is what it is all about. That is how this Government operates in areas such as this. Donations to the Liberal Party of Australia are the motivation for these crazy decisions about communications policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Until we get quite clear guidelines about the disclosure of funds donated to political parties, the Minister for Communications and other Ministers in this Government will not be above suspicion. That is the only conclusion that people can draw when they observe a series of irrational decisions made contrary to the public interest. People are entitled to know why Lord Howe Island can get a telephone connection years ahead of the time that would have applied under the priorities determined by Telecom Australia. Why did the Minister for Communications decide to make an alteration to the capital works priorities in the margin of a document from Telecom in his own well-known handwriting? Why did he do that? Why was the decision made that Telecom could no longer operate Videotex but that it should be given to the Channel 9 people, Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd and the Myer Emporium Ltd? Why were these decisions made? They are not rational decisions. They are not decisions made in the public interest. They are decisions which raise this query: Is it not about time that Australia had very clear and specific legislation on the disclosure of information concerning donations to political parties and members of political parties? When we get those things straightened out there will be much less temptation. There will be much better legislation because there will be much more determination to see that these things happen in the public interest rather than against it. </PARA>
<PARA> We reluctantly indicate that we will not oppose these Bills. They are not terribly important. They are only important as an indication of the Fraser Government's total incredibility, or lack of credibility, on these issues. They are another symbolic indication of what this Government is all about. I understand that Senator Siddons, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of these Bills. I indicate now that we will support that amendment. It will express an opinion about another sector of the broadcasting industry which has been grossly neglected by this Government and we support that opinion. Apart from that, we do not oppose these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, human nature being what it is, the Australian Democrats were naturally very suspicious about the Government's intention in introducing the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981 and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bills 1981 to alter the formula for raising television and broadcasting licence fees. Those who have studied the Bills will have seen that they are, in fact, a mathematician's delight. The formulas incorporated in the Bills for calculating the fees to be levied on broadcasting stations are almost incomprehensible to the casual observer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have done our best to grapple with the arithmetic of these Bills. The Government will be pleased to hear that we believe the net result is that there is very little difference between the amount of revenue the Government would raise under the new Bills and the amount it would have raised under the previous Bills which were introduced on 18 August this year. It is clear that the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill has been drafted with a particular organisation in mind. Why else would the ceiling come into operation at a point which almost equates the gross revenue of the Channel 9 network this year?</PARA>
<PARA> What is worrying us to some degree, if our calculations are correct, is that the amount of revenue that the Government will be raising will be only slightly more than it would have been under the old formula. We approve of a ceiling. The old formula had a percentage of gross earnings which rose as the gross earnings rose. For instance, with a gross revenue of $1m, the percentage for the fee was 8.45 per cent. So, theoretically, if the broadcasters were to pay a continually escalating percentage of their gross revenue, it would be possible for 100 per cent of gross revenue to be payable to the Government, which obviously is absurd. We approve of the proposal for an upper ceiling. If one works through the mathematics of the formula, it seems that the revenue due to the Government will not be greatly altered. Therefore, we join with the Australian Labor Party in not opposing the new Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that makes Senator Baume happier, we support them. However, we draw attention to the fact that the Government, as it indicated in the Budget, will be raising about $10m under these Bills. Therefore, it is significant to point to an election promise that the Government is not fulfilling. I refer to its promise to fund public television in this financial year. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote a letter to the Public Broadcasting Association indicating that the Government would call for licences for public television during this financial year. So far that has not been done. We ask: why?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our view, public television is a very worthwhile objective. It allows people who are not professionals to have access to a medium whereby they can communicate with the public at large and provide a service which is not covered currently by commercial, national or multicultural television. </PARA>
<PARA> A complementary service of public television could include such things as cultural development in which category we would put variety and dance, theatre performances, the visual arts and crafts, and local independent and creative films. It could cover such things as special needs programs. It could cover a diversity of needs for such people as the deaf and dumb, the disabled, the aged, youth, low income earners, environmentalists, those interested in minority sports, Aboriginal women and so forth. Public television could cover educational and educative programs. Above all, it could act as a means of better communication between regional and ethnic groups within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Broadcasting Association proposed that it would need government funding for the first five years only and after that would be self-supporting. The cost to the Government was estimated at $7m. It was an election promise that has not been kept so far. It is for this reason that we propose to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading asking the Government to honour this election promise. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest at this stage one line of development which could, in fact, save the Government a certain amount of revenue and also develop a new form of communication. I refer to radiated subscription television, or pay television as it is more commonly known. If the Government were to introduce pay television immediately and delay such developments as cable television, which will cost in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, it could, in addition to giving the public the benefit of high quality programs that pay television would ensure, also fund public television much more cheaply. At least, only two stations would be necessary to make pay television commercially viable. In addition, pay television needs the air waves only between the hours of 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. The rest of the time those two channels could be available for public television and they could be available in the early hours of the morning for transmitting special educational programs which could be videotape recorded for the schools that needed them. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by suggesting delaying the introduction of cable television, immediately introducing pay television-radiated subscription television-and making two channels available for commercial purposes for pay television while requiring that those channels be available for public television and for educational purposes, would achieve many worthwhile objectives at minimal cost to government revenue. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the loss to revenue if the Bill is passed. It relates to television broadcasters with gross earnings ranging from $45m to $100m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill. What has emerged in this debate is that there is support for these Bills from both sides of the chamber. The only argument really seems to be at the margins. The argument seems to be only as to what the upper level of the licence fee rate should be. I notice that the Australian Democrats have given their overt support to the imposition of a ceiling on the rate of licence fees. I acknowledge that this is the line the Government is taking. Senator Button developed an argument suggesting that there was some kind of conspiracy or that some kind of private deal was done. In fact, the reason for the alteration in the formula is that there was a re-consideration in the light of the representations from industry, from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, the organisations representing broadcasters and television stations. The last increase, in 1977, was a 20 per cent across the board increase. This increase being proposed now is to be reviewed in 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the maximum rate of 7.5 per cent for television stations might have risen under the previously announced formula to perhaps 7.7 per cent or a little higher. The rates being proposed are only marginally different. As for the 5 per cent rate for radio broadcasting stations, I understand that at present no station has reached that rate. The rate will still be expressed as a percentage of gross earnings. It is only the rate which will not rise above a certain figure. The amount of fee payable will rise above a certain figure. The amount of fee payable will rise as gross earnings rise. Therefore, it is wrong to say that a lid is being put on the fees. A lid is being put on the rate at which the fee is to be paid. That is the point that Senator Siddons brought out in his speech, one which we also want to bring out. The upper limits do not mean that licence fees will remain static. They mean that above a certain level the rate of the licence fee will remain static. Of course, as gross earnings rise, the amount of revenue, the amount payable by stations, will rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by the Australian Democrats, which we understand will have the support of the Australian Labor Party, seeks to add certain words to the end of the motion that the Bill be read a second time. I wish to make two points. An election commitment is an election commitment. The Government can be judged eventually on whether it honours its commitment. I am able to report on the kinds of activities which have taken place so far and which it is envisaged will take place in the near future. Guidelines for public Television are being prepared by the Department of Communications. It is expected that they will be submitted to the Government for consideration shortly. The guidelines are needed first. It is unfortunate that the process of preparation has been a lengthy one, but honourable senators will appreciate the need for full consultation with the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia and other industry bodies and consideration of all the issues before the Government approves the guidelines. I put it to the honourable senators that, with the best will in the world, the guidelines have to be appropriate before we can proceed. Once the guidelines are issued, planning proposals for public television services may be developed and submitted for consideration in the normal way; that is, through the planning processes of the Department of Communications and the licensing procedures of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The guidelines will open the way for the calling of licences for public television. The Government believes the setting of a mandatory date-the part of the amendment which we do not find acceptable-for such action as is proposed by the amendment could be counterproductive and might unnecessarily complicate the planning process. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to make a couple of points on the subject of broadcasting in Australia. The Senate will recall that earlier this year I spoke in particular about the quality of broadcasting. I also raised questions with the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and have recently been provided with an answer. I will be communicating further with the Minister in respect of that answer. However, the subject of cable and subscription television was raised during this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to add my comments in regard to this matter because during the past few months the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has been hearing public evidence on the social, economic, technical and other implications involved if subscription television is to be introduced in Australia. That has been the decision and that is what is occuring. But, at the same time, the public can expect, and is already being bombarded with, propaganda on the benefits of subscription television. National and international entrepreneurs know that there are fortunes to be made from the new networks which, in the United States, offer viewers just about everything from live concerts and sport to pornography and mindless violence. These entrepreneurs will tell one also how cable television can offer one shopping, banking and information receival services. But they will not tell one that advances in telecommunications technology will make these add-on facilities available much more quickly and cheaply through telephone attachments. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the inquiry proceeds much further the Government must announce its attitude on two vital questions which are relevant to the introduction of subscription television. The two issues I refer to are quality and cost. On the subject of quality, the viewing public must be sceptical of the Government's resolve. Despite what Senator Button said in his speech, the fact is that successive governments have deliberately allowed the question of the monitoring of television standards to be pushed into the background. I have referred previously to the fact that the Broadcasting Information Office which was, with great fanfare, to have assumed the role of receiving and investigating complaints from the public has, in fact, effectively received the chop from the razor gang. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has clear powers under the Broadcasting and Television Act to set and enforce program standards, and so has the Minister. So, let us have a bit of action in this field before we move on to other areas. Let us have a bit of action also in respect of some of the public broadcasting stations and some of the FM stations that broadcast material and abuse the airwaves that they are licensed to use. </PARA>
<PARA> I oppose the amendment to the Bill because I believe that we have a job to do with what we have got already before we go into other areas. We have to look at the quality of existing services rather than extending into other areas immediately. I believe we should have some action in this field. Then the public might believe assurances which no doubt will fall from the lips of the Government and the Minister about protection of the public from exploitation. I mention that some figures that have been developed already in respect of the cost of subscription television are astronomical. The cost of laying cables for Sydney has been estimated at $400m. I ask the Senate: Can we, as a nation, really afford this at this point? In any event developments in satellite technology may yet again revolutionise communications of which broadcasting is a part. Yet, as I understand it, satellite broadcasting is not even a part of the Tribunal's current inquiry. By waiting a little longer for colour television Australia learnt from the costly technical mistakes of other countries. In my view it would be prudent to wait and to use the time to improve the quality and standards of our existing broadcasting and television services. I use this opportunity to make those points and to urge upon the Government the need to ensure quality in existing broadcasting facilities. Because of that I oppose at this stage the amendment that has been moved. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) That the Senate is of the opinion that the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee should be given specific terms of reference, including the power to pass substantive resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the President be requested not to proceed with the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian until the applications have been presented to the Committee for its consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has been increasingly concerned at developments which affect the direction, staffing and effectiveness of the Parliamentary Library. This is of particular concern because the Library is the most important, single resource at the disposal of honourable members and honourable senators of all parties, opposition and government. In recent years the Library has been the centre of internal conflict and controversy over the range of services which it makes available to members. There have been complaints of authoritarian control over the staff, of patronage, and of a refusal to consult the senior officers about new technology or the organisation of different sections of the Library as a whole. The Government has significantly reduced the allocation of money available to the Library. Now there is disquiet about the pending appointment of a new Librarian and the merging of three of the five departments of the Parliament. The appointment of a new Librarian ought to be a subject of the keenest interest to all members of parliament. It certainly is a subject in which the Opposition and, we believe, other opposition parties have the keenest interest. It ought to be a matter of general concern. Unfortunately, however, there seems to be a reluctance by the Presiding Officers to consult with honourable members and honourable senators. Mr President, I am fully appreciative of the fact that you are a relatively new Presiding Officer and the complaints go back much further than that. I will distinguish the situations to which I refer. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be very unfortunate if there were substance in the suggestions being made that the delay in appointing a new Librarian, which went on for some time, was due to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Billy Snedden, dragging his feet on the issue. I should point out that only last weekend advertisements appeared in national newspapers, as I understand, now advertising for a new Librarian for the Parliamentary Library. I wish to refer to those advertisements in a moment. This motion is being brought to the attention of the Senate and the Parliament at this stage because it gives an opportunity for an assurance by the President that he and the Speaker of the House of Representatives do not propose to appoint a new Parliamentary Librarian during the parliamentary recess without seeking the views of members and senators of this Parliament. The appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian should be made on a scrupulously non-party basis. After all, it is a position of great sensitivity; one which goes to the very heart of how effectively this Parliament functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber have been in government for many years. No doubt that is a nice position to be in. But surely it must make them feel better, being in government, when they are able to point to a well informed and well briefed opposition, well informed and well briefed members of the Australian Democrats, and a well informed and well briefed Senator Harradine-when they see what a competent array of people they have against them-and know that they have been chosen by the electorate in spite of that fact. </PARA>

The point I am making is that there is an opportunity here for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate to give some assurances about the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian. It is important to both Government and Opposition senators that they be well informed as a result of the facility of the Parliamentary Library.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years there have been two senior officers of the Parliamentary Library, one of whom became the Librarian, who have had close links with the Australian intelligence community. When I say 'the Australian intelligence community' I do not mean people with higher than average intellect. That would be welcome in any librarian. When I say 'the Australian intelligence community' I mean snoops. I suppose there is a place for snoops in all societies but the last place where we should find snoops from security services is in the library of a national parliament. However many honourable senators want to have-that is, pay your money and take your choice-they should not be in the Australian Parliamentary Library. </PARA>

One of those officers was a senior member of the staff of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for 21 years before he became Assistant Parliamentary Librarian from 1971 to 1976. I refer, of course, to Mr Michael Thwaites. I do not need to remind honourable senators of the controversy that still rages about Mr Thwaites's role in a number of important political events in this country. Suffice to say that I think it is entirely inappropriate for senior officers of the Parliamentary Library to be recruited from ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Service, or any other arm of the security intelligence services. Are we to believe that someone who has worked in these services for a decade or two can suddenly shrug off all his association with the intelligence community when he comes into the Parliamentary Library? People like that are well placed in the Parliamentary Library to retail information about senators and members. Any suggestion that we cannot use the Parliamentary Library in the utmost privacy is to be deplored on behalf of all members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not impugn his integrity at all. All I was saying was that it is passing strange that when we come to select two librarians in a row they just happen to have been members of those organisations, a mathematical quirk which is not particularly usual in society at large. I would not impugn the integrity of the officers concerned. I might impugn the integrity of some Ministers in some governments who had an influence on their appointments. Mr President, what we are concerned about is that there should be ways by which members of the Parliament could ensure that about library issues there should be consultation by you and by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. We do not argue that the Presiding Officers have authority to make the appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian. I simply say that it makes for common sense, for courtesy, and for the rational use and development of the Library facility on a basis of trust that this sort of consultation should be observed. It is not putting it too highly to suggest that it is also a matter of public interest. The public is entitled to know that the resources available to its elected members of parliament are untainted in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, another matter which is of concern to the Opposition, and it is an associated matter, is the indication that the five departments of the Parliament are likely to be reduced to three. It is suggested that the Joint House Department, Hansard and the Library should be amalgamated. That suggestion was put clearly to an Estimates Committee in the House of Representatives on 8 September by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Billy Snedden. Mr Speaker, in the course of his statement, said that the current head of the Joint House Department, Mr Jorgensen, was a departmental head 'of great quality'. There is concern amongst many parliamentarians that this might mean that Mr Jorgensen, at the initiative of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, will be placed in control of these three departments. Frankly, members of the Australian Labor Party believe that there should be more consultation if such a decision were to be made because they do not have the highest confidence in the qualifications of Mr Jorgensen and in his capacity to handle and direct staff, as they have certainty about the question of his political neutrality. Mr Jorgensen's background in the business world as a director of the failed Palmdale Insurance Ltd and as Executive Director of the Master Builders Association raised some questions in the minds of members of parliament on this side as to whether he is the appropriate person to be appointed to that position. Yet when one looks at Mr Speaker's answer in the House of Representatives one gets at least the suggestion that he is in mind for such an appointment. What consultation is there to be with members of parliament if that decision is to be made? What confidence will members of parliament have in that decision and in the integrity and efficiency of the administration of the Library if such a decision is made without any consultation?</PARA>
<PARA> Once again we trust, Mr President, that you and Mr Speaker will do us the courtesy of canvassing our views before any new department is created and certainly before any new head is appointed to such a newly created department. I am not saying by that that we would oppose the suggestion for the amalgamation of those three departments, that it is necessarily and intrinsically wrong. All we would like to do is to record with you the view that there is concern about it and that there would be no confidence about a decision which was made without at least a modicum of appropriate discussion with a large and significant group of parliamentarians who may be affected by that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also somewhat suspicious about the way in which the Government has dealt with the financial allocation to the Parliamentary Library. Honourable senators should be aware of the following developments. Firstly, the Library's permanent staff has been reduced by 2 per cent and three temporary positions are to be abolished. These cuts are to be made by the end of the current financial year. That contrasts with the 2 per cent reduction over two years which was recommended by the Review of Commonwealth Functions-the so-called razor gang. So, in fact, the cuts in the Library's staff are in excess of the recommendations of the razor gang. Secondly, there has been a growth in the number of senior positions in the Library administration, so these cutbacks will tend to make the Library top heavy rather than balanced in its staffing requirements. Thirdly, the administrative expenditure effectively has been cut by 12 per cent, or 2.6 per cent more than for all Commonwealth departments. </PARA>
<PARA> The 12 per cent cut represents a reduction in real terms of 22 per cent. This will be particularly severe in some areas. It has been estimated, for example, that the allocation for books has been cut by 46 per cent, for photocopying by 44 per cent, computer search by 22 per cent, photocopying stores by 30 per cent, microfilming by 63 per cent and postage by 47 per cent. All of those details are matters which affect the day to day work, and the freedom to indulge in that work in an intelligent and informed way, of members of this Parliament. They are matters which should be matters of concern to all parliamentarians; astute at looking after their salaries when salary claims come along, they should also be astute at looking after their working conditions when matters of conditions come to the fore in discussions in this Parliament. The Library, with those cuts, will not be able to maintain standards and the fault for this lies with the Government. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when in Opposition was a notoriously heavy user of the Parliamentary Library services. He knows better than anyone else the damage that can be done to any Opposition by starving it and other non-government members of the research services of the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, briefly I press the Senate and you to agree to this course of action. Firstly, I ask that you press for the restoration of the money that has been taken away from the Library. It will be too late to have it restored in Additional Estimates. It should be made part of the Advance to the Minister for Finance so that it would be available promptly. If it returns in the Additional Estimates it will not be available until perhaps May of next year. Secondly, there should be formal consultation by the Presiding Officers with the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, Senator Harradine and Government back benchers before decisions are made, firstly, about the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian, secondly, about the amalgamation of the Joint House Department, Hansard, and the Parliamentary Library and, thirdly, about the appointment of a person to head such an amalgamated department. We are saying that members of parliament should be consulted about those issues because they are issues which go to the heart and integrity of the capacity of members of parliament to perform their work effectively, intelligently and well. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing chaired by Senator Jessop. The Jessop report, as it is now coming to be called, made it clear that the five parliamentary departments should not be regarded as an ordinary annual service of the Government. It therefore follows that staffing of those departments should be under the control of the Presiding Officers and the committees proposed in Senator Jessop's report. In view of the fact that three vital staff positions currently are under threat and two of the unions concerned have taken a strong stand on this matter, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a Press release by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and the Professional Officers Association relating to this issue. </PARA>

<PARA> Both unions said that the Public Service Board had told the Parliamentary Library management to show cause why it should not lose three staff positions. Areas where staff could be lost included Science Information and Research and Economics Research. ''To reduce the capacity of the Parliamentary Library's Information and Research Services for Science, Economics or indeed any other field of close interest to Parliament will simply mean that backbench MPs, whatever their party affiliation, will not have available the same high quality responses in future as they have had from the Library in the past.''</PARA>
<PARA> The unions pointed out that the final decision on the Library's staffing would be made not inside Parliament but by a Committee of Government Ministers. ''This represents unwarranted Executive interference in the internal affairs of the Parliament, and is inconsistent with the recent Report of a Senate Select Committee on Parliament's staffing and funding.'' The Ministers who make the decision will not suffer as a consequence, but all backbench MPs, regardless of party, would receive reduced services if the cuts were allowed to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said earlier that last Saturday the national newspapers carried an advertisement for a new Parliamentary Librarian. That raises some matters of concern. Firstly, the firm that has been chosen to assist in the selection of the new Parliamentary Librarian is Urwick International Pty Ltd. This is the company which surveyed the Library services and presented a report on the operation of the Library which has not been made available either to the Parliamentary Library Committee or to any individual members of Parliament. It is a secret document as far as the Library is concerned. One wonders what was in that report and why it has not been made available to parliamentarians. Urwick International conducted a management review of the three service departments-the Parliamentary Library, Hansard and the Joint House Department. As I said, the report has never been released. So one wonders why that report has not been released-so much for the commitment to freedom of information about our daily own activities-and why that firm was chosen to carry out the selection on the basis of a report which it conducted and the results of which have never been made known to the clients of the Parliamentary Library-Federal members of parliament. When, one might ask, is its report on the three service departments to be released?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a puzzling feature of the advertisement in respect of the apparent listing of priorities. In setting out the demands of the job, four main points are made. The fourth and last point made in relation to the Parliamentary Librarian is 'liaison with senators and members'. We would like an assurance that the listing I have suggested does not in fact represent the priorities of the Librarian as the Presiding Officers see them. If it does, it would suggest that the needs of private members of the Parliament are to be totally subservient to broadly administrative functions. Indeed, if the fourth function is to be liaison with senators and members, why are senators and members denied any say whatsoever in who will be selected for the position of Parliamentary Librarian. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 October the leaders and deputy leaders of the parliamentary Labor Party in both Houses wrote to the Speaker and to you, Mr President, about developments concerning the Parliamentary Library. As far as I am aware no reply has yet been made to that letter. I think honourable senators will know that that letter was written after Labor Party members had resigned from the parliamentary Library Committee because the Committee seemed to have no purpose in the way in which it was being administered at the present time. I would like to take this opportunity to ask whether you, Mr President, will be in a position shortly to answer the points made in that letter. The points were that the Parliamentary Library Committee should be given specific terms of reference and formally involved in the consultative processes which lead up to the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian by the Presiding Officers. That letter, of course, also advised of the resignation of Australian Labor Party members from the parliamentary Library Committee. This was not a matter which was in any sense dictated by any party whim but was a result of sheer frustration of those members of the parliamentary Committee who were not even informed, let alone consulted, about important decisions in relation to the Library. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jessop Committee-the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing-made a recommendation that each House should establish a committee to examine budgetary and staffing proposals. That Committee also believes that each House should have a separate appropriation Bill so that Parliament can finally have some say in the financial allocations needed to give members and senators the facilities they need to carry out their jobs effectively. </PARA>

It would provide also a salutary warning to the Executive that members of parliament are becoming less prepared to surrender their rights and that, as the Jessop Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing said, they now seek to 'regain or assert greater independence and autonomy'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In their internal arrangements of this Parliament and in the day to day work of members of parliament, there can be no more important institution in the interest of the members whom it ought to serve, having regard to the requirement and the need for greater independence and autonomy of members, than a proper and correctly functioning Parliamentary Library. That is why this motion is brought before the Senate tonight. I commend the motion. I ask you, Mr President, in particular, to be very mindful of the terms of the motion and, in so doing, convey to your colleague, Mr Speaker, and, if you have a Parliamentary Library left, convey to it the views which have been expressed on this matter. It is of the utmost concern. We wanted the views to be expressed before the Parliament breaks for the recess. If the views, having been expressed, are not taken into account, there will be a lot of very disappointed people and the issue which we have raised tonight will be pursued in the autumn session of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I wish to comment very briefly on what has been put forward by Senator Button. Senator Button, in support in his motion, indicated firstly that the Library Committee ought to have terms of reference and pursuant to those terms of reference ought to be in a position to move substantive motions. Secondly, he is concerned that the Parliamentary Library is not being consulted in respect of the appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian and, furthermore, is not being consulted in respect of the whole rearrangement that is contemplated for the Library, presumably involving at least part of the operations or personnel of the Library going into other departments or into one big department. Finally, Senator Button is concerned about the cuts in library funding. Quite obviously, I, too, am concerned with the amount of funding that has been provided for Parliamentary Library services at this time. Incidentally, I am also concerned with the amount of funding being provided to general library services for the public in the various States. Surely that goes without saying. I endorse what Senator Button has said about funding. Surely it is a matter about which we, as a parliament, have a right to express an opinion. I hope that the Government takes this expression seriously. I know, Mr President, that you and Mr Speaker would also be concerned about funding of the Library.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was sorry to see that Senator Button referred to two persons to amplify his point of view. I note that he specifically did not impugn the integrity or capacity of either of those persons. However, one could have been left with the impression that the appointments may not have been in the best interests of the Library. I am a great user of the Library and I have the greatest admiration for the work that is performed by its staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I believe that there is an overriding problem. It involves the question of where the Library services are going. Senator Button referred to the proposition that was put to a House of Representatives Estimates committee on 8 September-a proposition that really has not been canvassed well by the Parliamentary Library Committee-namely, that there should be some amalgamation of the functions of the Joint House Department, Hansard and the Library. Senator Button expressed some concern about that matter. I go further; I believe quite strongly that the efficiency of the Parliamentary Library and its information and research services can best be secured by maintaining it as a department administered separately from other parliamentary departments. I feel that unless we get some sort of assurance that the proposition that was canvassed before the House of Representatives Estimates committee will not be steamrolled through without our having a say in the matter, the Senate ought to grasp the nettle and pass a resolution declaring that it is its opinion that the efficiency of the Parliamentary Library services would best be secured by maintaining the Library as a separate department administered separately from other departments. </PARA>

If we do not get the Urwick report we can express an opinion on the information that is available to us. I am prepared, as a former member of the Tasmanian Library Board of many years standing and as a chairman of the Derwent Regional Library Advisory Committee, to say on my experience that the efficiency of library services is best served if libraries are autonomous and not linked to some sort of administrative structure outside those library services. That is the only way that I can express my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian. As I understand the situation it is not as quite as clear-cut as Senator Button put it. As I understand Senator Button-I may be wrong; I apologise if I am-he indicated that the appointment would be made by Urwick International Pty Ltd. It is my understanding that the committee to recommend to the Presiding Officers an appointment to the position of Parliamentary Librarian will consist of the Presiding Officers, a representative from Urwick, a representative from the Public Service Board and a representative from the National Library. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. In that sense I would be political. One could say that the President and the Speaker are political persons; they are politicians. Nevertheless they are charged under the Public Service Act with that responsibility. The Act provides for the responsibility to rest on their shoulders. I have no quarrel with what is being proposed by them; that is to say, they have sought and obtained the professional advice of the National Library, the Public Service Board and Urwick. I have a question mark about Urwick's involvement. Nevertheless, I believe that the Presiding Officers have there a committee which is professionally qualified to examine the credentials of persons seeking appointment as Parliamentary Librarian. I would hate to see a situation arise in which a committee, even the Parliamentary Library Committee or half of the members of that Committee, could blackball a person and say that they do not think a person ought to be appointed although on the best professional advice available that person is best qualified and best suited for the position. In such a situation there would be internal conflict which would seep right through the Parliamentary Library service and turn it into a political tool. I agree that by far the overriding consideration is the fact that we are not being consulted about where the Parliamentary Library is going, where the service is going. We have the right to be consulted in respect of those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now make a suggestion as to what ought to happen to Senator Button's motion, which reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Senate is of the opinion that the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee should be given specific terms of reference, including the power to pass substantive resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I see nothing wrong with that except that it does not say who is to give the specific terms of reference to the Parliamentary Library Committee. Will it be the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives? If so, perhaps we are back to where we started. Instead of the words 'should be given specific terms of reference', we probably ought to have the words 'should adopt specific terms of reference, including the power to pass substantive resolutions'. For the reasons I have stated, I would oppose paragraph (2) of the motion and seek to substitute these words: 'That the Senate is of the opinion that the efficiency of the Parliamentary Library and its information and research services can best be secured by maintaining them as a department administered separately from other parliamentary departments'. I put forward those suggestions in the hope that the first part will give to Senator Button what he and his colleagues really desire from their point of view, bearing in mind that the substantive motions ought to be in accordance with such terms of reference. I believe that if the Senate agrees to the second--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like briefly to take the time of the Senate to speak about the operations of Medibank Private as revealed in its annual report, which was presented at the end of last week. This report is a record of a better financial performance than was recorded in the previous year, 1979-80. There are still some worrying deficiencies apparent in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First I raise the matter of management expenses. Whilst management expenses show only a modest increase that is less than the rate of inflation for the year under discussion, 1980-81, they still appear to be considerably above those for the private funds. The reason advanced for this is that because of a Public Service Board ruling Medibank Private has to pay higher salaries than its competitors in the private field. That simply is not a tenable argument. Medibank Private cannot have it both ways. It cannot be divorced from the Government and maintain that it is a statutory authority completely independent, competing in a commercial world, and still be bound by irrelevant overhead requirements by a government body. One must also have grave reservations about the lavishness of style of Medibank Private, its office accommodation, the expensive paraphernalia of logos, et cetera, and recently the promotion of golf championships and sporting events of that nature. One does not see that sort of activity coming from private funds which husband their resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I am concerned about is profitability. Although health funds are not profit-making ventures, they must avoid trading at a loss and must have adequate provision for reserves. That implies some degree of profitability in their trading. As I said in my introductory statement, the national position of Medibank Private with respect to profitability is a considerable improvement on the previous year. Page 15 of the report shows a surplus of $9.784m for 1980-81 as compared with $2.351m for 1979-80. When one probes the operating results insofar as the sparse data in the report allows, one must ask some questions. Why has there been a decline from $10.247m in 1979-80 to only $3.55m in 1980-81 in the operation of the medical benefits fund? At the same time, there has been a dramatic reversal in the hospital benefits fund from a loss of $7.896m in 1979-80 to a profit of $6.198m in 1980-81. No explanation is apparent from the report for this great variation in managerial performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the medical benefits fund, I ask: Why has the fund gone from one unprofitable State, namely Tasmania, in 1979-80, to three, namely Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, in 1980-81? It is for management to take the appropriate steps at the relevant time to prevent this loss situation from developing. One is left with the conclusion that the non-commercial ethos of the Public Service is manifest in yet another operation. I have a particular concern about my own State of Queensland, where a profit situation last year in the medical funds became a loss this year and where the loss situation in the hospital benefits fund in 1979-80 was still a loss, albeit reduced, in 1980-81. Turning to the matter of reserves, honourable senators will recall that in 1978 the Commonwealth made a gift of $21m to Medibank Private. On page 29 of the report a notional allocation of this $21m is made to the 12 hospital and medical funds in the six States. This shows that $10.825m has been allocated to Queensland, over half the $21m. Queensland is a State which has roughly 15 per cent of the national turnover of Medibank Private. Presumably also this allocation provides some investment income to the Queensland division, which income would be offset against its losses and thereby reduce them. </PARA>
<PARA> Reserves are important for health funds. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) in the House of Representatives Estimates committee hearings on 10 September said that there were two standards of reserves required for health funds. He emphasised that he was speaking in a broad way, not in a specific way. But large funds such as Medibank Private are required to have roughly two months reserves, while the smaller funds have a four months reserve requirement. Medibank Private has paid benefits, both medical and hospital, of $226.771m in 1980-81. If that is computed on a two-monthly basis the figure is roughly $38m which is the figure it should have for reserves. Yet the reserves shown in the report are only $19.6m for 1980-81, roughly half what the Minister said should be required. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to take the time of the Senate any longer in developing the details of this argument but I do not view the performance of Medibank Private-while conceding that it is considerably better this year than it was last year-as being satisfactory when one looks at the length of time that Medibank Private has been in existence and the very great advantage, as evidenced by the $21m gift of the Commonwealth to name one example, it has enjoyed. Finally, I can see no place for Medibank Private in a Liberal government. It does nothing. It provides no service that cannot be provided by the private sector. Those services it does supply can quite obviously be more economically supplied by the private sector. I cannot understand how the Committee which undertook the Review of Commonwealth Functions ever allowed it to remain as a statutory authority. As this year's report is better than last year's report, perhaps the Government should review its position and divest itself of this body. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight on the subject of the motor vehicle industry and tariffs. I am doing so on the adjournment because of the decision that is anticipated to come down from the Government during the recess on that subject and its importance to South Australia, together with the fact that this is likely to be the only opportunity that I will have to address the subject. The logical starting point to any discussion of government assistance to the motor vehicle industry is the Industries Assistance Commission draft report on post-1984 assistance. The report is that of an independent commission with a great deal of expertise. The findings are based on submissions made by all major parties to the debate and its own research. Prima facie it therefore must be treated with respect. I deplore those elements within the industry which call for the Commission to be disbanded simply because it is reaching conclusions inconsistent with their views. The input of objectivity provided by the Commission is immensely valuable to a highly complex subject and must be preserved. It must, however, be remembered that the brief of the Commission is limited. It reports to its terms of reference. Other factors may well have to be taken into account in consideration of the implementation of its recommendations. Such factors as social consequence, which the Commission is unable to quantify, require political judgment. Implementation would require a change in political philosophy from that under which the motor vehicle industry in Australia has developed to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major findings of the Commission that are of particular importance I will summarise as follows: Firstly, the industry is one of Australia's highest cost activities, receiving three to four times the assistance afforded to manufacturing industry generally. Put at a sum in excess of $1 billion per year, assistance is estimated to have roughly doubled in the last five years. Secondly, despite such massive community support, competitiveness and employment have declined. Thirdly, the lack of competitiveness is largely due to low volumes of component production and vehicle assembly in Australia compared with overseas operators. Consequently, there has been limited exploitation of the benefits of economies of scale, specialisation and attendant advanced technology. Fourthly, the size and shape of the local industry shall be determined mainly by marketplace preference and international comparative advantage rather than by high levels and complex forms of assistance. Fifthly, it is inevitable that such adjustment would have adverse effects on existing employment and investment in some sections of the industry but there would be gains to the community generally through lower vehicle prices and improved efficiency of resource use. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of such findings the IAC recommended gradual reduction of protection so that by 1990 the level would be similar to that afforded in the early 1970s. It would still be high, giving the Australian produced product a 35 per cent cost advantage, but it would be more in line with that available to manufacturing industry generally. Specifically, the three recommendations that I consider to be of the greatest importance are as follows: Firstly, that the quotas or market share requirements which guarantee the Australian car industry 80 per cent of the total market, subject to no test of efficiency, be cut out in 1985. Secondly, that to provide extra cushioning for that change, tariffs on imported cars and knocked down vehicle parts be increased to 60 per cent in 1985 but that they then be gradually reduced to 35 per cent by 1990. Thirdly, that the export facilitation scheme, which commences in 1982, be modified so that vehicle manufacturers would be able to import 10 per cent of parts duty free and a further 7.5 per cent subject to export performance. Component producers would be entitled to duty free by-law credits on the basis of export performance to the extent of 20 per cent. The real crux of the report is summarised at page 10 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is already evident, from labour shedding and losses of existing investments, that maintaining the status quo cannot avoid disruptions. The longer the local industry is assisted to delay confrontation with its poor competitive and structural position, the more likely it is that the industries of other countries will adjust to changing market circumstances and become more competitive relative to Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The IAC report and the whole debate on protection in relation to the motor vehicle industry must be put in the context of the immensely important role that the industry currently plays in the Australian community. Clearly, it is the core of Australia's manufacturing industry. In 1979-80 it accounted for approximately 7 per cent of all manufacturing employment in the country-about 80,000 employees. It also represented approximately 10 per cent of total manufacturing investment or about $250m of investment in that year. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is argued that a reduction in protection will result in better resource use and therefore new employment opportunities, it must nevertheless be accepted that in any major restructuring proposal a great deal of employment is at risk. Furthermore, when assessing the risk factor it is worth noting that the motor vehicle manufacturing centres in Australia are not widely distributed. South Australia and Victoria together contain 90 per cent of the motor vehicle manufacturing presence in Australia. From South Australia's point of view, about 18,000 people are directly employed in vehicle making and about 94 component-making businesses employ another 12,000 people whose employment is dependent upon the industry. Therefore, while employment opportunities may improve elsewhere because of better resource allocation, South Australia and Victoria could face massive unemployment problems. Furthermore, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures based on the 1976 census show that 64 per cent of those employed in the car manufacturing sector are overseas born. Of those, 75 per cent have no technical or trade qualifications. Some 66 per cent of the Australian-born work-force employed in this sector has no trade or technical qualification. Alternative employment for this section of the community could not easily be found, even with better resource allocation. Thus the risk factor for South Australian employment is extremely high and explains the somewhat emotive terms in which the debate has been pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the industry to other areas of production similarly is not to be underestimated. There is little doubt that the motor vehicle industry plays a most significant role in the economy as a major consumer of materials such as steel, plastics, rubber, glass, textiles and paint. Furthermore, although Australians may be technically innovative, a nation with little manufacturing industry has no incentive to develop new skills and technical knowledge. Thus the risks if Australia ceases to have a motor vehicle manufacturing capacity are considerable and must weigh heavily on the mind of government. It is clear that we can now produce vehicles in competition on the open market with Japan. It is therefore argued that we should be importing more vehicles and exporting to their countries of origin that which we more efficiently produce. However, this assumes an international free market which simply does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> All motor manufacturing countries have restrictions on imports. Thus, notwithstanding what may be correct economic theory regarding the benefits of competition and efficiency, the reality of the world motor industry is that protection of local vehicle manufacturers is the norm rather than the exception. Such restrictions take different forms. They may take the form of explicit market sharing agreements such as those of France which limits the Japanese share of its car market to 3 per cent, or of Italy, which restricts Japanese car imports to only 2,000 vehicles a year; implicit market sharing agreements such as that imposed by the United States of America; monetary policies such as that of Japan; environmental factors such as in France; or high tariffs such as in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, which have duty regimes for imported vehicles ranging from 85 per cent to 205 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not intended to justify the present level of protection afforded the Australian industry but merely to make the point that changes in the assistance package will be made in a less than competitive world. In actual fact, according to evidence submitted last year to the trade sub-committee-of the powerful Ways and Means Committee of the United States Senate, Australia is second only to the United States in the share of the market allowed for Japanese vehicles. The Japanese share of the Australian market was 15.2 per cent and of the American market 16.6 per cent. Thus in overall protection we are not particularly out of step but rather more generous to imports than are some countries. Furthermore, and particularly important, it should never be forgotten that Japan's industry has grown rapidly and effectively in the shelter of a highly protected environment. That, I believe, gives a hint of the answer to Australia's problems. </PARA>
<PARA> To analyse the situation further one must ask why substantial Government support is necessary even to retain the status quo within the Australian industry. Primarily, small production runs have prevented Australian manufacturers achieving economies of scale. We have eight passenger vehicle manufacturers producing 19 basic models for a relatively small domestic market of from 450,000 to 475,000 new cars a year. The combined United States of America-Japan annual production run of 18 million cars a year indicates the degree of the disability experienced by the Australian motor vehicle industry. In that production environment our competitive position has worsened, with a slow down in market expansion due principally to a decline in world economic activity and rising oil prices. The shift in world demand away from Australia's traditional larger six and eight cylinder passenger vehicles has meant huge costs in redesign and new tooling. Increased oil prices have required a new technology range of cars, again requiring massive capital expenditure. Therefore, the trend has been towards fewer producers and a sharing of components; thus the concept known as the 'world car' has developed. Those with aggressive marketing policies and a willingness to adopt new technologies have become the market leaders. In national terms, that is Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> In such a scenario there is no way that the Australian motor vehicle industry can sit back and rely on domestic markets without continuing to impose an ever-increasing assistance burden on the Australian community. This means that unless Australia is prepared to pay that price the notion of a totally Australian designed and manufactured vehicle for the domestic market must become history. The only way that notion could be sustained would be through major export activity which, given the lack of free trade and the lag we would have to make up in technology and capital, is practically impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is an answer. Australia has advantages. We have a highly educated population, an abundance of raw material and cheap power. Furthermore, the economic strengths that have allowed Australia to withstand the cost of current protection can equally enable it to cushion change. Production of export volume levels of cars in Australia may be impossible, but there are components which Australia can produce effectively and economically for the world market. Therefore, change must be to the benefit of those who are able to produce an internationally competitive product and thus gain the economies of scale available from long production runs. Those who are prepared to do that must be given an incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer lies in the principle of export facilitation. Export facilitition gives credits for exports by allowing a given level of tariff-free imports equivalent in dollar value to goods exported. For those, such as some component manufacturers who are unable to benefit from tariff free imports, it gives an opportunity to transfer the credit and thus gain an advantage. It is obvious, however, that export facilitation will work only if quotas are kept tight and tariffs high; in other words, there must be an inbuilt benefit to exporters within the protection system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term the object must be the abolition of quotas or market sharing, which is an undesirable means of protection because it fails to reward or even to encourage efficiency. Tariffs, a more equitable form of protection than quotas, must be reduced to a level more equivalent to tariff protection given to other manufacturing sectors. Current rates of protection, perhaps with the exception of only a gradual reduction of tariffs which would provide some greater competitive pressure, must be the cushion to allow export facilitation to play its role. However, that reduction must be sufficiently gradual not to detract from the inducement of export facilitation. Survival in an ultimately non-quota lower tariff environment must be the penalty for those not prepared to grasp the nettle. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that quotas will be dropped after a reasonable period-say, 10 years from the commencement of export facilitation-places a massive political burden on a government for an opposition will seize the short term electoral advantage of offering a reversal of that decision. Nevertheless, it appears to me that there is no alternative. Even within the present scheme there is need for reform of the quota system and for export facilitation. Quotas now are simply a financial gift. The Deutsche mark has devalued against the Australian dollar by 12.8 per cent over the last year, but the price of Mercedes-Benz cars does not appear to have come down. Why should not the Australian manufacturer who is prepared to rationalise and specialise to fewer lines with export potential have an import quota to balance his stock range? Why should not a greater percentage of quotas be auctioned so that at least that revenue can contribute something towards the cost of protection?</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, export facilitation as presently structured should be re-examined because of its dollar for dollar basis and the fact that some Japanese components are two to five times cheaper than the locally made product. It may be that, as submitted by one party to the Commission, 7.5 per cent of imports will be sufficient to displace 21 per cent of local manufacture. If that is so, the scheme as presently structured has the potential to destroy a large part of the component industry without that industry having time to restructure. Furthermore, before quotas are dropped Australia's dumping laws should be re-examined and their effectiveness re-assessed. The Australian industry can regain its lost competitiveness provided it is given time to do so. But there must be both pressures in that direction and rewards for those prepared to meet the challenge. In other words, assistance must be directed towards the long term goal of greater efficiency. A more efficient and export orientated vehicle and component sector which is able to benefit from economies of scale will require less and less government financial support. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the picture is not all gloom. There are encouraging signs. Already Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd can claim that in 1976 the Chrysler plant was averaging 69 man hours to make a car. That figure is now 23 hours. Improved management, vehicle design and tooling techniques have led to increased efficiency. The company can further boast that in the 30 months to June 1981, although the consumer price index went up 26 per cent, Sigma car price rises were kept to 17 per cent. The industry can show over $1 billion having recently been or to be spent on capital investment. For example, the Ford company has in train $300m five-year investment program. The new four-cylinder engine plant of General Motors-Holden's Ltd at Fisherman's Bend has cost $300m. Thus, the Australian industry is showing a commitment in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of exports there are also pleasing examples of what can be achieved. Girlock has recently won a $100m contract to supply Australian designed brake units for a United States luxury car. GKN Sanky-Benson currently exports wheel rims to Japan. With the benefit of export facilitation, GMH will now produce 300,000 engines, of which 240,000 will be exported. These are examples that show that Australia can become competitive on world markets. What the industry needs is the firm, consistent and realistic hand of government. The industry should be allowed the benefits of export facilitation with the understanding that current levels of artificial protection will ultimately not last. Let us look to alternative incentives such as improved depreciation provisions, grants for industrial research for worthwhile projects and technical aid. Let us head towards an industry which will be efficient by world standards and able to provide security and the rewards of worthwhile employment whilst at the same time enabling growth in other areas that a more efficient redistribution of resources will allow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond very briefly to Senator Hill's remarks in connection with the motor vehicle industry. It is significant that Senator Hill represents the great State of South Australia and is prepared to put down the views which are very significantly identified with those of interests in his State. Indeed, he does his State a service by bringing these matters to our attention tonight. The questions which he raised are the subject of very great detail and of very great debate not only within the community but also within the Government. Of course, as he has pointed out, they will come to a final decision in the next few weeks. The arguments which the honourable senator has put forward have been tempered with a degree of pragmatism especially with regard to the export facilitation program. The Government will certainly be considering those points during the debate on this issue. I thank Senator Hill for his remarks and, of course, will carry forward his comments to the Government as appropriate during this discussion process.</PARA></TALK.START>
