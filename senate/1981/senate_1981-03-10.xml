<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the simplest answer would be to refer Senator Grimes to the printed administrative arrangements orders which set out quite clearly the dichotomy. As far as individual matters are concerned, national development in the obvious sense is concerned with the location and identification of the particular resources in Australia, the establishment of economic reserves, the desirable levels of conservation, the establishment of feasibility studies and pilot plant developments. Clearly, when the fully commercial stage of a resource for trade is reached the responsibility passes to other departments, as the administrative orders show. The National Energy Office of my Department has very specific administrative orders, and I draw the attention of honourable senators to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to uranium, general feasibility studies, such as on uranium enrichment, are covered by my Department. The Australian Safeguards Office in my Department is responsible for the auditing of nuclear safeguards. As far as coal is concerned, the actual sale of coal is basically a trade matter. However, once a policy is determined, the development of coal liquefaction and oil shale liquefaction, being an energy matter, is essentially and primarily one for my Department. Inevitably, overlapping between departments does occur-between my Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce in some cases and between my Department and the Department of Trade and Resources in others. I draw the attention of the honourable senator to the administrative orders.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the importance of the poppy industry to Tasmania, has the Government yet received any indication from the Government of the United States of America or its agencies of that Government's deliberations concerning the purchase of Tasmanian-grown alkaloids? Have the United States hearings been concluded? Have recommendations been made to Congress? Have there been any recent consultations with our Washington Embassy on the matter?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the interest of honourable senators from Tasmania in this matter. My advice is that the Government is well aware of the importance of the poppy industry to the Tasmanian economy, and provided advice and support to the Tasmanian Government when it appeared before the public hearing on opiates import policy in the United States of America last September. The administrative law judge who presided at that hearing handed down his report in January. He recommended that the most reasonable solution would be for a ratio of import quotas to be established between Turkey and India, on the one hand, and other exporting countries which maintain adequate controls, including Australia, on the other. The judge further recommended that allocation of quotas should be based upon world market shares during a recent representative period. The judge's finding is advisory to the United States Government and not binding. However, if adopted, it offers the prospect of access for Australian opiates to the United States market. No decision by the United States Government is expected until after the expiry of the 60-day freeze on new administrative rules, which was ordered by President Reagan on 29 January. This matter will be kept under constant notice by the Australian Government, and we will continue to press for Australian access to the United States market. If the honourable senator seeks further information he might indicate it to me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy and follows on somewhat the question asked by Senator Grimes. Does the Minister see his Department as having a major role in formulating economic policy, specifically as it relates to mineral development? Is the Minister seriously saying that there are no interdepartmental demarcation problems between the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Resources and his Department? Further, is it not true that the staff of the Department of National Development and Energy has been reduced by between 60 and 80 personnel while the Department of Trade and Resources has had an increase in staff?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of the matter is that a department such as the one for which I have responsibility has a wide economic role and a recommending role and inevitably those roles would overlap the roles of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Resources, the Department of Industry and Commerce and other departments. The question of the optimum usage of resources, their development and the development of energy in quantity and quality not only is a significant role for my Department but also must be shared in its activities by the Treasury and other departments. I repeat that from time to time there are matters which would involve questions of demarcation. Nevertheless, I do not find it difficult to pursue the role as laid down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt referred to the staff numbers in the Department. I do not have details of the precise numbers and the movements in recent months, but there has been a significant increase in the number of staff in the National Energy Office. I should have thought, therefore, that the trend would not have been as Senator Gietzelt indicated. I will obtain the figures and let him know.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to an open letter from East-West Airlines (Operations) Ltd, dated 5 March 1981, which I understand was sent to all parliamentarians and which states that the new two-airline agreement disadvantages third level commuter airlines on low to medium traffic routes throughout Australia. The letter points out that the new agreement attempts to tie down the commuter airlines to a limited and possibly declining list of approved routes and to a limited choice of imported aircraft which the commuter airlines consider not to be a fair deal for the future of the industry in Australia. Has the Minister seen the letter to which I have referred? If so, does the Minister consider that the points raised by East-West Airlines are indeed the present case? If this is true, will the Minister reconsider the new two-airline agreement with a view to allowing smaller airlines to operate with fewer restrictions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that East-West Airlines has sent an open letter to all members of parliament and I understand that it addresses East-West's position as a second level regional operator rather than the position of commuter airlines, as suggested in Senator Thomas's question. In fact, commuter operators have made little adverse comment on the two-airline agreement. Their views generally have been in overwhelming support of the improved opportunities which the new agreement provides for them. I understand that the letter also addresses the question of East-West's inability to continue to service the Sydney-Alice Springs route and seeks to attribute the blame to the existing two-airline policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The points made by East-West are inaccurate. The company is well aware that the only limitation imposed on it in respect of aircraft choice is that the aircraft suits the network over which it operates. East-West currently has approval in principle to import F28 jet aircraft for its network. The new agreement facilitates the importation of those aircraft. East-West, in its interpretation of the two-airline agreement, ignores the extent of the network it can develop, which includes all intrastate and intra-Territory services as well as services from regional centres to any other place in Australia. The only real limits placed on East-West under the new agreement are in regard to the trunk routes presently operated by Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy and concerns the apparent need for some national standards for the transport of nuclear materials in Australia. On 4 December last a shipping container labelled 'Gulf Oil Corporation-Property of Gulf Nuclear, Webster, Texas' was split open after a semi-trailer accident near Port Macquarie, revealing a 60-litre drum marked 'Americium 241' and some smaller containers marked 'Caesium 137'. It is alleged that two New South Wales policemen have suffered unusual illnesses after handling the drum, which was also said to have been split open. I ask: What overall supervision is kept over the transport of nuclear materials within Australia? Is a register kept of nuclear materials imported so that their identity and degree of risk can be readily established and notified in the case of an accident?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="411" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would take a very lengthy answer to deal fully with all the questions asked because there is a wide range of nuclear materials of varying radioactivity. Senator Mason will appreciate that most of the nuclear materials moved around are of relatively low radioactivity and are for medical or industrial usage. Therefore, of course, there are different specifications for nuclear materials. The various States, as well as the Commonwealth, impose very strong health rules. I describe the situation as complex because State health laws apply to certain of the types of nuclear materials and it would be necessary for me to seek the particularities of those laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that the Commonwealth seeks a minimum uniformity of standards throughout the whole of Australia. In general terms, the Commonwealth is interested in the handling, particularly the interstate handling, of radioactive materials. The Commonwealth has a total interest once the material leaves Australian shores and a tracking interest for the whole of the lifetime of these materials. Although I recall the Port Macquarie incident, at this moment I do not recall the details. I will seek the actual details of the incident and in doing so I will then provide in general terms for Senator Mason the details of the safeguards that apply. I fancy that many of them would be State laws concerned with packaging and handling. I will look at the question and let the honourable senator have further information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I ask: Has the Government seen the extraordinary spontaneous support for anti-strike rallies? Is this support understandable in view of the fact that many strikes are deliberately intended to hurt the community as a means of gaining financial advantage for union members-behaviour that would not be tolerated from any other section of the community? Although these rallies, of course, of themselves will not do anything to improve our industrial relations, does the Minister see hope of something constructive emerging from them by encouraging the silent majority of union members to participate more in union affairs, thus getting rid of trouble making militant unions, and perhaps by making the union movement, as a whole, recognise that the day is long past when inter-union solidarity was needed in order to survive and that what is needed now is more solidarity with the community of which unions are a privileged part?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself somewhat surprised that the Opposition should be opposed to any form of rally. In fact, the Opposition and its spokesmen have been the most vocal proponents and, indeed, instigators of such rallies. For example, I think Mr Hawke was a keen instigator and proponent of the Medibank rally and, indeed, of a rally, some time ago, against the Budget. The question of rallies ought to find a common support on both sides of the Parliament as a means of individuals expressing their freedom of belief and their right to do so. Therefore, one would have been surprised yesterday to have heard that Labor Party members saw as divisive rallies which did not suit them but those rallies which did suit them they saw as greatly important democratic expressions. I come to the fundamentals of this situation. I and the Government observed that yesterday there were spontaneous rallies following the rally in New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, yesterday in Sydney a portion of the travelling public was inconvenienced by yet another strike. The Qantas Airways Ltd strike showed what the people of Australia think. I believe we owe a great debt of gratitude to the people who inspired those rallies and to those who came forward.

<PARA> As to the reasons why the Minister for Defence is taking a particular action, that is a matter on which the Minister himself will answer. But in general terms Ministers should be responsible for and answerable to the Parliament for Government policy. Public servants provide factual information on administration and are answerable to their Ministers for their administration. This was made quite clear in 'Guidelines for Official Witnesses Appearing Before Parliamentary Committees', which was tabled in the other place by the Government on 28 September 1978. The Public Service Board's 'Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants' also deals with public comment by public servants. I think a standard procedure is laid down, which distinguishes policy from fact. I think that is well understood. If there is any further information that I can give, I will seek it out for the honourable senator.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister relates to the new federalism policy. The Minister will be aware of the proposal of the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, to levy a new tax on the Nabalco partners operating the Gove bauxite mine and that he reportedly described the tax as taking a percentage of the company's profits calculated in terms of a formula that was fair to everyone concerned. I ask: Is it part of the federalism policy of the national Government to allow State or Territory governments to levy a company tax additional to that levied by the Commonwealth in the same way as it proposes to allow room for such governments to levy personal income tax additional to that levied by the Commonwealth?</PARA></TALK.START>

It was directed to the Prime Minister in respect of the new federalism policy which has had its strongest proponent in the Parliament in the person of Senator Carrick. I repeat the substance of the question: Under the new federalism policy is there room for State or Territory governments to levy a company tax additional to that levied by the Commonwealth and parallel to the often-spoken of proposed ability of the States to levy personal income tax additional to that levied by the Commonwealth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this moment, the federalism policy has very clear definitions. It is based upon the States receiving some 39.87 per cent of the revenue raised as personal income tax by the Commonwealth. The States are able to apply either a rebate or a surcharge to that. They are able to raise a wide range of indirect taxes. I repeat that I am not aware of the technical or other capacity of the States to levy company tax.

When the Minister carries out the investigation requested by Senator Mason will he find out what is the role of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission at Lucas Heights whenever accidents involving radioactive materials occur?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a fairly lengthy reply to Senator Mason, I indicated that the daily handling of radioactive materials, particularly for medical or industrial purposes, is essentially and predominantly a matter for the States and State laws. I say that without seeking to resile at all from the overall responsibilities of the Commonwealth. I did say that I would seek to obtain information for Senator Mason as to that accident. Indeed, there have been several of these accidents. At Mascot airport a container of radioactive materials-medical isotopes, I think-fell off the pallet of an aircraft-unloading vehicle and was run over. Those materials were dealt with very quickly by a combination of advice from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the State health authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware at all of any attempt by the police to get in touch with the Atomic Energy Commission. Basically I would have thought that the Port Macquarie situation would have been dealt with by the State health authorities. I will look at the matter to see whether, in fact, such a situation did arise. People are always on duty at the Atomic Energy Commission because, of course, the reactor is functioning 24 hours a day. On that basis there are always people on duty. I am not aware of any such matter. Senator O'Byrne indicated that there was food on the truck.

Does the report go on to show that, whilst in 1980 some 112 projects were judged worthy of support but in fact could not be funded, this number grew to 296 this year? Does this indicate that, despite commendable progress made in increasing research funds in areas such as medical research, energy research, industrial research and productivity grants, there is still a significant need for more money to be committed to research grants made through the ARGC mechanism?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the figures showing the number of grants and so forth cited by Senator Puplick. However, the position is that the Australian Research Grants Committee was established in 1965 to provide opportunities for first class work and to stimulate research. In 1978 the Australian Science and Technology Council reported on the basic scientific funding in Australia and recommended that funds be increased in real terms but that emphasis be given to excellence. I understand that that report of ASTEC has had some influence on the reduction in the number of grants referred to by Senator Puplick because the Committee has had regard to that special recommendation that emphasis be given to excellence in regard to ARGC grants. Furthermore, in recent years the Government has stimulated research in other fields, specifically through the Australian Marine Science and Technology Research Scheme and the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Scheme. There are other calls on government research funds in the scientific area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The five-year plan in the Northern Territory has been formulated by the Northern Territory Government and the Chief Minister for the Northern Territory and has not been the subject of any agreement between that Government and the Commonwealth Government. I think it is important for people to understand that it is not an agreed program of any kind. Having seen Mr Everingham's assertions and having read with interest the transcript of the debate, I have checked the appropriations made to the Northern Territory-the overall appropriations, the per capita appropriations and the appropriations made specifically from my Department for Aboriginal advancement programs. All the results show that the Northern Territory enjoys on a per capita basis among the highest rates of subvention in Australia, whether it is from my Department for its programs or whether it is subvention on an overall basis.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>. . . so if we take money away from education or health or police or roads or whatever which we are in fact doing to get to the fifteen million dollar level it means that those people in education or wherever are worse off . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Chief Minister was saying that in the end it comes down to a question of determining priorities and making choices. I understand the difficulties which he faces in doing this, but the financial agreement which was worked out between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory in 1978 was negotiated by Northern Territory Ministers who are presently working in the Territory. The situation which existed was then known to them. The arrangements made between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth were generous at that time. They made special allowance for the particular needs in the Northern Territory. I think that Mr Everingham is well aware of that fact. He did finally say in the debate yesterday that he might want to come back in pursuit of $70m to make requests for the funding of specific projects. I think that is an appropriate course for him to follow. We would want to examine any such proposals in the light of funding priorities and available resources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment to the 1979-80 annual report of the Australian Heritage Commission and, in particular, to that section relating to the protection of the National Estate. Is it correct, as alleged in the report, that a particular problem exists in the deployment of resources for conservation work within the Commonwealth Public Service? Is it also correct that cuts enforced by reduced staff numbers appear to have fallen disproportionately on heritage functions and that, as a result, parts of the National Estate are being affected adversely without the benefit of professional conservation advice? Does the Minister agree that, for the Commision to fulfil its statutory obligation of providing comments on proposals by Commonwealth agencies which may affect to a significant degree a place on the register of the National Estate as set out under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act, a considerable amount of research and conservation expertise is required? If so, what action will be taken by the Government to ensure that the Commission has the necessary staff and resources to enable it to deal effectively with matters referred to it under section 30 of the Act?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, concerns section 49 of the Repatriation Act and in particular the question of trust funds. The Minister will recall that on 3 December I drew to his attention public criticism of the amount of money which was reverting to the Commonwealth Government because of the failure to establish relatives' claims to those trust funds. I also pointed out the fact that the Commonwealth Ombudsman had submitted proposals to the Government and that a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs had promised a review of that section of the Act. I ask the Minister: What has become of those representations? Is the matter likely to be reported by him to the Parliament in the near future? Can he give the Senate some information as at today about those considerations?</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that governments world wide are seeing growth in cash transactions which escape reporting and taxation. The Treasurer advises me that, as is the case with other countries, the black economy in Australia is thought to be of significant proportions and, because of its nature, there is no satisfactory means of measuring either the size or the growth of this underground economy. The Government's policies seek to create the sort of economic climate which will discourage the dishonest in our society, particularly by controlling inflation and containing the growth in government taxation and expenditure and by reviewing reporting requirements by businesses. I will refer the remainder of Senator Watson's question to the Treasurer to see whether there is anything further he wishes to add to the information I have given.</PARA></TALK.START>

By way of preface I refer to a rejection by Senator Chaney of a suggestion to the effect that the Australian Government could be flexible in relation to a social security reciprocal agreement if the Italian Government were to withdraw its directive that it had a right to call up Australians for service in the Italian army. Bearing in mind that the Department of Foreign Affairs wants to do its own thing, and the fact that we have had ongoing negotiations with the Italian Government since Senator Willesee was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I ask the Minister: How close are we to getting the Italian Government to understand that, just as we objected to a callup for Vietnam, we are equally concerned about foreign governments claiming a military control over people born in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

At the same time I ask: Has the Minister seen today's Australian Financial Review article claiming that yesterday senior government officials confirmed that a recommendation to disband ADAB will shortly go before Federal Cabinet? Does this report, being so contrary to indications of the Prime Minister's and the Government's support for ADAB, indicate a campaign by some public servants against ADAB and against the continuing effectiveness and the extent of Australian overseas aid, matters about which so very many Australians continue to express so much concern?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have further information for Senator Hearn in relation to a question she asked on 5 March. I undertook to obtain information in respect of infant deaths in Tasmania, particularly those due to the sudden infant death syndrome. I also offered to obtain information about research funding in that State. I am advised that Tasmania does have the highest rate of infant deaths in Australia from the sudden infant death syndrome-a very unfortunate fact. The official figure is 4.13 deaths per 1,000 live births in Tasmania compared with an Australian average of 1.85 per 1,000 live births. It has been suggested to me by other sources that the higher Tasmanian rate may be due to just a couple of deaths which tend to make the figures move a lot. In addition, it is true that at 14.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, Tasmania is exceeded by only the Northern Territory in the overall infant mortality rate which Australia-wide is 12.2 deaths per 1,000 live births. It is apparent therefore that the enigma of sudden infant deaths is of particular significance to Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Research into the sudden infant death syndrome has been supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council for some years. It is important to recognise however that support for medical research is not given on a State basis but is awarded to those researchers who, after a careful and very equitable peer review process, have demonstrated the highest level of scientific merit. That is the sole basis on which the NHMRC recommends funding for medical research. It certainly does not preclude consideration of new areas of research; on the contrary, it ensures that all available research funding is directed to projects of the highest scientific quality. On the basis of scientific excellence, significant levels of funds have been provided for SIDS research; since 1976, $860,000 has been provided by the NHMRC for such research. This amount includes $280,000 provided this year alone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer further a question asked of me a few moments ago by Senator Missen. I have been able to obtain information to amplify the answer I gave him. The honourable senator queried some aspects of staff resources for conservation purposes in the Australian Public Service, quoting for his purpose from the last annual report of the Australian Heritage Commission. It would be fair to say that the range of disciplines associated with conservation work is not usually found in the normal administrative functions of government departments. It is usual for departments without such expertise to call on advice from specialised departments or from other agencies. I am sure that the Minister whom I represent would respect the view of the Commission that staff ceiling limits have affected performance of the Australian Heritage Commission functions but many other important areas throughout the Public Service also have been affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that this sort of comment concerning disproportionate cuts usually results from observation of one or two areas. In regard to resources required, I expect the Minister would agree that expertise in research and conservation is an essential element of the Commission's obligations under section 30 of the Act. I also notice in the annual report that the Commission is managing to provide constructive suggestions on methods for solving particular problems referred by Commonwealth agencies under section 30 of the Act. Staff and resources of the Commission have been maintained at a fair level commensurate with the Government's obligations to limit expansion of the public sector. I am happy to advise the honourable senator that I am informed that since the report was written a small increase in research staff has been allocated to the Commission. The Government has consistently stated that it maintains the principles behind the Heritage Commission and accepts its obligations to protect our heritage.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Human Rights Commission Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Commonwealth Human Rights Commission. The Commission will promote the observance of human rights throughout Australia within the limits of Commonwealth power. In co-operation with the States on human rights matters the Commission will assist the Government in discharging its international obligations in the cause of human rights. Our intention to introduce this legislation was foreshadowed in the Government's policy speech prior to the last election. The most recent attempt by this Government to have Parliament approve a human rights commission foundered because of a lack of agreement between the Senate and the other House on what became known as the Simon amendment, and was related to the rights of the child before as well as after birth. The Government has arrived at a formula, included in this Bill, which it believes will be acceptable to both those who voted for and those who voted against the amendments made by the other House. I shall return to this matter in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Human Rights Commission Bill 1979 was debated in the Senate, several events have transpired which only add to the need for effective human rights machinery in Australia. In August of last year, Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. To date 65 countries have become parties to this covenant, many of which have established their own special forms of machinery to promote and protect human rights. The measure now before us, and the Commission that would be established under it, will help Australia to discharge the obligations it has assumed under the covenant.</PARA>
<PARA> Last August, as well, the Government established the Human Rights Bureau as an interim measure pending creation of a human rights commission. Recently, the Bureau has begun to receive representations from the public in the form of complaints, requests for assistance, and requests for information in the general field of human rights. The Bureau has also made significant progress in establishing links with non-government organisations in the human rights field. It is apparent, however, that there is a need for more effective machinery to promote human rights in Australia than is available through the Bureau, and it is the object of the Bill to provide this machinery. The Commission will not be a large undertaking. Its emphasis will be on quality. Its annual cost is currently estimated at about $850,000, to which will be added the cost of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations-estimated at $350,000 in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The main provisions of the Bill are the same as those in the Bill approved by the Senate in November 1979. As such, they have already been the subject of considerable discussion and debate. I intend in this speech, therefore, to refer to and explain only those changes from the 1979 Bill that are found in the present measure. The only change of significance is that the charter of the Commission has been extended to three additional international instruments. As with the previous Bill, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will be the primary point of reference for the Commission. However, in response to the concern expressed by many members in both Houses during the debate on the Simon amendment about the rights of both children and handicapped persons, the Commission will also be required to have regard, in areas of Commonwealth responsibility, for the rights of these groups as recognised in three international declarations, each of which has been supported by Australia. The three declarations are the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959; the Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, 1971; and the Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled, 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The Declaration of the Rights of the Child recognises that the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. The declaration calls upon men and women everywhere, on voluntary organisations and on governments to strive for the observance of the rights of the child which it proclaims. The rights include the right to special protection to enable the child to develop fully; the right to enjoy the benefits of social security, including adequate pre-natal and post-natal care; and the rights to education and to protection from cruelty and exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the two declarations concerned with the rights of physically and intellectually handicapped call for national and international action to protect the rights they declare. The rights of the intellectually handicapped include the right to be accorded as far as possible the same rights as other persons; the right to economic security and a decent standard of living; and the right to protection from exploitation, abuse, and degrading treatment. The rights of the physically handicapped include the right to the same civil and political rights as other persons; the right to respect for their human dignity; the right to measures to enable them to become as self-reliant as possible; and the rights to medical and other treatment and to economic and social security and a decent level of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The three declarations I have just been describing do not represent commitments in international law, as does the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But they express important aspirations, and we are proposing that the Commission should monitor, and report on, the way in which Commonwealth departments and agencies, and activities generally in the Australian Capital Territory, are conforming with them. The three declarations are defined in clause 3 of the Bill, and are included in the definition of 'human rights' in the same clause. There are consequential amendments, chiefly in clause 31, which envisage the declaration of further international instruments as part of the Commission's charter. </PARA>
<PARA> During debate on the 1979 Bill and in the ensuing months, comments have been made about certain aspects of the 1979 Bill that are repeated in the present Bill. Because they are apparently the source of some concern, I should like to discuss three of those criticisms. The first is that the scope of the proposed Commission would extend only to laws of the Commonwealth and the Territories-except the Northern Territory-and actions or procedures under such laws. The Commission's mandate will not extend to State or Northern Territory laws or actions or procedures of State and Northern Territory authorities. However, clause 11 of the Bill provides for a range of co-operative arrangements to be entered into with the States and it is my expectation that this mechanism will be fully used. </PARA>
<PARA> The ministerial meeting on human rights will continue to exercise a role at top policy level in considering issues which require consultation between the various levels of government and in promoting generally the cause of human rights in Australia. Accordingly, this Bill manifests the Government's continuing commitment to co-operative federalism, which is already developing well in the human rights field. The second criticism levelled at the 1979 Bill is that the proposed Commission would incorporate the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. Non-government organisations in the human rights field have particularly voiced this concern. It is motivated by a fear that the work done by the Commissioner for Community Relations will somehow be interrupted or curtailed. My hope and expectation in fact is quite the opposite. Let me emphasise, as I did when the previous Bill was before the Senate, that the Commissioner for Community Relations will continue to carry out the complaint-handling and conciliation functions associated with administration of the Racial Discrimination Act. Further, the added resources of the Commission will be available to assist as required in the important task of combating racial discrimination, and there will be recourse, as there was not previously, to the Meeting of Ministers on Human Rights on racial discrimination matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident, therefore, that establishing the Commission will not make less effective the role of the Commissioner for Community Relations in dealing with complaints of racial discrimination. Thirdly, there have been criticisms that the Human Rights Commission is being given inadequate powers-that it has no machinery for enforcement of its findings. That criticism represents a misunderstanding of the essential purpose of the Commission. The purpose of the Commission is to promote discussion and understanding of human rights in the community generally and to recommend to the Government and to Parliament changes in law or practice required to bring that law and practice into line with human rights as defined by the International Covenant or other human rights instruments. For its job, the Commission has been given adequate powers to obtain papers, to call witnesses, to conduct hearings and to make reports. A survey of institutions with similar functions in Australia and overseas shows that the Commission is as well, or better, endowed with powers than other bodies having similar functions. </PARA>
<PARA> What the critics of the Commission suggest is that it should have some kind of court-like powers of enforcement. In the view of the Government, this may be a possible step for the future, but it is not the next step, which is the establishment of the Commission. It is only when the Parliament has laid down laws relating to human rights in a particular area-for example relating to racial discrimination-that the normal law enforcement machinery should be considered. Even there, the clear cut and authoritative decisions of the courts may not be the correct way to proceed, at any rate in the early stages of the operation of the law. The promotion of human rights in this country will be achieved more through education, through finding new balances of interests and through conciliation than through firm measures of enforcement. In closing, I should like to refer to the final paragraph of my second reading speech for the 1979 Bill. The thoughts and hopes expressed are as current and important today as they were then. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Human rights are about the protection of individuals. I believe, and the Government believes, that in an era of social change in which governments exercise wide powers and corporations and large institutions greatly influence the lives of individuals, it is important to have an agency that is active in the protection and promotion of the rights of individuals. We see in the world around us too many occasions where the rights of individuals are cruelly violated. The purpose of the Human Rights Commission, and of the machinery associated with it, is to help Australia maintain its excellent record in the protection of human rights, and progressively to develop a better and more comprehensive recognition and observance of the rights of every individual in our community, regardless of financial standing and whatever his or her race, age, sex, religion or status. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a purely technical Bill, and is associated with the Human Rights Commission Bill 1981, which I have just introduced. This Bill will make the Racial Discrimination Amendment Act 1980 operative. That Act was expressed to come into operation when the Human Rights Commission Act 1980 was proclaimed, but is inoperative because the Human Rights Commission Bill 1980 was not enacted. The present Bill will amend the Racial Discrimination Amendment Act 1980 to apply to the 1981, instead of the 1980, Human Rights Commission Act. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>Shipping Registration Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Shipping Registration Bill is an important step forward in the development of Australia's status as an independent nation. The right of a country to determine the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships is fundamental to its national sovereignty. In international law the nationality of ships is determined by the flag they are entitled to fly. It is also customary to require at least the larger ships to be registered in order to secure the right to fly the national flag. The present law governing the registration of ships in Australia was enacted by the Parliament at Westminster 87 years ago. Indeed, it is contained in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. </PARA>
<PARA> Originally that law applied throughout the British Empire on the basis that a ship was a British ship if it was owned by a British subject or corporation in any part of the Empire. The Act required all British ships to be registered except certain small ships of less than 15 tons carrying capacity. Registration could be effected at any British port of registry throughout the Empire and this entailed the entry of particulars of the ship and of its owners and mortgagees in the register at the port. The registrar at the port was required to transmit returns at regular intervals to the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen at Cardiff and in that way a complete record of all British ships was built up. However this procedure has been abandoned in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> From the commencement of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the various member countries of the British Commonwealth were free to repeal the Merchant Shipping Act 1984 and to establish their own shipping registers. However, under an agreement negotiated in 1931 the laws of each country were required to adopt a common status of 'British ship' and to follow closely the provisions of Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. By mutual agreement in 1978 the British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement 1931 was rescinded by all member countries. Australia is the only major independent member of the Commonwealth, other than Britain itself, to have continued to operate under the Merchant Shipping Act system. The stage has now been reached where it is essential that we put an end to this anachronism. The Commonwealth countries have recently agreed on common principles for the future operation of their own shipping registers. In accordance with those principles the United Kingdom is expected to confine the Merchant Shipping Act system to Britain, to ships more than 50 per cent owned by residents of Britain or companies based in Britain. It is understood that the adoption by Australia of its own national system will simplify the task being undertaken by the British authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles underlying this Bill have been the subject of extensive discussion with the States and the Northern Territory in the Marine and Ports Council of Australia. Their views were taken into account in the framing of the legislation. In recent discussions in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, agreement has been reached on the form of the clause relating to the preservation of State and Territory laws and that revised clause appears in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a description of the main features of the Bill. Firstly the Bill repeals Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 insofar as it is part of the law of Australia, thus terminating Australia's reliance on the British legislation and clearing the way for the adoption of an appropriate Australian system. Secondly, the provisions spell out the ships that are eligible for Australian registration, either on a compulsory or on a voluntary basis. The main elements are: Defence Force ships are excluded and registration is compulsory only for Australian-owned commercial ships of 12 metres or more in length, other than certain government ships, fishing vessels and pleasure craft; Australian-owned ships for which registration is not compulsory may be registered on a voluntary basis and also ships under 12 metres in length that are owned or operated by Australian citizens or residents may be registered; and registration is also permitted in the case of foreign-owned ships that are demise chartered to Australian interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures for registration, including the evidence of ownership required, the division of property in the ship into 64 shares, issuing of registration certificates and of provisional certificates and the naming of marking of the ship have been made broadly comparable with the British system to ensure that the changeover from that system to the Australian system can be effected with a minimum of inconvenience for shipowners. The same can be said of the provisions of Part III of the Bill which deal with transfer and transmission of title and the registration and priority of mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA> The flag proposals for Australian ships were arrived at after considerable public discussion. In the Australian Merchant Navy there was strong support for the continued use of the Australian Red Ensign. Therefore it is proposed to declare the Australian Red Ensign the national colours for Australian merchant ships. Regarding other ships the general opinion was that they should be allowed to fly either the Australian National Flag or the Australian Red Ensign. This was accepted on the condition that the two flags would not be flown simultaneously. Complementary amendments to the Flags Act 1953 and the Navigation Act 1912 are necessary. The Flags Amendment Bill and the Navigation Amendment Bill are being introduced for that purpose. Apart from these flags which until now have been covered by a mixture of British and Australian laws, the British Admiralty has issued individual warrants to certain members of some 16 yacht clubs in Australia, authorising them to wear the British Blue Ensign, either undefaced or in a defaced form. The British Blue Ensign is similar to the Australian National Flag but without the stars. Approximately 400 Australian yacht owners have been issued with such warrants. This causes some difficulty as under the Geneva Convention on the High Seas 1958, to which Australia is a party, ships have the nationality of the country whose flag they are entitled to fly. </PARA>
<PARA> These international requirements apply particularly to the high seas. It is possible to permit departure from the Convention requirement in the Australian territorial sea and internal waters. In view of the concern expressed by yacht owners who presently have Blue Ensign warrants, the Bill will allow them to continue to fly that flag in Australian waters so long as British law allows them to fly the flag. The Bill also preserves the use of the flag of a State or Territory in Australian waters and contains provisions in respect of flag rights for unregistered Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of Parts IV and V of the Bill set out the broad administrative arrangements for the establishment and operation of the Australian Register of Ships. In this area there are some significant departures from the present system. The proposed Australian system is basically a centralised system in that there will be only one register. The Bill provides that the Register and copies of the Register or such part or parts of the Register as the Minister directs shall be kept at such places as the Minister directs. It also provides that there shall be at such places in Australia as the Minister determines, an Australian Shipping Registration Office and such number of branch registration offices as the Minister determines. This is a flexible arrangement and it enables a certain amount of decentralisation. However, it does not suffer from the disadvantage of the present system in Australia under which there is a seperate register at each of 20 ports of registry and the complete record of all ships registered in Australia is not available at any one place. One consequence of that change is that there will be no ports of registry as such. However, because of the importance of the port of registry concept for legal and other purposes, the Bill makes provision for the adoption of a concept of home port for each ship and the regulations will spell this out in greater detail including the practice of continuing to mark the port on the ship's stern. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions including power to remove unqualified ships from the Register and the provision of penalties for offences. It also includes the clauses relating to the preservation of State and Territory laws and the review of decisions of the Minister or the Registrar by the courts or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Finally, the Bill contains transitional provisions that have been framed in such a way as to minimise any inconvenience to the owners and mortgagees of ships registered in Australia under the Merchant Shipping Act. On the commencement date the existing registers will be deemed to form part of the Australian Register and no further action will be required of owners or mortgagees in order to effect the transition to the Australian Register. The Australian Register will of course make use of modern procedures, equipment and documentation and ships will be progressively transferred over to the new documentation after the commencement date. As I mentioned this Bill is an important step forward in the development of our status as an independent nation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Flags Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Flags Amendment Bill is a small Bill to complement the Shipping Registration Bill 1981 and the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981. The only amendment of substance is made to Schedule 1 of the Flags Act 1953, which contains the description of the Australian National Flag. The new wording to be inserted in that Schedule will describe both the Australian National Flag and the Australian Red Ensign. This is necessary because at present the description of the Australian Red Ensign is partly contained in section 406 of the Navigation Act 1912, which is being repealed by the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> One consequence of this adjustment is that the present reference to the British Blue Ensign in describing the Australian National Flag is removed. This means that the description of the Australian flags stands on its own and does not rely on reference to the flag of another country. Other changes proposed in the amending Bill are of a drafting nature only. I refer honourable senators also to the remarks I made in my second reading speech on the Shipping Registration Bill on the question of flags to be worn by Australian ships. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The principal purpose of the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981 is to amend the Navigation Act so as to accord with the proposed Shipping Registration Act. The Shipping Registration Bill which I have just introduced provides for the prescribing of national colours to be flown by Australian ships and therefore the Navigation Amendment Bill repeals an overlapping provision in the Navigation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Many provisions of the Navigation Act refer to British ships and, in particular, the whole of Part II is expressed to apply only to British ships except where a contrary intention appears. These references to British ships are being replaced with references to ships registered in Australia under the Shipping Registration Act or otherwise having a close connection with Australia. Schedule 2 to the Bill contains many of these consequential amendments. Australia's withdrawal from the British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement 1931, which took effect in 1979, is an added reason for making these changes. Provisions of the Navigation Act relating to the tonnage measurement of ships refer to ships registered in Australia under the Merchant Shipping Act. There is a similar reference in section 411 of the Act. These provisions are being replaced with references to the Shipping Registration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A second purpose of the Bill is to update the offence provisions of the Navigation Act and to ensure that the penalties prescribed are appropriate to present day conditions. These amendments are made by clause 44 and Schedule 3 to the Bill. Some of the amendments affect sections of the principal Act introduced in 1979 or 1980 that are not yet in force. Special commencement arrangements are required for these provisions and are contained in sub-clause 2 (5) and Schedule 1 to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The general purpose of these amendments is to update the level of pecuniary penalties in line with present money values. At the same time opportunity has been taken to repeal offences that are not relevant to present day conditions or that are now covered by the general criminal law. Other improvements are the provision of higher pecuniary penalties for offences by corporations and the provision of indictable offences that can be dealt with summarily if the parties and the court all agree. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of minor adjustments that are considered to be appropriate at this time. An example of this is contained in clause 6 which adjusts the Minister's power of delegation. Another example is in paragraph 3 (2) (c) of the Bill which adjusts the definition of 'ship' in relation to off-shore industry mobile units that are not self-propelled. Finally, the Bill proposes to insert into the Act a power to exempt ships from one or more of the provisions of the Act where the ships only come within the jurisdiction of the Act infrequently-for example, where they have to undergo a single interstate voyage. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Currency Amendment Bill will not be opposed by the Opposition. It authorises the minting of silver coins with a face value of $10. The price at which the coins will be sold when they are ultimately minted will be determined closer to the time of release. This practice follows a precedent established by the Government last year when two gold coins-one being a bullion coin and the other a currency coin-were minted and sold by the Government at prices substantially higher than the value of the coins' metal content and the cost of minting. Indeed, it is reported by different sources that the total profits on the transaction will be between $10m and $15m. I do not know whether this is one of the exercises the Government has in mind in accordance with its obsession to reduce the Budget deficit but it will certainly have that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that if people want to pay well above the value of the metal content of the coins, there is no good reason why the government should not take their money. Indeed, it could be seen as a system of voluntary taxation. As such, it would not be all that far removed from the system of taxation over which this Government has presided for many years, at least in relation to the very rich. Taxation for the very rich is largely a voluntary matter because of the Government's continuing refusal to take the only effective action which can be taken against tax avoidance-given the Byzantine rulings and reasoning of the High Court of Australia-that is, the introduction of retrospective legislation. Since the Government has closed off and continues to close off that option, taxpaying becomes voluntary for the very rich. Therefore, it is quite appropriate that de facto taxpaying in the form of purchasing these coins ought to be extended to the lower income groups as well as to the very rich. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that a precedent had been set last year with the issue of the gold coins. I hope that the other precedents associated with the issue of gold coins will not be followed with the silver coin. One which will is the precedent of making money out of the issues. In particular, I refer to the 70,000 Australians who ordered coins which the Government will not be able to supply and also to the number-an intermediate number but probably several thousand-whose money has been accepted by the Government for the coins, the delivery of which was not effected for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, according to some Press reports on the Government's failure either to deliver the coins on time or to deliver them at all, it would seem that the coin distribution exercise is the greatest farce that we have seen since the Liberal Party's great Khemlani's suitcase chase of 1975. I cite as an example the Sydney Sun-Herald of 8 February this year which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Deliveries of the gold koala coins are now months behind schedule and at least two consignments have been lost or stolen. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA>-one in Brisbane and one in Melbourne. Police are still searching for the 100 coins involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Although we entirely approve of the Government's exercise in painlessly extracting money from the public in this way, our hope is that the Government can organise the exercise more efficiently in this instance than it did in the gold coin exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Another irony associated with the issue of the gold coins is that, although some 70,000 Australians had ordered the coins and were unable, because of the Government's inefficiency to procure them, the issue of Overseas Trading of 27 February, which is the journal issued by the Department of Trade and Resources, contains an item boasting about the fact that some 8,000 gold coins will be taken up in the United States. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's newly minted $200 gold coin has scored a sell-out success in the USA. All of an issue of 8000 of the coins was taken up within days of its recent release to the American public. </PARA>
<PARA> The US shipment consisted of 2000 individually struck 'proof' coins, in presentation packs, selling at $310 each, and 6000 'uncirculated' coins, also in presentation packs, selling at $240 each. </PARA>
<PARA> Release of the coins was announced at a press conference in New York by the Senior Trade Commissioner, Mr M. G. B. Coultas, with the Royal Australian Mint's representative in the USA Mr John Van Emden. </PARA>
<PARA> As both a collector's item and a speculative investment gold coins have generated a high level of interest in the USA. Since gold coin sales started in the USA six years ago, for instance, 29 million Krugerands have been sold. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose the Department of Trade and Resources is to be commended for what is apparently a painless and profitable distribution of coins in the US. It is a pity that the Government could not organise the distribution in Australia as efficiently as it was organised overseas. One might also add that the Government is under some obligation or ought to consider itself under some obligation to supply the Australian demand before supplying an overseas demand. For the reasons that I have stated, the Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak briefly in support of the Currency Amendment Bill 1981 which seeks to amend the Currency Act 1965. The purpose of this Bill, of course, is to empower the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to issue a $10 silver commemorative coin for the 1982 Commonwealth Games which will be held in Brisbane. Each coin will, I understand, be slightly larger than the present 50c coin and weigh about 20 grams. Although the designs on the reverse side are yet to be determined, I believe there will be a lot of interest in the final outcome. I trust that it will be appropriate as a commemorative coin of the Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill also gives to the Executive certain regulative powers for the issuing of new denominations of standard coins, et cetera. The issue price, naturally enough, will be determined very much closer to the date on which the coins will actually be issued. This is due to the highly volatile state of the metal market at the moment, particularly with silver. It is obviously desirable that the issue price be determined very much closer to the time of issue of the coin. The issuing of such coins, of course, will render a tidy profit to the Government. Such coins in the past have proved popular. For example, I believe that the Government has already sold something like 50,000 of the special proof $200 gold coins for $300. It has also sold 207,000 of the $200 uncirculated or bullion type coins at a price of $240 a coin. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter which concerns me is that certain of the administrative arrangements in the past at the Mint have not really been in the interests of collectors of small coins. Unfortunately in the past there has been a high degree of frustration. I trust that the Mint has learned from its previous problems and that this will improve its administrative arrangements for selling and producing these coins. </PARA>
<PARA> The $10 coin will be of 92.5 per cent sterling silver and 7.5 per cent other metal. I trust that all the efforts being made to make the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane a success will not be frustrated by the political considerations of people in some nations who seek to evaluate who is appropriate to compete with their own nationals. It is unfortunate that in the past boycotts and threats of boycotts have stained the true spirit of athletics around the world. I have much pleasure in commending this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill will not be opposed by the Opposition. It makes a number of amendments to the Dairying Research Act, nearly all of which could be regarded as trivial. For example, the name of the body controlling research funds has been changed from the Dairying Research Committee to the Australian Dairy Research Committee and the number of representatives of producers of milk used for manufacturing purposes has been increased from three to four. The Bill also contains an innovation which the Opposition welcomes. The Government has been introducing this provision into all recent legislation of this type. I refer to the requirement for members of committees and boards of this type to disclose any pecuniary interests they may have which could lead to conflict of interest situations. I suggest that the transcript of recent proceedings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations would provide ample evidence of the need for such a provision, if the need were not already apparent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to take advantage of the opportunity by making a few generalised comments about the Australian dairying industry. Firstly and most importantly-this is recognised by anyone who takes a serious interest in the subject-the manufacturing sector of the dairying industry is in a much better shape, a much healthier condition, than it was a decade ago. In dairying industry establishment circles and in those conservative political circles that take any interest in such matters, it is fashionable to attribute this fact to cult figures, such as the former Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, Mr Webster, and the President of United Dairyfarmers of Victoria and present Deputy Chairman of the Corporation, Mr Pyle, or some favoured son, such as Ronald Anderson, the publisher of Primary Industry Newsletter. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical factor to which the healthier condition of the manufacturing sector of the dairying industry must be attributed-I would not deny the Mr Webster played some part in this regard in the early stages-is the structural changes which have taken place within the last decade. I refer to the reorientation of the industry from the production of an end product for which the market was dying-that is, butter-to the production of those end products for which the market is growing, principally cheese and wholemilk powder. Those structural changes were not precipitated by people such as Mr Pyle or Mr Webster; they were precipitated by the legislative changes made by the Labor Government in 1974 and 1975. Those changes were vilified at the time, particularly by the Country Party under the various names by which it is known in the States, and were not accepted gratefully by the dairying industry establishment of the day. But ultimately they have been shown to be highly advantageous to the dairying industry, as the Labor Government of the time, with its more rational approach to agricultural policy-making, appreciated would be the case. Had it not been for the election of a Labor Government there is no real doubt, given the propensity of the Liberal Party to cave in to National Country Party demands and pressures on this and other matters, that the dairying industry would have been in a much worse condition today. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 12 months there has been a great deal of loose talk from influential people in the industry about the decline in the numbers of dairy farmers, which have roughly halved in the last decade, being a tragedy. The obvious response to these people is that it is just as well for those who are still dairy farmers that this number has halved. Had it not halved in the way that it did the net income of the industry would not be very much greater than it is now and it would have to be spread around almost twice as many dairy farmers, with obvious implications for the average income of dairy farmers. People who have indulged in such loose talk either are unaware of the constraints which the industry faces or are concerned more with maintaining the income of dairy farmer organisations, such as United Dairy Farmers of Victoria, than with the welfare of the dairy farmer. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been an alarmist campaign about the alleged horrific prospect of butter being imported from New Zealand. I might say that the comment in the agricultural Press on this matter, whilst it has been lengthy and at times highly emotional, has not been very enlightening. It seemed likely a few months ago, but it now seems less likely, that although Australia is a significant net exporter of butter-we will export perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 tonnes of butter this year-local supplies will be inadequate to meet local demands. Given that the price is significantly higher on the domestic market than it is on the free world market, the fact that manufacturers were selling on the export market in preference to the higher priced local market was superficially a mystery. It was possible that they had inadvisedly entered into longer term contracts to supply export markets at stated prices, not anticipating the way in which prices would move. After several weeks of reading about these matters in the agricultural Press and of reading the not infrequently verbose and emotive comments of dairying industry leaders, I was finally informed by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics that the problem was that in order to secure a captive home market earlier legislation-an Act of I think, 1977-required that a levy be imposed on all butter production. That is fairly well known. That revealed nothing new to people who were taking any interest at all in the industry. But that levy exceeded the market differential between the price of butter in Australia and the free on board export price. In other words, because butter prices overseas had risen, although still substantially below the prevailing Australian domestic price, they were above the Australian domestic price net of levy. In those circumstances it was very clear that the appropriate response was to reduce the levy on domestic sales. The Government has not done that. I wonder why it has not?</PARA>
<PARA> Disregarding that example of inefficiency, incompetence and negligence on the part of governmental authorities, there is no reason to become hysterical about the prospect of butter being imported from New Zealand to meet shortfalls in the local supply if Australian dairy products can be sold overseas in a different form at more profitable prices. Indeed, it would be a completely rational thing to do. Any given quantity of milk, at least in the longer term, can be converted to butter, cheese, wholemilk powder and a number of other dairy products. If the market for Australian cheese overseas, for example, provided a higher return than the Australian domestic market provided for the same milk if converted to butter, any sensible dairying industry operator would supply the overseas market. If New Zealanders are happy to supply the Australian butter market at prices less remunerative than the export cheese market is to Australian dairy farmers, then there is no reason why we should not import the butter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems, of course, highly unlikely that the New Zealand dairy industry would be so inept that it would forgo higher priced markets for cheese overseas in order to supply what is effectively a lower priced market for butter in Australia. At least it seems highly unlikely that the New Zealand dairy industry would be so inept as to do that for any considerable length of time. I suspect, however that the real cause of what was seen to be the problem, that is the apparent likely shortfall of production in Australian butter for the domestic market, was the Government's negligence in failing to adjust the levy on domestic sales to a more appropriate level, thereby allowing the market situation to drift into the position where the price realised on the free market exceeded the price on the domestic market, net of levy. I hope that such ineptitude and inefficiency will be less common in the future than it has been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too am not opposing the Dairying Research Amendment Bill 1981. In effect it is not the simple Bill that it may appear because it is now quite an important Bill to one of Australia's vital industries. This industry was once a major export industry and it has now become basically domestic. As such we have reached the stage where the industry needs to be retained for all the range of economic and strategic reasons that go with providing food for the nation. In 1976 we took the heavy approach towards rationalising the dairy industry and this has achieved most of what was proposed. It has worked quite well through the production sector and while some mistakes have been made it has been quite satisfactory. The farmers in the production area have done well. Over this period they have become very efficient and are now well equipped, well stocked and are certainly striving to do even better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During this period we have seen the commencement of a tendency towards larger farms, of corporate dairying and a slight drift away from the traditional family farm. With this we have come upon a somewhat newer breed of dairymen who are better educated, more businesslike, more interested in getting further ahead and in achieving more and wider research. We need only look into the Dairying Research Committee's report to see what it is all about. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The broad objective of the scheme is to raise productivity and enhance the welfare of the Industry. In accordance with the requirements of the Dairying Research Act 1972, expenditure from research funds should be within the following categories and directly or indirectly related to the production or distribution of dairy produce;</PARA>
<PARA> Scientific, economic or technical research</PARA>
<PARA> Training of persons</PARA>
<PARA> Dissemination of scientific, economic or technical information and advice</PARA>
<PARA> Publication of scientific, enconomic or technical reports, periodicals, books and papers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the research is going and that is certainly where it is necessary. Over the last few years we have seen a considerable improvement in fundamental matters such as breeding and feeding, improved use of fertilisers, the handling and housing of cattle and matters such as that. This followed on directly from the advice that was given in the Industries Assistance Commission report. I refer to page 72 of that report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested that one way in which dairy farm productivity could be further improved was through dairy herd improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to list the following eight items:</PARA>

<PARA>These measures have been largely achieved. The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation has concentrated on trying to ensure that the important items of dairy production have been followed through. It is interesting to note, from a table which I obtained from the Library, the extent to which milk production in Australia has improved during the period 1974-75 to 1979-80.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that in New South Wales the average milk production per cow in 1974-75 was 2,476 litres. By 1979-80 this average was 2,906 litres, which is an increase of 430 litres. In Western Australia it rose from 2,702 litres in 1974-75 to 3,049 litres in 1979-80, an increase of 347 litres. The Australian average increase over the same period was 147 litres but I am somewhat disappointed to find that the Tasmanian average increase was only 83 litres. This is disappointing because while the Tasmanian average yield per cow is of course higher than the other States-as it should be because of better soil, better climate and so on-we have had quite an extensive government program on herd improvement. Nevertheless, we seem to have made less progress than about half the number of States when we look at the national average and we have made considerably less progress than the better States. There is certainly room for more improvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More inducements should be offered, I believe, to the producers by the processors. I will cite a couple of alternatives that have been suggested recently, some of which are in operation in other places. I refer to such things as subsidies on fertiliser beyond certain basic levels; heavily subsidised herd recording programs for total herds; insemination subsidies for world class size; subsidies for pregnancy testing; and added extension service advice on pastures, forage pest control and other production related items. There are a whole host of items where I think the processors can assist the producers in further increasing their cows' production. The returns in 1976, at the time I first became a senator, were about $100 per cow, per year. In Tasmania for this year this is now being discussed on the basis of approximately $400 per cow, per year. I hope that within two years, on the present anticipations, this will be about $500 per year. Primarily, to achieve this, not only will we need better production but also we will need more consolidation and rationalisation in the processing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a newspaper article the chairman of the dairying division of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, John Charleston, said recently that there were 13 receival points in Tasmania which between them were not handling as much as was being handled by one point in Victoria. I receive regular reports that in various places up to four milk tankers are on one road, and of course there are excessive costs in duplicated managerial and production staff. I am told generally that approximately 40 cents a kilogram is being lost in duplication costs, and I believe that dairy farmers, both in Tasmania and Australia-wide, are now at the point where they expect to receive more of that money than they have in the past. The producer has done his part by arriving at his current level of efficiency and will now expect to be paid the amount available through the elimination of duplicated costs. It is generally considered that the over-capacity in the manufacturing sector of the industry is of the order of 35 per cent to 40 per cent, or possibly more. The cost of maintaining this over-capacity is borne directly by the producer, certainly not by the processor. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make two final points. Firstly, I concur with Senator Walsh's statement that, from the dairy farmers' point of view, they would be wise to support moves for market forces trading in Australian dairy products. It may be desirable right now for us to be importing some products from New Zealand while at the same time selling products in other areas at better prices. That would assist in maximising the returns to the farmers. The present arrangements will be at the expense of these same farmers. The second point I wish to make relates to the present discussions on closer economic relations with New Zealand. For the benefit of the governments on both sides of the Tasman, I make the point that those relations do not involve the abolition or dismemberment of the Australian dairy industry. The Australian dairy industry will certainly not be the sacrificial calf in achieving closer economic relations. For both economic and strategic reasons, Australia must retain a viable industry. We are down to about the level of reasonable viability now, and I think it is only sensible that we should try to restrain further contraction until we have time to level out. The Australian industry needs a little more shaking down but it does not need shaking out in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three points on which the discussions with New Zealand should be based as far as the dairy industry is concerned, and a similar situation would apply to the horticultural industries. Firstly, all trade should be stripped of any advantages, benefits, bonuses, and so on. Secondly, where we are dealing together on overseas export markets, we should work on a co-operative basis and program these markets between the two countries. Thirdly, where we are dealing with each other, agreements should be arranged between producers on both sides of the Tasman. Such agreements have worked quite satisfactorily for certain other products, notably through the Australian Pea and Bean Industry Panel. I again commend the dairy farmers for what they have done in becoming as efficient as they have become in the last five years, and I ask the processor section to consider what the farmers have done and try to do likewise. To achieve that purpose we should be able to use the funds of the account we are currently discussing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills currently being debated are the Dried Vine Fruits Stabilization Legislation Repeal Bill 1981, the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill 1981, and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill 1981. These Bills are associated with price guarantees for apple and pear exports. The Opposition will not oppose any of the Bills. The package of Bills associated with apple and pear pricing changes the basis of industry support from stabilisation to underwriting. Those are jargonistic or fog words which have little meaning to people who are not fully acquainted with the industry, and perhaps little precise meaning even to those who are acquainted with the industry. The change embodied in fact is quite important. Previously governments have guaranteed supplementary subsidy assistance for apple and pear exports to European markets, within some market price parameters. Those prices were set arbitrarily and frequently, I suppose, with a significant political input. That system has been phased out and the price support system now to operate will be in the form of a guaranteed or underwritten price related to actual market prices, effectively as determined by market prices on a three-year moving average. Although extreme fluctuations in prices from one year to another cannot occur, as the prices trend is either upwards or downwards, the underwritten price will follow that trend, albeit with a smoothed and time-lagged effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This system follows the precedent which was first established by Labor when in government, in regard to the changes to the wheat industry guaranteed price formula in 1974. The apple and pear legislation is more efficient on two grounds: Firstly, because the underwriting provision will apply to exports to all markets. The previous provisions applied only to European markets and therefore effectively discriminated against exports to non-European markets and actually discouraged the industry from seeking to develop markets in the non-European area-the area, incidentally, where the prospect for growth is probably greatest. They are also more efficient in that they are price related instead of being determined completely arbitrarily. We commend those changes and note that they are in line with the recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in a report released, I think, last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dried Vine Fruits Stabilization Legislation Repeal Bill, as the name implies, repeals the existing Act under which, whenever actual export market returns were more than $10 per tonne above or below the set price-that set price again being more or less an arbitrary price-growers either contributed to or received payments from the stabilisation fund. The history of that stabilisation fund over recent decades is that the Government has frequently been obliged or required to contribute public money to the fund to enable payments to be made. In other words, grower contributions have not equalled grower withdrawals from the fund. But in recent years that longer term trend has been reversed and in fact payments into the fund were based on the 1978 crop. It is confidently expected that payments based on the 1979 and 1980 crops would also be made into the fund if the existing legislation were to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to repeal the legislation both in order to avoid contributions being made from the 1979 and 1980 crops and also to expedite the distribution back to growers of contributions made in 1978. I suppose one could say that by terminating the present and long-standing marketing arrangements at this time the industry is getting out of that arrangement while it is in front, but I guess few people would probably begrudge that privilege to dried fruit growers. It is forecast in the Minister's second reading speech that the old stabilisation arrangements will be replaced by underwriting arrangements at some time in the near future. The Opposition hopes and trusts that the underwriting arrangements ultimately chosen for this industry will in principle be similar to those incorporated in respect of apples and pears and, more recently, for other agricultural industries; that is, whatever the underwritten figure is, it will be related to actual market returns, probably with a smoothed and time-lagged effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Dried Vine Fruits Stabilization Legislation Repeal Bill, the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill. I wish to express concern about some aspects of the underwriting aspects of the legislation. This concern is shared by, I should say, the majority of growers from my State of Tasmania because apples and pears are a particularly important part of the economy of the State. In this joint debate I wish to concentrate on the three Bills which are connected with apples and pears. As most honourable senators would be aware Tasmania, in the past, has produced approximately 67 per cent of apples which are exported to at-risk markets. Therefore, the problem of the at-risk market raises all the consequences of local overproduction and underproduction and other countries' apple supplies to Europe, including the United Kingdom. But Tasmania is also plagued by problems of uncertainties in such things as shipping schedules, limited frequencies of services, some extra cost of packing materials, interruptions on the wharves and the degree of industrial disputation. All these problems to the local grower are compounded when one recognises that one is dealing essentially with a perishable product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills essentially reflect the Government's acceptance of the major recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission report No. 239 on apples and pears dated 28 March 1980. Basically what we are looking at today is a phased withdrawal of the stabilisation provisions. In the case of apples they will be phased out over a period, whereas the $2.20 a box subsidy for exports to the United Kingdom and to Europe will be phased down so that in 1982 it will be $1.65, in 1983 it will be $1.10, and in 1984 it will be 55c. The total amount of money involved in the new arrangements will also be reduced. In 1981 it will be $2.475m and it will decline to $825,000 in 1984. The stabilisation arrangements in regard to pears will be reduced after one season. These arrangements will create problems because the stabilisation scheme which has operated since 1971 has produced a stabilising effect on the incomes of all apple and pear producers. In fact, it was stated in the IAC report that if the stabilisation arrangements had been withdrawn in toto this would have reflected approximately a $6,500 decline in the net income of producers in Tasmania and lesser reductions in the net incomes of the mainland producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is significant that prices in 1980 were the highest ever and that in that year a significant new trend emerged and many Tasmanian apples were not exported to the mainland. Some growers diverted their support from the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority and were selling at the very much higher prices which were prevailing on the mainland. Price variations were significant. Last year some varieties sold at approximately $9 a case. So the combination of production drops due to storm damage and higher prices prevailing on the mainland caused at least one ship from Tasmania to be cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority, I believe, has done great work. The last few years have been fairly difficult for that organisation. I believe it is trying to do a job and at least is starting to get on top of some of the problems. I am rather concerned that this movement from a stabilisation scheme to an underwriting scheme will destroy some of the confidence of the Tasmanian producers at a time when I believe confidence is sorely needed . Some of the initiatives by TAMA, for example included the securing of a contract for the export of 100,000 cartons of apples in 1980 to Taiwan, with a contract extending into 1981 and 1982. In the past I have been fairly critical about the advertising and about some of the administration of the Apple and Pear Corporation. I trust that with its new chairman it will show more a vigorous and business-like approach, especially to advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I am quite happy with two of the Bills but it is the underwriting Bill which causes me some concern. The point I wish to make is that the underwriting provisions provide assistance on the basis of 95 per cent of an average of four seasons; so one takes the last four seasons and applies that average to the fifth season and takes 95 per cent of it to determine the underwriting amount. But herein lies the rub; the underwriting provisions do not allow for inflation. Unfortunately, inflationary levels are still unacceptably high and because this formula does not make provision for inflation the producers-essentially, Tasmanian producers, who form the bulk of exporters-are the ones who will suffer most. I appeal to the Minister at the table, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), to see whether perhaps this debate could be adjourned and continued at a later date so that he could recommend that this percentage be increased to 110 per cent, 115 per cent or, preferably 120 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, this is a sincere belief and requirement of the Tasmanian producers because they will suffer. They need a higher rate of compensation than is presently provided because so many of these producers have had very difficult periods. They can see some light ahead but these Bills have changed that. The IAC report came at a most inopportune time for the industry. I will quote from some of the submissions made to the IAC. For example, the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Stabilisation and Supplementary Assistance should be continued. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now explain how the stabilisation scheme worked. There was a maximum Commonwealth assistance to $2.20 a box where exports at-risk were sold at a loss and further supplementary assistance was available on a dollar-for-dollar basis from State and Federal Governments to a maximum of $2.20 a box. This gave a maximum assistance of $4.40 a box. The Department also recommended a modified form of fruit growing reconstruction scheme to be introduced to complement the stabilisation scheme. This statement came from the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture directed by a Labor Party Minister so naturally we believed that statement was made with the support of the Tasmanian Government. The large Tasmanian company, Cascade Brewery Company Ltd, submitted that:</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance should be provided to the apple industry in some markets to maintain production at an effective level. </PARA>
<PARA>We can also look at the statements of others who made submissions. The Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Export Stabilisation Scheme should be maintained for an indeterminate period. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Apple and Pear Shippers' Association submitted:</PARA>
<PARA> The Stabilisation Scheme should be continued indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Apple and Pear Corporation submitted:</PARA>
<PARA> The Stabilisation Scheme should be continued indefinitely and not be considered a temporary arrangement during a period of adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand we have the academic approach exemplified in the IAC report which opinion, naturally, has gone along with many of the conclusions of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The Bureau submitted:</PARA>
<PARA> There is little justification for the continuation of the present Stabilisation Scheme, and the scheme is no longer appropriate for the problems of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>As with these theoretical expositions, no consideration is taken of the effect on people's lives and on particular localities. Although there has been a tremendous drop in the number of people employed and engaged in orcharding in Tasmania, nevertheless the industry represents a significant contribution within the fragile Tasmanan economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem Tasmanians have to put up with is, for example, the tremendous increase in the freight rate. For example, from 15 June 1979 to 20 January 1980, the sea freight rate from Tasmania to the mainland increased by 33 1/3 per cent. These are from figures provided by both the Australian National Line and the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Ltd. There is an expectation of further bunkering charge in the immediate future to compensate for fuel price increases. When we make comparisons we note that the net freight increase, so far as the industry is concerned, is about 60c a carton over the period 15 June 1979 to 20 January 1980 on the Hobart to Sydney route trip. We compared this with a mainland road freight cost increase, over the same period and over a comparable distance, which was only 10c per carton. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian growers have also had problems because the transporting of fruit in bins rather than cartons has virtually collapsed as a result of freight rates becoming just too prohibitive. This was the result of a situation in which the freight forwarders were only allowed to carry a drastically reduced number of bins in a container which thus increased the cost per bin to an unacceptably high rate. Despite all our problems present production is increasing marginally. I do not think that the Tasmanian situation has been recognised sufficiently by many of the people on the mainland pushing for this new scheme rather than for a continuation of the stabilisation scheme. They fail to recognise that Tasmania is a significant producer. I seek leave to table two documents which I have submitted to the Minister at the Table and to the Opposition Whip. I believe the first document shows that the significance of Tasmania as a producer of apples is at risk. The second table is from the IAC report showing the distribution of production by regions in Tasmania. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When honourable senators read the tables in Hansard tomorrow, they will note that, if there is no export market or incentive for Tasmanians to export to overseas countries-Tasmanian producers need confidence at this point-many of the local supplies will be sent to the mainland. Consequently, this will affect the prices received by mainland producers because the total Australian domestic market is not all that large. Tasmanian producers would also like to see an amendment to the freight equalisation scheme to enable Tasmanian export apples to qualify for the freight rebate when sent overseas from a mainland port.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that, in adopting the major recommendations of the IAC report, the Government is essentially seeking ways, in many cases, of saving money rather than of helping an industry in dire need of stability at this time. The old stabilisation scheme applied to each variety of fruit. It is recognised that some varieties have better yielding characteristics than others. Under the underwriting scheme we make no distinction as to variety and refer only to apples in total. As I mentioned, an average as taken over the last four years free on board returns for export of apples provided the basis on which we determined a 95 per cent underwriting in the fifth year. Under this scheme, if a variety of fruit has a very bad year, it is not recognised under the new arrangements of the underwriting scheme whereas it was recognised under the stabilisation scheme. I believe that this change will work to the detriment of some of our Tasmanian producers. I reiterate that I believe that 95 per cent is far too low and does not recognise inflationary factors. Again, I ask that this aspect be considered most sincerely because it will be a thorn in the side of our producers, especially those from Tasmania. I believe our State Government has been showing some initiative to help local producers. A significant initiative is the payment of the salary of the Chairman of the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that growers are losing a degree of confidence in the export market. Unfortunately the export market has tended to perform badly because of the enormous competition, especially in markets in Europe and the United Kingdom. One of the problems in the past has been that Tasmanian producers have not been selling on terms as favourable as those offered by producers and authorities in South Africa and New Zealand. For example, whereas Tasmanian fruit in the past has been sold on consignment and at a firm price, overseas producers have been providing Europeans with much more favourable terms. The Tasmanian Government set aside $20m by way of guarantee to enable the Authority to borrow money so that our products could be sold on terms similar to those offered by South Africa and New Zealand. However, it is important that growers have this confidence to export good fruit in order to support the new underwriting scheme. I am rather concerned that there was not greater consultation with the industry, especially the Tasmanian industry. I am concerned at the 95 per cent underwriting. I trust that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) will take into consideration my request, although it is made at this very late stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill 1981 and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill 1981. It is my intention to confine my remarks to only one of those Bills; that is, the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill. I want to refer briefly to the Corporation's functions, which are set out in the Corporation's fifth annual report. It cites section 6 of the original Act, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The functions of the Corporation are-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to promote the export from Australia of apples and pears;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to control the export from Australia of apples;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to control the export from Australia of pears;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to promote trade and commerce in apples and pears among the States, between States and Territories and within the Territories;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to improve the production and encourage the consumption of apples and pears in the Territories; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) such other functions in connection with apples and pears as are provided by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not my intention, having listened to Senator Watson, to engage in the real politics of apples. I remember that in my youth Tasmania was known as the country of ABC-apples, beer and cupids. I found that out when I visited Tasmania some 40 years ago, not to pick apples but to do another job. The reason I entered this debate was to put a case on behalf of the South Australian apple and pear growers whose representatives visited Parliament House before we rose for the Christmas recess. They expressed some concern that both South Australia and Queensland had no representation on the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the overview which is set out in the latest annual report of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation we will see the production figures for each State. In 1978 New South Wales produced 3,071,000 boxes, with production rising to 5,685,000 boxes in 1979. New South Wales has one representative on the Corporation. Victoria produced 3,458,000 boxes in 1978, with production increasing slightly in 1979 to 3,527,000 boxes. Victoria has three representatives-not all grower representatives-on the Corporation. Queensland and South Australia have no representatives on the Corporation. In 1978 Queensland produced 1,387,000 boxes of apples, increasing to two million in 1979. South Australia produced 940,000 boxes in 1978, increasing to 1,237,000 in 1979. Western Australia produced 1,861,000 boxes in 1978, increasing to 2,465,000 boxes in 1979. Western Australia has two representatives on the Corporation. Tasmania produced 3,489,000 boxes in 1978, increasing to 3,915,000 in 1979. Whilst it can be truly said that both my State of South Australia and Queensland do not export very many apples, it is the feeling of the grower associations in both of those States that they ought to have some representation on the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the visit of the Apple and Pear Growers Association of South Australia to Canberra late in 1980 was to make representations in that regard. Mr Kerin, who is the Opposition's spokesman on primary industry, and I were able to speak to these people. We then took the matter up with our party's committee on primary industry. I wish to read part of a letter which I received from Mr Lockier, who is the Manager of the South Australian Association. He states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> A meeting of the President of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association and the Chief Executive Officer with the Minister of Primary Industry on 28th January last resulted in the Minister's agreement to increase the grower representation on the Corporation from four to six providing all states agree. </PARA>
<PARA> Our members are concerned that 'State representation' cannot be written into the legislation which does mean that a future Minister could appoint two persons from one State at the expense of another State. </PARA>
<PARA> We have notified the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association that we agree to the Minister's offer to increase members representing growers on the Corporation from four to six provided not more than one such member is appointed from each State. </PARA>
<PARA>A meeting of the Opposition's committee concerned with primary industry agreed to support the South Australian growers' case for a representative from each State. I hope that when the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) makes the new appointments, which I guess will not be until the end of this year, he will give due consideration to the representation of both Queensland and South Australia on the Corporation, in view of the figures I have cited. Whilst some of the representatives of the Corporation are not directly representative of the growers, they are representatives of the particular States. I will just repeat the figures: At present Victoria has three representatives on the Corporation; Tasmania has two; Western Australia has two; and New South Wales has one. Queensland and South Australia have no representative. It would make for great harmony in the industry if all States had a voice on the Corporation, despite the fact that South Australia and Queensland have very low production figures. </PARA>
<PARA> In years gone by, I was a poultry farmer and I went through the traumas of the chaos that results when people trade outside an orderly marketing system. If all States are represented on a corporation or a board they are able to put a point of view. If any problems arise they can put that point of view and probably chop off any problem at its source. After checking with the powers that be last year I was able to ascertain that there have been some changes to the Corporation since the printing of this report. I notice that Mr Boynton is the new Chairman of the Corporation, that Western Australia has a new representative by the name of Mr Gubler and that the Victorian representative, Mr Chandler, replaces Mr English. So, as Senator Watson pointed out, there is new blood on the Corporation. I have received no complaints about the Corporation, although Senator Watson seems to have received some. He said that he hoped that the expertise of the new Chairman would help the industry, particularly in marketing. Without being critical of the past Chairman, I join the honourable senator in saying that I have put a point of view on behalf of the South Australian growers organisation. As I have said I hope, when the time comes for new appointments to the Board, that the Minister will take cognizance of the suggestion to increase grower representation from four to six and that both Queensland and South Australia will be represented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; in reply-The Senate has been considering a group of Bills which have to do with apples, pears, dried vine fruits and stabilisation schemes. I understand that the Bills, which are supported from all sides of the House, aim at balancing the need for income security with a continuing capacity within the industries to be able to adjust to changing circumstances. When I was outside the chamber listening to the broadcast of the contribution by Senator Watson I was aware of two things. First of all, I was aware of the matters to which he adverted-some of the points which he brought up-and also of his specific request. The three Bills-the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill and the Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill-bring together a group of propositions which were the result of a very lengthy process of negotiation. They went to the Industries Assistance Commission; there was government consideration; there was public discussion; and there were submissions from interested parties. Of course, that is not necessarily the end of the matter. Senator Watson has now put a series of points which deal with an alternative way in which the matters might still be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will seek, if I may, to put the propositions into the Government system and I invite the honourable senator to talk with me later to see whether we can take his suggestion further. The level of 95 per cent on average returns which did emerge was a result of considerable compromise and argument. I ask in the interests of comity that we take that course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLaren made a point to which I think we need to respond and he has made this point before, I seem to recall, in relation to membership of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation of States which are not represented at the present time. I noted that his State colleague Senator Young indicated his agreement with the point that Senator McLaren was raising. Senator McLaren is correct in saying that the number of grower members on the Board is limited to four. Queensland and South Australia have objected but they have little or no chance of being represented. The honourable senator did set out the membership which indicated that neither Queensland nor South Australia had representatives as such. Following recent representations from the Australian Apple and Pear growers Association seeking added grower representation, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has undertaken to re-examine the membership with a view to increasing the number of grower members from four to six, but on the basis that the selection would remain with the Minister and would not necessarily be on a State basis. The increased membership from four to six possibly may give a capacity to respond in ways which the honourable senator has indicated would be desirable. Having made those remarks, I thank honourable members for their general support of these measures and I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply was interrupted I was dealing with that aspect of the Governor-General's Speech in which His Excellency said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The foreign policy priorities of my Government are clear. It is very conscious of the need for a strong and united Western stance towards the Soviet Union and to this end it will work to maintain its already strong ties with its traditional allies, and in particular with the United States. It should be clearly understood that it will do so out of an appreciation of Australia's needs and interests and for no other reason. </PARA>
<PARA>I had drawn attention to the fact that the maintenance of strong ties has particular relevance for the Northern Territory. Firstly, it meant allowing Pine Gap, that is, the Joint Defence Space Research Facility base, to continue to operate despite the fact that it is controlled by the American Central Intelligence Agency, that the Australian Government is not aware of its real purpose, that private information from Pine Gap is given to commercial organisations in the United States and that its activities would make it a prime target in the event of nuclear war. The second comment I made was that the maintenance of strong ties means that by offering Darwin as a stopover base for American B52 aircraft it would become a prime target. I had said that there were three reasons why we of the Opposition oppose the use of Darwin as a B52 stopover. Firstly, the fact that it would make Darwin a prime target. That would mean that the two major centres in the Northern Territory would become major targets. Secondly, I had spoken about the possibility of an accident if nuclear weapons were carried on these aircraft. And thirdly, I had spoken about the fact that the decision of the Government ties us into American policy and removes our independence. I had reached the point of commencing to talk about the use of Darwin as a B52 stopover base tying us into American policy. I now deal with that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia wants to be an ally of the United States. There is no doubt about that. We have firm commitments in that area. But we do not want to be a satellite, a colony or a minion of the United States. We are allies and there is no doubt that our policies will usually, but not necessarily, be the same. We must have our own positive, independent policies. I am convinced that if we had them and expressed them clearly we would get more respect from the world, particularly the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> What ties Australia and the United States together? Basically it is the ANZUS treaty. Let me deal quickly with the ANZUS treaty without going into it too deeply. Article IV states:</PARA>
<PARA> Each Party recognises that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional process. </PARA>
<PARA>Article IV states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of Article IV, an armed attack on any of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on the metropolitan Territory of any of the Parties, or on the island Territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific or on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA>Basically the ANZUS treaty is a watered down version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Honourable senators will recall the NATO phrase which goes something like 'an attack against one, shall be considered as an attack against all'. I do not know whether that is the exact wording of the phrase, but that is the sentiment of it. The ANZUS treaty does not do that. The United States Congress specifically left out this provision because it did not want it included. Some of the older honourable senators in this place might recall what a former leader of the Australian Labor Party, Arthur Calwell, had to say in the House of Representatives in a debate on the ratification of the ANZUS Treaty. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an obligation on USA and all the other participants in the European Treaty, NATO, to go to each others aid. The only guarantee that it is given in the Pacific Treaty-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the ANZUS Treaty-</PARA>
<PARA>is that the nations will consult in common . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that I read that phrase from Article IV. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no real obligation in the Pacific Treaty on anybody and on some grounds it would be better to have no treaty at all. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to sum up briefly what ANZUS is. It is clear that the United States is not required to come to Australia's assistance in the case of an attack. I am not suggesting that it would not come to our aid. It came in 1914 or a little thereafter. It came in the 1939-45 conflict. It did not come to our assistance at the beginning but it did a little later. The treaty does not require the United States to come to our aid and that is the important thing. Unfortunately, ANZUS means what the United States says it means when and where it feels like it. Most people realise that the very meaning of ANZUS has been the subject of debate in the United States. The people of the United States are still not sure what it means. I suggest that there is no advantage in having bombers refuelled in Australia and that there are many disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to recall that the use of nuclear weapons is now thinkable. It was not some time ago, but it is now. People are considering the use of nuclear weapons. Certainly we do not want to have one of the key foreign bases that would be knocked out in the initial skirmishing. I suggest that before any decision is taken, the people of Darwin be consulted. A straw poll taken within the last fortnight shows 67 per cent of people are against B52 bombers landing at Darwin and only 20 per cent in favour of B52s landing in Darwin. In other words, the position here is similar to the Iceland situation. Some honourable senators may have noticed that the Iceland situation was dealt with on the 60 Minutes program recently--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an excellent program, as my colleague says. It covered the objections that Iceland has to the B52s landing in its territory. Other sites in Australia have been suggested by me and by others. If we must have these aircraft landing in Australia let us use some of the other sites and make sure that these sites are away from the major centres. The United States does not put its bases close to towns or cities. We should not put these bases in Australia close to towns and cities and we should not allow the United States to do so. The problem, of course, is that it is very difficult to get factual information either from the United States or from the present Australian Government about what is really happening. The people of the Northern Territory have been bombarded by the Murdoch Press in the Northern Territory News. It favours the landing of the B52s. I would like to draw attention to an editorial of 5 March 1981 under the heading: 'Bullying bear nonsense'. The editorial stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For once the Soviet Ambassador in Australia has departed from his usually low profile to warn that Darwin could become a future nuclear target if the Federal Government decides to allow American B-52 bombers to refuel here. </PARA>
<PARA> How the Labor Party's prophets of doom must be chortling 'we told you so'. </PARA>
<PARA> This was just what the Lefties have been delighted to forecast. The Ambassador, Dr Nikolai Soudarikov, has made their day. </PARA>
<PARA>One can only ask what goes on in the mind of an editor who writes that sort of drivel. What strange values would a man have to attribute that sort of value to fellow Australians? We tend to judge others on our own standards. I shudder to think what the standards of that editor must be to make those sorts of statements. What an example of journalistic objectivity! We are not prophets of doom. I am one of those to whom he is referring. We are concerned politicians. We are concerned about Darwin and its surrounds. We are concerned about Darwin's people. We are concerned about our families. I am concerned about my family. I suggest that we would be delinquent in our duty if we did not draw attention to the danger inherent in B52s landing in Australia. Further on in the editorial, there is the comment:</PARA>
<PARA> But let's get this threat into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>It is then suggested that the United States has the same nuclear resources as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It has not, but that is not important. It is clear that the United States is concerned that Russia has an advantage. That does not give me any joy despite what the editor of the News may think. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of one nuclear bomb being exploded in anger would be to plunge the world into such total catastrophe that the significance of Darwin's aircraft landing strip would be paltry indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Darwin would be far less important, in a military sense, than hundreds of other United States installations in dozens of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an event would be rather like cracking a peanut with a sledgehammer. Use of a nuclear warhead to knock out Darwin airport borders on the ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the editor is not listening to what has been said or using the Press releases which have been sent to his newspaper, which is not unusual for him. Certainly, I have never suggested that a nuclear bomb would be used. It would not be necessary and it would not be appropriate. It would be more appropriate to use a conventional weapon. But the point I make is that if the B52s were not landing here, there would be no need to knock out the airstrip. The editor continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Darwin doesn't figure in the Kremlin's sight any more than countless more strategic targets. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that is the only reasonable comment in the whole editorial. That last comment, 'Darwin doesn't figure in the Kremlin's sights any more than countless more strategic targets', defeats the logic of the whole of the rest of the article. If it does not figure, good, let us keep it that way. It will figure if the B52s land. We have been warned, not for the first time. Let us heed the warning. Let the people be consulted before we have any suggestion that B52s might land in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> The next paragraph of the Governor-General's Speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> Beyond this my Government will concentrate its efforts heavily within the region, broadly defined, and on the Commonwealth of Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>I was very pleased to hear this statement. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will follow the excellent advice given 2 weeks ago by the late Senator Knight, who was an expert on foreign affairs, when he made an excellent speech in this place. Speaking of Indonesia, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we should act at any time at the expense of our national integrity of our international standing. If we are going to avoid that, or even the suggestion of it, in my view we will have to be rather more forceful and direct in our relationships with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to indicate that we have not been forceful and direct with Indonesia in the past. He gave the example of Timor. I support the stand made by Senator Knight on that occasion. Firstly, in relation to the refugee situation what will we do? Will we allow into Australia or regard as normal applicants those 2,500 people who want to enter Australia? In this regard, I was particularly pleased today to receive an answer to a question I put to Senator Durack on 27 November on the matter of East Timorese getting into Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nominations in favour of over 1,000 East Timorese have so far been received under the special humanitarian program arrangements announced on 7 October 1980 and processing of these in the State offices of my Department is going forward rapidly. It is expected that the majority of the nominations will be acceptable under the relaxed criteria established in respect to this program. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in his reply, Senator Durack said:</PARA>
<PARA> Two families approved under this program have already arrived in Australia and I expect that movement will shortly gain momentum and continue well into 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Government for that change in attitude because certainly, at one stage, very little attempt was being made to have people regarded as refugees and brought into Australia. Perhaps some of the comments made from this side of the chamber had some little effect on the Government and its change of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> What will we do in this area in respect of communication? We know that Fretilin has begun broadcasting again. Will we continue to hound that group of Australians in the Northern Territory who try to maintain family links with the people in East Timor and which provides the only vocal contact with the group in East Timor? Will we continue to harass them, maintain that they do not have a licence to operate and make it difficult for them to establish that vital contact? Will we continue to forbid the telecommunications centre in Darwin from receiving and relaying messages? Let us trust not. Let us hope that the words of the Governor-General will not have that effect. What will we do in relation to the arms sales to Indonesia? Will we be like the United States of America and Britain and others and supply patrol boats, planes and arms to Indonesia? Will we provide equipment to allow Indonesia to blockade East Timor and starve and rape its people into subjugation? Will we do that or will we be concerned about the East Timorese people. I hope that the Government will not follow the call of the former Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Critchley, when he said we should forget the past and look to the future like some sort of Victorian melodrama. It is not too late to save some of our former allies. It is not too late to take a stand. I commend the late Senator Knight's approach on this matter to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the economic aspect, the Governor-General had this to say in his Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, a continued need for the firm application of consistent policies to reduce inflation and to allow our national resources to be employed in areas where the highest economic return can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the question: The highest economic return to whom? Let us take one example, that of Ranger and the sale by the Government of the people's equity in Ranger. Honourable senators will recall Sir Edward Cohen of the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australia Ltd urging the Government to stay with Ranger until production. What did the Government do? It set up Energy Resources of Australia and in undignified haste allowed its friend in big business to make a 'killing'. There was no attempt to maximise the Australian people's involvement. In fact, to the contrary, every attempt was made to make sure that the small people of the Northern Territory and of Australia were not able to become involved in this venture. </PARA>
<PARA> The ERA prospectus states:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government agreement Peko and EZ enjoyed a more favourable position than the Commonwealth and the A.A.E.C. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is referring, of course, to the price ERA paid to Peko Mines Ltd and EZ for their interests in the project. What is the financial structure of ERA? Peko has 125 million shares or 30.8 per cent of the total shares. EZ has 125 million shares or 30.8 per cent of the total shares. Overseas participants have 98.4 million shares or 24 per cent of the total shares. The public has 57.9 million shares or 14 per cent of the total shares. Of the 94 million shares not issued, four million shares were held in reserve for another overseas power utility. This parcel has already been sold to a Swedish concern which is prepared to buy uranium from ERA. It paid $1.40, a 40 cent premium on the initial issue. However, that was considerably below the market value at the time which was $1.90. </PARA>
<PARA> ERA escaped criticism of the price charged because 'B' shares cannot be listed on Australian exchanges until 30 June 1984. In other words, although this transaction was within the letter of the law it was an unfortunate-and one might even say underhand-practice to give foreign buyers a considerable advantage over the locals. When ERA became listed on Australian stock exchanges the price hit $3 in a matter of hours. Its marked capital was over $1,000m. Overnight it leapt to stardom as Australia's eighth largest company. The Commonwealth-and therefore the Australian people-did not get a fair return for its investment. The $1 issue was a means whereby EZ and Peko offloaded the Commonwealth. That it was grossly undervalued can be seen by the frantic trading immediately shares became listed. When shares opened a report of the time stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On the first 2 days 2.9 million shares were traded-there is the suggestion the people in the know or friends of the stockbrokers snapped up the shares at the $1 issuing price. </PARA>
<PARA>They knew full well they were undervalued:</PARA>
<PARA> They were not serious investors in the sense of a long term commitment to the development of a Resource but only interested in quick profits. Many small Australian Investors missed out and some only got a small part of the number they requested. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Australian Government allowed millions of dollars of the Australian people's money to slip through its fingers. EZ and Peko were given a bargain. The Australian people paid the price. They paid the price in that small investors were not able to participate as fully as they wished to and they were denied the money which would have come from the sale and which, of course, would have eased the tax burden to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention now the involvement of the Federal Government in Northern Airlines and the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in at the moment. Northern Airlines has been a disaster from the beginning. It is quite clear, as I have said in this place before, that the Northern Territory Government chose the wrong airline, blocked the people's company-Trans-Australia Airlines-from getting in and gave the contract to East West Airlines Ltd. The chosen airline selected the wrong aircraft. The aircraft, the Metroliner, which was selected needed longer runways than were provided on most of the Aboriginal communities. Our colleague, Senator Cavanagh, has already drawn attention to the fact that money which should have been allocated to the welfare of Aboriginal people was used to extend the runways when that should not have been necessary. We know that the Metroliner had propellers which were slung too low and on the strips in the outback they were damaged in many cases. At $10,000 a throw per propeller it soon became an expensive operation. The Metroliner was not suitable for carrying out work in the Northern Territory and the schedules which were arranged were not those which would have been economically advantageous to the company. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I do not want to dwell on the Northern Territory Government involvement but rather the Commonwealth Government involvement. The problem Northern Airlines faced was that a surveillance contract would be allowed only if Nomads were used. Perhaps this could be reasonable except that the company had to wait up to 12 months for the delivery of the Nomads. In other words, the Government Aircraft Factories was not able to supply the Nomads and the Government would not allow the company to use any other aircraft. Northern Airlines was paid only for the section that was covered. In other words, it was behind the eight ball from the word go. The Chairman of East-West Airlines, Mr John Riley, lashed the Northern Territory Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I personally advised the Chief Minister in late November the company was not receiving the amount of government support and business which was part of the original regional airline concept. </PARA>
<PARA>This lack of support and business was resulting in losses which Northern could not afford to sustain. The content of that last comment and the quotation come from the Northern Territory News of 20 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> John Riley complained about the fact that there was a lack of government support. He gave as an example the fact that the Minister for Health and Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Tuxworth, spent $99,996-nearly $100,000-on air charter in one year. Often the aircharter he took ran parallel with schedules run by Northern Airlines in its flights from Tennant Creek. In other words, a good section of that $100,000 should have gone to Northern Airlines to help support the company. It is fair to say that Mr Tuxworth never supported the airline. In a telex message to his leader, Mr Everingham, on 18 April 1980, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are many complicating factors in the proposed introduction of East West Airlines-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, into the aerial medical service-</PARA>
<PARA>that are starting to worry me. I believe it has the potential to be a political time bomb, and for this reason I would like to keep the aerial medical operation separate as I do not believe we should allow this part of the Health Department to become involved in what might become a fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fair indication that Mr Tuxworth had a better appreciation of the political situation than did his leader. In the same telex Mr Tuxworth pointed out that the Northern Territory aerial medical service contract was being given to Northern Airlines at a tender price of $170,000 above the quote made by TAA. Of course, as we all know TAA had been efficiently carrying out the work for 20 years. Its quote was $170,000 below the quote from Northern Airlines, which was accepted. There was ample warning in the Press, from the people involved and from commentators that Northern Airlines was going bad, yet the Northern Territory Government did nothing about it. The winding down of the company meant the closure of the Alice Springs aircraft servicing facilities. That meant a loss to the Territory of a great store of expertise and an excellent training facility for the young people of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Suggestion has been made in some quarters that the Northern Territory Government indulged in complicity with Ansett Airlines of Australia so that it could step in when Northern Airlines finally tumbled. I have no evidence one way or the other but certainly this comment was made in the Press and was broadcast by radio stations. We do know that discussions were held with Murdoch over the chancellorship of the university just prior to the Northern Airlines blowup. It is unfortunate that investor confidence has been seriously shaken by this state of affairs in the Northern Territory. My concern is with the Federal Government involvement and the part that the Federal Government played in the downfall of Northern Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend Mr Dondas, the Minister for Transport in the Northern Territory, for a statement which I chanced upon only today. The Northern Territory News of the sixth of this month stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will consult with NT communities before deciding which airline will succeed failed Northern Airlines for regional operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport Minister, Mr Dondas, said today he would discuss details of Ansett and TAA proposals with people at Katherine, Tennant Creek and Nhulunbuy and the outlying centres. </PARA>
<PARA> ''It is important to find reactions to the two main proposals from the people who will be using the services'', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend him fully for going to the people and asking them what they want. There has been reluctance on the part of the Northern Territory Government, as there is on the part of the Federal Government, to go to the people and find out what they want. I commend Mr Dondas for this action. </PARA>
<PARA> The last section in the Governor-General's Speech I want to deal with briefly is the section headed 'Caring for People'. The Speech stated that concern 'is evident in the commitment to improve aboriginal health standards'. I commend this intention although I remind the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Certainly there is need for concern. There has been a drop in concern since the Labor Government was in power. There is no doubt about that. The Minister, who is a doctor, should know the relationship-and I am sure he does-between health and hygiene. At present the hygiene standards of a good many of the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory are to be deplored. </PARA>
<PARA> In a question I addressed to the Minister last week, I referred to a statement by one of the elders at Ngurrkurr that his community was 'the biggest rubbish dump' in the Northern Territory. It is not enough simply to provide finance. It is not enough for the Minister simply to say. 'We have made money available to the Northern Territory Government.' It is obvious that it is necessary for the Minister to arrange the spending of that money to be checked by his officials. Councils have insufficient money for municipal services. It is no good saying that the Northern Territory has the total responsibility because in 1967 the Federal Government received a clear mandate to accept responsibility. The Minister must have the courage to face the Premiers and the Chief Minister on this matter. It is too important a matter to be left to the simple expedient of pleasing political brothers. I maintain that the Governor-General's words are meaningless, that they are empty rhetoric, unless they are followed by firm and decisive action on the part of this Government. I trust that we will see that firm and decisive action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said previously by many honourable senators, the Address-in-Reply is the answer to the Governor-General's Speech. It is not his speech; it is a speech on behalf of the Government. I must say that I was not impressed by the pomp and ceremony of that occasion. I think it is about time we realised that this is not Westminster and that we are a long way away from it. Recently the former Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, made a speech on his retirement. On that occasion it was his own speech. I was pleased to see that in that speech he was critical of the actions of the former Governor-General. The speech was summed up by the Daily Telegraph of 28 November in the headline 'Cutler spells out Gov's role . . . and takes a shot at Kerr'. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the same day there was an article giving full details of his speech. It was headed 'Governors don't play politics-Sir Roden.' Sir Roden Cutler is certainly well remembered by all members of the State of New South Wales. I must say that I would think that less than half the population of New South Wales would say the same things about Kerr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Senator Davidson moved the Address-in-Reply motion he spoke at length on the election result in his home State of South Australia, as did Senator Teague. It is my intention tonight to speak about the result in New South Wales in particular. Senator Teague said in his speech of 25 February 1981 that a number of Government members were defeated by small margins. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, a tinge of disappointment in the actual result of the latest election in that I believe too many of our Liberal colleagues were defeated by very narrow margins. I believe 13 lost their seats. That is disappointing because I believe the Government's program, its legislative achievments and its fulfilment of policy promises were sufficient to have won it an even better result than the good result it achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred to what I considered to be lies in the Liberal Party's advertising campaign. I was about to refer to an example given in an article in the Australian Financial Review. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Liberal Party election advertising has caused more than a few ripples in diplomatic circles, as British officials comb England for a #2 milk shake. </PARA>
<PARA> British Government tourist authorities have asked British diplomatic representatives in Australia to complain to the Liberal Party on its election advertising, which depicts England along with a number of other countries as ravaged by rising costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The manager of the British Tourist Authority in Australia, Mr David Morrey-Jones told the Financial Review that he had written to the British Consulate-General in Sydney complaining of the advertisements and asking that the matter be taken up with the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also what I consider to be a scurrilous advertising campaign on the capital gains tax issue, particularly in New South Wales newspapers. With a fortnight to go in the election campaign I received many complaints at my office about the advertisements that were being run in the Murdoch Press. I expected that reaction in the Sydney metropolitan area because at the moment the cost of the average dwelling is $63,000 and it is rapidly rising towards the $100,000 mark. Knowing what their homes were worth, people became worried by the sorts of advertisements that were run in the Murdoch Press. But I was amazed at what I was told after the election when I went to a number of rural electorates throughout New South Wales, including Calare. I was told that the word of mouth campaign that was being run in small country towns, such as Oberon, was that everybody who owned a house would have to pay a special tax if a Labor government was elected. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said about the role of the opinion polls in the last election campaign. People have said that they were wrong and that they will not have any influence in future campaigns. I do not think that they were necessarily wrong, but I do believe that the results of polls published in the last week were based on information at least a week old. I believe that the polls of a fortnight or even a week before the election showing there would be a Labor government were, in fact, correct. In New South Wales, which is my State, there was a disappointing House of Representatives result. The Labor Party won only two seats and lost one. Despite that, the House of Representatives result showed that the Labor Party polled 46.4 per cent of the primary vote as against the Government's 46.2 per cent and on a two-party preferred system the Labor Party polled 50.4 per cent of the vote and the Government polled 49.6 per cent of the vote, yet the Labor Party finished with 18 seats as opposed to the 25 seats held by the Government. We achieved an excellent Senate result in New South Wales, where three Labor senators were elected. </PARA>

It was the only other major party in the whole of Australia to get three senators elected. I will refer to the result in Western Australia later in my speech. One of the aspects of the result in New South Wales was that a higher proportion of the people who voted for the Labor Party in the House of Representatives in New South Wales also voted for the Labor Party in the Senate, despite the increased informal vote between the House of Representatives and the Senate. In fact, the Labor vote between the House of Representatives and the Senate dropped only 1.7 per cent. This was an excellent result.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In New South Wales the Government vote in the Senate dropped by 2.9 per cent. It was, therefore, the worst State for the Government in Australia. One of the main reasons for that is that it did not run a sufficiently tight ticket. I will refer to that matter later. In New South Wales in 10 seats the Labor Party's Senate vote was higher than its House of Representatives vote. The differences were as follows: Calare, 0.1 per cent; Cunningham, 0.2 per cent; Farrer, 1.4 per cent; Granydler, 1.3 per cent; Gwydir, 2.1 per cent; Mitchell, 0.4 per cent; Newcastle, 0.6 per cent; Paterson, 3.1 per cent; Riverina, 1.8 per cent; and Sydney, 2.8 per cent. In four seats-Barton, Calare, Phillip and Riverina-the Labor vote was higher than the Government's vote. In other words, the vote that Senator Douglas McClelland received as the No. 1 candidate on the Labor ticket was higher than the vote that Sentator Carrick received. The Labor Party was unsuccessful in the House of Representatives election in Barton, Calare, Phillip and Riverina. It is probably worth while pointing out that the Government received the donkey vote in the House of Representatives in those four seats. In Eden-Monaro, Macarthur and Lowe total votes received by Senator Douglas McClelland and by Senator Carrick were extremely close. I think there were a number of reasons for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the result for Labor in New South Wales was a very good one, but I believe that we undertook our best ever Senate campaign. There was excellent teamwork throughout the State. Over the years my colleague Senator Douglas McClelland has done a tremendous amount of work in rural areas. I believe that he received a very high personal vote on top of the vote that the party could have expected for the Senate in rural areas. I think this was proved by the fact that I received a higher personal popular vote in those areas to which I am allocated by the party than in the areas to which I am not allocated. Whilst it is impossible to prove that Senator Douglas McClelland received a higher personal vote in these electorates, I think the statistics that I gave earlier go a long way towards proving it. We did not look for a personal vote for our No. 2 or No. 3 candidates. We stressed the importance of voting for the ticket. This was unlike the Government's campaign. Senator Puplick, who was No. 3 on the Government ticket, was actively looking for a No. 1 vote. His literature seeking a No. 1 vote was available in a number of garages and motoring establishments throughout the State and a number of other organisations in New South Wales sent out literature on his behalf asking for a No. 1 vote. There is nothing wrong with that, of course, but I believe that it led to a higher informal vote. </PARA>

The result of the last election is very bad news for the hopes of the Liberal and National Country parties in the Legislative Council election which is to be held in New South Wales this year. Senator Teague in his speech on 25 February spoke of the recent Federal by-election results. I wish to make some remarks about those results and the figures obtained in the New South Wales by-elections that were held recently. I wish to read from an article that appeared in the Australian newspaper. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The results of the four elections in NSW on Saturday indicate that the Wran Government could be returned with a majority of 46 in the State election this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures on the by-elections show a swing to the Government conservatively estimated at 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> On the new boundaries, a similar swing in the State election would give the Government the Liberal seats of Pittwater and Maitland, the National Country Party seats of Goulburn, Orange, Clarence and Bathurst, and the new seat of Northern Tablelands. </PARA>
<PARA> Political observers have predicted that Willoughby and Albury could go to the Liberals, but a 3 per cent swing would retain them for the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> The swing would also mean the Liberals have no chance of holding Hornsby. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would therefore hold 72 seats to the coalition's 26, compared with the present 63-35 split. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the vote is unchanged, the new boundaries will give the Government a 36-seat majority. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not include the South Coast seat held by Mr John Hatton, an independent who usually votes with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The swing would mean that the Opposition would have no chance of keeping Bligh or of picking up Manly where the former . . . Lord Mayor, Mr Nelson Meers, is the endorsed Liberal candidate. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not about to say that this will happen. I am not about to say that the results of the by-elections in New South Wales will necessarily be carried over to the New South Wales elections to be held later this year, but I think there is more chance of that happening than of the Federal Government's being able to repeat its by-election figures at the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I quoted from that article I was referring to the New South Wales Senate campaign. I wish to make some remarks about the work of Senator-elect Bruce Childs, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales and who will become a member of the Senate after 30 June. I believe he produced what was the best how-to-vote card of any party in any State. He decided that in New South Wales the Labor Party's how-to-vote card would have the precise dimensions of the ballot paper, that it would be in full colour and that it would use a green border of the same colour as the House of Representatives ballot paper. Many members of our party were critical of this decision. They thought it would cause confusion among the voters and would increase the informal vote. But after looking at the statistics I believe that his decision in fact reduced the informal vote. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a straight distribution of preferences by the Labor Party in New South Wales. We did not distribute our preferences on an ideological basis as we did in 1975 and 1977. The voting procedure, which had to be followed, was printed on the how-to-vote card in eight languages. Again, I believe that this led to a lower informal vote throughout the State. There was a near 100 per cent distribution of the Labor Party how-to-vote cards in the letter boxes and roadside mail boxes throughout New South Wales. I believe that this also significantly reduced the informal vote, which in New South Wales was 9.38 per cent in comparison with the 9.7 per cent national figure and the 11.2 per cent figure for Victoria. I think those figures emphasise what I have been saying. We achieved this result in New South Wales even though it had the largest number of candidates of any State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor scrutineers reported that unlike the elections of 1974 and 1975, it was the Government that was losing the majority of votes in the strong Labor seats. It was the Government that was losing the most as a percentage within the smaller total. I should mention here that the concerted campaign that was run in such electorates as Sydney and Grayndler has certainly brought about a vast improvement. The Labor Party has won many thousands of votes since the events of 1974. In New South Wales we and our scrutineers were determined that the events of 1974 would not be repeated. We believed in 1974 that Peter Westerway in New South Wales and Senator Colston, as he is now, would both have a reasonable chance of being elected had the party been able to achieve the proper scrutineering that we are now able to achieve. Of course, if either Westerway or Colston had won, Australian political history would have been changed. </PARA>
<PARA> We conducted a very strong campaign to train our scrutineers. The Assistant Secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales, Mr Steve Loosely, and I toured the State over a 12-month period running a series of scrutineering seminars. We estimate that we spoke personally to over 2,000 scrutineers. As a result the party was able to man all branches of the Commonwealth Electoral Office prior to the polling day and therefore to run a concerted campaign for postal votes. But in New South Wales we had to contend with a very rough campaign for postal votes run by the Liberal Party. I wish to give the Senate some indication of the sort of campaign run by the Liberal Party. One elector in the electorate of Warringah, Mrs Audrey Isobel Parrett, received an official form from the Commonwealth-an application for a postal vote. This form was completely filled in. It showed her address, occupation, subdivision and electorate, but also stated why she was applying for a postal vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether I should thank my colleague, Senator McLaren, for giving me an audience. Before the suspension of the sitting, I was speaking about the successful Labor campaign in New South Wales for the last Senate election which resulted in our winning three of the five positions. I talked about our campaign to win as large a percentage of the postal vote as possible. Of course, whilst we certainly did not gain a majority of the postal votes in New South Wales I referred to the fact that we had to contend with a very rough campaign which was run by the Liberals. I intended to use stronger words than 'a rough campaign' but I will leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also referred to a particular tactic and raised the case of a Mrs Parrett from Mosman who received, throught the mail, an application for a postal vote and a postal ballot paper. I gave her name and address and said that she received this application in which all of the grounds for her to seek an application for a postal vote were crossed out except the one that said that she was seriously ill or infirm. Her address was given. Also in that envelope was an official envelope addressed to the Divisional Returning Officer for the Electoral Division of Warringah. It came in an envelope marked 'If unclaimed please return to the Northern Regional Office, P.O. Box 218, Willoughby, 2068.' No reference was made to the fact that that was the address of the regional office of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. Also enclosed in the envelope was a how-to-vote guide for the House of Representatives, Michael Mackellar for Warringah and a guide on how-to-vote for the Government in the Senate. It was authorised by J. S. C. McDouall, northern metropolitan region, 128A Penshurst Street, Willoughby, 2068. That is the address of the northern metropolitan regional organiser of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that during Federal election campaigns some rough and dubious tactics are used to try to get postal votes. The very fact that this mail arrived at somebody's house unsolicited-I have given details of how the application was filled in-is a clear breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have been asked by the people concerned to raise this matter in the Senate because Mrs Parrett died some time before this application was sent to her. Her son, who came to see me, was very disturbed about the fact that his mother had this application filled out and sent to her as though she were still alive and asking for a postal ballot paper for the last election. It was typical of the tactics that were used by the Liberal Party in New South Wales to obtain a majority of the postal votes in the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a whole file of these complaints here but I will give the details of only another one. Again the ballot paper that arrived was filled out completely for Mr David Marshall Lyndon James, of 3 Bolwarra Road, Elanora. The grounds on which he was seeking a postal ballot paper were that he could not vote on the day because of his membership of a religious order and because of his religious beliefs. Again, the how-to-vote card was authorised by the northern metropolitan region of the Liberal Party. The envelope that it came in was from the Willoughby Office of the Liberal Party and, of course, the person did not seek that postal ballot paper. Mr James is a councillor of the Warringah Shire Council in Sydney and he won his position on that council, standing as an endorsed Australian Labor Party candidate. Yet he received an application for a postal ballot paper from the Liberal Party which also outlined how he should vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were getting very desperate but it did not work. As said, I believe that even the posting of the form was a breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and I will do something about that matter at a later stage. In the New South Wales campaign that I referred to, all of our Federal and State members of parliament, union officials, and members of the party rank and file were rostered as scrutineers. They responded magnificently, especially in the rural areas of New South Wales. We had Labor Party scrutineers in all of the 43 Commonwealth electoral offices. The result was that at a crucial stage of the vote, when the corrected figures were put in, because of the work of the scrutineers, we found that the total vote of Mr Nile, who was the recipient of the donkey vote in New South Wales and the Australian Democrat candidate, Mr McLean, who was second on the ballot paper, dropped by 29,000. Both Senator Puplick, the Government candidate and I, the Labor Party candidate, gained votes and at that stage the Government's lead over the Democrats was only 22,500 votes which points out how the scrutineering was absolutely crucial to the result and how the Labor Party gained victory as a result of it. However, it does raise the question: Why is this necessary? Honourable senators may ask: Why have I dwelt for so long in this speech on the mechanical aspects of the campaign and of the polling? Senate voting and the Senate voting system is antiquated. The system, as we know it at the moment, is a lottery. The Government lost ground in New South Wales. If the Government looks at the position that its candidates drew on the ballot paper on an Australia-wide basis, it would realise why it lost. It might say that it was bad luck but it is the luck of the system. The system needs a complete overhaul. I consider any system, under which one in every 10 voters in New South Wales casts an informal vote to be a joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make some brief remarks about the situation in Western Australia because of my experience in the recount of the Senate result in 1975 in New South Wales. I believe that if the votes in Western Australia were counted again, either in Perth or Canberra, we would get a different result. I say that because in the recount that occurred in 1975 in New South Wales, the Labor Party won on the first count by 854 votes-that is, by 19 votes per Federal electorate throughout the State. That is very similar to the result that just elected the last candidate in Western Australia. About the same number of votes per electorate were involved. But when there was a second count I finished up winning by a total of 2,016 votes. People said that that was not a great difference-854 to 2,016 out of a total of three million votes-but what I would like to point out is that the total formal vote in that count dropped by over 10,000. On those results, I consider the system at the moment to be a disgrace. In the recount in New South Wales, the big losers were the party that gained the majority of the votes-that is the Government-and the party that received the donkey vote. If there were a recount in Western Australia the same situation would apply. The party that received the donkey vote and the party that received the majority of votes, in this case, the Government, would be the big losers. I believe that on a recount the final result would be completely different. I am not saying that there would be a different senator; I am not saying that the third Liberal candidate would not win if the votes were recounted. I am saying that there is a possibility that that might not occur. I am 100 per cent certain that there would be a different result in terms of how many votes that candidate would win or lose by. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of all these factors, I think one of the crucial things facing this Parliament in the next three years will be the issue of electoral reform. I think it is absolutely imperative that we have a new look at the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This has been promised by successive governments and by successive Ministers. When Senator Withers was the Minister in charge of the Act he promised a complete overhaul and an updating of the Act. It is not my intention to speak at length on electoral reform, but I do think it is crucial that we look at whether candidates for the Senate should pay deposits and the method of nomination. There is no doubt that in New South Wales we had joke candidates. We had disc jockeys and rock groups standing for the Senate for one reason only-not to be elected but to seek publicity for their own activities. I think there has to be a strong look by this Senate at what constitutes a genuine candidate. We have to look very carefully at whether we should make it essential that people number every square on the ballot paper. We ought to look at whether we have an optional preferential system as we have for the Legislative Council in New South Wales. We ought to look at whether we need a list system such as operates in a number of countries in Western Europe at the moment. It is not my intention tonight to go into all the different changes that I believe should occur to the Commonwealth Electoral Act; I will save them for a later date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise again to take part in this debate on the Address-in-Reply and in doing so I want to make a few remarks regarding the amendment which was moved by my leader, Senator Button, on 5 March 1981. As honourable senators are aware, I spoke earlier and at length. I propose tonight not to speak at length but I would like to refresh the memories of Government senators in particular regarding the wording of the amendment moved by my colleague. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the following words be added to the Address-in-Reply:</PARA>
<PARA> 'But the Senate is of the opinion that the Government-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Has failed to adequately respond to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) record unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a high and worsening level of inflation;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) reduced and falling family living standards; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the highest taxation burden in the nation's history. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Allows unsatisfactory administration of foreign investment guidelines which permit an uncritical and open-door policy to the takeover of Australian industry and resources to continue; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Makes no long-term provision for assistance to manufacturing industry and farming industries, which are likely to be severely disadvantaged as a result of successive exchange rate revaluations and substantially increased imports in the context of resources development'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is almost a blanket motion pointing up the weaknesses of the Government's approach to the Address-in-Reply. I know that we have heard some very pretty speeches from Government senators who were very proud of what they were doing, but we on this side of the chamber find much which we want to criticise. I think the most adequate way in which to do that is to illustrate our points of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> When this country went to the polls in the last general election in 1980, nothing was said by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), or by any of his Ministers that they were considering whether to impose a new tax, that they were considering whether to impose further restrictions on the national health service, that they proposed to take away the unemployment benefit from those under the age of 18 years, or that they proposed to appoint a razor gang to further pare back the Public Service and make it less competent than it ought to be. I could go on for the next 25 minutes detailing the sorts of things that were hidden when the election campaign was going through its various phases. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer first of all to a factual case in relation to Medibank. I received today a letter from a lady who pointed out that if Medibank or the national medical service was no longer going to cover the cost of acupuncture, she would suffer. Before I quote from her letter I point out that for ethical reasons I do not propose to name the doctors but they are named in this document if any one wants to have a look at it. Her letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I always seem to write when I have a problem and this time this is a formal request to voice my protest in parliament . . . Sounds grim . . . anyway what it is-is: I have just heard that acupuncture is going to be stopped as a medical benefit. True or not I don't really know . . . As you know I suffer (suffered) terribly from asthma. Records in the Cairns Base Hospital will show it was completely out of control and I can't for the life of me remember the name of the doctor I had in Cairns, but if need be I can-and he would vouch for this. He recommended we sell everything and get out of Cairns or it would be curtains! At this stage I was on everything imaginable and even was having 'aminophylin' drips in hospital. Well, 18 months ago we went to Rockhampton where the climate was drier and again spent most of the time in hospital. Records there will show this. The chest specialist I had was Dr . . . Here in Rocky I met up with a lady doctor, Dr . . . of . . . Street. She practised acupuncture and said the asthma could be controlled with acupuncture. Well, when you are desperate you try anything. She also said that it was the heat and muggy weather and that we should go to a cooler climate. So . . . off again--</PARA>
<PARA> They are now living at Landsborough, not very far north of Brisbane, just off the main highway in the hills. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>three months ago we came to the Maleny range, near Caloundra and I go to another doctor who does acupunture every month on me and for the first time in my life I can honestly say the asthma is controlled or I even feel that it is cured. I do not take any medication now-and I had been on cortisone. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose most honourable senators would be aware that cortisone is one of the more powerful drugs. It does cure some people but it has many side effects which can be quite dangerous. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I have had no asthma attack since January last year-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, over 12 months-</PARA>
<PARA>I have been having the acupuncture since January last year. My doctor here is Dr . . . ., Caloundra. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . could you please present this as a case history for the use of acupuncture. It costs about $29.00 for about 2 hours once per month and I get 100 per cent back through Medibank. You are free to use my name, address, doctors, anything you wish. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a plea from the heart from a lady whom I have known for the last 17 or 18 years and who has suffered very badly with asthma. Of course Mr Fraser has now made this announcement. I would like to see him stick to the portfolios which he has allocated to himself. I think I saw today in a newsletter that someone suggested that very thing-that Mr Fraser not poke his nose into industrial affairs and that there be some change of portfolios because people have been big noting themselves about the Qantas Airways Ltd dispute in particular; but I will have more to say about that in a moment. I am glad to see that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) is in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major complaint I have-I think it is well covered by the references in the amendment to the Address-in-Reply-concerns the inability of some Ministers to come to grips with their portfolios, the inability of other Ministers to be able to send out an acknowledgment to the effect that they have received a complaint and the inability of some Ministers to even deal with the complaint at all. On 5 March 1981, I sent a telegram by urgent rate to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). I do not like sending urgent telegrams because they are more costly than the ordinary form of telegram, but sometimes there is no alternative. I addressed the telegram to the Minister in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> Am advised that three Bairnsdale Aboriginal organisations, the medical service, the housing co op and the alcohol rehabilitation service--</PARA>
<PARA>which is about to operate-</PARA>
<PARA>have been raided by CIB and books and cheque accounts confiscated. </PARA>
<PARA> Am informed by local NAC rep that this was done at the instigation of the local National Country Party member. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> Can you also advise what action you are able to take to correct this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>I know today is only 10 March but I also know that that telegram did not even have to cross Kings Hall before it was delivered to the Minister's office. I have had no response to it. I do not know what has happened. It seems to me to be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs when people can march into organisations-in this case the Criminal Investigation Bureau in Victoria-and search houses as well as offices of the organisations which I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a little more detail of which to inform honourable senators. On Wednesday, 4 March, the day before I sent the telegram, the CIB wrote to the Aboriginal organisation centred in Bairnsdale where Mrs Nessie Skuta is not only the National Aboriginal Conference representative but also in theory is the administrator of the Aboriginal medical service, the community housing co-operative and the as yet not established alcohol rehabilitation centre. Mrs Raelene Dent, who is related to Mrs Skuta, is the administrator of the medical service. Mrs Skuta and her daughter together with the regional administrator of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs were in the building when members of the CIB arrived. They had a warrant to confiscate cheque books and accounts and hold them until officers of the fraud squad arrived from Melbourne. There is a number of accusations, apparently with little or no substance. We are supposed to live in a democracy. This is supposed to be a free country, but this sort of thing happens and, when it is referred to the Minister, neither he nor his advisers-four days later-can say what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I received another letter today from the chairman of the Community Council, Mr Aia at Sai Bai Island, which is within two or three miles of the Papuan coast. In that letter, Mr Aia told me that, on about 26 September last year, he wrote to the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs mentioning the Community Development Employment Project and asking whether money could be provided. Sai Bai is a coral or sand cay. Once within recent memory, Sai Bai Island was covered by a very high tide, probably of subterranean influence caused by an earthquake or by some other subterranean upheaval. But, nevertheless, the people there were given a grant some four or five years prior to that tide to build a rock sea wall to keep the water off the island. That work ran out about a year ago and there is no alternative employment in that area at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A school teacher is paid below award rates. Labourers are paid below award rates just to look after the community. There are many people who do not have jobs at all. That is another matter on which the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and successive Ministers have dithered. The then Minister and the Department backed off when Mr Justice Matthews made an order, I think in May two years ago, to the effect that award wages were to be paid to the communities. That great leader of democracy, Mr Porter, now retired-thank heavens-flew down here. The husband of the senator-elect who will appear in this chamber either after next Thursday or after 30 June said that the Queensland Government could not afford the $7m the Sai Bai people wanted. The Aborigines of these communities were deprived for many months more of an adequate wage structure. Finally, a decision was arrived at which was not the rate for the job which is expected by everybody, including politicians. There are some politicians who complain that they do not get the correct rate for the job. Nevertheless these people have to paddle their own canoe-if one chooses to use that slang phrase-yet, as far back as last September, the chairman of this community wrote to the Minister. He got a reply from his private secretary about two weeks. There has been a wall of silence ever since. In desperation, he wrote to me about a week ago. I received the letter today. The letter is now in the pipeline to the new Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume. I do not know what will happen about it, Mr President, but it is just not good enough when people are left in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of other matters to which I wish to refer but I, like Senator Sibraa, think these are matters which ought to be transferred to a more major debate. But I wish to refer to three other departments. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has been a type of lone ranger system for a long time. I do not blame the staff of that Department; I think they are highly competent people who are handicapped by an unimaginative Minister, a minister who is afraid to take any initiatives and who looks at the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System as the answer to everybody's prayer and who counts migrants, particularly those from the Asian areas, as numbers on a chart. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to Christmas 1980, a young Chinese couple from Hong Kong who had been in Australia studying for a year or so came to my office hoping that they could stay in Australia. It took them from then until the end of February for the Minister to decide that they could not stay in Australia. It is not much use sending urgent telegrams. One might as well send a carrier pigeon with a note in its beak, not tied to its leg because I do not think some ministers would know how to undo an ordinary knot. I suggest that we might tape messages to the pigeon's beak. But when that young fellow came into my office there was a job for him at Rockhampton, a provincial city in Queensland, where a handicapped children's home had been trying for many months to get a teacher with his qualifications. But the Minister had gone on holidays immediately after the election and did not come back until just before Parliament was called to meet, or was unable to read his correspondence or had handed the matter over to the bureaucracy with all sorts of threats as to what it should do about it. It surprised me that that job, which had been open for many months, was subsequently filled. The authorities could not wait to see whether this young Chinese man was able to take the job. He left Queensland, lived with relatives in Sydney and then had the opportunity of two other jobs, but he finally obtained a job as a headmaster in a school in Hong Kong, which he could not afford to leave if he was not to get a job in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have let pass through our hands a teacher with the qualifications that are not held by many Australian teachers. He would have been of great value in the handicapped children's school with the sort of knowledge which he, as a teacher, can impart. He finally went back to Hong Kong. I have had a letter from him. After he went back to Hong Kong, I got a letter from the Minister referring to my urgent letter of a date, many weeks previously, and stating that they could not stay here. That is what we do. There are many other cases like that. I can quote a case of a Filipino lady who runs her own accountancy practice in Sibu, a city in the Philippines and who has been trying to come to Australia with her little family for approximately seven years. Every time the Minister brings out new guidelines, I put in a fresh application. Not only does this lady run her own business but also is her husband an expert in his own field. When one looks at the list of job vacancies, one sees that for many months accountants have been in demand because we cannot fill the vacant positions in Australia. I know that there are problems in relation to the second-class degrees which are given in the Philippines universities but nevertheless if somebody is able to--</PARA>

Perhaps we will never ever get the opportunity to bring another qualified person to Australia. I am not saying that we ought to bring migrants in when there is a surplus of labour under the different headings, the professions or the trades, but there ought to be the possibility of bringing people in when we cannot fill the positions from within our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Floods again occurred in north Queensland this year. I have a very close knowledge of what was happening to our main roads system, if one can call it that. People talk about the Birdsville Track. We have a road which runs from Brisbane to Cairns which is more popularly known as the Bruce track. On maps it is shown as the Bruce Highway. But Highway 1 runs out through Borroloola and, if one has ever travelled Highway 1 between Burketown and Doomadgee Mission, a distance of 60 or 70 miles, one would wonder why one ever took a vehicle to the area. The local member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) does not take a vehicle there; he flies over the area. When Ministers go there they do not go by vehicle; they fly. In fact, very few National Country Party politicians or Liberal Party politicians have ever tried to cover that track by vehicle, but it is still part of Highway 1. The situation is worse than that because there has been inadequate build-up of the main roads in the north and far north of Queensland. I received a delightful letter only a couple of days ago from Mr Hunt, who said: 'It is not my fault. Blame Mr Hinze; he is laundering the funds'. They are not the precise words he used but that is precisely what he meant. Money is given in bulk to the State governments for them to decide what they want to do with it. </PARA>

The Premier of Queensland said that he could not possibly go; he would wait until the floods went down. The Premier flew, mind you; he did not drive. The area was sorely neglected. Many millions of dollars worth of damage has been done in that area and we have still not seen the colour of one single dollar of Commonwealth money. It is a bit like the Burdekin dam proposal, but that is another story which is worth an hour's debate in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I want to make concerns the great encouragement that the Leader of the Government in the Senate gave in this House today to what he called the spontaneous demonstrations against industrial problems in this country. A lot of those industrial problems start right here and in the other place with the inability of Government members to conceive or even to assess what is going on in the big world. They live in their own cosy places. They are more at home in the Melbourne Club, the Sydney Tattersalls Club, the Queensland Club, the Commonwealth Club and in the cosy bars around Parliament House where they discuss the problems of this country. That is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The demonstration was not a spontaneous demonstration; it was Government inspired. I know for a fact that employers were encouraging their employees to go into the streets of Sydney, New Zealand and Brisbane by not docking their pay. If a person is young and can be influenced, obviously he will take the easy way out if he is afraid that the boss would not keep the job for him if he did not do the right thing by the boss. The alleged spontaneous demonstration will only aggravate the situation; it will not do a thing to dampen it down. I do not believe in wildcat strikes; I have never supported them. In fact, in my years of association with trade unions I never had a strike. There are other ways of frightening the wits out of bosses and getting them to the arbitration courts. </PARA>

<PARA> Sentor KEEFFE-I do not think the honourable senator quite knows what she is talking about, so I am not going to dwell on what she is saying. There are many ways of getting around it. In most instances the provocation is caused by employers and foremen on jobs who want to create an incident. I recall what happened once in the far north-west of Australia, in Senator Walsh's country, when the people running the mines found that there was a surplus of minerals going to Japan. They wanted to close down their operations for a couple of months in order to overcome the surplus. There is nothing like starting a strike to do that, so the employers provoked the workers into a strike and their plan succeeded quite well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick talked about other demonstrations we have had from time to time. I can recall when we had an Aboriginal embassy outside Parliament House, when we marched against Vietnam and when we marched, as we still do, against the use of uranium and all its by-products. They were spontaneous and organised. None of us makes any apology for that. Coming back to Senator Carrick's comments, the same sort of tactics were used at Bamaga on Cape York and a group of other Aboriginal settlements when the Premier of Queensland was to visit the area. The Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs people-undoubtedly on the instructions of the Premier-were told that all workers could have time off so they could listen to the Premier utter his words of wisdom on what his Government would do to support Aborigines. The workers were also told that if they did not turn up at the meeting their pay would be docked. What did they do? A couple of them did not turn up; they went fishing. They did not want to listen to the Premier. Their pay was docked. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was at the settlement some time later a number of those people were told that if they came to my meeting their pay would be docked anyway. Some of them came along and, as far as I know, their pay was not docked. The threat was a good one. These meetings are not spontaneous. Senator Carrick, who indulges in reading Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, gets carried away in a state of euphoria and actually believes statements he makes because Mr Murdoch says so in the Murdoch Press. I am very sad to relate that. I hope that Senator Carrick does not perform that sort of miracle again tomorrow, the next day and after that because these demonstrations were not spontaneous. I would like to go on for a couple of hours, Mr President, but I know that you are watching the clock and so am I. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech and the amendment moved thereto by Senator Button. The outstanding attribute of the Governor-General's Speech, apart from its pomposity, is the startling contrast between the rhetoric and the reality of the Fraser Government. In the third paragraph of the Governor-General's Speech it is claimed, on behalf of the Government, that the Government's policies are designed to work for the well being of all Australians. That statement is from a government whose two proudest boasts are that it is alone amongst the Western nations, including Europe and North America, in abolishing all forms of taxation on wealth and capital transfer in a country which has two million people living in poverty and that it has consistently repudiated a resources rent tax which not only is more efficient in purely technical economic terms but also would ensure that the benefits of the impending mineral development would be more widely spread in the community. Later in the Governor-General's Speech we heard a mass of contradictions when it was said that the Government's policies:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . have been given coherence by an economic strategy which is designed to restore economic stability. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> This strategy has already resulted in an encouraging pick-up in activity and employment and a marked strengthening in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>This was asserted by the Governor-General on behalf of the Government. It is correct that over the last 18 months, for the first time since the mid-1970s, there has been a significant increase in the number of people in employment. In fact, there has been an increase of 180,000 employed persons in the last 18 months. The reasons for this have nothing to do with the economic strategy enunciated by the Fraser Government back in 1975 and 1976 and rhetorised about ever since. The reasons for the economic recovery in the last 18 months can indeed be found in the fact that the Fraser Government has substantially repudiated those economic policies. For example, the money supply growth in the previous two years has run well above the Government's planned targets. Real wages have increased in the last 12 months and this has shown up in higher consumer spending. Despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, government spending, which had been increasing slightly in the 1978 and 1979 Budgets, increased in real terms by 3 per cent in the 1980 Budget. To the degree that there has been an economic recovery in the last 18 months, it has happened not because the Fraser Government has adhered to its stated economic policies but because it has, to a substantial extent, repudiated them in practice, if not in rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic, in view of the present controversy between the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the permanent head of his Department, that at the end of January at the Agricultural Outlook Conference John Stone should have delivered what was not only a highly political but also an intellectually dishonest speech. Reiterating high Tory dogma disguised as economic verity, he asserted, firstly, that inflation was caused by growth of the money supply; secondly, Budget deficits increased the money supply; and thirdly, rigid control of government expenditure has reduced the deficit in recent years. There were no qualifications, no exceptions and, of course, as always with John Stone, no possibility of error. In fact all three propositions are fallacious. Money supply growth can be a cause of inflation, but does not necessarily cause inflation. Budget deficits do not increase money supply if they are funded by domestic borrowing. Government expenditure in real terms has increased in each of the last three years, and by about 3 per cent in the current year. The deficit, it is true, has come down in that period, not because of rigid controls on government expenditure but because taxation has gone up. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that would be known to any second-year economics student who had a look at the Budget Papers, one can only assume that the Treasury Secretary had decided to massage the prejudices of his audience and to proselytise his own political ideology with the aid of economic fallacy. He, like the Government, boasted at length of the employment growth of the last 15 or 18 months, the cause of which he had no doubt, of course, was the economic policies of John Stone and of the Fraser Government. Heretics who had doubted the infallibility of John Stone and of the Fraser Government were for ever vanquished, he implied. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic trouble with those claims by both the Government and its Treasury Secretary is that the employment growth of which they both brag took place in a period of rising inflation. A fundamental tenet of earlier Stone and Government encyclicials was that rising employment and rising inflation were mutually exclusive. When that final point was drawn to John Stone's attention at the Agricultural Outlook Conference, he assured what he must have taken to be a very credulous audience that the reason that employment had grown in spite of the rising inflation of the last 18 months or two years was that it was known that inflation would turn downwards again, as indeed it had done in the last couple of quarters. So monetarism has now been amended yet again apparently. Monetarism and inflationary expectation theories of unemployment have been amended yet again. They always incorporated infinitely variable time lags. They now apparently have been amended so that the time lags can be positive as well as negative. Shortly afterwards in the Governor-General's Speech this was asserted:</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, a continuing need for the firm application of consistent policies to reduce inflation and to allow our national resources to be employed in areas where the highest economic return can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>There would be little disagreement with that statement in itself. There would be a great deal of disagreement from anyone who has actually watched the Fraser Government's performance as to whether it has actually done that. When confronted with difficult political decisions about the structure of the economy, the Fraser Government has always done the opposite; it has always taken the soft political option. It was further asserted:</PARA>
<PARA> A primary objective of my Government will be to continue to fight against inflation. Inflation results in fewer jobs and lower living standards for everybody. Firm anti-inflationary fiscal and monetary policies are therefore essential to any lasting solution to the problems of unemployment, the achieving of higher growth and the more rapid raising of living standards, on a sustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the facts that I mentioned earlier; that is, that far from such economic growth that has taken place in the last 18 months taking place in a period of falling inflation and falling inflationary expectation, the empirical fact is that it has taken place in a period of rising inflation and rising inflationary expectations, a phenomen which both John Stone and the Government consistently asserted, and continue to assert, could not happen. I do not suggest, of course, that inflation necessarily causes economic growth; just that the real world is much more complex than is acknowledged by pontifical zealots like the Treasury Secretary or realised by simplistic ideologues like the Prime Minister. The speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope--</PARA>
<PARA>Wait for it-</PARA>
<PARA>for reducing the burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>That talk of restrained public expenditure and reduced taxation comes from a government which currently presides over the highest levels of taxation and the highest levels of government expenditure, as a proportion of gross domestic product, that this country has ever known. I pass no judgment on whether it is a good or a bad thing to have those levels of taxation and government expenditure, but it is again an indisputable fact that that is the case. Far from restraining public expenditure and reducing taxation, the Government presides over the highest levels of both ever recorded; and it has the audacity to insult the intelligence of this Parliament and of the nation by putting such pap and drivel into a speech for the opening of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> That situation is not likely to change. Last October-I think it was the first-six weeks after we had been presented with what government propagandists had assured us was the most responsible and the best considered Budget in history, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made no fewer than 61 additional commitments either to increase government spending or to forgo government revenue-from the $500m Alice Springs to Darwin railway to the $2m car racing track for Canberra. I presume that, as Ronald Ziegler used to say, that particular promise will be inoperative, since it failed to save John Haslem. No less than $4 billion has been promised for airport development and expansion throughout the country; $90m for the Burdekin Dam; and $10m for retrospective waiving of tax assessments on imputed rentals in central Queensland. I instance also such ill-considered Country Party sops as a farm fuel storage tax rort under which expenditure on tanks in which to store fuel on farms will be immediately deductible for taxable income-a seemingly insignificant item which is tucked away among 61 promises but which, if it is effective to the extent of causing farmers to store an additional six months supply of fuels on farms, will cost government revenue about $75m. It is particularly ironic, in view of the reported statements of the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, at the National Country Party conference last week that the razor gang would be getting stuck into some of the fat in the farm sector or what more accurately could be described as some of the tax rip-offs which this Government continues to provide for the advantage of the high income groups and the outside investors in agriculture and to the disadvantage of those who are actually concerned about making a living from farming on a continuing basis. That particular bonus for inefficiency-that is, storing fuel on farms-is also somewhat hard to reconcile with Senator Carrick's boast two months later that Australia, in conformity with its obligations to the International Energy Agency, was supporting a stocks draw-down policy designed to minimise or prevent supply caused increases in world oil prices by drawing more heavily on accumulated stocks in net importing countries. That co-exists with the Government policy which allegedly is designed to encourage farmers to store more fuel on farms. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the 61 promises were either uncosted or dishonestly costed. I draw just two examples of the latter, of which the dishonesty has been subsequently acknowledged. One is the extension of the liquified petroleum gas subsidy said to cost between $9m and $11m and now admitted by the Government to cost $13m. Another is the allowance of a 20 per cent rate of depreciation on farm machinery which was said by the Government in the policy speech to cost $7m. It is now admitted in a letter that I received last week from the Treasurer to cost $20m-up from $7m to $20m! I could go on and on about the Governor-General's Speech, or more accurately the speech that the Governor-General delivered on behalf of the Government, but I will move on to a couple of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's economic contradictions are matched by his military contradictions. Our Prime Minister, as those who have observed him over the years will be aware, has long indulged in military command fantasies. The most recent evidence of this has been the ludicrous security arrangements in Parliament House which he imposed after the Hilton Hotel bombing and whatever was responsible for that; his bellicose posturing toward the Russians and his endorsement of President Reagan's attempt to get a re-run of the Vietnam war in central America. Curiously this penchant to involve others in shooting wars to contain communism has never extended to involve himself. In 1951, with the Korean war raging, he thought it was much more important to depart for Oxford to pick up that third class degree. In the mid-1960s, while he was still well within military age, his contradition to stopping communism in Vietnam was restricted to using his power as the Minister for Defence to send thousands of Australian conscripts into the shooting war. </PARA>

<PARA> The 1980 parliamentary opening was the last which will be attended by Sir Garfield Barwick as Chief Justice. The great tragedy about Sir Garfield's retirement, like the death of Menzies, is that it came many years too late. If it had come 10 years earlier, for example, there may have been no emasculation of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act as a result of a series of bizarre judgments by the High Court under Barwick's tutelage. Almost certainly, there would have been no infamous advisory opinion to Kerr in 1975 and there may not even have been any falsification of company records by the Chief Justice of the type we saw when he filled in that directoral resignation form dated 1974 but signed in April 1980-that bogus resignation form which falsified company records in order to conceal the activity of the then Chief Justice as a tax evader. Apologists for the late unlamented Chief Justice have stressed that most of his controversial judicial decisions can be ascribed to the alleged fact that he is a judicial literalist. He takes the letter of the law, it is said, and takes a narrow interpretation of it, or so these credulous people say. I remind those who have swallowed that line that the fiction of a caretaker government is entirely the work of the late Chief Justice. The Constitution says absolutely nothing about caretaker governments or anything remotely resembling them. Where was this great literalist who abides only by the written letter of the law when he concocted the fiction of a caretaker government in order to provide a rationale for dismissing the elected government and installing Malcolm Fraser in its place? I also remind those apologists of the Webster case when the facts were not in dispute. Former Senator Webster was a major shareholder and also had been the managing director of a company which had had numerous contracts with the Postmaster-General's Department. It was a private company of fewer than 25 persons. Section 44 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> Any person who-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (v.) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than 25 persons:</PARA>
<PARA>shall be incapable of being chosen of or sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>One might have thought that a literalist jurist, confronted with that written Constitution and the undenied facts that the then Senator Webster was a member of a company consisting of fewer than 25 persons-a major shareholder and managing director of a company which had had contracts with the Postmaster-General's Department-would say clearly that Senator Webster was in breach of section 44 (v.) of the Constitution. This literalist jurist, however, as he always managed to do when he wanted to bring down a judgment that was less than compatible with the written law said, in his judgment, that no evidence had been produced that Senator Webster had used his position as a member of the Parliament to secure those contracts, which was true. The point, however, was that that had absolutely nothing to do with the charge. But on that basis, along with a couple of other spurious reasons, he found him eligible to sit. This literalist jurist has always managed to concoct fiction to rationalise the judgments which he had decided, frequently on political grounds, to bring down. He is no loss to the Bench. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have finished with that item, Mr President. The last point I make concerns events that took place immediately before and subsequent to the election. I wish to refer, in particular, to the Australian all ordinaries index. As those who follow the stock market will remember, there was a significant downturn in the all ordinaries index-that is, for those who are unfamiliar with that jargon, share prices-in early October. On 9 October 1980, the Canberra Times reported the Prime Minister as saying, among other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The share market slump has proved that Labor's economic policies were wrong for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 'What's happened in the stock markets of Australia yesterday and again today shows quite plainly how business, and the hundreds of thousands of Australian investors, view the prospects of a Labor Government', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor . . . would attack resource development, making it hard for business to get off the ground, and set up 'a spy unit' within the Foreign Investment Review Board, to pass on information about multinational companies within Australia to Australian and overseas trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA>The all ordinaries index bottomed on 15 October and 16 October at 661.4 and 661.5. It has been below that level for nearly all of the last five weeks. The most recent day for which I have a figure-I did not take it out of this week's newspapers-was 6 March when it was 647.1. This is some 2.5 per cent or 14.3 points lower than it was at the depth of the pre-election slump. I can only assume from that, given those facts and the Prime Minister's diagnosis of the pre-election slump, that business views the reality of a Fraser Government as being something far more frightening than the prospect of a Labor Government. I would not seek to dispute that judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly in this Address-in-Reply debate as it has been a long debate. It had not been my intention to enter the debate. Some incidents have occurred during the last few days in respect of which I thought it was necessary that one topic of the Government's policy be touched on. Under the guise of speaking to the amendment moved by the Opposition, certain comments have been made in this place in relation to the Government's manpower policy. Some of those comments I found a little disturbing. I found them all the more disturbing when I opened my newspaper in Brisbane on Saturday morning to read a story about a Vietnamese refugee who had been working as a barber and who had lost his job because of racist complaints made by a number of the customers of that barber shop to the owner of the barber shop. The Vietnamese migrant had a family, including four children, to support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the public outcry in Brisbane, we read in our newspapers over the next couple of days that that refugee had been given a job by the same employer in another shop. But one concludes from the comments made and the news stories that one of the complaints made to the employer was that the Vietnamese in question had deprived an Australian of a job. All comment from those who worked in the same shopping centre and from the employer, the barber, indicated that the Vietnamese refugee was an excellent employee. The public outcry was such that the man now has a job. I think this is a warning of what could happen. All of us in Parliament, I think, have had comments made to them about the Government's policy in relation to refugees, specifically in relation to Indo-Chinese refugees. It would be easy to give in to the pressure that is exerted on all of us from time to time, particularly by those who choose to contrast the refugee policy with the immigration policy, to be critical of a refugee policy. In recent years we have taken a restricted number of migrants but we have continued to take them. However the Government has pursued as have Australian governments for many years its policy in relation to refugees. </PARA>

<PARA>owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we need to make a careful distinction between those who seek to migrate here and those who come here as refugees. Australia has always been very proud of the responsibility that it has accepted for contributing to the solution of refugee problems in many parts of the world. We have considered our policy in this area to be one of humanitarian assistance. Our assistance has taken two forms. It has taken the form of resettlement in Australia and contribution in the countries of first asylum. Australian governments have recognised that the preferable solution to refugee problems is repatriation where possible. However, they have also recognised that repatriation is not always a feasible solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In our region we are faced with an enormous problem in the form of the Indo-Chinese refugees. The most acute problem is that of the Vietnamese refugees who have been persecuted in their own country and whose own Government has made it very clear that they are not welcome to stay in their own country or that if they do stay they will suffer the consequences of having their property appropriated, of not being allowed to work and of being forcibly required to move to other parts of the country and undertake labour which is not reasonable. Most disturbing of all are the indications that within Vietnam much of that persecution of the domestic population has a racial basis. The persecution has not been confined to people in the south. Many people in the old North Vietnam have also been persecuted by the Vietnamese Government. That basis-a genuine fear of persecution-is the basis of any refugee policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all aware that there are those in Australia who would prefer not to see people of Indo-Chinese origin in Australia and who would prefer to see a certain racial mix preserved. Governments-Labor and Liberal-have rejected that attitude. I have had approaches to my office along those lines, as I am sure every honourable senator has. I have rejected them as unworthy. It would be unworthy of us as Australians to close the doors of our country and not to seek to extend humanitarian assistance to those who are without a home and who have the prospect of satisfactory settlement in this country. Our refugee policies have been supported by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. For that support we ought to be very grateful because we face a difficult problem in the region which leads to a difficulty with our refugee problem. I would hope that no honourable senator, whether he be a Government or Opposition senator, would be tempted to make easy political capital under the heading of manpower policies of what they perceive to be a vocal minority of opinion in Australia in relation to refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate to the Senate the basis of the Government's policy on refugees. Australia fully recognises its humanitarian commitment and responsibility to admit refugees for resettlement. The decision to accept refugees must always remain with the Government of Australia. Special assistance will often be needed to provide for the movement of refugees in designated situations or for their resettlement in Australia. It might not be in the interests of some refugees to settle in Australia. Their interests might be better served by resettlement elsewhere; that is, by support resettlement programs in other countries. It is estimated that in the world at present there are 13 million refugees. The number of refugees in our world is nearly equal to the total population of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have a first responsibility in our own region. However, Australia takes refugees from all over the world, not only from the Asian region but also notably from South America and Europe. We have assisted in the resettlement of refugees in other parts of the world in cases where it has not been appropriate for or the desire of those refugees to come to Australia. I believe we can be proud of our refugee policies as they have been conducted for many years. Approximately 10 per cent of the total of 3.5 million people who have come to this country in the last 30 years have been refugees. They have been successful and highly desirable settlers. I just regret that unworthy reflections were cast in this chamber on the motives of this Government in pursuing its refugees policies. The motives are no different from those of preceding governments in pursuing refugee policies in relation to displaced persons and persons throughout the world who are persecuted and without a home. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the conclusion of the Address-in-Reply debate. I congratulate Senator Davidson for his speech in the Address-in-Reply debate. As he said, it was his last opportunity to speak in an Address-in-Reply debate. He moved that the Senate agree to the Address-in-Reply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose any of these three Bills. The Coal Excise Amendment Bill is simply a machinery measure to extend from seven to 28 days the period for making returns with respect to coal production. It is part of a legislative scheme going back to 1949 to raise funds for both long service leave and research in the coal industry. The measure here in issue will simply facilitate the administrative operation of that scheme. The Bounty (Non-Adjustable Wrenches) Bill involves a matter on which Senator-elect Siddons might be able to muster rather more lyricism than I can manage on this occasion, as his Sidchrome operation appears to be, if not the sole operation, certainly one of the handful of operations that will in fact benefit from this largesse.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed; and his lyricism would no doubt have to be expressed in muted or qualified terms or outside this chamber, but lyricism, I have no doubt, it would nonetheless be. We ought to acknowledge that the spanner industry has been in trouble from import competition and that something like 400 jobs-industrially democratised jobs at that-are at risk. The Industries Assistance Commission has recommended that temporary assistance be provided until a fuller investigation, together with a report and a determination of appropriate longer term measures, can be conducted. The Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Amendment Bill also involves temporary assistance to an industry which has been in real difficulties. Again, it is simply an interim measure while longer term arrangements are being worked out as part of the total textiles, clothing and footwear package. The Opposition supports that Bill, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my purpose to embark on any kind of lengthy examination of the industrial policy generally which discussion of these Bills might be thought to stimulate and, indeed, to justify. I make the point that if manufacturing industries of this kind are to be assisted-assisted they must be in the present economic environment if anyone in manufacturing is to stay employed, whatever the longer term need may be for rational reconstruction-it is wholly desirable that, wherever possible, such assistance be given, as is the case here, by way of bounty rather than tariff protection. When the bounty mechanism is employed the economic cost is precisely known and easily measured, the burden of the assistance falls squarely and equitably on taxpayers generally rather than on consumers who might well be ill-equipped to bear it, and the inflationary impact of the assistance in question is obviously minimised. With those few remarks I think I have exhausted what I have to say on these measures. Once again I simply indicate-following the very extensive debate, I might add, of these matters in the other place-that the Opposition does not oppose, nor would it wish to hinder, the passage of these Bills in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly in support of these three Bills, the first a Bill to amend the Coal Excise Act 1949. As my colleague, Senator Evans, has explained, this is very much a machinery amendment to overcome a restrictive provision. The intention of the Bill is to increase from seven days to 28 days the period during which returns and entries can be made for home consumption, in relation to coal which is removed to enable research and long service leave collection payments to be made. So the amendment is proposed to overcome an administrative problem and to provide a more realistic interval in which these returns can be lodged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Bounty (Non-Adjustable Wrenches) Bill 1981 is designed to provide a bounty assistance of 11c on each bountiable wrench-this is important-which has a local content exceeding 50 per cent. The maximum payment in any one year is restricted to $620,000, so an upper limit applies. Under these circumstances, where essentially one manufacturer is involved, a bounty appears to be a reasonable sort of a way in which to provide protection. On the other hand, if there were a large number of operators and manufacturers, I believe protection would be more effective through quota or by tariff. In this case, where there is essentially one operator, namely Siddons Industries Ltd in Victoria, it is an appropriate means of protecting the local company and of providing protection to about 400 important jobs, essentially those of skilled workers who produce a good product. The purpose of this Bill is to enable local producers, essentially Siddons Industries, to get back to more normal capacity levels. It was pointed out that local producers have suffered from imports and it is hoped that the 11c bounty on each wrench will be sufficient to protect the local industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a particular interest in the past in the third Bill, which is the Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Amendment Bill 1981. The 1978 Act was designed to provide a bounty until 31 August 1981. This Bill before us tonight seeks to extend that period from 31 August to 31 December and, under this arrangement, $1.15 per kilogram bounty is paid on bountiable yarn. We realise that these industries are being subjected to an Industries Assistance Commission report, No. 240 of 30 April 1980. To some extent, this IAC report has been rejected by the Government. Some aspects of it have been picked up. It was recommended in that report that the present assistance arrangements be extended to 31 December 1981. The new arrangements will come into effect from 1 January 1982; it is just an interim arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to speak on these new arrangements now. An upper limit of $200,000 applies during this interim period. In a full year it would be $600,000. I believe this is an appropriate occasion on which to raise a rather serious matter. The bounty for the future, that is from 1982, has been calculated on an incorrect assumption. This incorrect assumption is so dramatic as to wipe out much of the spinning operations within Australia. From 1 January 1982 it is envisaged that the duties on yarns will be reduced to minimum levels and bounties will be paid in lieu thereof. The bounty is to be paid as a fixed percentage of cost value added in Australia by yarn manufacturers; that is, the ex-factory value of bountiable yarn less the cost of materials used. With most cotton system spinning yarns which are produced by Australian industry, the bounty is to be in the area of 33 per cent of factory cost. This level of bounty will be completely inadequate for industry to compete with imports. Although I understand that there have been some discussions with officials from the Department of Industry and Commerce on the amount and the extent of this damage, I trust the Government at this point will, fairly quickly, see fit to correct this problem that has arisen; in other words, the inadequacy of the level of protection and the inaccuracy of the assumptions on which this has been based. In fact, I believe that the inaccuracy is so serious that I, and I think the majority of those involved in this sector of the industry, would regard it as a breach of faith on the Government's part, of its assistance to textiles which it declared just prior to the last Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that the matter is so serious that the cotton system spinning sector of textiles could be sacrificed because of an incorrect assumption on the basis of the calculation used in formulating a decision. I believe that it is justly regarded that this sector of the industry is economically a very efficient sector of the textile industry of Australia; that is, the spinning sector. I trust that the departmental officers and also that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) will come up with a formula which will fulfil our Government's electoral commitment in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> With that reservation and that very dark cloud on the future, I support this Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Amendment Bill so as to extend for an interim period to 31 December 1981, the protection based on $1.15 per kilogram of bountiable yarn which is spun in registered premises for use in knitting and weaving of textiles here in Australia. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When these reports were tabled this afternoon I sought leave to continue my remarks. You will recall, Mr President, that Senator Rae suggested that this debate be brought on at a later hour this day because it is of some urgency. It is of some urgency from the Opposition's point of view because the reports of Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd have been presented at a rather unhappy time for this Government. The Senate has witnessed some amazing responses to the report of a committee commissioned by the Government that are quite rare in the annals of this Parliament. At Question Time today Senator Messner-I do not think I treat him unkindly-had some difficulty, to say the least, in rationalising an extraordinary situation arising from the publication of the report of the Holcroft committee in relation to domestic air fares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is pertinent that the two reports of the airlines concerned should be published at this time. The members of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares appointed by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) under the Fraser Government, were effectively misled by the Minister. To serve the demands of friends of this Government and the business community, the Minister cut short the committee's period of inquiry. I do not think it is now in dispute that the Holcroft committee's deliberations were cut short. The Minister on a number of occasions has sought to suggest that it was anticipated that the committee would report by 31 January 1981, but it is quite apparent that Mr Holcroft and other members of the committee, in discussions with the Minister, were firmly of the view and expressed the view that they would need additional funds and staff to take the inquiry beyond 31 January 1981. When the Holcroft committee in its report protested about the way in which it was being treated, it was accused by the Minister for Transport and his colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), of misrepresenting the position of the Government and the terms of reference of the inquiry, and an attack was made on the integrity and competence of the three distinguished members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It was at that point, in the exchange between the committee and the Government, that the two organisations central to any discussion of domestic aviation presented their reports to this Parliament. Clearly, more will flow from these reports later but I think I can summarise fairly quickly some of the things which flow from the presentation of the reports of Ansett and TAA. These reports refer to a period nine months ago. It is nine months later that the Parliament is receiving any detailed information. I know that by the standards established by Senator Rae for delays in tabling reports in the Parliament, nine months is not exceptional; it is a well recognised period of gestation, but it is still a very long time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I have been greatly assisted by the interjections. I would like them to be recorded in Hansard. I shall summarise the situation as it is at this stage. It is nine months after the period to which these reports refer that the Parliament is receiving any detailed information and, as my colleagues have added, for six months that information has been in the hands of the Department of Transport which is responsible, in a sense, to see that these reports are presented in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing which follows from the presentation of these reports is that the report of Ansett Airlines of Australia particularly is totally outdated and, in terms of enabling honourable senators to detect the real financial position of that company, is quite meaningless. Thirdly, I think one can say that the impending actions by this Government, namely amendments to the Australian National Airlines Commission Act and an attempt to implement a new two-airline agreement for a period of 10 years, represent crucial decisions for the future of domestic aviation in Australia. More particularly, they represent crucial decisions for the potential passengers on Australian domestic airlines. Fourthly, Ansett, by presenting such a scanty document to the Parliament, has treated the Parliament with contempt. That, again, is a matter with which Senator Rae has been concerned in a general context in time gone by. Fifthly, the financial statement of Ansett could indicate a real profit, in our view, of at least 50 per cent higher than it has in fact admitted. I will return to that matter if the Senate is concerned with the precise details. The figure which is stated in the report as a real profit seems to be a little extraordinary if one looks at the net profit before tax, the company tax which is payable and the provision for taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion of these two annual reports must inevitably involve some reference to the most recent detailed observations on domestic aviation in Australia-truncated observations as they are. Those observations have been made in the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, chaired by Mr Warwick Holcroft, with Dr Harold Bell and Professor Warren Hogan. They are observations about which we have heard quite a bit in the Senate and about which we will hear quite a bit more in the next few days. I refer the Senate to some comments in the report and particularly to a comment on page 175 of Volume 1. Under the heading 'Administrative Control' the committee of inquiry states:</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry has observed a number of features of the administration of air fare pricing which it believes should be altered as quickly as possible. By far the most important of these is the lack of public disclosure of financial and performance data by the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that we are discussing the two reports of the airlines TAA and Ansett. The Committee says that the most important thing is the lack of public disclosure of financial and performance data by the airlines. Page 175 goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public disclosure is, in the Inquiry's view, of overriding importance in the regulation of air fare pricing. A moment's reflection will recognise the irrationality of creating a protected joint monopoly, with a cost plus pricing system, and then affording the members of that joint monopoly secrecy in relation to costing and pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry points out when a company accepts a place in an industry into which competitors are precluded by law from entry and in which prices are set by law so as to recover costs, including profit, and in which longterm government policy prescribes that there shall remain only two firms, each capable of competing with the other, and by implication that they shall survive that competition, for each airline then to adopt the stance of being a firm in a highly competitive environment, jeopardised by the slightest disclosure, is plainly ridiculous. So too is the toleration that has been displayed over a long period by the regulatory authority of such a stance, apparently without asserting its right to be properly informed as surrogate for the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is, Senator. The report goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the DOT as the regulatory authority has accepted this state of affairs is plainly shown by the numerous acknowledgements by the DOT of lack of data. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinary indictment. Perhaps somebody on the other side of the chamber could tell us it is incorrect but so far there has been very little evidence to that effect. That is an extraordinary indictment of a government, a government department and of a Minister who claims to be responsible for the administration of the two-airline system in this country and who is more particularly the author of the latest domestic airlines fares agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few days we have heard in this place some discussion about what public servants can and cannot do in pursuit of their roles as public servants when giving evidence to committees of this Parliament. We have heard some somewhat pompous statements by Ministers as to the extent of ministerial responsibility. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) said in this Parliament, that Ministers are responsible for policy. When we come to the Minister for Transport when the policy is an absolute shambles, who gets the blame? Not the Minister! The Holcroft inquiry gets the blame for that. Three distinguished members of an independent inquiry get the blame. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question of ministerial responsibility when it comes to the Minister for Transport. The Minister for Defence is, as usual, full of hot air about the question of ministerial responsibility and is prepared to describe people, who express concern about the role of committees of this Parliament and the role of public servants who give evidence to those committees, in terms which are of the utmost clownishness and absurdity when one considers the real responsibilities involved. So the indictment of the Holcroft inquiry, if it is to be grappled with, is an extraordinarily powerful one of the Government. The response, of course, is to say that these people misread their terms of reference; they did not do their work properly and all these sorts of allegations which have been made by Ministers, particularly the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Primary Industry. If a person is under attack the best means of defence seems to be that of a skunk, that is, to emit some sort of smell which confuses everybody but which does not deal with the elements of the attack. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all honourable senators will detect that the inquiry not only is criticising the position of the airlines, and by implication Ansett Airlines, but also is highlighting the situation in which the Department of Transport as a regulatory authority has accepted a state of affairs which, according to the members of this inquiry, is against the public interest. I repeat: The Department of Transport has accepted, in the view of the inquiry, a state of affairs which is against the public interest. Again there is a lot of waffle about what the public interest means but it is seldom said in such clear and unequivocal terms that an action of a government department is against the public interest. The inquiry goes on to say that the Department plainly accepts this state of affairs by the lack of information it has. Ignorance is bliss for the Department of Transport when dealing with Ansett Airlines. That lack of information cries out for some response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, true, Senator, but I think that, if one reads the report, it can be seen clearly where the greatest indictment lies. I will come to that in a minute. We are discussing the reports of the two airlines but I take the honourable senator's point. The report is an indictment of the way in which this Department conducts itself and inevitably of a responsibility owed to this Parliament by the Minister for Transport. I reiterate these are reports to the Parliament. It is equally disturbing to read a further comment by the committee of a similar kind. I refer to page 14 of the first volume of the Report of the Independent Public Inquiry. Paragraph 1.53 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although domestic aviation policy generally appears to be only vaguely defined it is clearly dominated by the two-airlines policy. This policy ensures the preservation of a duopolistic situation in which the key factors that might otherwise bear upon competition such as pricing policy, capacity, route frequencies, load factors et cetera are all circumscribed and are not subject to scrutiny by the Trade Practices Commission or the Prices Justification Tribunal. Moreover, to the extent that these non-competitive elements are not or cannot be effectively monitored by the Department of Transport, they are merely being rubber-stamped with the imprimatur of official approval. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: They are being rubber-stamped with the imprimatur of official approval. In a sense these are the issues which spring from this report. Some of the matters which are dealt with in these reports are some of the things which are being rubber-stamped by the department, according to the Holcroft committee. It goes on to say that any application for fare increases by the domestic airlines is being approved without question by the Minister. It is instructive that this comment appears after an official inquiry, because the fact is that fare increases are initiated principally by Ansett Airlines. That is the point I wish to come to and which relates to Senator Chipp's earlier interjection. That raises the question of the extent to which the principals of Ansett Transport Industries are able to exercise influence on this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that there are two actions pending which have immense importance for air travellers and for Australians generally. One is the amendment to the Australian National Airlines Commission Act. This amendment was introduced in the House of Representatives before Parliament was dissolved for the Federal election of October last year. It is now to be re-introduced. The real reason for its re-introduction and for amendment to the Act is to enable the imposition to be made on Trans-Australia Airlines, to which I will refer. That is to say TAA will be made to quadruple its profit objective. An accounting arrangement is to be introduced to force TAA to declare a profit which is really 400 per cent higher than it would otherwise declare. That will be done by having the airline's profit calculated on its assets rather than on capital invested. Honourable senators will be pleased to know that TAA has a mere $15m of government capital invested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rae might not be pleased. I was using the word in a general sense, hoping that there was general good will here. Senator Rae is excused from that description by virtue of his particular interest and expertise. I repeat that most senators will be pleased to know that TAA has a mere $15m of government capital invested. Of course, it has been able to acquire many more millions of dollars in assets through efficiency and its attraction as an airline to the travelling public-something Senator Rae might find equally unpalatable, but it is nonetheless true. The real reason for imposing this profit burden on TAA is to force it to increase its fares substantially. Under the two-airline agreement, the fares charged by both airlines, TAA and Ansett, must be the same. That means that, because of TAA's need to increase its profits dramatically, Ansett would receive windfall profits running into millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the first element of this scheme. The second element is the attempt to implement a two-airline agreement for a period of 10 years. The policy decision on that matter has already been made. The implementation of the two-airline agreement for a period of 10 years would ensure that the situation of drastically increased air fares and windfall profits for Ansett would be guaranteed until at least 1991. Because the two-airline agreement has built into its terms a guarantee for five years from the notice of termination, the effective end of the agreement would be 1996. If something happened in the Parliament, an earlier termination date could be possible, but it would still be a long way away. In this situation Ansett Airlines seems to have called the shots.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through a glass darkly, yes. I hinted darkly at a situation which I thought would have suggested to an alert person such as Senator Chipp that if something happened in this Parliament the termination of the agreement might be at some date other than 1996. That is my interpretation, and I think it would be the interpretation of an erudite gentleman such as Senator Chipp. As I have said, Ansett seems to have called the shots. It gave very little information to the Holcroft inquiry, and it has given precious little information to the Parliament in the report that has been tabled. Because the Holcroft inquiry was truncated, Ansett was not required to give evidence. It is common knowledge that at one stage Ansett sought the outright sale of TAA and that this proposal was shelved simply because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) felt that the public would be outraged by such an act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an open secret that Ansett has pressed for the quadrupling of TAA's profits by having TAA's earnings calculated on assets rather than capital invested. It is further an open secret that Ansett has been demanding ratification of a new 10-year two-airline agreement. It is an open, though disputed, secret-wide open, I should have thought-that the Minister for Transport has been totally compliant in these matters, and the Minister who represents him in the Senate has been totally confused. That is to say, we do not charge Senator Messner with compliance in this conspiracy but with the lesser venal sin of confusion, and that is amply documented at Question Time day after day. The Minister for Transport has shown no capacity for independent thought or action and a deplorable lack of oversight of the Department for which he is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, honourable senators should take note of the lack of information given to them in the actual reports tabled in the Senate, particularly in the report of Ansett. They should bear in mind that Ansett will be the beneficiary under the terms of the two-airline agreement in the way in which I have stated we believe it will operate. Together with TAA, Ansett is given guarantees that would be the envy of many enterprises in this country. One would think, therefore, that a full obligation of this company is to declare in the fullest terms details of its operations. I take the point made in Senator Chipp's earlier interjection, but I am putting a case about the way the fare structure operates. Because the facts might be different at another time, the same obligation is on TAA to report to this Parliament, in the fullest possible terms, details of its operations. In fact, it is quite impossible, from a reading of the Ansett account, to make any meaningful comparison between Ansett and TAA, the two major airlines of this country. The scantiness of the first report takes liberties with the Parliament which should not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett's financial statements for the four sections of aviation operated by it-MacRobertson Miller Airline Services, Ansett Airlines of South Australia, Ansett Airlines of New South Wales, and Ansett Airlines of Australia-are a conglomeration of figures that do not disclose the true financial situation. The Ansett financial statements are unaudited, so in one sense they lack the credibility which even audited accounts of the smallest company would have. For example, Ansett discloses $28.3m before tax, and the tax provision is given as $20.3m. Those amounts lead us to believe that Ansett's net profit is far greater than is disclosed. There is also the write-back of depreciation or disposal of revalued aircraft. On a broad judgment, Ansett's profit after tax and extraordinary items would be $20m plus, due to non-allowable items for tax purposes such as writing back double depreciation on assets. The Ansett statement reinforces the need, and this was mentioned in the Holcroft report, for uniform detailed financial statements so that a meaningful comparison can be made between the two airlines and meaningful information can be made available to the Parliament and the Australian people on a matter which vitally affects them as very large consumers of these two important domestic airlines. The situation of the airlines concerns not only the Australian people but also their children who are of most slender years. Can I say slender years?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, and it could happen again during the time the domestic airlines agreement will probably run-potentially 15 years. On the other hand, TAA operates under the impediment of government policy restrictions such as superannuation payments in excess of Ansett's, different foreign loans incurring greater exchange losses, and so on. TAA also has many accounting treatments from past financial reports, and this tends to cloud the issue. TAA's performance is quite good, but not good enough in the circumstances surrounding the aviation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary we say that the information provided by Ansett Airlines is inadequate for the purposes of assessing the true financial position of that company and of assessing its effect, having regard to the policy announcements which have been made on the fare structure of TAA, and that as an unaudited report it indicates contempt for the proper parliamentary process. The repeated assertions by the Opposition about the Government's failure to ensure proper, responsible examination of Ansett Airlines' accounts has been vindicated by the Holcroft inquiry. Indeed, the slender nature of the reports tabled by the airlines, having regard to the circumstances which I have referred to, is again an indication of contempt for the parliamentary process.</PARA>
<PARA> All one can say is that one wonders where the passing of the buck stops in relation to the reports of these two airlines. One wonders who accepts responsibility for these situations. We on this side of the House regard these reports, scanty as they may be, as most important documents in the life of the Parliament for the fact that they reveal not only very little to the public but also incompetence, lack of care and, possibly, a very grave situation of commercial favouritism by the Government which is disastrous in its implications for the development of industry in this country and potentially disastrous in the particular context of this industry. We are most concerned about this situation and hope that the Senate is prepared to see the situation as we see it and to take this matter further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad that the opportunity which was canvassed this afternoon has become a reality and that there is an early opportunity to have some debate in relation to the two delayed reports which were tabled this afternoon, namely, the reports of Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in relation to their airline operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button, in speaking to this matter, has made certain comments in relation to the operation and accounts of Ansett Transport Industries. In particular, he made reference to the fact that its accounts are not audited. In case there is some misunderstanding in relation to that matter, the annual report of Ansett Transport Industries-namely, the forty-third annual report, 1980, which covers more than its airline operations-is in fact audited, and that report has been available to shareholders and to the public generally for some months now. The problem that arises is the problem of to what happens under the two-airline agreement, under government intervention in relation to airline operation in Australia, with the reports which deal solely with the operations of TAA and the operations of Ansett Transport Industries in relation to aviation activities. I am told-I have no reason to doubt this-that over recent years both Ansett and TAA have regularly been able to make the information available to government by late in the year, following the closing date of 30 June, for the period being reported upon. But for some reason which is not clear and which has never really been explained, notwithstanding attempts to raise it at Question Time, by way of debate on Bills, by way of debate on the adjournment and at various other times that I have raised this matter over the years, it takes so long for it to get through the process of the bureaucracy and of government before eventually it is tabled in the Parliament and is made available to members of parliament and to the public at large. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the problems. The information is important in relation to the decision-making processes not just of government but of all sorts of people. People involved in the tourist industry, in manufacturing, and in a wide cross-section are entitled to have this sort of information made available to them a long time before it is made available in the present circumstances. That is why I interjected gently during what Senator Button was saying by way of criticism of this situation. I have been criticising it for years. I do not criticise either of the airlines; I criticise a system which means that it takes so long between the preparation of the detail and the final publication. I wish somebody would just agree that this is an unacceptable situation which has to be changed. The processes of government somehow need to look at themselves before some people, including me, get to the stage of saying: 'If they will not do it, let us find out really why it happens and publicise why it happens and who is at fault'. Surely to goodness, after the number of times this matter has been raised, it is about time they pulled themselves into gear and got the reports out on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have pointed out that Senator Button referred to the fact that ATI's aviation report did not have an auditor's certificate with it. I would not want it to be thought that ATI's general report was not audited. I just make that point. I notice that Senator Button is nodding his head, so there is no disagreement between us. As he made some comments about ATI's report, perhaps it is not inappropriate that I should have the opportunity, not by way of criticism but by way of statement of fact and of the problems we face in trying to delve into what on earth does happen in relation to the operation of the two-airline system in Australia, to make some comments in relation to the financial statements and report of Trans-Australia Airlines. I say it not by way of criticism of TAA but by way of criticism of the structure and of the system under which it operates. </PARA>
<PARA> One finds a great many problems when one tries to identify what really happens in relation to the operation of the airlines. Senator Button has referred to some of the comments about the alleged inadequacies of the information which is published by ATI. I do not pause to have any difference with him about that, but I would supplement what he said by pointing to some of the problems in relation to Trans-Australian Airlines, which I suggest are even greater than those which he may have identified in relation to ATI, yet they are of fundamental importance to matters such as those which were dealt with by the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, the Holcroft committee. They are matters which are daily being dealt with at Question Time, and which are considered by government and others within the Parliament and externally, and they are matters relating to the question of what amounts to an air fares policy for Australia which is fair and which can produce an efficient operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before one can come to conclusions about that, it is my suggestion that one needs to know what are the real figures, and from the accounts which are published there is no way one can work out what are the real figures. I can say that I have had the assistance of people who range from some of the leading stockbrokers in Australia to some of the leading company advisers, company takeover experts and a cross-section of others, to go through the published information in relation to the airlines. They stated qualification after qualification because the information is just simply not available. I should like to demonstrate some of those matters to the Senate tonight. I do not wish to debate the Holcroft committee's report but I should like to quote one item from it because I think it is relevant as a starting point. On page 124, in paragraph 7.113, of that report it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Other interest (that is not related to aircraft purchase) is included in administration overheads. In effect, not only is interest treated as a cost of airline operations, but the accounting treatment also effectively conceals the level of interest charged to the company's profit and loss account in any year. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry noted that TAA's treatment of interest differs in a number of respects from conventional accounting practice. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that simply to show that I am not the only one who is making comments about these aspects to which I wish to refer; the Holcroft committee also made some comments. I want to do it not by way of attack. I have great respect for the general efficiency of the way both airlines produce a good service at what, in comparable costs with the rest of the world, is a remarkably low fare for the standard of service which is provided. People insist that the airlines are deficient and that there is cross-subsidisation, that fare costs are high and so on, but if we are to look at these questions, and I do not say that we should not, then let us look at the figures and identify what is really happening before we start to debate things such as air fare formulas. The problems with the fact that TAA is a statutory authority rather than a public company structured under the Companies Act include the fact that employment conditions-in particular, superannuation-impose an intolerable burden, as described by its Chairman in the most recent report. The chairman on page 8 of the 1979-80 annual report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme is of such magnitude that no enterprise could remain self-sufficient in a competitive environment with such a handicap. </PARA>
<PARA>A little earlier the chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Australian Government Actuary has not completed any evaluation of the fund beyond 30 June 1976 we believe that the $96.228m by which the actuarial liability was reported to be uncovered at that date would now have increased to a figure approaching $140m. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a debt due by and in respect of the operation of one half of our domestic airlines. That is a debt which has been accruing for the past seven years and which has now built up to $140m or nearly ten times the figure identified by Senator Button as the total amount of capital invested in the operation by the Government. I am not saying this as a matter of blame but to identify a fact. It is a liability which the Government now proposes should be paid for-at least as to some amount over $90m-by the taxpayers of Australia. Why should the taxpayers of Australia have to pick up the tab for the extra cost which airline passengers are not providing and which the airline system cannot provide because-according to the chairman of Trans-Australia Airlines-it is a provision which would put the airlines out of business if they charged fares in relation to the real cost of conducting their operation? What is the reason for this cost? The reason is that it is a statutory authority subject to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme instead of being a public company which could organise its own superannuation scheme in the same way as ATI. This would cost something like the 7.8 per cent or 8 per cent employer contribution which ATI makes to its employees superannuation scheme. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has very extensive implications in other areas of the Public Service and statutory authorities, particularly bearing in mind that two out of three of the total number of people employed by the Commonwealth in direct government activities or in its statutory authorities are employed in statutory authorities. I think that is a matter for another debate. I will now go on to the matter of gearing and the impact of that on the figures. Senator Button may be interested in this matter because it is why I was curious when he said we would be pleased to know that the fund had only $15m capital invested. The net result of having a low invested capital, low equity and a high gearing ratio, which obtains for TAA,-ATI attains that benefit as does Qantas Airways Ltd, the Australian National Line and a number of other enterprises in Australia because they receive government guarantee-is that the comparability of their published profit figures and the tax they pay is totally distorted because, instead of having a profit figure out of which eventually capital is serviced by way of dividend, before the profit figure and tax figure, interest payments are taken off as expenditure. That is the simple net result of having a high gearing ratio. So, a double advantage is given by that. The first advantage is that there is an operation which can be conducted on a very low, or relatively low, capital base and a high loan content because of government guarantee. The second advantage is that a benefit is given by reducing the net taxation to be paid because they can take off the cost of servicing a large section of the total capital out of profit before tax instead of after tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What this means is that where these government enterprises, in particular, are obtaining these sorts of high gearing government guarantee benefits the taxation which they pay is unreal and the profit which is disclosed is an unreal profit. I do not have enough time to elaborate on that but I do not think it needs elaboration to most honourable senators to see what impact it can have. When the complication of superannuation is added to that-it is not provided for at all-there is no provision and nor has there been provision in recent years by TAA for superannuation. This again produces an unreal figure because one would have expected the companies to have made some provision for it. Yet, if one goes through the accounts there is no provision for superannuation. Apparently the taxpayer is expected to pay that. When one comes to the question of depreciation and depreciation policies it is interesting to find that the Auditor-General has done something about which I have been commenting for some years. He has now required TAA to change its depreciation policy because it, and one or two other of the Commonwealth statutory authorities, have engaged in depreciation policies which are totally unreal. I will read from page 9 of the report of Trans-Australia Airlines a statement which I think makes the point I want to make. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> One significant change of accounting policy was made, in that capitalised exchange losses on foreign borrowings are now amortised over the remaining terms of the relevant loans, instead of over the remaining estimated economic lives of the aircraft financed. It is also noted, although it did not strictly constitute a change of accounting policy, that the Commission extended the economic lives of all aircraft types except the Twin-Otter, and adopted aircraft residual values of 10 per cent instead of the previous nil values, for depreciation purposes. In implementing these revised depreciation assumptions, the Commission re-stated accumulated aircraft depreciation provisions to the levels that would have existed if the new assumptions had been applied from the outset, this treatment being demanded by the Auditor-General . </PARA>
<PARA>I will identify the effect that that has had. This year it has meant that TAA has put in what would be regarded by most people as a rather miserable return. I am not saying it is the fault of TAA. There may be other reasons which we need to identify. But for a total operation, for which there is a total revenue of $378.5m, to turn in a net profit of $2.9m would be rather poor in the estimation of most people. I think that most shareholders, if they were shareholders in a company which had a total turnover of nearly $400m and had a net profit of under $3m, would start to ask questions at the next annual meeting or else would sell their shares. Let us identify the fact that as a result of this change in depreciation policy that profit has been taken up from about $2m to just under $3m. In fact, the only reason that the figure gets up to $3m is as a result of the change in the depreciation policy. That is only a little change rather than a big change which has been made because, as the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares points out, and as I have attempted to point out over the years, the whole depreciation policy being used is a failure. Assets, that is land and buildings have not been revalued since 1974. Assets values in relation to aircraft are these incredibly depreciated values where the life was estimated and depreciated down to nil. Now, because TAA has had difficulty in making a profit this year it did what Ansett did two years before when it suffered a huge loss of $18m in relation to Associated Securities Ltd. It revalued its aircraft. It is not something peculiar to either ATI or TAA. The only thing is that Ansett had to do this a couple of years earlier. Now, TAA has done it. The result is still that there is no real revaluation of assets, only a little change in depreciation policy which means that the profit can be boosted a little bit this year. If the assets of TAA were revalued on a proper basis I imagine they would be sufficient to go a very long way toward covering the indebtedness of $140m in respect of superannuation. One of the things that I have suggested in the past-I am getting to the stage of believing it must be insisted upon-is that before we determine any further questions about what will happen in relation to the domestic airlines, we should start to get some real figures from both of the protected domestic airlines on their actual operating expenses and their real asset values, and not some of the nonsense that we have been getting to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to delay the proceedings of the Senate but let me just identify a few other problems which seem to me to warrant further explanation than they receive. An extraordinary item in both senses of the word-in the accounting sense and in the ordinary language sense-is the one referred to in note 11 to the present annual report-the provision for annual leave. In the past five years TAA has had a net profit of $17m. Let me look at one item which relates to only two of those years. For two years, for some reason which is not explained, TAA decided to make provision for annual leave-something which is not done by public companies as far as I can gather. I have looked through a large number of reports and I have searched with a large number of people, but I cannot find such a provision. For some reason TAA made special provision for accumulated annual leave which is a nice way of setting aside an amount of money out of profit before having to declare it as part of the profit on which a dividend will be paid. Over two years, the year ending 1978 and the year ending 1979, it made a provision of nearly $11m. Unless that can be explained in a much better way than it has been explained in any of the reports which have been produced to date, my impression-and from checking this out, the impression of a number of people-would be that that is another aspect of hidden profitability. One is tempted to believe that TAA, during a period of some stress in relation to its indebtedness for superannuation, has been happily tucking away wherever it can whatever fat it can to ensure that it has hidden assets or funds which eventually it can draw upon. The sooner it draws upon them, the sooner they will become identified and the sooner we will know the real situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to this point: Is it really fair that the taxpayers of Australia should have to pick up a bill for $90m or $140m for superannuation benefits for the employees of an airline which is supposed to be in a competitive situation in what some people might think is a free enterprise land of competition but which others criticise as being no real competition but a protected duopolistic situation? Let me refer to some other items. There is the problem involving interest which I have referred to already and also this problem: There is no way from the published data in which one could attempt to rewrite the accounts of TAA on a normal commercial basis. I have had a considerable amount of work done to try to restructure them so that they can be compared in a way which would enable one to find out whether TAA is operating efficiently, whether it is making a profit, whether it is making a large profit or a small profit and what its real costs are. From the published data that is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made the general criticisms that in short there are problems in relation to the way in which interest has been dealt with, in relation to depreciation-both of those being extremely abnormal things-and in relation to annual leave which in the absence of any better explanation, is an extraordinary thing. There is also a problem in relation to valuation and revaluation of assets which again puts one in a position of not knowing their real value. However, when one looks at the aircraft involved and at the depreciation which has been applied, one can come to the conclusion that there are tens of millions of dollars worth, if not more than $100m worth, of assets which do not appear in their rightful amounts in the financial statements which are prepared as the result of the policy-it is applied by other statutory authorities; I am not suggesting TAA is the only one-of depreciating the assets to a nil value over their anticipated life expectancy and including in that depreciation the amount in respect of interest owing on the loan which can then-one cannot tell from the accounts whether it does-also amount to a double deduction from profitability of interest paid. The asset is depreciated and also apparently a deduction is made within the accounts as a payment out so that there is a double impact,</PARA>
<PARA> Having summarised some of those problems of interest, the gearing ratios, the lack of comparability that arises as a result of the extraordinary gearing ratios that are applied, depreciation, the extraordinary item for annual leave which, subject to any explanation, seems to be a way of tucking away a little of what would otherwise be profit and the huge liability in respect of superannuation, all I can say is that it seems to me that we need to request TAA to prepare accounts which indicate what the real costs are. If we had those we could then look not only at TAA and how its operation could be made most efficient but also at how the real cost of air fares in Australia could be identified. What are the real costs when airlines prepare their accounts on the sort of basis that I have identified? I have picked out only a few of the more outstanding items. There are plenty of others. I am reminded of the fact that three years ago, I think, I identified in a speech in this chamber a discrepancy between two years in the accounts of TAA of an amount which from recollection was about $400,000. To this day that has never been explained or corrected. I just wonder at an organisation which can make such a mistake and blithely ignore it from then on. There may be a perfectly simple explanation, but it would have helped if TAA had identified the explanation at some stage in its accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> My time is running short. I was going to discuss very briefly the suggestion made by the Australian Democrats that we should look at the amalgamation of TAA and Qantas Airways Ltd. I agree that we should look at that question, but bigness is not necessarily efficiency. I also believe that totally different considerations may apply to the operation of an international airline under international agreements and against international competition than ought to apply to a domestic airline. Not all economies can be achieved from combination, as the United Kingdom's experience of attempted amalgamation has shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate for giving me the opportunity to speak briefly on this matter tonight. I indicate that there are drawers full of more information in relation to this question for anybody who is interested at any time in pursuing the debate about how the accounts might be prepared so that they are on a basis which would give people who are interested an opportunity to identify the real profits and losses, the real asset values and the real costs of operation of our domestic airlines. Until we do that I think we are blowing hot air and not flying the people through the air efficiently. We should have this information before we start debating air fare formulas when we do not know accurately the basis on which they may have been calculated. </PARA>

It was interesting to observe that Senator Rae, who obviously has a fine grasp of detail in these matters, was able to give Senator Button a very clear lesson in accountancy and, in particular, the difficulties of obtaining comparable figures. Indeed, I found Senator Button's remarks very simplistic in relation to certain claims about the profitability of Trans-Australia Airlines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter tonight which I first raised in the Senate on 29 August 1979. That is the matter of Government funding to the Kapunda Committee for Ageing Inc. to enable that Committee to construct at Kapunda an aged persons hostel. After reading Press reports on Saturday, I am very confused as to what the Government actually is doing about providing funds to this Committee. Back in 1978, the Chairman of that Committee, Dr David Jones, wrote under the date 28 March to the Department of Social Security. I will quote not the whole of the letter but only part of it so that honourable senators will have the history of this application. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> As your Department will be soon considering the allocation of funds for the 1979-80 year, I wish to renew and reinforce the application by our committee for the Aged in Kapunda. </PARA>
<PARA>Having visited Kapunda during 1979 and spoken to people whom I know there, I received a letter from Dr Jones. I will quote only the last paragraph of the letter dated 17 August 1979 which sets out the problems the Committee was faced with. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you be kind enough to plead our case with the Minister for Social Security and seek their support. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, seek the support of the Department. On 27 August, just 10 days later, I wrote to Senator Guilfoyle in her capacity as Minister for Social Security and asked whether she would give urgent consideration to the application from the Kapunda Committee for the Ageing. I also wrote to Dr Jones in a letter under the same date advising him that I had approached the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 August, when I was speaking in the Senate in the debate on Budget Papers I referred to funding for aged persons' homes and I raised with the Minister the matter of funding for a home for the aged people of Kapunda. I referred her to the statement she had made on 21 August on social security programs under the heading 'Assistance to the Aged' and the amount of money that the Government would be making available. Time went by and, on 21 September, I received a letter from the Minister, Senator Guilfoyle. I will quote the pertinent part of that letter in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the existing commitments outlined above--</PARA>
<PARA>She had set out in the letter the reasons why things could not be done and the amount of money which had been allocated to various other projects-</PARA>
<PARA>you will appreciate that I am unable to give any assurance of funding for a particular new project at this time. I can assure you, however, that my department has recorded details of the Committee's proposal and it will receive careful consideration when relative priorities are re-examined in the context of future allocations of Government funds for the aged persons' accommodation program. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Committee on its excellent efforts to promote the establishment of its proposed hostel units and I regret that I am unable to provide the assistance which has been sought at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>That assistance had been sought for quite a few years previously. I then wrote to Dr Jones under the date 10 October. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the Minister in her answer does not give any indication that you will receive assistance in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> You may be assured that I will keep reminding the Minister of your needs. </PARA>
<PARA>I enclosed with that letter a copy of Senator Guilfoyle's letter. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 December 1979, Senator Guilfoyle issued a Press statement headed 'Major New $225m Program for Aged and Disabled Persons' Accommodation'. That Press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government announced today a new $225 million program for aged and disabled persons' accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote the whole of the Press release because I think the contents are already in Hansard. On 20 December, I sent an urgent telegram to the Minister asking her, in view of that statement, to place the Kapunda Home for Ageing high on the priority list. I have not received a reply. Of course, last year on the first day the Senate sat-Tuesday, 19 February 1980-I spoke in the adjournment debate, as I am doing now, on behalf of the people at Kapunda and I put the case to the Minister. I thought I had put it fairly strongly. I again raised the matter two days later in the adjournment debate on 21 February. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, after dinner, I was very pleased to be approached by the Minister and to be told that she had now made available the money for the Kapunda Committee for the Ageing. When I rang the people in Kapunda after receiving the message they were overjoyed. I take the opportunity tonight to pay tribute to the Minister for her very prompt action in dealing with the matter after I raised it during the adjournment debate. I think this shows that there is some value in making speeches on the adjournment. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter that I received from the Minister dated 21 February, after she had spoken to me personally in the corridor, in part stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Kapunda Committee's proposal was not included in the initial 1980-81 approvals, a further assessment of the proposal has now been made and I am pleased to advise that the proposal has been given an approval-in-principle for funding in 1980-81. I would suggest the Committee provide the Director of my department in Adelaide with firm details of its proposal as soon as possible. This will enable the Director to give whatever advice and assistance he can. </PARA>
<PARA>I sent a copy of that letter to the Chairman of the Committee, Dr Jones. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to that request from the Minister, full details of what the Committee wanted to do had already been given to the Department of Social Security but further details were sent to it. I received no further communication from either Senator Guilfoyle or the present Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, from the date of that letter, 21 February 1980. However, I was very astounded to read in the Adelaide Advertiser of last Saturday, 7 March, an article headed 'Unit cash approved'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> KAPUNDA-A $262,035 Federal grant towards building 20 hostel units for the aged in Nash Street has been approved. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been made under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act in favor of the Kapunda Committee for Ageing Inc. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, has told the MHR for Wakefield, Mr Giles, of the grant. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney has told Mr Giles eight months after I was advised by the then Minister, Senator Guilfoyle, that this money was available. I made the initial approaches. I feel that Senator Chaney has displayed some discourtesy to me in that, since the money was made available, there has been no communication to me unless this is an extra grant. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see a frown on the face of my colleague from South Australia-I have forgotten his name-Senator Messner. This may be another grant, an extra grant. I will be pleased if it is. What I really am concerned and confused about is that, having been told personally by the previous Minister for Social Security that after I had made the application the money had been approved, having received a letter that the money was approved and having advised the people in Kapunda that their request had been approved, I found last Saturday a report of Senator Chaney announcing through the local Liberal member that a grant had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Messner can clear up the matter tonight for me and the people of Kapunda by indicating what is going on and why I was ignored in the giving of the announcement to Mr Giles although I was the one who made the initial approach, I was the one who stood in this Parliament and thanked Senator Guilfoyle for making the money available and, as I said, no further communication has been received by me since 21 February last year until I picked up the Advertiser on Saturday and saw the report that the grant has been made available. It is confusing not only to me but also to the people in Kapunda who alerted me to it and who have worked very hard in an endeavour to get hostel units for the aged people who live in Kapunda. I hope that Senator Messner can throw some light on the story tonight because, if he cannot, I will pursue the matter further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The eloquence of Senator McLaren forces me to take part in this debate. I want to reinforce the argument he has put by speaking in the context of events in New South Wales. Honourable senators will know that I have always been a crusader for the transfer of Commonwealth-occupied land to the premier State, New South Wales. During the last Federal elections there was strong agitation for the land occupied by the Abbotsford quarantine station to be transferred to the New South Wales Government. I received a letter on this subject from the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, who pointed out that the accepted practice-I emphasise the words 'accepted practice'-was for this land, which had been acquired in World War I, to be returned to New South Wales only at the current market value. The State Government, which, like all other State governments, has been affected by a reduction in Federal grants, has had to economise. The State Government has considered the idea of the Housing Commission of New South Wales taking half of the land and making the other half available as a waterfront picnic area on the Parramatta River. It is an area which Senator Davidson, who is from the same State as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), would well know because part of the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution in the 1970s traversed that river; so I am sure that the Minister has got the message.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is so reprehensible about this matter-I use the word 'reprehensible' advisedly-is that I was told by Mr Newman that he had put it to the New South Wales Government that it had to come up with hard cash but, to my amazement, out of the blue-of course, it was election time and I am a resident of the Lowe electorate-a former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon), was able to say: 'The Minister has used his discretion. The land has been handed over to the New South Wales Government for use as a park. The Commonwealth is waiving any monetary consideration'. As a Conservationist I welcome any addition to parkland, but I think an important precedent is being set. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator McLaren was speaking previously I interjected that we are all supposed to be equal. On one occasion I had a heated altercation with Sir John Gorton, before he became Prime Minister. He said: 'Senator, we are all equal in this Parliament'. He used the word 'Parliament' for both Houses. I have never received a letter from Mr Newman confirming that the Federal Government had granted to the New South Wales Government this prime river frontage as a park and confirming that the financial compensation for the value of the land had been waived. Whatever dialogue ensued between Senator McLaren and Senator Chaney, an insult was paid to New South Wales senators. I still have not had a letter from Mr Newman. I pioneered the agitation in this matter. I have not been told the official reason for this happening. I do not cavil at the decision, but I represent New South Wales and I was entitled to be told the decision of the Government at the same time as Sir William McMahon was told. I ask the Minister to see that this miscarriage of justice is rectified and that I get a letter of apology from the responsible Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am tempted to say that I want to respond to Senator what's-his-name from wherever-it-is, but, since he is complaining about my lack of courtesy, I will be more polite than that. Unfortunately I heard only part of what Senator McLaren had to say. By the time I got to the chamber the Press release to which he referred had gone to Hansard, so all I can say at this stage is that I am a little uncertain as to the basis of the complaint of discourtesy that he has levelled in this matter. With respect to applications for subsidies for aged and disabled persons' housing, the general situation is that my Department and the Minister for the time being tend to receive multiple representations from a series of senators and members. Very often one has a number of senators from a State as well as the local member of the House of Representatives concerned about their constituents' interests. In the case raised by the honourable senator it is very likely, I think, that there were representations from a number of senators from both sides of the chamber. The fact that it would appear that a Press release was put out relatively recently by the local member of the House of Representatives is, again, not unusual, particularly when the funding has yet to come through. I understand that to be the case. I am lost for words. I do not intend to say any more. I assure the Senate that no discourtesy would have been intended by my Department or by me in dealings with Senator McLaren or any other senator. I am sure that there is a perfectly innocent explanation for the matters he is so excited about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I am informed by my Department that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Slovene Society (Karantania Inc.) was one of the many organisations which applied for capital and equipment funding under the ACT Community Grants Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) Mr T. E. F. Hughes Q.C. was consulted on 18 July 1980 and 20 August 1980 on the future conduct of the prosecution of persons arrested and charged in connection with an alleged social security conspiracy. At that time about 113 of those persons were not before a court, and it was unlikely that the charges against them would or could be disposed of for some years. They were in the meantime inevitably constrained by pending proceedings. In the interests of justice advice in regard to the overall approach to the prosecutions was sought from Mr Hughes as a senior counsel not concerned in the day to day conduct of particular proceedings.

<PARA> (2) The pardon was granted in respect of all crimes and offences against the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia that Miss Artopolou may have committed between 1 January 1976 and 31 March 1978 in relation to the preparation and lodgment of claims for the payment of Sickness Benefits and Invalid Pension pursuant to the Social Services Act 1947 and the receipt of such Benefits and Pension. The indemnity was in similar terms.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As far as I am aware the terms of the pardon were not communicated to the Greek Government at the time the pardon was granted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basis of the estimate to which this question refers is unclear. The estimate was made by Mr Rofe, Q.C., on 23 May 1979 during the Committal proceedings being conducted before Mr Brown, S.M., in the Central Court of Petty Sessions, Sydney. I am unable to say whether or not it is correct but I provide the following information as to costs that I have obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to 31 December 1980 the total amounts paid or approved for payment to counsel retained by the Commonwealth on behalf of the prosecution in these proceedings was $1,249,593.83. The total cost of payments to defence counsel through the Australian Legal Aid Office was $772,010.00 up to 31 December 1980. I cannot supply the amounts of salaries paid to the Magistrate and to Commonwealth and State officials that would be appropriately attributable to this case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I have seen copies of some letters which were sent out many years ago by Deputy Commissioners of my Department, advising individual veterans that their pension would not be reduced below the then applicable 100 per cent General Rate. However, I am not aware of any assurances given to these veterans that the minimum level of this pension would be raised with increases in the 100 per cent General Rate, although in practice this did occur until 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, in its report of 1973, did not fully support the preservation of benefits already gained in the interests of ex-servicemen and, in fact, recommended a number of changes. In particular, recommendation 19 called for the repeal of section 37 of the Repatriation Act 1920. Section 37 of the Act provided that disability pension granted in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis would not be less than the 100 per cent General Rate at the time of grant.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In his report of June 1975, Mr Justice Toose recommended that pensions in payment under section 37 of the Repatriation Act 1920 for tuberculosis be continued at the minimum rate then applicable and that future grants should only be assessed at about 25 per cent of the General Rate but with higher rates payable as applicable. His Honour also recommended that section 37 (3) of the Act be amended as there was no longer any justification for automatic grant of war pension for pulmonary tuberculosis.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The changes to the legislation are not considered to be contrary to either the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare or those of Mr Justice Toose. The repeal of section 37 of the Repatriation Act 1920 was raised by the Senate Committee in 1973 but it was only after long and careful consideration that the Government decided there was no longer sufficient reason for the rate of pension in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis to be assessed on any grounds other than those of actual incapacity.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation introduced by the Government was more lenient than the recommendations of the Senate Committee and, although not accepting that veterans granted entitlement for pulmonary tuberculosis in the future be assured a minimum pension, the pensions in payment were continued at a rate higher than that recommended by Mr Justice Toose. The changes to the legislation were in accordance with his recommendations that each case which arises in future be dealt with on its merits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position in relation to the matter raised in the question is as follows: On 29 April 1974 a Mr Anthony Bruce Catip sought to nominate for the 1974 Senate election in Queensland as Anthony Bruce Catip White-Australia. The then Australian Electoral Officer for Queensland acting on the basis of legal advice from the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, rejected that nomination as it did not comply with the requirements of section 71 (a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, in that, the nomination form did not contain the true christian names and surname of the person nominated.</PARA>
<PARA> On 18 May 1974 Mr Catip filed a petition in the Court of Disputed Returns challenging the validity of the rejection of his nomination. Mr Catip did not serve or otherwise proceed with the petition.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently in 1975 and again in 1980 Mr Catip nominated for, and contested, the Senate election in Queensland as Anthony Bruce Catip.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions relating to payment of costs in respect of appeals to the Federal Court, arising from proceedings before the Repatriation Review Tribunal, are set out in section 107VZZK of the Repatriation Act 1920 which provides that, where an appeal is instituted by the Repatriation Commission, the approved costs of the veteran shall be borne by the Commonwealth. Where an appeal to the Federal Court is instituted by a veteran, the Federal Court has a discretion to make such order as to the costs in the appeal as it considers just.</PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Repatriation Review Tribunal has no authority in the matter of determination of responsibility for costs in respect of appeals to the Federal Court.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Education has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tertiary Education Commission is examining the present superannuation arrangements of all Australian universities and colleges of advanced education, and will be including comment on the matter in Volume 1 of its 'Report for 1982-84 Triennium' which is expected to be available shortly. Grants for non-salary items of expenditure which include fuel are supplemented annually in accordance with a national index maintained by the Tertiary Education Commission. In this way, the base grant for total operating expenditure is adjusted to maintain its real value. To this extent, universities are compensated for increases in the cost of fuel, although it is recognised that annual supplementation may not fully meet cost increases as they occur progressively throughout the year. This matter will also be taken into consideration by the Tertiary Education Commission in the preparation of its 'Report for 1982-84 Triennium'.</PARA>

<PARA> Nominations in favour of over 1,000 East Timorese have so far been received under the special humanitarian program arrangements announced on 7 October 1980 and processing of these in the State offices of my Department is going forward rapidly. It is expected that the majority of the nominations will be acceptable under the relaxed criteria established in respect of this program.
