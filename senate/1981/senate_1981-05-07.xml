<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer: Was any decision made as to when and where the decision made by Cabinet on the amount of money to be offered to the States at the Premiers Conference would be announced, to which media outlets it would be circulated and what other media steps would be taken? I further ask the Minister to note that I am asking not for details of a substantive Cabinet decision but for information on how the decision was to be released. I ask the Minister to treat the question in the light of that qualification.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps, in the light of the fact that the question is broader than a question for the Treasurer, I will take it. Later I will be making a broader statement on the whole of these procedures. The fact is that the Minister in charge, in general terms, is competent to announce any decision of the Cabinet. It is necessary to indicate that every Premier who comes to the Premiers Conference does so with instructions and with limitations upon his capacity to discuss and negotiate. These are imposed on him by his own Government and his own Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The representatives of the eight governments at the Premiers Conference each came with particular advice and instructions from his own Cabinet. It is a matter of common knowledge and not any surprise to anyone that negotiating parameters are the practice of all governments. There was never any need for that to be made known. Any thinking person in the community and any member of the Press would know that. Therefore, there is no need for a statement to be made to the general public. As I understand the specific case, a reply was made to a question and the answer obviously stated the obvious, and that was that our Government, along with other governments, and negotiating parameters with which it came to the table.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a supplementary question. I ask the Minister whether the announcement at the Premiers Conference of the amount of tax reimbursement to be made available to the States was not in fact a statement of Government policy. As to any subsequent statement, was any decision made by the Cabinet to announce to the media that that which was released at the Premiers Conference was not a statement of Government policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the statement I will be pointing out that, as with other governments which came to the table at the Premiers Conference, the Federal Government came with negotiating parameters. The Federal Government has been pursuing policies, which have been applauded throughout Australia, of economic efficiency and economic restraint so as to keep down inflation, to allow enterprise to expand and to create more job opportunities. That policy has been applauded over recent weeks and months widely throughout Australia. The Federal Government has pursued those policies. In regard to tax sharing arrangements the Federal Government had a responsibility to seek a similar restraint by the States. It sought that restraint. It was told, by way of Cabinet parameters, that it must seek the most significant restraint it could achieve. It was given an absolute upper limit of real terms; that is, to retain the same value in purchasing power for the coming year. That upper limit, as such, would have been described as somewhere between 9 1/2 per cent and 10 per cent. It would have imposed no particular restraint upon the States to take more efficient measures. The agreement that was reached was perfectly within the hands of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to reach. It was part of a Cabinet decision that within those parameters they were empowered to reach an agreement. The agreement that was reached was 9 per cent. It was announced, and it was wholly within the Cabinet's decision so to reach that agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General will recollect that on 28 April I asked him about statements attributed to Mr Justice Barblett of the Family Court of Australia, which sought to make a case for bringing de facto relationships into family law. Is the Attorney-General aware that the judge took a most unusual step in arranging for the Press to be told beforehand that he would be delivering a judgment in the Family Court about these de facto relationships? Can the Attorney-General confirm that this is a highly unusual circumstance, as normally even important Family Court judgments are not reported? Has the Attorney heard any details about the case now concluded, particularly about the basis of ex parte orders made? Has the Attorney seen an article on page 26 of yesterday's Perth Daily News which alleges substantial irregularities in Mr Justice Barblett's handing of the case? Is the Attorney aware that Mr Justice Barblett arranged publicity for his statement without the knowledge or approval of the parties involved? Has the Attorney heard from the Child Welfare Department of Western Australia, which is considerably aggrieved, about aspects of the matter concerning the children? Finally, will the Attorney please get the full details of this matter and inform the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Court of Western Australia is a State court set up by its State Parliament and invested with jurisdiction under the Family Law Act of this Parliament and also under State legislation. I thought I explained some of those features of the Western Australian State Family Court in answer to the previous question which Senator Martyr asked me about that. I reiterate that it is a State court. Mr Justice Barblett and the other judges of that Court are appointed by the State Government. The procedures of that Court are under State legislation, even though a substantial part of its jurisdiction is under the Family Law Act. The matters that Senator Martyr has raised are, I believe, matters on which I will have to seek an answer from the Attorney-General of Western Australia. I will refer the honourable senator's question to the Attorney-General of Western Australia and endeavour to obtain an answer from him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is any confidentiality about the oath. I should like to get the text of it and see whether it can be made available to honourable senators. I will seek to do so. Prior to a Minister being sworn into a portfolio the first oath that is taken, as I recall it, is that of the Executive Council. That oath is in effect to advise the Queen or the Queen's viceroys to the best of one's ability and in full confidentiality. If that is not a complete recollection, I will see whether I can get the words.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank Senator Carrick. Will he tell us whether the oath obviates the need for all or any other sworn statements, as claimed by Mr Sinclair in a letter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations? Is there any penalty for breaches of the Executive Council oath? If so, how does it compare with the penalty of four years' imprisonment for a conviction upon indictment for making a false statutory declaration?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main sanction that comes upon a member of parliament is the sanction of the chamber in which he has the privilege of serving. If that Minister, senator or member can be shown, within that chamber, to have misled or to have made a false statement-not on oath but any false statement-then that member, senator or Minister is subject to the discipline of the chamber. The real sanction, as I understand it, is not one which relates to the Executive Council oath. It is a wider sanction. The Executive Council advises the Governor-General or Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia. The real sanction is the presumption by the people of Australia-a correct and proper presumption in my judgment-that when a member, senator or Minister speaks, whether publicly outside this chamber or in this chamber and whether with or without parliamentary protection, he or she speaks truthfully. If that person does not speak truthfully, then the sanction of the chamber is heavily upon him or her. Therefore, I invite all honourable senators to presume that when a member of parliament makes a statement, whether written or oral, that person is making it with the same force as if it were made on oath.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Education aware that a false impression has been publicly circulating this week that the Government will cut off funding for 30 colleges of advanced education, whereas the decision from the Review of Commonwealth Functions which affects colleges of advanced education is seeking improvement, rationalisation and co-ordination to achieve multi-campus colleges under single managing councils along the lines already successful in South Australia and Tasmania and these newly arranged colleges will continue to be fully funded? Can the Minister clarify this decision for continuing Commonwealth support for these colleges on the basis of these new arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1721" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Essentially, what Senator Teague says is correct. There were, and probably still are, approximately 80 colleges in existence. Over time there has been a great proliferation of those colleges. The proliferation occurred when the Australian population was expanding rapidly, when it was a younging population and, therefore, when there was a great demand for more teachers to meet the population explosion. A considerable number of colleges existed. Many of them were teachers' colleges, which in 1971 or 1972 changed their names to colleges of advanced education and became single purpose teachers' colleges. Now the Australian population growth is virtually stagnant. There is a slow decline in the school population in the government school sector and an aging of the population. There is now very substantially less demand for teachers-there was an explosion in the number of teachers-and therefore the future need for a number of single purpose teacher-training colleges has been somewhat negated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Tertiary Education Commission and the Government have taken the view that there is a need for a regrouping and rearrangement of colleges so that they can be linked under a common administration to save money and to give better efficiency and better performance. It is not to be considered that this will abolish the colleges. It is a reform which was inevitable in terms of demographic movement. It will bring about improvements. If those groupings occur in the course of the year, the Tertiary Education Commission will consider funding each new grouping on a per capita basis as though it were a separate organisation. I understand that approximately $5m extra has been made available to allow for extra costs in these rearrangements. Certainly it would be wrong to believe that this move will destroy a number of colleges.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement, at his Press conference last night broadcast on the Nationwide special edition at 11 o'clock, that his revelation of the Cabinet's bargaining position with the Premiers was justified on freedom of information grounds. No doubt Senator Carrick will recall the exact words, which were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in this world in which freedom of information is so important why should the Press or anyone worry about the fact that the Treasurer in consultation with myself and I, last night, made it plain that we'd been given that kind of authority, . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, by the Cabinet. Does this statement mean that the Government is no longer implacably opposed to the revelation under the Freedom of Information Bill of Cabinet materials, even materials of the utmost sensitivity involving contemporaneous negotiating positions? If the Prime Minister did not mean this by his statement, then-given that he is not exactly famous for his wit, irony, sense of humour or general lightness of touch-what did he mean?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that Senator Evans would have started from an understanding of the day-to-day Cabinet procedures by which daily, and certainly weekly, quite a number of Cabinet decisions are made and in due course the Cabinet decisions are made available to the community through the responsible Minister. That is the normal situation. It does not need any recourse to the Freedom of Information Bill or any other matter at all; it is simply that, when a particular procedure has taken place and there is a particular timetable, unless Cabinet has decided for particular reasons that the decision shall not be made public at that time it is made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is nothing at all secret about the fact that all governments-State and Federal-go to a negotiating table with parameters of negotiation defined by their respective Cabinets. That would be a presumption that every person would know and understand. There is no question of disclosing that. The fact is and the presumption is that everyone would understand it. I cannot believe that there can be any issue about that at all because, in respect of every Premiers Conference that has ever been held and every ministerial council meeting that is held in Australia, Ministers go to those conferences with what one could colloquially say would be riding instructions from their Cabinets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If indeed Senator Button wants to make statements, let him make them, and not by way of interjection. I am asked whether there is any particular link between a change of heart on freedom of information and what the Prime Minister said last night. The answer is no. They are two totally different situations. It has been the practice always for Cabinet decisions in due course, assuming they are public decisions, to be made public by the responsible Minister. There has always been the presumption that governments would take negotiating parameters to the negotiating table. There is nothing new about that. The fact that the Treasurer, being asked a question by journalists at a background briefing, responded by indicating that there were parameters is nothing new. It is simply the statement of a fact.</PARA></TALK.START>

If it is nothing new, if it is normal procedure, if it is normal practice, can the Minister give us one precedent for the revelation of a precise negotiating parameter after the event of either a Premiers Conference or an international conference into which Australia has gone with a bargaining position?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would need, of course, to research that to find incidents of the particulars. But let me simply say that every conference that takes place is a conference in which on both sides of the table, as in legal conferences, there are negotiating parameters, and to state that is simply to state the obvious or the platitude. As I understand it, the explanation of the Cabinet's decision which was given by the Treasurer was that instructions were given by the Cabinet to achieve the maximum level of restraint and that, above everything else, the negotiation should not exceed the ceiling of real terms. To give an explanation that, 'real terms' would mean something between 9.5 per cent and 10 per cent is to state what it is quite possible to state at any time from a Cabinet decision.

The world knows-even Senator Evans would know-that we have been aiming, through our general economic policies, through the Review of Commonwealth Functions, through the health funding, through the whole of our policies, to get a situation in Australia in which, at the very least, cost increases in the government sector are not greater in real terms.

Do the great height of the building and the arduous work and remote nature of the site warrant an over-award payment, for a 40-hour week, of $26.40? Furthermore, did the Minister read in today's Press that the cost of the new parliament house has doubled from the May 1978 figure of $151m to approximately $300m?

In other words, I should think that a leak would be what happens when information is planted in a sub rosa fashion with the aim of preventing anyone from tracing its source back to a particular person. The fact is that this background briefing, as I understand it, was done in a completely public sense in that a journalist asked for and was given access to a Minister and the Minister spoke frankly to the journalist.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is right in suggesting that there has been a considerable number of representations in this area. If my memory serves me correctly, I think that yesterday Senator Grimes presented a petition on the subject from an unusually large number of petitioners. The honourable senator is not indicating his agreement, but that is my recollection. The early intervention projects are matters which of late have received a lot of public interest. They represent a comparatively recent development and have been supported in part by the Commonwealth and in part by the State authorities up to this time. With respect to the Education Program for Infants and Children, that is one that is conducted by Dr Clunies Ross at the Preston Institute of Technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proposed to maintain that at existing levels of funding, pending consideration of a report into early intervention services commissioned by the Commonwealth through the Schonell Institute. That will involve an assessment of the effectiveness of Commonwealth programs and their integration with State health, education and welfare services. It will help us to make decisions on the Commonwealth's role in this area. The report was sought by the Commonwealth because over the last few years there had been a rapid growth in early intervention services for disabled children. The children's services program of the Department of Social Security has funded some of the services. As I have previously indicated, the State governments have also taken up responsibility for many of them. It was thought by us to be appropriate for the planning of good quality services that the direction and effectiveness of the program should be assessed before too many further decisions were taken. We expect to get the report towards the end of this financial year. It has been a little delayed.</PARA>
<PARA> Following receipt of that report, my Department will be developing guidelines on the assessment and funding of programs of this sort, but we will have to take into account the quite complex interaction of the State and Commonwealth responsibilities in that area. Within the last few days I have extended approval for funding at the current levels to the end of this calendar year. What action is taken after that will depend upon the Schonell report and the review of that report which will be received. However, it appears that the practice of taking action early in the life of a disabled child produces very good results. I imagine that the report is likely to throw up a quite positive assessment of the value of these projects.</PARA>

As it appears to be evident from this report that the sole offence that those people had committed was their membership of the Baha'i religious faith and as that is a faith which is represented in this country and which appears to consist of an eminently peaceful group of people, will the Government consider making some representations of protest to the Iranian Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

On 15 March a member of the Baha'i National Council and another leading Baha'i were executed in Shiraz. The verdicts against them alleged a number of offences but also prominently cited their adherence to the Baha'i faith. Those verdicts, which were confirmed by the supreme court of Iran, indicate an intensification at the highest level of persecution of the Baha'is by the Iranian authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are differences in airworthiness standards such as those relating to aircraft performance between aircraft classified as large and those classified as small, the dividing line being the maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 kilograms. Most commuter airlines operate only small aircraft but under recently announced government policy some commuter airlines are now permitted to operate aircraft of a size coming within the classification of large. These meet the same standards as are applicable to aircraft such as DC9s or Boeing 727s. Small aircraft operated by commuter airlines are required to meet standards which are accepted internationally for that class of aircraft. But, in addition, some further operational and airworthiness requirements have been imposed by the Department of Transport, aimed at bridging the differences in standards between large and small aircraft. These additional requirements include some in respect of takeoff performance and aim at the optimum level of safety that can reasonably be required for that class of aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>

It has a slightly different approach to the question asked by Senator Georges yesterday on Northern Ireland. By way of preface, I refer to the accepted fact that the political situation in Northern Ireland is compounded by its economic problems with shipbuilding and the depressed linen industry whereas the Republic of Ireland has a relative boom because of its European Economic Community dairy product sales. In that context, I was wondering whether we would be prepared to make the offer to both the United Kingdom Government and the Irish Republican Government along the lines that we would second Justice James Staples to serve on a boundaries committee to look at the boundaries, in view of the fact that, with a million and a half people, a boundaries adjustment to the Republic of Ireland could allow it easily to take additional people and leave fewer people competing for jobs and social services which is one of the root causes of the sectarian bitterness.</PARA></TALK.START>

I so accept it. It is true that, whilst there are some 300 years of history showing various reasons for Northern Ireland's problems many of the problems have now been lost in history but the bitterness still persists. Some of the residual reasons lie in the underprivilege of some and the feelings between the haves and the have nots. Some of the difficulties arise from economic problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Foreign investment proposals are subject to the Foreign Takeovers Act and included in those proposals are those that involve rural land. There is no exemption limit in the Act for the examination of this matter but in normal practice what has occurred is that there has been no intervention in the case of small properties involving a consideration of less than $350,000. Beyond that limit all real estate proposals are examinable. As a general rule proposals for new agricultural or pastoral business projects involving a total investment of $5m or more are expected to have a minimum of 50 per cent Australian equity, together with 50 per cent of the voting strength on the controlling board being held by Australian interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This provision is applied flexibly to ensure that worthwhile projects are not delayed where Australian equity is not available on reasonable terms and conditions. Very few cases involve new businesses or projects. Most involve acquisitions of existing businesses. Approval for a foreign purchase is not normally given unless the Government is satisfied that Australians have been given a reasonable opportunity to buy the land in question if they wish to do so. Approval usually is given when it is considered that Australians have had adequate opportunity to purchase or to participate and where the investment proposals offer net benefits to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The question asked by Senator Jessop mentioned Middle East interests. The advice that I have is that overall Middle East foreign investment in Australia is a very tiny proportion of total foreign investment. That is true for Middle East investment in rural properties as well as in other areas of investment. If a particular proposal is causing concern to Senator Jessop, if he would advise me of the details I could have some reference made to the Treasurer to see whether some investigation of that matter is necessary. As I have said, my information is that overall the Middle East foreign investment is a tiny proportion of the total foreign investment in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may deal with the last part of the question first, it is palpable nonsense to suggest that any Minister or Prime Minister would proceed to have a background briefing of a journalist or journalists and later seek to deny that that had happened. The fact is that journalists are, by nature, people of integrity and have a responsibility to disclose these matters. In such a case the journalist would have said: 'This is not so'. Quite clearly the honourable senator's suggestion is palpable nonsense and should be disregarded. If there were a background briefing of one or more journalists on a matter which later became a matter of public controversy, the Minister or Prime Minister concerned would accept what he had told the journalists. No doubt a record is kept of these kinds of briefings and therefore what had been said could be easily established.</PARA></TALK.START>

He gave them information which, as I have said, one could normally expect to flow from the Premiers Conference. That briefing was certainly not in the category of a leak.

The fact is that the Cabinet, because it has been pursuing an economic policy that has been commended internationally as well as in Australia, was seized of the fact that that same economic policy and its principles should extend to revenue sharing with the States. It gave to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer a set of negotiating parameters with the absolute maximum being the real value of the money in terms of last year's purchasing power, but with the request to them that they should seek to gain better than that in order that there should be an efficiency built into the States-the same as we have imposed on ourselves-so that the taxpayers themselves could have the benefit and so that the development of industry and commerce and of jobs in Australia should persist. The Cabinet said to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that, operating within those parameters, they could, on their own judgment, make a decision. They were given by the Cabinet a clear right to negotiate within those parameters. They were doing their job when they did that. In the course of the day there were a number of variations of position within the parameters.

In the course of his answer to Senator Chipp, Senator Carrick said that initially the Prime Minister was content to leave the matter of giving a background briefing to journalists to the Treasurer, Mr Howard. Because Senator Chipp's question was not answered, I ask: When the Prime Minister formed the opinion that his view, supplementary to that of the Treasurer, should be put to journalists, did the Prime Minister invite selected journalists to hear his view?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On 29 April, Senator Lewis referred to comments reportedly made by Admiral Lord Hill-Norton. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has provided the following information in response to Senator Lewis's question: The Government is aware of remarks reportedly made by Admiral Lord Hill-Norton to the effect that Australian troops should replace United Nations forces in peacekeeping operations in the Middle East. The United Nations has had long experience and involvement in peacekeeping operations in the Middle East. At present the following United Nations forces are engaged in peacekeeping operations in the Middle East: The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organisation and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian Army officers have served for many years as military observers with UNTSO and in this capacity are associated also with the operations of the Disengagement Observer Force and the Interim Force in Lebanon. In addition, an Australian helicopter unit known as Austair was an important component of the United Nations Emergency Force whose mandate to patrol the Sinai concluded in 1979. It is therefore not accurate to identify separate options of United Nations forces and Australian troops since Australian troops have already participated with distinction in a number of Middle East and other United Nations peacekeeping operations.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator mentioned the Zimbabwe example. The Government agrees that the Australian and other Commonwealth forces in Zimbabwe performed admirably the difficult role assigned to them. This was an exclusively Commonwealth operation. On the other hand, the situations on the West Bank, the Iran-Iraq border and the Thai-Kampuchean border all call for a very different role, even assuming that the parties concerned in these situations could agree on what that role should be. The Government agrees that United Nations peacekeeping operations play a vital role in lessening international tensions and creating conditions of stability. However, because any such operation can be mounted only with the agreement, both in principle and in detail, of the parties directly involved, there would seem to be little to be gained from raising the subject in general terms either at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting or at the United Nations.</PARA>

I now have the answer. I will seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. It is an important matter which deals with drug abuse. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard pages 34, 35, 36 and 37 of the report on drugs presented by the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. I have shown these pages to the Chairman of Committees and he has passed them as suitable for incorporation. It is necessary to have these pages incorporated because they reinforce the statements which I made. In particular, they reveal, as I should have mentioned as part of my argument, the bromides. This would have strengthened my position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Barbiturates. Barbiturates are the most abused prescription drugs in Australia and can induce dependence. At the time of the replacement in therapeutics of the bromides and bromureides by barbiturates as sedatives the dependence producing effect of barbiturates was not realised. There was much evidence submitted that dependence on these drugs has been largely medically induced by being too freely prescribed. There is encouraging evidence that responsible medical bodies are now taking steps to inform the medical profession that greater care should be exercised in barbiturate prescribing. When misued the barbiturate drugs induce a confusion in the mind of the abuser and it is perhaps this effect which has caused them to be one of the principal vehicles for suicide attempts. Barbiturate dependence is found mainly in the over 35 age group and more frequently in women than in men. It has been suggested to the Committee that they have been too freely used in hospitals and nursing homes as well as in the normal prescribing for patients by general practitioners. Evidence was given that in Queensland hospitals the prescribing of barbiturates has been largely replaced by nitrazepam with consequent beneficial results. This aspect of therapy should be examined by medical authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> With evidence available that the rate of suicide attempts is increasing in Australia, the Committee believes that a useful step would be to eliminate the opportunity for suicide by the impulsive swallowing of large numbers of barbiturate tablets. Two suggestions have been made in evidence. The first was that barbiturates should be individually wrapped in plastic or tinfoil as a deterrent to this impulsive action. A foil wrapping would have the added advantage of preventing deterioration of barbiturate tablets during storage. The second proposal was to follow a practice adopted in Japan of adding a mild emetic which in the individual tablet would be harmless but if consumed in excessive quantities would cause vomiting and therefore render the suicide attempt abortive. The Committee was unable to obtain further details of this method but suggests that it may be worth further examination by health authorities. However it does appear that individual foil wrapping of barbiturate tablets would be reasonably inexpensive and be a valuable deterrent in suicide attempts. It therefore RECOMMENDS that it should be made compulsory that barbiturate tablets be individually foil wrapped.</PARA>
<PARA> The bromureides-are synthetic bromides developed since the use of bromides went out of favour in medical practice because of their toxic effects. They are claimed to be sedatives with wide hypnotic action, commonly referred to as a relaxing tablet and are freely available in over-the-counter sales from chemists throughout Australia excepting in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The Committee has been informed that their availability is shortly to be restricted to medical precription in Tasmania. The National Health and Medical Research Council recommended some years ago that bromureides should be available throughout Australia only on medical prescription but this recommendation has not been adopted by some States.</PARA>
<PARA> Medical evidence given before the Committee has been scathing in its criticism of the free availability of these drugs which were claimed to be major drugs of dependence in Australia. The Committee was told that in the Melbourne area, 720,000 bromureide tablets are sold without a prescription each week, the major fraction being in inner suburbs and in industrial areas. Of their danger, an eminent medical authority said 'I think it is generally agreed that bromureides are more hazardous as far as causing straight toxic psychosis than are the barbiturates.' The Committee also received first hand evidence on the disastrous effects on the life of a family following one of its members becoming dependent on bromureides.</PARA>
<PARA> Only one witness defended the free availability of bromureides. In fairness it must be stated that he was a witness whose experience and professional standing must give weight to his evidence. However some of the authorities quoted by this witness in support of his arguments were found on further examination to have been quoted out of context. In the face of the overwhelming and sometimes equally eminent professional standing of other witnesses, the Committee unhesitatingly accepts the dangers of the free availability of this drug and RECOMMENDS that bromureides should be available only on medical prescription and for the same reasons as in the case as barbiturates, that bromureide tablets should be individually wrapped.</PARA>
<PARA>The minor analgesics are the aspirin type drugs in their various compounds. Some of them can only be obtained from pharmacies but in the main they are freely available in almost any retail establishment without restriction. Evidence was given of research which strongly indicates that the continued and excessive use of these drugs is a possible cause of the kidney disease papillary necrosis. The evidence included advice that the incidence of this complaint is extremely high in Australia, possibly fifty times as great as in other Western countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The high incidence of kidney disease has led to Australia becoming a leading country in the treatment of the complaint including kidney transplant operations. While leadership in this field must be applauded, the cost of such treatment as advised to the Committee in evidence is worthy of reference. A leader in this research said 'In the past two years the treatment of patients with kidney failure due to minor analgesics has cost the Australian public $500,000. Each patient with kidney failure treated with an artificial kidney costs the Australian public $5,000-$10,000 for each year of treatment'. This same witness went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The enormous cost of continued treatment of this type for people with self-induced kidney disease which results from excessive consumption of drugs raises a very practical question as to whether drugs which can cause this type of damage should be available without restriction. The patients who develop kidney disease from excessive consumption of minor analgesic drugs take these not for any analgesic effect which they produce but as a habit. They are in fact analgesic addicts and it is very difficult to stop them from taking the analgesic drugs. They may take 50 or even 100 tablets or powders daily and often admit to taking them for the stimulating effect which they produce . . . The disease always recovers if the patient can be persuaded to stop taking drugs'.</PARA>
<PARA> While the research undertaken so far may not have reached a stage of providing irrefutable scientific evidence, the Committee believes that every encouragement should be given to the pursuit and extension of research in this field. The fact established are that Australia has a high incidence of kidney disease and research points strongly to this being related to the excessive consumption of minor analgesics.</PARA>
<PARA> Those involved in the research in this field feel so strongly on the subject that they have suggested that minor analgesics should be available only on medical prescription. Some medical witnesses supported this view and others recommended that their sale be restricted to pharmacies where at least a qualified person should be available to advise customers on their use. On the other hand witnesses representing a number of manufacturers contested both the inferences which could to date be drawn from research into kidney disease and the contention that their products should be available only on prescription or through pharmacy outlets. They maintained that the research into kidney disease was inconclusive and presented the results of a survey into the consumption of minor analgesics which indicated that 90.1 per cent of the population use minor analgesics and that 11.4 per cent are daily users.</PARA>
<PARA> Although not questioning the method of the survey conducted, other than that it was conducted over a short period of time and in only two areas, this isolated survey supports the view expressed in Chapter 2, that available statistic are inadequate on an Australia-wide basis. Although these witnesses were reluctant to give figures of their own production unless a similar requirement was made of all manufacturers, their written submission to the Committee stated that 'An analysis of known industry sales figures shows that the usage of mild analgesics in Australia is 0.63 tablets per person per day'. By simple calculation this reaches the staggering figure of 2,904.3 million tablets used by the Australian community in a single year.,</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the considerable evidence given on the subject, the Committee concludes that greater care should be exercised by those who consume minor analgesics regularly and that their potential dangers must be made more widely known to the people. It accepts the evidence so far available that consistent and excessive use, without medical direction can be harmful but because of their widespread value for intermittent relief of minor complaints, it would be unreasonable to limit their availability to medical prescription. Nor does the Committee see any value in their sale being restricted to pharmacies only. It believes, however, that the dangers of excessive use should be clearly indicated on labels and that they should not be displayed in such a way as to encourage their purchase in impulse buying. Greater restriction should be imposed on both the form and amount of advertising of these products, window, floor and counter displays and 'specials' should not be permitted. Minor analgesics should be individually wrapped.</PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Government's response to this Industries Assistance Commission Report which was to reject the recommendations. It is an appropriate time to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has a view of himself-indeed one could say a manic obsession of himself-as a disciple or a descendent of Adam Smith, Fredrich von Hayek, Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman. He sees himself as the high priest of small government, market power and of no government interference with consumer sovereignty. Last Thursday we were exposed to an orgy of self- congratulatory rhetoric on this matter. The very next day, last Friday, we saw a travesty of the Prime Ministerial rhetoric. The sordid realities displaced the sanctimony of the Fraser Government which had been revealed the day before when the Government decided to move to impose restrictions on the import of canned ham, imports which, at their peak, comprised something like 0.8 per cent of Australian pig meat production and something less than 5 per cent-about 4 per cent-of Australian canned ham production. </PARA>
<PARA> By that decision the Government repudiated market forces, its self-proclaimed political philosophy, the Industries Assistance Commission, consumer sovereignty which it claims ought to be sacrosanct, and its own proclaimed commitment to reducing inflation by adopting policies which will force food prices up, however marginally. It repudiated all these things and responded, as it usually does, to pressure from vested interests. In its customary grubby fashion, at what is almost a micro-level, the Fraser Government, the Prime Minister, this bearer of the standard of Adam Smith and Friedrick von Hayek, applied the power of government to protect the perceived interests of a favoured few who are clients of the Government and of the National Country Party in particular. </PARA>

What I am saying is that all of the sanctimonious rhetoric of the Fraser Government with which we were bored last Thursday was all overturned the very next day. What is really dangerous about this is that the man who is primarily responsible for it, the Prime Minister, this client, this puppet of the National Country Party, lacks the intellectual capacity to recognise the mutual exclusiveness of his own assorted manic obsessions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It will be recalled that last night during the adjournment debate I indicated my intention to seek leave to make a statement on this matter today. The reason for the statement is that, since the Premiers conference, a number of matters have been raised in the Press and considerable misunderstanding has occurred in relation to them. I therefore intend now to indicate the facts to enable a better understanding of the matter to be reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premiers Conference was called for May this year to discuss basically two items-revenue sharing and infrastructure financing. It was intended to get some indication in Loan Council of the thinking of both the States and the Commonwealth on the latter. The main business related to revenue sharing. It concentrated upon the fact, known to the Australian community, that the old arrangements had run out of time and that there was a need for a new set of allocations to be made to the States for the immediate future. Of course, all Premiers and the Commonwealth were aware that in the months ahead the Commonwealth Grants Commission was likely to bring down a report on relativities which could give another emphasis to the whole matter of funding. The Commonwealth came to the table at the Premiers Conference in the knowledge that it had been requested repeatedly in the past by the States not to come in a totally inflexible position and not simply to adopt one set of figures from which it would not move. Premiers had suggested that if that were the approach the matter could be dealt with by correspondence and that the correct position should be for the Commonwealth to come with flexibility of negotiation, and that is what the Commonwealth did. </PARA>
<PARA> The cabinet authority, under which the Commonwealth went to the Premiers Conference, was that a final decision as to the amount to be given to the States should be made at the Conference by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the light of the Cabinet's parameters and in the light of the assessment of the discussion both in terms of the economic and budgetary considerations. That in fact was done. I repeat that the Cabinet had given essential and particular parameters and had given authority to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer to reach a point of finality of that matter following a full day's discussion. It was further stipulated that the amount in toto should not be greater than the same amount in real terms as had been provided in 1980-81, plus a sum sufficient to cover items such as urban public transport which were to be absorbed into the general revenue grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the absorption grants I point out that to understand the basis of the Commonwealth Government's stand and its approach one must look to the general state of the economy in Australia and to those steps which are necessary-and agreed upon widely-to continue to improve the economy at this vital stage. General approval of our economic policy has been indicated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, by other countries and by economists. Our inflation rate is some two or three percentage points below those of our trading partners and we recognise that it is vital to try to retain something like that relativity. We recognise that the enormous pressures that will accompany the developmental processes in the months immediately ahead, particularly in regard to the inflow of capital and the demands upon our resources, will threaten our inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in the weeks and months preceding the Premiers Conference the Commonwealth set about putting its own house in order and took stringent steps to produce a state of efficiency which would permit a reduction in the size of government and thus free for use by the private sector vital resources needed for the expansion of industry and commerce and the creation of jobs. All of these are eminently respectable goals and acknowledged by economists and national leaders as being vital. The Commonwealth, through its Review of Commonwealth Functions, its review of the health scheme and its whole approach, has set out to reduce its own expenditure in order to take the heat out of inflation and borrowing rates. That has been its purpose and goal. However, the Commonwealth recognises that it cannot proceed alone, in an economic sense, to achieve those goals-that the States must accept a parallel responsibility and co-partnership in lowering the rate of inflation and taking some pressure off interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, in regard to the vital segment of the revenue sharing, it was necessary to adopt the approach that whatever the quantum of revenue sharing it should not so press upon the economy as to negative the Commonwealth's policies and become inflationary in itself. In other words, the Commonwealth accepted that the states had an equal responsibility to put their own houses in order, to bring about an efficiency which would lessen the pressure imposed by government and increase the capacity of the private sector to create employment. These are eminently acceptable goals and have been acknowledged and approved as such by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It was within that framework that the Cabinet decided that the absolute maximum ceiling that could be envisaged in any such negotiation would be the receipt by the States, in real money terms, of what they had received the year before. However, the Commonwealth recognised that if that were to be so there would not be exerted a pressure for the achievement of efficiency and saving and that the pressure on the rate of inflation would continue. In defining what might be meant by real money terms, the Commonwealth had in mind that the rate of inflation might be expected in the year ahead to be of the order of 9 1/2 per cent to 10 per cent. Therefore it was agreed that 9 1/2 per cent to 10 per cent would be the absolute upper limit but that the Prime Minister and Treasurer should seek to achieve something better than that in order that the States should exhibit the same good housekeeping as the Commonwealth has accepted as being necessary for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> That is how the Commonwealth went to the negotiating table. The negotiations ran over the full day and evening; they were intensive. A number of breaks were taken for discussions by the Premiers and by the Commonwealth. There was ample opportunity for both sides to put their views. The views of the States and of the Commonwealth were put. Indeed, there was an acknowledgment by the States that there had to be a reduction in the money given compared with that given in the past if there was to be some tackling of inflation. There was no argument that the Commonwealth in the past generally had been overgenerous in terms of the conditions that would confront the Australian community in the future. At the start the Commonwealth took the position that it would seek to achieve an 8 per cent increase in the quantum of money. As the debate emerged, it became clear that one or two States would find some difficulty because an 8 per cent increase, if broken up, would give one or two States less than 8 per cent. So the Commonwealth suggested that we might look at bringing the increase for all States up to 8 per cent. That meant that certain amounts had to be added to the South Australian, Tasmanian and Victorian shares so that every State had 8 per cent. That amount was an additional $27m which had the overall effect of the quantum being, from memory, about 8.4 per cent, with no State getting less than 8 per cent. That again was a matter for vigorous discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion having gone over the morning and the afternoon, it was adjourned for dinner. There was a lengthy discussion following dinner between the Prime Minster, the Treasurer and the five other Ministers who had special reasons for being present. The States' arguments were taken into account and it was agreed that the Commonwealth's pre-absorption offer-that is, the offer regarding tax sharing-should be lifted to 9 per cent. That meant that, together with the absorption items, the increase would be 10.1 per cent. An increase of 9 per cent, which would be compared with the total real value of money in the range from 9.5 per cent to 10 per cent, was considered a respectable response to the request from the States for adequate money to enable them, with some minimum efficiency, to pursue their tasks and to put their house in order, as the Commonwealth did. The Commonwealth indicated that 9 per cent would be its final negotiating position, and it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers went away and, of course, the normal discussion occurred in the Press. Each of the parties went to the table with negotiating parameters. The Premiers did not disclose their parameters, nor were they asked to. Everybody understood that everybody round that table had those parameters and everybody understood that the community outside would know that. The States would have known that the intention of the Commonwealth would be to get the best bargain it could for the Australian community in terms of the best economic policies and that the Commonwealth was striving, within those parameters, to get agreement on a lower section of the parameters. That would have been understood; it would have been taken for granted. Any suggestion of surprise today would involve a failure to understand the normal negotiations at the table. </PARA>
<PARA> Following that, there occurred the normal discussions with the Press. The Premiers no doubt pursued numerous backgrounding sessions with the Press, as well as direct Press conferences. There is no doubt in the world that they will have given background information to the Press, as they have done enormously in the past. It is equally known that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer provided background information. I said during Question Time today that it is the normal process of governments in every country in the world, whether State or Federal and of whatever political faith, to provide the Press throughout the day with background information. The Press itself understands that from time to time it needs and uses what is called unattributable information, not because there is anything wrong in attributing it but because the very nature of the story is such that it is a background story and not just one man's statement on that story. So background briefing has occurred beyond any doubt at all at both State and Federal levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Without any question of secrecy, as I understand it, the Treasurer was approached by a number of journalists. I think he agreed to talk with them on his own. It is perfectly plain to anyone who understands the process that that matter could become public property and would not be in any way unethical. No one who understands the Treasurer would attempt in any way to impugn his integrity and honesty. He is a man of great frankness and great courage in presenting the honest facts to the Australian people. In these briefings, as in all matters, his behaviour has been impeccable, as has that of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Normally the limits of the parameters would not have been raised because it would have been generally assumed that the parameters existed and that the Commonwealth would have settled below its maximum. That is the normal situation. That would be fully understood. But, as I understand it, a journalist, or some journalists, asked both Mr Howard and Mr Fraser whether the Commonwealth has been too lenient, the important point being whether the Commonwealth, having set very stringent standards for itself with regard to its own behaviour, had relented or weakened in the journey with the States. That was a question of considerable importance because it recognised that it was vital for the States to set the same stringencies as the Commonwealth. Mr Howard indicated clearly that that was not so, that we had negotiated to a ceiling of real values but that we had been able to achieve something less than that, although the 9 per cent increase represented a very respectable amount for the Premiers. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there has been some reaction from one or more of the Premiers on this matter. Mr Howard has said that perhaps it was an error of judgment on his part to have commented in the detail that he did. In so saying, he was not saying that the error of judgment was one of ethics or impropriety. As I understand it, he was saying that, although the Premiers would well know and suspect that the Commonwealth's final offer was below the ceiling, there may have been some sensitivities about a public revelation of that and that it might have been better left unsaid, although fully understood by everyone involved an any negotiations. So the Treasurer, being the man he is, made those comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion has been made that there is some impropriety in telling the Press the substance of some Cabinet decisions. I cannot comprehend how such a long bow could have been drawn. The fact is that, whilst Cabinet discussions remain confidential and whilst some Cabinet decisions that have a long term consequence have to remain confidential, it is normal, where no necessary confidentiality is imposed, for the Minister concerned to have the full capacity, based on his judgment, to indicate Cabinet decisions. All of us, day by day, are indicating Cabinet decisions to the public. Certainly there was no impropriety in indicating that decision. It is very proper for us to tell the Australian people, as I have done, how the Commonwealth Government viewed the economy, how the Commonwealth Government, with very great solicitude for the employment prospects of Australians for the future, seeks to keep the economy in excellent shape and to create more jobs, and how the Commonwealth Government intends that the States should work in copartnership in that regard. The Commonwealth Government has set particular parameters. Therefore, I would reject unequivocally any suggestion that there has been any impropriety as regards a Cabinet decision. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the fact that some three or four journalists became party to the particulars, the Government would have presumed that all the community would have accepted the existence of parameters at the State and Federal levels and that the Government would have worked to keep the final position below the ceiling. Therefore, what was stated by the Treasurer in response to a question-it would not otherwise have been stated-was a presumption that would be drawn by all. They are the simple facts of the case. At a Premiers Conference there is always an attempt by the Premiers to get the maximum amount of money they can get. There is never an occasion on which the Premiers will publicly admit that they are happy with the result. At the conclusion of every Premiers Conference held in Australia statements have been made by the various Premiers that they have been short-changed. Nevetheless, they privately acknowledge that in the years that have passed they have been given a generosity in funding by way of revenue grants which would be quite wrong in the general concept of the rigidities and stringencies needed for the future if we are to have prosperity and the employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there will be the normal response of the Premiers that they have not received enough. Of course, they have a completely valid right to go into the Conference and fight like Kilkenny cats to get as much as they can. Equally, the Commonwealth has an absolute moral responsibility to go into the Premiers Conference and bring about the result it thinks is best for the Australian people. I repeat that a 9 per cent result, based against a prediction of 9.5 per cent to 10 per cent, inflation rate, is a result that the States are quite competent to cope with and and it is quite competent for them to do that without having to apply anything like the efficiency measures that the Commonwealth has applied. The achievement and the adoption of that would have provided the kind of copartnership that was essential. It is interesting that virtually every correspondent and every editorial in Australia has acknowledged the need for the Commonwealth to achieve a finality with the States which would create a stringency upon them in terms of good housekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the journey after that result, the negotiations having been carried out in the strictly correct way, there is nothing in the background briefings or the comments that are in any way unethical or improper. The contrary is true. It is true, I suppose, that no political leader would like to read in the newspapers that, in fact, he was not capable of getting all that a Cabinet ceiling might have enabled him to get. Every Premier in his heart of hearts knew that that was highly unlikely. Every Premier must have known when he left the conference table that the Commonwealth would have sought to get, within the centre means of those parameters, the best for the people of Australia. Indeed, that was done. I believe that this issue has been blown out of all proportion. In fact, the Commonwealth, by its actions both in setting its own house in order in the previous weeks and by it achievements at the Premiers Conference, has done something that will be applauded world-wide as being the best for the Australian people in terms of good economics. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I am underwhelmed, as some say, by the blandness of the statement by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). Last night, when we were having something of a debate about this matter, Senator Carrick came into the Senate and apologised for not being in the chamber earlier. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I intend to schedule for tomorrow morning a statement and a debate on this matter. Mr President, in ordinary procedures, that will allow what I understand the Opposition has been seeking tonight and that is what our intention is. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what we were seeking last night was some explanation of the conduct of various Ministers and Press secretaries of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in standing over journalists in this place. We were seeking an explanation of the conduct of and the inconsistencies between two Ministers in particular about a set of facts which occurred earlier this week. It is not much comfort for us for the Minister to come into the Senate and tell us about the Government's economic management-the 'Play it again, Sam' tune-and the great savings which have been imposed on the community as a result of the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I shall test Senator Carrick's fundamental proposition, which goes to the heart of this matter. His fundamental proposition in the Senate this morning is that everybody in Australia-all the sophisticates in Australia, except members of the Australian Labor Party Opposition and people like that-know that when Premiers meet with the Commonwealth Government they each have a negotiating position-a parameter, as it were-for the purposes of discussion. What has now been revealed, of course, is that the parameter of the Federal Government in dealing with the Premiers was greater than the amount which the Premiers were in fact granted. Let us change the terminology for a minute and forget the Premiers, none of whom may be particularly attractive figures to everybody. Let us remember that we are talking about the taxpayers' money and we are talking about the delivery of community and government services to the people of Australia. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen knows, it is not as though the Premiers will stick the money in their own pockets. The money which Queensland gets is used by the Queensland Government to provide services to the people of Queensland. We are not just talking about the Premiers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. I believe I have taken it too far. The point is that we are talking about taxpayers' money and the way that this Government handles taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me test Senator Carrick's fundamental proposition by asking some questions. This is the Parliament of Australia which, according to all traditions of the Parliament of Australia, is entitled to know as well as anybody in this country what the facts are about government decisions. What would have happened if I had come into the Senate on Tuesday after the Premiers Conference and asked Senator Carrick: 'What were the parameters which the Commonwealth Government had in its negotiations with the Premiers'?' If I had asked Senator Carrick that on Tuesday morning, what would he have said? Does anybody in the Senate believe that he would have said anything other than: 'No, I am sorry, you cannot have that information. That is a matter confidential to the Cabinet'? Would he have said anything else? Has he ever said anything else in this chamber when asked questions of that kind? That is what he would have said on Tuesday. Senators and members of this Parliament would not be entitled to know, but journalists selected for background briefings by Malcolm Fraser would be entitled to know. That is the point of it all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take another example of Senator Carrick's glibness about this question of how the sophisticates of Australian society know that they all have negotiating positions at the Premiers Conference. Let us take this in another context and assume that the Commonwealth Government is involved in negotiations concerning wages with its employees and the Commonwealth Government offers its employees a wage rise of $10 a week. Let us presume that the day after the wage rise has been announced a senior public servant goes to the newspapers and says: 'They are mugs, those unions, they could have had $12 if they had pressed harder'. Supposing a senior public servant did that a couple of days later. What would any self-respecting government do to him? It would sack him. That is what should be done to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of this country because they did exactly the same thing as the public servant in the hypothetical case I have put forward. There would be uproar in this country if that occurred in relation to an industrial relations situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier this sort of information is not even available to members of this Parliament but it is available to the people whom the Prime Minister of this country selects to tell about it in a context of boasting about how tough and smart he is. That is the context in which Cabinet secrets, denied to members of this Parliament, are given to the public of Australia. It is called backgrounding. It is not acknowledged. The Prime Minister is not doing it. A senior government official made the information available. The new pseudonym for the Prime Minister for Australia is 'a senior government official'. I remember a year ago when the Budget was leaked. According to some people that was leaked by a senior government official. We wonder which senior government official leaked the Budget last year to Laurie Oakes. Was it the same senior government official who leaked information on this occasion?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's claim that we all ought to understand that we do have negotiating positions, that Premiers have negotiating positions, that the Commonwealth Government has negotiating positions-it is an in-club thing-and that we understand the rules, is nonsense. That sort of information, and the sort of information to which I have referred about the parameters of Commonwealth Government decisions in the offer that was to be made to the Premiers, is available to selected people chosen by the Prime Minister, but it is not available to the Parliament of Australia. I am prepared to go along with the suggestion that it ought not to be available. It is not available to people other than those selected journalists. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick came in here this morning floating that proposition blandly. He made no response to the suggestions which were made last night. I understand that he is the only Minister to speak in this debate. He is to be supported by the resident Cicero, Senator Puplick, who will no doubt seek to close the debate, but no other Ministers are coming in here to defend the Prime Minister. They have got sick of defending the Prime Minister. Fourteen Ministers in the Fraser Government have gone now. Why should anybody else such as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) put his head on the block. He might be next. Senator Puplick, a senator who will not even be here after June, has been selected as the sacrificial lamb to contribute to this debate at a later stage. Senator Carrick talks blandly about this issue as if nobody had been upset by it. He actually said in what was I think the most classic patronising remark that I have ever heard him make-I have heard him make plenty-that some people were sensitive about this issue. I tell him that Sir Charles Court is sensitive about it. I want to tell the Senate what Sir Charles Court had to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from producing flick knives or Molotov cocktails, I don't know what these anonymous 'officials' are supposed to mean about being tougher. </PARA>
<PARA>He is referring to the anonymous officials, the senior government source, which we now know to be the pseudonym for the Prime Minister of our country. Sir Charles Court went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Premiers conferences are not a game of bluff poker in which the biggest cheat gets the most money. </PARA>
<PARA>I apologise for using that word, Mr President. I was ruled out of order for using it last night but the Premier of the largest State of Australia has used it in the same context. He is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Premiers conferences are not a game of bluff poker in which the biggest cheat gets the most money. </PARA>
<PARA> They do involve some pretty tough negotiations, but if the Commonwealth is sitting around chortling about stealing even more money from the States than it thought it could get away with we have reached the absolute nadir of Federation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard lots of rhetoric about the Premiers Conference in this place. Whatever one likes to say about it and whatever one's political view, the Premiers Conference is the CHOGM, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, of this little banana republic of Australia. It is a meeting of heads of government and it is a meeting of six significant figures with the heads of the Commonwealth Government. Let us imagine what will happen at the next Premiers Conference-the most important conference in terms of federalism in this country, in terms of what this Government is pleased to call co-operative federalism. It is the most important conference in terms of heads of government in this country. For example, at the next Premiers Conference the Commonwealth Government will say: 'We have got 10 per cent of tax reimbursements for you'. The Premiers will all say: 'But that cannot be true. That is what you told us last time. You told us there was a maximum figure last time. After you told us that it was a maximum figure you went and told selected journalists something quite different, that that was not the maximum figure at all'. What will happen at the next Premiers Conference?</PARA>
<PARA> It goes to the whole question of the credibility of the system of government in our country. It goes to the whole system of whether we can trust the Prime Minister of Australia, whether the Premiers can trust him or whether he is pulling the wool over the eyes of the leaders of the six governments of Australia as he has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the ordinary people of Australia for the last five years. That is the question of government which is involved, and the integrity of the system of government in Australia stands on the answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Premiers any longer trust the Prime Minister? What will happen at the next Premiers Conference? What will be said in answer to the Commonwealth's offer by the Premiers. They will say: 'We cannot trust you'. Even if they say, 'Finally we are prepared to trust you in relation to the answer you have given,' the next question the Premiers of Australia will ask is, 'When we get out of here are you going to go to journalists and tell them that we are a pack of mugs, that we do not know what we are doing and that we are being outsmarted by you, Mr Fraser'. That is the question the Premiers will ask. They will ask: 'Are you going to go to journalists and tell them that on this occasion'?</PARA>
<PARA> When referring to the comments made by Sir Charles Court, Senator Carrick blandly and patronisingly said: 'Sir Charles Court is sensitive about the issue'. By God he is sensitive about the issue and so is every other Premier. Anybody who is concerned about the integrity and the ongoing processes of government in this country ought to be sensitive about it. The only people who are not sensitive about it are those wafflers on the Government side of the chamber who come in here and make bland, waffley statements about important issues confronting this country. They are not sensitive about this issue. Their only sensitivity is keeping on that side of the chamber. They will do anything to justify that position but it is not in the interests of good government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiating position of the Premiers in the future is placed in an extraordinary situation. The negotiating position of future Commonwealth governments, not just this Government, is placed in jeopardy because of the action in leaking a Cabinet decision-the action of the Prime Minister and the action of the Treasurer of our country. That is what in fact happened. What it means is the end of Premiers Conferences in terms of sensible, frank and honest dealings between the parties. To that extent it is an indication of the utterly cynical view of government of the Prime Minister of this country. We have reached a low point in the political history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I do not wish to go into the question of economic management involved. The question of economic management involved is that this Government rides on the seat of its pants. Its attitude is: 'Give or take $70m, we can do this or that'. It takes $70m from the people of this country but it does not give them $70m. It is ludicrous to adopt the position which Senator Carrick has adopted, that this is a respectable attitude for a government to have. Senator Carrick this morning tried to suggest that Treasurer Howard is an honourable boy. He leaked information to selected members of the Press after the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to Senator Chipp. Mr Howard backgrounds, which Senator Carrick explains to us is an art form of sophisticated government. He backgrounded the Commonwealth's position on the Premiers Conference to selected journalists. It was only afterwards, in our view and on a correct statement of the facts, when he got caught, that he started to come clean on the whole issue. It was not, as Senator Carrick said, that he rushed out and said that he had done the wrong thing. He did that later on, only when he got caught. Senator Carrick seems to be trying to make the point that all these activities by the two Ministers were perfectly legitimate in that they were explaining to the Australian people what the Commonwealth's position was at the Premiers Conference. If it was perfectly legitimate for two Ministers-the Treasurer and the Prime Minister-to behave in this way, why did they try to hide what they had done? Why did they try to hide what they did when they got caught? Why did Mr David Barnett, presumably with the authority of the Prime Minister of Australia-our country-stand over journalists of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, telling them: 'That program is not to be run'? Treasurer Howard and the Prime Minister had already made that program. Why did Mr Barnett stand over journalists in the national broadcasting system of our country saying: 'You must not run the interviews which we have given to you. You are no longer allowed to do that.' Did he not say later last night that the careers of two journalists involved would be finished as a result of running interviews which Mr Fraser and Mr Howard had given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

If that is so, why did the Treasurer and the Prime Minister go to extreme lengths to try to hide from the people of Australia and the members of this Parliament what they had done? The answer is that they were caught. That is why they did it. They wanted to stop the truth from getting out. So much for integrity in government under the Fraser Government. Mr Malcolm Fraser is the Prime Minister who sacked Senator Withers with the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had no doubt that our first and foremost responsibility was the maintenance of the high standards of propriety set and maintained by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Withers should get a knighthood tomorrow. Phil Lynch stuck to his position and he got one. Senator Withers should get a knighthood tomorrow for his standards of propriety. His standards of propriety are absolutely impeccable compared with those displayed yesterday by the Prime Minister of Australia. The Prime Minister, when he sacked Senator Withers, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The community rightly demands a high standard from the Ministers of government. </PARA>
<PARA>The high standard that the Prime Minister demands of his Ministers is that they put their heads on the block. The tough Prime Minister of Australia said to Treasurer Howard: 'Excuse me, you take the rap. I am not going to take it'. He has said the same thing to Andrew Peacock on a number of occasions. That is the standard of Ministers which is required by the Prime Minister. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The judgments on Ministers are more exacting and sometimes more harsh than the judgments which might be passed on those outside the sphere of public life. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to Senator Withers he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If these standards were not upheld, the people's confidence in government-a confidence which is fundamental to the Australian democracy-would be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA>No incident in the history of this shoddy Government has so much undermined the system of government in Australia as what happened earlier this week in relation to the Premiers Conference. The Premiers are rightfully enraged. This Parliament is properly concerned about the standards which have been applied. In answer to questions we have heard all this stuff about Cabinet solidarity, Cabinet secrecy and so on. The person euphemistically described as a senior government official is now on record as being a breaker of Cabinet solidarity and a 'backgrounder', to use Senator Carrick's word, of Cabinet decisions. Do the other members of the Cabinet really realise that fact? When are the Ministers in this Government going to face up to the fact that the Cabinet which is said by the Press and others to leak like a sieve has only one hole? We know what that is. It is the senior government official referred to by journalists in all their reports on background information. Another issue is involved. The Prime Minister, amongst others, is often on record as saying that governments should be accountable to the people. This Government is the least accountable to the people of any government in the history of Australia.</PARA>

Everything that has been revealed in the last two days points out that he is right. If Prime Minister Fraser is prepared to background or leak-whatever expression he uses-confidential Cabinet decisions in the way in which he did this week, who is to deny Andrew Peacock the claim that that is what happened in his case? Who is to deny Andrew Peacock the veracity of that claim? We cannot deny it, because the Prime Minister and Treasurer Howard did leak information. Treasurer Howard glibly described the action as an error of judgment, not only on his part but also on the part of the Prime Minister. That is the problem that Senator Teague has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me come to the question of accountability which concerns the honourable senator. I say that the Prime Minister of this country does not make himself accountable because, apart from last night and once last week when he was under considerable pressure and perhaps could not make decisions in the way in which he usually makes them, for five years he has not given a Press conference in which he has made himself available for questioning by journalists. Yesterday, when he did give a Press conference, and journalists asked him questions, he said: 'Oh no, I am not going to answer that. This Press conference was to deal with this question and this question'. He was effectively saying: 'I answer only those questions the details of which I have before I give a Press conference, and I will not talk to you about anything else'. Is that accountability to the public? After all, we talk about the Press as the Fourth Estate, the guardian of civil liberties, the medium whereby information is provided to the Australian public. This Prime Minister is not accountable at all. He prefers the background briefing or the leak to people who, he thinks, might favour him a bit rather than a frank open discussion with the Press. He has never had such a discussion. That is the sort of accountability the Prime Minister deals in. </PARA>
<PARA> Another dreadful thing about the way in which this matter is handled is the manner in which the Prime Minister, having been found out, seeks to blame yet another Minister. Last night we saw Treasurer Howard on television, a pathetic figure, saying: 'Look, it was my fault--</PARA>

When he is pressed a bit, he says: 'Well, look, it is not really that I did it, that it is entirely my fault. But I did it first. The Prime Minister did it second. I am first in sequence in leaking confidential Cabinet information. I am first cab off the rank, so I should take the rap'. But, in the last dying moments of his Press conference, he could not stand it any longer, and he said: 'Perhaps you ought to ask the Prime Minister a few questions about this too'. That was an act of gross disloyalty by Treasurer Howard, If I might say so. He should have taken the rap quietly and gone the way of the 14 other Ministers who have disappeared from the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is another example of the Prime Minister acting without the authority of his Cabinet, acting in a way which is detrimental to the system of Government in this country, acting in a way which betrays the trust in the whole system of government, and acting in a way which, in my view, creates disastrous situations for future Press conferences. It is all done in an atmosphere of no genuine accountability at all. It is all done in an atmosphere, I say to Senator Teague, when we talk about accountability, in which a member of the Prime Minister's staff goes to the national broadcasting service and says: 'Do not run that interview that you have been given'. That is the Prime Minister's view of accountability. That is censorship which is characteristic of the government of Idi Amin and a dozen governments in South America, and, sadly, it is becoming increasingly characteristic of our Government in Australia. That is a tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate arises out of a controversy which surfaced yesterday, a controversy which does not come up as a result of actions by the Opposition, or as a result of actions of the Press. It arises because of the dubious behaviour, the dishonest behaviour, of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, Mr David Barnett, and, I suggest, to that dubious behaviour can be added the behaviour of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) in this place today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night on the adjournment we attempted to start a debate on this matter. We attempted to introduce this matter so that we could get a sensible and proper statement from the Government as to the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for the previous two hours on television and on the media in general in this country. We were told by Senator Carrick that he would make an opportunity for a statement to be made and for a full discussion to take place in the Senate today. 'That could not be fairer', said Senator Carrick. </PARA>
<PARA> He promised us a full discussion. He promised us a ministerial statement. But what have we had in fact? We have had the Leader of the Government in this place, the Prime Minister's representative in this place, making an ad lib statement. There is no written statement. This is the first time that I can remember when a statement of which notice has been given by a Minister has been produced in this manner. We have had a homily on the Government's economic policy and, towards the end of the statement, a little discussion on the fact that flexible negotiations take place at Premiers Conferences and, at the end of it, a little statement saying that the Treasurer, Mr Howard, is an honourable man and that when he was found out he admitted what he had done. We were told that we would have a full discussion on this matter. In fact we have had one Cabinet Minister making a relatively unprepared statement in this place. We are told that two members of the Opposition will be allowed to speak-that is, Senator Button and myself-and then Senator Puplick will be moved in to move the gag and to stop further discussion. That, I suggest, is not full discussion, and the statement is not a reasonable statement in view of what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in this controversy results from the deception of the gentlemen concerned, from the deception of Treasurer Howard, the Prime Minister, and particularly Press Secretary David Barnett. What has happened is that the Parliament and the people of this country have been treated with contempt by all of those people and, as Senator Button has said, this demonstrates a lack of accountability by those gentlemen, by those leading spokesmen of the Cabinet and of the Government of this country, in their handling of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened, I think, should be clearly put on record. As has been admitted by all concerned, including Senator Carrick, the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the Prime Minister himself, gave what are called background briefings, and in those background briefings to selected journalists they spilled the beans and told what the upper level of the parameter was, what the upper limit of payments to the States was which the Cabinet would allow them to negotiate on. They did not tell the Parliament of this country. I am not suggesting that they necessarily should have, but if they told anyone they should have told the parliament of this country. They did not tell the public in a public Press statement. They let this information out in a non-attributable background briefing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers became annoyed. Premier Court called for the resignation of the Treasurer-that is Premier Court who is of the same Party as the Treasurer, and an alleged supporter of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The Press then went to the Treasurer, first of all, and said: 'Tell us about this. Let us know about this briefing. Let us know whether these reports in the paper are true'. The Treasurer did not immediately admit what he had done. He refused to answer questions, and, at his first Press conference, he talked all around the question. The same thing happened at the first Press conference of the Prime Minister. He refused to answer questions, and anyone who saw him on television last night would realise how angry he was that these questions were brought up. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick's suggestion that Treasurer Howard is an honourable man and that, when confronted with the situation, he admitted what he had done, is quite wrong. He did not admit what he had done. He called a Press conference later and admitted what he had done. One can imagine what happened. One can imagine that he went out and contacted the Prime Minister to see what they would do. One can imagine that the conversation between them would be like the conversation which is reported to have occurred between Senator Withers and the Prime Minister just before Senator Withers' demise from the Cabinet in this place. The Prime Minister is alleged to have said to Senator Withers: 'You are in trouble', and Senator Withers replied, 'We are in trouble'. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Prime Minister and the Treasurer got together and sought means to get out of this situation. It was then that the Treasurer had his Press conference and admitted to the Press of this country, and through the Press to the rest of us, that he had leaked this information to the Press at a background briefing. As Senator Button said, if anyone in this Parliament had stood up on Tuesday after the Premiers Conference and asked Senator Carrick or Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who represents the Treasurer, what were the parameters under which the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) negotiated matters at the Premiers Conference he would not have received an answer. We would have been told that that was confidential Cabinet information. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone should get an answer, if anyone should be given that information, certainly it should be the people of this country, through the elected representatives of this country. To sneak into a dark room, as one newspaper put it, and, over a glass of whisky, spill the beans is quite wrong and is contempt of this Parliament. For the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to deny at the first Press conference that this had been done and then, when the pressure was on, to run away and cook up a plan between them and later to admit it is bad enough. But for their representatives to have the gall to come into this place and say that Treasurer Howard is an honourable man and that he admitted that he was wrong as soon as he was detected is even worse. He admitted he was wrong because he had no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, Treasurer Howard gave the information in a background briefing. Secondly, he attempted to deceive the Press when he was asked about it. When pressed further at an interview he admitted to what he had done. Attempts were made-I will come to that in a minute-to have the interview in which he made that admission gagged and stopped from being broadcast over the networks of this country. Yesterday afternoon Prime Minister Fraser refused to answer questions on the subject. He became extremely annoyed that anyone would have the cheek to suggest that he had taken part in leaking this information. Later, when he had to admit that it had happened, he had the gall to try to bluff this way out of the situation by saying that it was part of his belief that there should be freedom of information in this country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Press should be happy with what we have done because we need freedom of information. </PARA>
<PARA>We do need freedom of information but information of this sort should be given publicly and openly, and above all it should be given to this Parliament. But it would not have been given to this Parliament or to anybody in this country if the circumstances which arose out of that background briefing had not arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, probably the most sinister character of all, the Press Secretary of the Prime Minister, David Barnett, M.B.E., arrived on the scene. When David Barnett found out what was going on he-obviously with the approval of the Prime Minister and probably under the instructions of the Prime Minister-stormed around to the Press Gallery of this Parliament and into the Australian Broadcasting Commission office, where he told the head of staff that the interview with Treasurer Howard should not go to air, should not be published and should not be broadcast for the information of the people of this country. He threatened two journalists that their jobs would be on the line if they proceeded with the story in the way they were proceeding. He then tried to pressure other people in the Press Gallery to change their stories and to alter their line. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first time that Mr Barnett has done this. He is notorious for behaving in this way. It is not the first time that he has behaved in a dishonest way. Prime Minister Muldoon of New Zealand has complained on many occasions about the behaviour of that character, particularly at overseas conferences. For example, he described incidents in London, Lusaka and Zambia where Mr Barnett leaked premature or inaccurate information to the Press to promote his Prime Minister against Mr Muldoon and Mrs Thatcher. Mr Muldoon described the anger that he and Mrs Thatcher felt at the behaviour of Mr David Barnett. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Muldoon admitted that he did not think much of the Australian Prime Minister's Press office, that it has a bad habit of trying to big note its Prime Minister by putting down other leaders, that it uses inaccurate information, and that it leaked information to the Press and promoted in the Press violent rows between Mr Muldoon and Mr Fraser. As Mr Muldoon said, this does not help international relations and this does not help to settle international disputes. We have this man, who holds a responsible position, a senior position and a powerful position in this country, behaving like a second class thug, walking around to the Press Gallery and threatening journalists. He has done so not only in this country but also overseas. Last night's episode was disgraceful and no one-I am certain Senator Puplick, who will follow me in this debate-will be able to deny that that happened. I challenge anyone on the Government side and I challenge Mr Barnett to deny that what I have said happened last night. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a sad story of deception by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. We have a sad story of contempt of this Parliament and of the State Premiers by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. We have an example of the lack of accountability by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to this Parliament, which is something we have experienced so often in the past. It is no wonder that there was a controversy and that people on both sides of this Parliament and people who are concerned about democratic government and proper government in this country are concerned. That is why we sought and still seek a full and proper debate on this matter. That is why we sought a proper statement to this Parliament about what happened-not an ad hoc statement about the Government's economic policies, not an ad hoc statement of the kind that we have heard over and over again in this place about the need for restraint and the need for the States to pull their horns in. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, we want to know why the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country are allowed to deceive the Premiers and to treat the economic affairs of this country like a game of poker, as one Premier, Sir Charles Court, described it. Secondly, we want to know why the Government is going on like two-bit poker players, bluffing the Premiers and then, unable to hide its glee, running to the Press and leaking what the Government had done; that is, to quote the words of Premier Court, cheat the Premiers. These Ministers, unable to hide their glee, had to go, as one person put it, and chortle at the Premiers and sneer at the competence and ability of the Premiers to conduct their affairs, and to do so without reporting to this Parliament, without any responsibility to this Parliament and in utter contempt of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick's statement is quite unsatisfactory. We need a proper explanation of what goes on. After such a proper statement, I suggest that we should then question whether the Treasurer is fit to be Treasurer of this country, whether the Prime Minister is fit to be the Prime Minister of this country and whether a person who behaves in the way Mr Barnett behaved on this occasion and on other occasions should have a senior position in which he is responsible to the Prime Minister of this country. We have not had that. Obviously we will not have a satisfactory debate here today. We have registered our concern about and contempt for the manner in which the Government is conducting itself. We will continue to do so. No good can come out of this for the Government or the country. It is a sad day when this Parliament is treated in this manner. I implore the Government to allow a proper debate and to produce a proper statement on this affair in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -After a great deal of sound and fury the mountain opposite has laboured and managed to bring forth in this debate two white mice, neither of whom, of course, is present in the chamber now. (Quorum formed).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I was saying, after all of the exertions, the Opposition mountain, having laboured has brought forward nothing more than two white mice neither of whom is yet present in the chamber despite the ringing of the bells for a quorum. Those two white mice to whom I propose to refer in some detail have attempted to put up a case in this debate which is simply unsustainable. I am happy with the remarks of Senator Button who referred to me as some sort of resident Cicero because on this occasion I am happy to play that role to the petty Cataline that he seems to be determined to play today in concocting this conspiracy of nonsense. The speech that we have heard from Senator Button which was really nothing more than a farrago of irrelevancies, a catalogue of innuendos, assertions and baseless accusations. It was followed by a complaining litany from Senator Grimes who managed to add absolutely nothing to what Senator Button had said and then he complained that he did not have enough time in the debate for a proper discussion to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that four issues arise specifically from what has been said in the Senate and what has been said in the general debate over this issue. I believe they are: Exactly what are the facts and the relevance of the issue, and the public disclosure of the Commonwealth position. Secondly, what, if anything, is to be concluded about the public announcement of what the Commonwealth's negotiating position was after the conclusion of the Premiers Conference? Thirdly, is there any validity in the accusations that the Premiers were somehow shortchanged or indeed duped or deceived? Finally, was the statement issued by the Treasurer by way of the background briefing, although in his view with hindsight an error of judgment, in any way improper?</PARA>
<PARA> The first of those issues relates to the facts. Quite clearly, as Senator Carrick has said and as has been indicated in the other place, prior to the Premiers Conference the Cabinet took a series of decisions about the parameters of the financial offer that the Government was prepared to make to the States and imposed some sort of upper limit, apparently a level of about 10 per cent, plus the additional funding needed for absorption purposes. Like all negotiations, that was the extreme position and clearly the Commonwealth was going to put to the Prermies a going-in offer substantially below the level which it had set as a maximum. We know that the initial offer to the Premiers was about 8 per cent plus the absorption grant money. By a process of negotiation this was eventually raised to 9 per cent plus the absorption money. Criticisms were made after the conclusion of the Conference. They were made in the Press. They were made on a number of occasions. That criticism was that the Commonwealth was somehow not fair dinkum about the whole attitide of reduction of government expenditure, that the Commonwealth had been overly generous with the States and that it was not attempting to apply to the States in respect of the works and the functions that the States were to take up, the same sort of rigorous scrutiny that the Commonwealth had applied to its own requirements and future programs. Indeed, the Treasurer, Mr Howard, at his Press conference alluded to this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I explained to you--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in response to a question-</PARA>
<PARA> That the purpose of doing it was in the context that I thought there were suggestions that the Commonwealth had perhaps not lived up to its rhetoric of earlier times of the previous week, but in the context of those suggestions this type of comment-this type of backgrounding-was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was setting down quite clearly that the Commonwealth had sought to bring to the Premiers Conference and to the grants made to the Premiers a degree of scrutiny and a degree of financial rigour along the lines that it had already adopted for its own purposes over the last couple of months and which had been most recently announced in the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The background briefing was therefore to provide the facts and to indicate that the Commonwealth in fact had not been bullied into a position, coerced into a position or slipped into a position which was beyond a reasonable statement of its own financial limitations and its own financial policies and to indicate that the Treasurer in fact had given this information in response to questions that were asked of him and, in a way, that was appropriate to the questions that were asked of him. It is certainly true that some of the State Premiers in their initial responses-Sir Charles Court in particular-have taken objection to what they have seen portrayed in the Press as an attempt to indicate that they, as a group of hardened, political professionals, were somehow unable to cope with the Machiavellian designs of the Federal Treasurer and the Prime Minister in coming to grips with Commonwealth-State financial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question I posed was: What flows from the decision? What does the fact that the background briefing was given actually mean in terms of the real impact on either Government policy or on the way in which government is conducted in Australia? I suggest absolutely nothing can be drawn as a direct inference from the way in which this matter was handled. Absolutely nothing can be drawn along the lines that Senator Button and Senator Grimes sought to do. It certainly was not intended by any of the persons involved as some sort of insult to the Premiers. It certainly was not intended as some sort of 'laughing up their sleeves' at the naivety of the Premiers or crowing over the alleged ability of the Commonwealth to put one over the Premiers. I do not think anybody could seriously entertain that that was in the mind of the Federal Treasurer or the Prime Minister who after all have to deal with the State governments and the State Premiers on an ongoing basis, year by year. It certainly is not possible to draw any inferences from the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer along the lines that Senator Button did in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I raised was the question of whether the Premiers had somehow been short-changed, whether the Premiers had somehow been done out of money which was rightfully and properly theirs. The answer to that is: Far from it. The treatment which the States have received from the Commonwealth Government in the last five or six years has been the most generous treatment that they have ever received. Many people on this side of the Parliament believe that from time to time the treatment has been overly generous. While the Commonwealth has been making the necessary adjustments and taking the necessary steps to restrain its own expenditure, to restrain the growth in the number of its own public servants and the extent to which it is required to raise taxes and charges from the Australian community at large, the States have not shouldered their fair degree of the national economic burden and have not sought to undertake the same sorts of rigours in their own expenditure and their own behaviour that the Commonwealth has made a feature of its expenditure and behaviour in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that, the States have still been treated extremely generously. In recent years they have been receiving in the vicinity of a 40 per cent return of personal income tax taken in Australia. The figure in the next couple of years will be 38 point something per cent of the total personal tax take. A new formula is to be entered into in which the States will have access not only to personal income tax but also to the whole tax revenue pool of the Commonwealth. Their own instrumentalities, their own local governments, which are creations of State governments and are not the direct responsibility of the Federal Government, have been provided with a source of income. They have been provided with a figure which has grown steadily from 1 1/4 per cent to 2 per cent of personal tax takes. That is not only a direct subvention to local government but also a considerable easing of the burden that the States would otherwise have to shoulder for the financing of their own creations. </PARA>
<PARA> To that extent, the argument cannot be put forward that somehow the States have been short-changed; that somehow they should have got $70m more. They cannot argue that they were entitled to that amount when in fact what they were entitled to was to come to a Premiers conference in Canberra and to negotiate with the Commonwealth Government over a figure which ended up being accepted by both sides and which clearly, as has been indicated, was amended in the course of the discussions to increase the actual amount of revenue that the States were to get. The increase was above what the Commonwealth went in with as a negotiating position but, by the way in which the conference eventually came to a final decision, was below the upper limit which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister had been charged by the Cabinet simply not to exceed. They had not been charged by the Cabinet to ensure that the States got that particular amount of money. They had been charged by the Cabinet to ensure that that was the upper limit beyond which no offer could be made. It is part of the normal negotiating process, whether it be between individuals, companies or States, for any party to go in with an opening offer and to know itself its absolute limit, its absolute maximum offer, and to try to find some figure which falls within those two parameters as the eventual figure on which things will be settled. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the speech made by Senator Button. I want to indicate a number of instances in which Senator Button was either critical of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer or tried to put forward arguments which he believes somehow reflect on the way in which this matter was handled. The first totally irrelevant type of argument that he put forward was that if this sort of leak had been made by a senior public servant in discussing wage negotiations that senior public servant would automatically have been fired. The answer to that is: Yes, indeed, that senior public servant should automatically have been fired. The problem is that Senator Button clearly does not distinguish or does not seek to distinguish between the position of a person who is a public servant and the position of a person who is a member of the Cabinet or, indeed, who is Prime Minister and therefore whose entitlement to make public Cabinet decisions is not a matter of dispute whereas the position of a public servant making public the decisions of Cabinet is of an entirely different quality and character. 'We are entitled', said Senator Button, 'to get the facts'. Because the facts are put on the record by the Treasurer in this regard the Opposition considers that that is somehow suddenly a source of criticism. In other words, quite clearly, members of the Opposition want it both ways: They want the facts but they do not want the Treasurer to give out the facts. Senator Button cannot put both of those arguments at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA> During the whole course of Senator Button's speech he sought deliberately to avoid-he said that he was deliberately avoiding it-any discussion about what exactly it was that the Premiers and the Commonwealth were negotiating about, what exactly the underlying economic policies were that had brought about a situation in which the Commonwealth clearly was going to insist that there be reductions in expenditure and in which the Commonwealth clearly was not going to be in a position of offering straight out, or automatically, a maximum figure for the States so that they would be able to continue on their merry way without any thought of restraint or responsibility in their own financial administrations. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button, in response to Senator Teague, made some comments about accountability. This Government, he said, was not an accountable government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The acid test of accountability, Senator McLaren, is accountability to the Australian electorate. This Government has submitted itself three times to that acid test. On three straight occasions the accountability of this Government to the Australian people has been tested and on each of those three occasions the Australian public has responded by returning this Government with record majorities. Yet this is supposed to be a government which is not accountable. Clearly, it is accountable and has been at every one of the last three elections. It is accountable and it makes itself accountable in this Parliament where it is tested and continues to come through all of the tests which are put against it by the Opposition. It has come through in this place and in the other place without a mark being left on it by the feeble attempts of the Opposition to make some capital out of passing events which it seeks to blow up into matters of monumental importance. As I said, Senator Grimes who followed for the Opposition in the debate complained that there was not enough time for the debate and then in the time that he took proceeded to add absolutely nothing to what his Senate leader had already said; he indicated quite clearly just how seriously the Labor Party wanted to take this debate. It was simply making a point again and again in the hope that it would be like something in Alice in Wonderland: If something is said often enough somebody will be foolish enough to believe that it is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth point that I indicated was clearly central to what has been put before this chamber is the question of whether a briefing, a set of statements or information given by senior Ministers to people on the details of a Commonwealth position were in some sense of the term improper. It is quite clear, I think, from the statements that have been made that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer clearly had the authority of the Cabinet to release details of Cabinet decisions which had been taken and which related to their areas of responsibility. The Prime Minister, in his own Press conference, said at one stage:</PARA>
<PARA> We did not go beyond real terms, and in this world in which freedom of information is so important, why should the Press or anyone worry about the fact that the Treasurer, in consultation with myself-and I last night, made it plain that we had been given that kind of authority,--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the authority of the Cabinet to make known Cabinet decisions-</PARA>
<PARA>that we should not go beyond real terms, and the final position was somewhat less than that, but the decision made it plain that the final judgment was to be made on the day. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, Mr Howard, in his statement from which I have already quoted, indicates quite clearly what the background to it was. Indeed, in an earlier statement that he put out on the matter, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA> As to the allegation of breaching confidentiality the Prime Minister has taken the line that he and I plainly have authority to discuss a Cabinet Decision in an area of our own responsibility and this quite plainly was such an area. </PARA>
<PARA>The nonsense proposition, if this quoted statement is denied, is that somehow Cabinet decisions are not for public release. In other words, the Cabinet will make decision and in no circumstances and through the mouth of no Minister will anybody in the public arena be told what those Cabinet decisions are. Presumably, Cabinet will make decisions, will pass them on to some public servant or to somebody for administration, but that in no circumstances and at no time should the public be told what those Cabinet decisions are. Clearly, unless Cabinet decides that for certain reasons of security or, for instance, because the premature disclosure of a particular Cabinet position would be disadvantageous to the nation, to the national economy, to the national interest or to the national defence, that Cabinet decision is not released at that time but the decision is made public at an appropriate time. Obviously, any other Cabinet decision is going to be released at some point, presumably by the appropriate Minister. In terms of Commonwealth-State relations in the Premiers Conference, clearly the responsible Ministers are the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They had the responsibility and the authority to make clear those decisions and those determinations which they thought appropriate to make clear to the Parliament, to the Press, to the Premiers or to anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> Was the particular decision improper in that it benefited somebody at the expense of somebody else, was it improper in that it breached vital national interests, was it improper in that it implied some breach of Cabinet solidarity or of collective responsibility of the Cabinet? Clearly, the answer to all those questions is no. It was an exposure, in terms of public policy, of a Cabinet decision which was made in the public interest. Since Cabinet is supposed to and does under this Government operate to make decisions in the public interest, it is not surprising that from time to time the public is told what the bases of those Cabinet decisions are. Clearly, the Prime Minister specifically has addressed his mind to this matter and has said something about it in his Press conference. I propose to repeat those words. When challenged on the basis that perhaps this was a breach of Cabinet confidentiality, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . what you are aiming at is a total absurdity. Because, if the Cabinet makes a decision, which is relevant to the Treasurer's authority and to my authority in relation to a Premiers' Conference, obviously either of us or both of us are entitled to make that decision public, and to suggest that we are not entitled to make a Cabinet decision public and to suggest that the Treasurer is not entitled to make a Cabinet decision public, which is within his area of responsibility is total absurdity--</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a question of leaking any information to the Press. It is a question of a Cabinet decision having been taken, and of a Cabinet decision having been made public, and there is nothing wrong with a Cabinet decision being made public. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite clearly a statement of the facts as they pertain in this case. We come to the question of the extent to which in a debate about the way in which Cabinet government is conducted in Australia, the Australian Labor Party is in any position to make a comment about the effective conduct of Cabinet in Australia. During the course of the debate some time ago on a ministerial resignation down the other end, the Minister for Defence was on his feet. His words were salutary in respect of the way in which proper Cabinet government is conducted. The Minister for Defence, referring to previous Cabinet practices under Labor, said:</PARA>
<PARA> How many honourable members who sit opposite today and who have served in the two governments led by Mr Whitlam would be prepared to give to this House the instances of when they were defeated in the Cabinet and, either on their own account or through the assistance of some other colleague, took the issue into the Caucus. I notice that the honourable member for Capricornia--</PARA>
<PARA>that is Dr Everingham-</PARA>
<PARA>is standing up. There it is! There is the very perversion of the principle that I propose to enunciate. Without shame and without inhibition, constantly and coarsely, the Australian Labor Party has put political principle and regarded it as a mere coquetry of political prostitution. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the attitude which the Australian Labor Party takes towards the operation of Cabinet government in Australia. We know full well the numerous and documented instances-whether it was Thursday, 13 September 1973 when Minister Bryant had to take into Caucus a special resolution to try to overturn Cabinet policy on interest rates on housing loans, or whether it was 20 May 1975 when poor old Moss Cass, in one of those momumental fights with Rex Connor, was stood on his ear by the Prime Minister who described him as inefficient and hopeless as a Minister and had to take the Fraser Island decision for the rape of Fraser Island back into the Caucus where he was eventually rolled by 42 votes to 41 votes. We know the way in which Ministers in the Labor Government used to lock themselves in their offices like naughty little boys who were caught smoking in the toilets and who refused to be ejected from their offices because they were about to be sacked. We know the way in which the sorry sagas of Cairns, Connors, Cass, Khemlani and Crean were paraded through the Parliament as an example of what the Opposition believes is the style of Cabinet government appropriate in Australia today. We know the extent to which the Australian Labor Party in this debate has revealed its paucity as an Opposition. </PARA>

I am sure Senator McLaren would be delighted to know that I was elected to this place by a majority of Labor Party members voting in the Parliament of New South Wales on a nomination proposed by the Premier of New South Wales and seconded by the leader of the Labor Party in the Upper House in New South Wales. Mr Deputy President, as I was saying, this debate has revealed the paucity of the Labor Party as an Opposition and, indeed, as an alternative government. Lacking constructive policies or issues of significance and unwilling to have its shortcomings and its failures exposed, day by day in this Parliament, members of the Australian Labor Party come here like paupers rummaging through the rubbish bins for the odd scrap and the hope of finding the odd piece of sustenance. There is absolutely no way in which Senator Walsh, the poor man's Goebbels from Western Australia, or anybody else is able to disguise that fact. It will not work. The personal attacks of the Labor Party on the Prime Minister and on other individual Ministers did not work as their primary tactic in the last federal election. They will not work in other circumstances. Indeed, they will not work at the next election. I therefore move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent debate on the Minister's statement and on the issues raised thereby being resumed forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>I do so because it is evident from the debate that has taken place so far that this whole extraordinary saga of sin, confession, repentence and feeble self-justification shows that this is a government which is unfit to govern and, moreover, one which is in imminent danger of collapse. For that reason it is a matter of urgent necessity, under the Standing Orders, that a whole series of matters raised by the statement of the Leader of the Government (Senator Carrick) this morning, and by the events of the last few days, be the continued subject of debate, exchange and answer in this House.

Senator Evans is quite persuaded in his convictions, as he understands are the officers of the Senate, that the matter in respect of which he is seeking that the debate proceed is a different matter from that which the Senate has just resolved. I put it to you, Mr President, that I am not seeking the immediate resumption of debate on the motion: 'That the Senate take note of the Minister's statement'. That has been the subject of a resolution. I am simply putting a different proposition: That debate be resumed on the question of the issues raised by the Minister's statement, which is technically and substantively a different question.

I simply put it to you, Mr President, that a number of questions which have been raised by recent events need answering. It has been suggested that in the last few days this Government has done a number of wrong things. It has been suggested that it was wrong of the Government to deceive the Premiers in the first place as to the extent of the Commonwealth's financial capacity. That question needs to be resolved, as a matter of urgent necessity, by the Senate. It has been suggested that it is wrong for the Commonwealth, having deceived the Premiers in this way, to crow about it; that that is a classic demonstration of political immaturity. It has been suggested further--</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not now speaking to any of the substantive issues. I will deal with those with loving care, attention and detail if we get to the stage of substantive debate in a few minutes time. I am simply offering a shopping list of issues which remain unresolved and must be addressed by the Senate if we are sensibly to tackle the problems of the nation, which have been added to so spectacularly by the events of the last few days.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I am not claiming that the third issue is that it is wrong for the Government to appear to have intimidated and to have covered up its original denial. I am simply saying that one of the issues which this Parliament needs to be satisfied about concerns the facts about, the circumstances surrounding and the justification for that alleged intimidation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The remaining issue which it is very obvious this Parliament needs to tackle and to debate is the suggestion that it has been wrong to treat the conventional notion of Cabinet confidentiality as the kind of plaything and vehicle for self-aggrandisement for the Prime Minister which seems to have been the case, it has been argued, in this instance. In particular we need to debate the suggestion that it has been a sickening exercise in cant and hypocrisy for the Government to invoke the principles of freedom of information in justification for what it has been doing. Those are the sorts of things which need, as a matter of urgent necessity, to be further debated, as do a number of other claims that are being made around this Parliament and around this nation today in the light of recent events. It is being claimed that this Government engages in confident thuggery when it is on top but, by contrast, is engaged in no more than cowardly dissimulation whenever its deceits are revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is being suggested equally that this is a government of opportunism for which no principle is too sacred for it to stand on its head if the political advantage of the moment seems to justify it. It is being suggested all around this nation, and it needs to be further debated in this Parliament, that this is a government of hypocrisy from which no single statement can be accepted at face value any more by anyone. That has been learnt by the Parliament. Equally it appears, and it has been claimed, that the Premiers can no longer take at face value the assertions of this Government. It is being suggested around this Parliament and around this nation-and it needs answering-that this is a government of incompetence which not only is manifestly incapable of administering policy and programs but also is so incompetent that it treats everyone else collectively as being as big a mug as it is in terms of the strategy that engages it. It is being suggested-this is another and the last of the particular matters I wish to refer to-that this is a government of self-immolation bent on a path of self-destruction, the key Ministers in which are unable to maintain even the pretence or appearance of a facade of unity. Those are matters which the ministerial statement has raised for the attention of the Parliament. Those are matters which this Parliament must deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> The final reason I suggest that there is a pressing necessity for this Parliament to debate further the ministerial statement is that later in the program today we are scheduled to have a resumption of the freedom of information debate. At the moment the Parliament is being left in a state of total confusion as to exactly what the Government's position is on freedom of information as a result of these developments. The question that needs to be understood and resolved before we can proceed with that freedom of information debate is whether this Government is simply being dissimulating in its commitment to freedom of information. There is a question of whether it has been engaged in sickening cant and hypocrisy, as I said, in relying on and invoking freedom of information principles in support of its stand on the leaking of the Premiers Conference negotiation parameters. Alternatively, there is the possibility that there has been a change of heart on the part of this Government and that there is a wholly new conviction and commitment to freedom of information principles involved in what the Prime Minister, Treasurer Howard and Senator Carrick were saying today. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that there has been some kind of Paul-like conversion on the road to some Damascus as far as freedom of information is concerned. If that is true, if the Government has changed its position on freedom of information, it will change the whole context of the debate which is scheduled to take place later today. If the Government has changed its position on freedom of information in the way which appears from the course of action that has been taken and the justification for that action, we do not want to waste time stumbling around the foothills of that problem when it comes to the debate later this afternoon. There are mountains there to be climbed. It is clear that the whole course of resistance to amendments to that Bill which the Government has proposed has now been completely changed, if that is indeed the proper interpretation of what has taken place. Clearly that dilemma as to whether there has been a change of heart in the Government's attitude is another matter that needs to be resolved in the context of further debate of this ministerial statement. For all those reasons, I suggest it is clear that there are many matters remaining for the Government to answer. Many charges remain totally unanswered by anything that Senator Puplick or any other spokesman for the Government has said. For those reasons, the debate ought to be resumed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, for two reasons. I shall stick to why we should suspend Standing Orders and will not engage in a repetition of the debate we had earlier today. The first reason is that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) should be permitted to honour the promise he made last evening that there would be a ministerial statement and a full discussion. That has not been carried out. Therefore, the Government has no alternative but to support its leader so that he may be given the opportunity to honour the undertaking he gave to the Senate last night that there would be a full discussion here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other reason concerns the severity of the Matter. Having received from South Australia both telegrams and today's issue of the Adelaide Advertiser, I can see the deplorable situation that that State is in as a result of the allocation of money at the Premiers Conference. One notable thing is that Mr Tonkin, who has been one of the greatest supporters of the Fraser Government--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He backed his policies to the hilt. Mr Tonkin has restricted the Public Service in South Australia in line with the propaganda of the Federal Government and has imposed greater sacrifices on the South Australian community than possibly any other State government in Australia, but today is very critical of the treatment that has been dealt out to him. In the stop press of the Advertiser he is reported as saying that he has lost complete confidence in future negotiations with what is termed responsible government.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;David Tonkin, the Premier of South Australia. When he told South Australians that there would be a further cut in public works in South Australia he told them, amongst other things, that capital works concerning kindergartens and hospitals would be cut back. We find today that legal aid services are to be withdrawn from prison officers in South Australia who are facing a crisis as the result of the appointment of a royal commission in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When serious allegations were made against prison officers in South Australia, the Premier appointed a judge from Western Australia as a royal commissioner to consider allegations as to the conduct of prisons in South Australia. One after another prisoners have made serious allegations against prison officers. Some of those allegations could have been proved untruthful in cross-examination by counsel representing the prison officers. In future those common workmen who today operate in the prisons are to be left without any legal representation, the victims of whatever lies and perfidy may be directed against them by prisoners in those institutions. There is now counsel to represent a responsible body of South Australian prison officers who are faced with those allegations. The injustice that could happen cannot be permitted to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Judging by the statements that have been made, we believe that there has been a robbery of some $70m. Surely we should sort out this matter and have a full discussion. In view of Mr Tonkin's remarks on his lack of confidence in negotiations between responsible governments, surely we must restore this Government's recognition as a responsible organisation for the purpose of seeing that at least South Australian Premiers can have an idea of fair play and decency in this matter. There is a lot I want to say-I believe I was on the speaker's list before it was terminated-on the negotiations. I shall seek that opportunity and ask for decency on the part of the Government to honour its undertaking of last night and to give us the opportunity for further debate on this matter.</PARA>

The mover of this proposal suggested that we should continue the debate so that the matter can be resolved. The only way a matter can be resolved is by resolution and no resolution has been put forward by the Opposition in this place. All the Opposition is doing at present is thrashing out hot air. I shall not, and, in fact, I am not able under Standing Orders, to canvass the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which, of course, must be described as odd, to say the least.

Senator Walsh knows, and other people know, what he has to do in respect of that matter to allow his situation to be clarified. I believe that the proposition that has been put forward should not be supported because the Government, with the assent of the Opposition, has agreed to delay and defer General Business tonight. I had a very important matter to discuss in General Business tonight. The Whip has consulted me about that matter. I have finally agreed with the Whip to vote for General Business being deferred tonight. I believe that if the Senate wishes to continue to debate the substantive matters that are on the Notice Paper, including the Freedom of Information Bill, it ought to proceed and reject this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes this motion, as it always opposes such motions. We will not necessarily divide because of the obvious situation in this place. The Government has to abandon General Business tonight because it is incapable of bringing legislation into this place and handling it in a sensible manner. Senator Harradine is correct in his objections to the removal of General Business from today's program, because there are important matters to be debated. In the last two days we have spent almost five hours debating a relatively minor amendment to health legislation. We spent this amount of time because on the first night on which we debated the Bill the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) was unable to resolve a problem. We had to delay the debate until the next day to overcome a relatively minor difficulty with the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the whole of this session we have gone for days in this place without adequate debate of important legislation. Such legislation as the Freedom of Information Bill and the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill have been delayed, the latter for almost 12 months. It is absolutely unnecessary either to abandon General Business or to extend the sittings, as has been telegraphed to us will happen at the end of this session. We protest again at this invasion of the right of private senators to have important matters debated. I record my protest as I have done on every occasion when such a motion has been proposed in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I record my opposition to the motion moved by Senator Messner who is the Minister in charge of the chamber. Once again, we will lose the opportunity to deal with General Business because Government Business will take precedence. As my colleague and deputy leader, Senator Grimes, has pointed out, the Government is in complete disarray. Yesterday when the proceedings were being broadcast we witnessed a complete vacuum for at least five minutes because the Government could not get its act together. If my colleague had not called a quorum to get it off the hook it would have been in worse trouble. Now we find ourselves in this position. The Government cannot run the affairs of state, it cannot run this place, and now we are to lose the time for General Business tonight in favour of Government Business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I record my protest in regard to this matter. I am somewhat in sympathy with the remarks expressed by Senator Harradine. Obviously, the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill, the Freedom of Information Bill and the Excise Tariff Amemdment Bill are of more importance to the Government than the Order of the day which relates to the International Year of Disabled persons. That is given second consideration by the Government. I think our concern about the attitude the Government is taking should be noted in this, the International Year of Disabled Persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one point that I make frequently and which I want to make again today. There are so few opportunities for back benchers to ventilate their concerns in this place. Back benchers are as important a part of government as Ministers. Whilst Ministers, under the Standing Orders, have every right and preference to bring forward business, back benchers rarely get the opportunity to do so. After a desperate fight we gained the opportunity for at least one period of General Business during parliamentary sittings. On Thursday nights matters of importance to back benchers are brought up for discussion and a government reaction can be obtained. Some of those matters raised do bring a result. But once again, that right is to be taken away from us. The rights of back benchers no longer exists under this Government. It keeps encroaching upon the right of back benchers to have matters of General Business discussed in this chamber. </PARA>

When the Government Whip asked Senator Mason and me how we felt about dispensing with the General Business debate tonight, reluctantly we said that we would agree, notwithstanding the fact that we would be the greatest sufferers because of this action. Of the first eight items on the Notice Paper, Senator Mason and I would have enjoyed speaking on at least four of them. They are listed with us. The reason we reluctantly agreed to allow Government Business to take precedence of General Business is that allegedly there is so much very important legislation to come through this chamber before the Senate rises. For weeks now we have been dithering about with the Freedom of Information Bill. I made a judgment that it is more important to the Government to get the Freedom of Information Bill through this place than private senators' rights which, as Senator Cavanagh quite properly says, are also important. If we do not follow this course near the end of session the Government, with its weight of numbers, will force this legislation through and we will get a hotch potch on important legislation such as the Freedom of Information legislation. I understand that there are something like 40 Bills of some importance to be passed before the Parliament rises at the end of this session. Already it is mooted that the Senate will have to sit at least two more weeks. I will just name a few of the proposed changes to legislation. It is proposed to change legislation relating to the Medibank, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Freedom of Information, Taxation, and the two-airlines agreement. There are just five Bills which I would have thought would take us two days each to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McClelland for his interjection. I acknowledge it so that it can be included in Hansard as a contribution to what I am saying. I do say this to the Government, with as much good will as I can muster: Yesterday, as Senator Grimes said, it took the Government something like five or six hours extra to get a relatively simple amendment through this chamber because there were enough senators, not only on this side of the chamber, but also on the Government side, who felt fairly strongly about a Bill the ramifications of which were to be thrust on 14 million Australians. There are those types of honourable senators here. There are honourable senators on this side and on the other side who are not just party hacks. There are honourable senators on the other side who are not just ciphers and rubber stamps for the wishes of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or the Cabinet. There are some who will stand up and be counted on issues and I warn the Government that if the disorganised way in which it has tried to run this place during this session continues, it will not get legislation of the kind I have mentioned passed before the Senate rises. The Government will then run the risk of introducing that legislation in the Budget session when no longer will it be able to command the numbers, even if all Government senators acquiesce and again became rubber stamps.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to place on record my objection to the loss of General Business so early in the session. I believe that the program is such that the Senate will be sitting into June. There are several weeks of sitting remaining. Yet today we are having General Business taken away from us. Back benchers in this place consider General Business on Thursday night to be important to them. Much of the debates in the rest of the week is taken up by the front bench on both sides of the House. I voice strong objection to the sudden taking away of General Business night from back benchers. There was no indication early in the week that this would happen but now we face this proposition. The Australian Democrats will suffer considerably because of this proposition. It has been indicated that they will not force the vote to a division, but I suggest to the Australian Democrats that they ought not give up the right to General Business so easily in the future. I think that the Government will play them against the Opposition in the future. It will come to them and suggest that they give up the time for General Business because there is an agreement with the Opposition. Then the Government will go to the Opposition and say the same thing. I suggest that our right to General Business is too valuable to be played with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Overall the function of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill 1981 is to set up a new structure for industrial research and development incentive schemes. Its effectiveness will depend on the level of funding which the Commonwealth Government gives to industrial research and development. My remarks will be brief. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of the motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Expresses its concern at-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the low level of Government investment in research and development compared to other technologically advanced nations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the failure of the Government to encourage significant private sector investment in research and development;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the low level of Australian innovation as measured by the number of patients taken out each year by Australian individuals and companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the failure of the Government to stimulate Australian innovation in electronics, biotechnology and other high technology industries, and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Australia's disadvantageous position in relation to technology transfer;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Condemns the Government for losing national control over significant industries based on high levels of research and development, including motor manufacturing, electronics, the computer industry and petrochemicals; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Rejects those parts of the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions (the 'Lynch Committee') which eliminate or downgrade Commonwealth instrumentalities concerned with the collection, dissemination and application of information about high technology in industry, thereby reducing Australia's fight back capacity in high technology areas'. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are saying in this amendment to the second reading is something that has been said by members of this Parliament of all political persuasions in some of those esoteric debates that we have about policy in relation to science and technology and which mean nothing in terms of government action. We say that Australia's performance in relation to research and technology is a poor one. Because of the structure of the Australian economy, if the industries about which we are concerned are to be developed, in the latter years of this century, much will depend on the attention to which this Parliament, the Government and industry gives to questions of technological innovation, research and development. That is the essence of what is being said. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that the Bill sets up a structure for industrial research and development incentives. Its effectiveness depends on adequate Commonwealth funding. I am not making a partisan criticism when I say that the level of Commonwealth funding is inadequate. Yesterday, in another speech, I referred to an answer given in 1976 by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when the Department of Productivity was set up. An important point in the answer given by the Prime Minister in 1976 was that questions of technological innovation, technological transfer, research and development are issues which affect the long term future of this country. As I said yesterday the wicked thing about the deliberations of the razor gang is that they are not concerned with the long term future of this country. They are concerned with immediate perceptions about political advantage and ideology. They are not concerned with long term questions. The same general comment can be made in the context of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows funding of research associations formed by firms in an industry to get together to form an association for research on industry problems. That is a good thing. This was advocated by the Birch Independent Inquiry into the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. We regard it as a good thing and are glad that the Government has acceded to that recommendation of the Birch Committee. We commend the Government for that action. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to what the Government has done in the area of science and technology, quite apart from the cuts which were announced at the end of last week. Of the 18 bodies which were abolished by the so called razor gang, 11 belonged to the Department of Science and Technology. I am not saying that all of these bodies were necessary or that it is necessary to retain all of those 11 bodies. They included important areas of industrial and technological research and development such as the Information Technology Council, the Advisory Committee on International Scientific and Technological Activities and the Australian Inventions Advisory Committee. The Department of Foreign Affairs will no longer have a science adviser who may get information from abroad which is to our national advantage. I do not know-probably no members of Parliament including the razor gang know-how those bodies worked and how effective they were. But that is not the point. The important point is that, if these functions of Government are abandoned, inevitably Government will become less well informed and less efficient. That is something which again relates to time scales in politics. The long term problems of this country will not be addressed. Instead short term political gains will be, as usual, the priority of the Fraser Government. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Funding has risen from $14m in 1977-78 to $54m in 1980-81-nearly a four-fold rise within three years, despite the need for continuing expenditure restraints. </PARA>
<PARA>That is said in the context of the second reading speech on this Bill but one should look at it in conjunction with the report of the so called razor gang which announced cuts. This shows the level of co-ordination in this Government. We have a second reading speech of this kind which boasts about fund increases, at the same time that committee of Ministers-not the gang of four, but the razor gang-introduces cuts across the board in the science and technology portfolio. In the second reading speech the Attorney-General, in justification for increased funding in this area, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for government assistance rests on the proposition that there are disparities between the private and national returns from research and development expenditure. The market does not provide enough incentives for firms to undertake research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say that the market in Australia is a bit soft on these issues. The Attorney-General went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The result is a national under-investment in industrial research and development and a tendency for firms to concentrate on relatively short-term industrial research and development. The fundamental purpose of the program is to correct this market failure. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition applauds what the Attorney-General said in that respect. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government has decided that, in future, an industrial research and development project will be supported only where it involves a substantial degree of risk or where a firm is unable to gain enough of the profits generated by the industrial research and development to justify the project. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting statement. So much for the cliched ideology of the private sector taking up the slack. The private sector will not take up the slack in industrial research and development unless the everlasting arm of the Commonwealth Government is there to support it. That is an important point to recognise in relation to this statement. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> To compensate for inflation as well as to strengthen the incentive to firms to undertake the industrial research and development, the Government proposes to increase ceilings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General indicated the proposed increased ceilings in grants which are to be made available. What happened to all that economic rationalism in the Attorney-General's speech when the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee made its report? The report not only cuts back areas of science and technology research but also cut back Commonwealth funding for defence science, research and development. As I have said, Australia has a poor record in research and development. This reflects a lack of commitment from government. There is a very high degree of overseas ownership of the high technological industries we do have. The research and development is done overseas. The product of that research and development becomes the property of those foreign companies. This is true of the motor car industry, and the mining industry. It is true of a low and now shrinking educational base in Australia. The Australian motor car industry and the Australian mining industry import technology. A number of tables are available indicating the shrinking educational base in Australia compared with the position of other countries which are relevant in relation to research. By Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development standards we have a low educational base in the 15 to 19-year-old group. For example, educational base in Australia for that age group is below that of Greece and Ireland, not countries with which we always want to be compared. There is a correlation between a high educational standard at the secondary and post-secondary levels and a healthy economy. There is a correlation between those educational standards and a high standard of living and economic growth. Australia is well down that list. The Australian Labor Party is the party in this country that has by far the greatest commitment to raising educational standards across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other points made in the foreshadowed amendment is the position in relation to patents. I have here a table setting out the number of patents granted each year in Australia since 1969. The table was provided in response to a question on notice. It is a clear record of the success of previous governments compared with the present one in harnessing the indigenous ingenuity of this country. It is a clear record of the present Government's failure. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table which was provided in response to a question on notice. I will have to provide the Senate with the exact date of the question. The table sets out for the calendar years from 1969 to 1979 the total number of patents granted in Australia and the proportion of those patents granted to overseas patentees. The number of patents granted to overseas patentees has increased significantly in proportion to the total number of patents granted in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from what I have said by way of making general points which are always important in a discussion of science and technology, I would like to make one or two other points. One is that the Bill will allow for grants for computer softwear. That is very commendable but we should be sure that the grants are made only to help to establish a genuine Australian softwear industry. The definition of 'softwear' in the legislation is, in our view, far from satisfactory and I believe that point was made in the House of Representatives on a number of occasions. It is our very great regret that, because of ideological factors which have possessed bodies such as the so-called razor gang, decisions about important matters relating to science and technology are no longer being made with a view to the long term future of this country. They are being made in a short-sighted way and they are being made in a way which reflects, as I have said on previous occasions, concern not about the future of Australia and its industrial base but about the forthcoming election and things of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this Bill because it is certainly a move in the right direction. I could be critical and say that the Bill does not go far enough in that direction. I may comment on that later. The implications of technological change for Australia are immense. We have to encourage Australian industry to be innovative and to take new initiatives in this important area of industrial research and development. I notice that the Bill provides for another five-year program for industrial research and development incentives. I also note that one or two expert committees are mentioned in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a little disappointed to note that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment was not given some sort of honourable mention in the speech. Honourable senators will recall that in June 1979 the Committee, of which I am Chairman, presented a report to the Senate. I regret very much that the Government has not yet responded to that report. We made something like 61 recommendations. I will refer to one or two of them in a moment to remind honourable senators of the significance that the Committee placed on policy determination in this area. I think the instructions of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to his Ministers that they should respond to parliamentary reports of this character within six months is highly commendable. I regret very much that almost two years have been allowed to pass and we are yet to see the Government response to this very significant document which has received the acclaim of the Institution of Engineers of Australia, the vice-chancellor's committee and other significant organisations throughout Australia who make the point that this document is worthy of government action and favourable consideration. I noted the other day that the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Thomson, had called for more investment in industrial research. The Minister was speaking at the opening of EMI's computer-aided design bureau in Melbourne. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 28 April states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Private enterprise was still not investing enough in industrial research and development, the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Thomson, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospects and possibilities for Australian industry opening up through the application of computer technology, he said, were profound and exciting. </PARA>
<PARA> 'But they will only be realised if we adopt technology faster and integrate it better than our competitors', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a true statement. I think it is very important for the Government to provide more incentives for industry to invest in this important area of industrial research and development. I felt constrained to reply to that particular Press comment and on behalf of the Committee I issued a Press release which, unfortunately, I do not think saw the light of day in the media. However, for the benefit of the Senate I would like just to read the comments that I have made. The release states:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Don Jessop (Liberal, SA), the Chairman of the Senate Science and the Environment Committee, today agreed with the statement made on Monday, 27 April, by the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr D. Thomson, that private enterprise in Australia was still not investing enough in industrial research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Senator Jessop said that the Commonwealth Government could do more to encourage Australian business to devote additional resources to industrial research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Science and Environment Committee in its report 'Industrial Research and Development in Australia' (tabled on 6 June 1979) found that Commonwealth legislation intended to stimulate industrial research and development in Australia had so far failed in their purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Government incentives for IR &amp; D were nowhere near commensurate with need nor did they bear any other than incidental relation to national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Committee drew attention to the decline in IR &amp; D in Australia. Between 1973-74 and 1976-77, gross expenditure on research and development in Australia, as a percentage of gross domestic product fell from 1.29 per cent to 0.97 per cent, a reduction of 20 per cent. No other OECD country showed so great a decline. This decline was due primarily to a fall-off in private enterprise R &amp; D which dropped drastically from 35 per cent of total expenditure in 1973-74 to only 19 per cent in 1976-77. This trend was in strong contrast with the stabilisation or increase in private enterprise R &amp; D which occurred over the years prior to 1976 in almost all other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop said that the Committee found that no clear national policy for science and technology existed in Australia and as a consequence there was little coherence, sense of purpose or direction in government support for IR &amp; D. Senator Jessop said that it was vital that national policies for science and technology be developed as a matter of urgency to encourage IR &amp; D in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I have expressed already my disappointment at the Government's failure to respond to that report and I hope that in the near future that report will be forthcoming. I hope also that the 61 major recommendations will be recognised by the Government as significant and as justifying further Government action in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the importance of the computer and electronic industry not only to Australia but also to the world generally. I understand that if the computer industry has not already taken over from the motor industry as the world's largest industry, it soon will. The implications of this sort of technology to Australia, I believe, are quite significant. I understand that the Government has already taken the initiative to employ 15 scientists at the Waite Institute associated with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Adelaide. They are to develop a super silicon chip. People might say that this advance of technological development could mean unemployment. I suggest that it does not mean unemployment at all but that it is necessary that the Government, in order to avoid unemployment, should recognise our future manpower needs in Australia as a result of the development of such an industry and should gear our education system so that we will be able to provide the personnel to fill the jobs which will open up as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to me, in reading about technological advances in the computer area in preparation for an address I was to give at the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in Brisbane on the implications of technological change, to read a book called The Mighty Micro which was written by Dr Christopher Evans. He described the dramatic miniturisation that had occurred in the computer industry over a number of years. He used a very good example of an engineer required to construct a machine in 1945 that would perform the functions of the human brain. He said that such a machine would occupy the space of Greater London and would require a substantial power station to provide energy for that machine. He went on to say that when transistors become obvious in Australia in about the 1950s, that particular machine would be reduced to something of the size of the Albert Hall and would require a smaller generator to energise it. But the computer of the 1980s will assume about the same size as the human brain and will require a simple mercury cell to activate it. But the significant thing is this-Senator Baume will be able to correct me if I am wrong-I understand that the average human brain is capable of performing about a hundred functions per second. Whether my brain is capable of doing so or whether the brains of some of the members who sit opposite--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The amazing fact is that the computer of this decade will be able to perform one billion functions per second. To me, that is an incredible, mind-boggling figure. The implications of it open up wide possibilities for Australia. In order to capitalise on this we have to be able to research and develop these particular industrial initiatives in this country. The Bill suggests that we will be able to integrate our activities with those of other countries in this type of work that I am suggesting. It will be very important to Canberra where the Government is ngotiating to establish an electronics industry. The job opportunities that will flow from that will be quite immense. But we have to be alert to the need for further action in order to cope with this demand. I told honourable senators that our Committee, in its recommendations, made about 61 conclusions and recommendations, some of which apply to this Bill. On page 22 of the report, recommendation 56 reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal instrument of the Federal government in encouraging IR&amp;D is the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 57 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Acts intended to stimulate IR&amp;D in Australia have so far failed in their purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 58 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> If the IR&amp;D Incentives Act is to be a really effective instrument of government policy it must be related to national aims for industry and directed towards meeting priorities for strengthening industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 59 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Low levels of IR&amp;D incentive grants lead to a frittering away of public money without having any appreciable effect on the quality of the nation's technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 60 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Government incentives for IR&amp;D are nowhere near commensurate with the need, nor do they bear any other than incidental relation to national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>We also went on to suggest that the Government should create and influence the climate for innovation. In paragraph 8.3, at page 234 we stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that many government initiatives influence either directly or indirectly, business assessment of risk taking. The CSIRO in particular drew the attention of the Committee to the indirect effect on decision making of such factors as taxation policies, incentive schemes, employment policies, industry policies, cost structuring and raw material wage policies. As the 1977 White Paper on Manufacturing Industry pointed out, it is important to recognise that ''uncertainty about the continuation of major government initiatives from one government to the next can act as a significant barrier to the commitment of new capital''. Such changes in government policy may be necessary in political terms, but they often have unintended and lingering effects on industry and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>We also made some reference to tariff protection. We suggested that in the past we paid a lot of money to protect inefficiency in industry. This money, in our view, would have been better spent to provide incentives for industries to innovate, develop and lift their production. Many other clauses in this document are meritorious and deserve favourable Government consideration. I look forward to the time in the near future when the Government will indicate to the Senate that it will take initiatives based on this document which was prepared after about 2 1/2 years of public inquiry. We saw more than 100 witnesses and we received many additional submissions from those whom we were able to examine personally. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these people-they came from universities, industries, the CSIRO and from similar areas-were experts in the field and pointed to the urgency to do something further to develop industry in Australia. I like to think that the Government will not ignore the value of a document such as this which has distilled the evidence from interested people throughout Australia on this very important subject. I support the Bill and look forward to further initiatives being taken as suggested by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to honourable senators who have taken part in this second reading debate on the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill 1981. I refer first to the references by my colleague Senator Jessop to the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. I think it is fair to say that honourable senators place great value on the work of Senate committees to which they belong. They take the work of those committees very seriously and are very concerned about the way in which the recommendations are handled and the response which they eventually attract. As a former member of that Committee, though not for some time, I attest to the value of its work and I commend both its Chairman, Senator Jessop, and the members of the Committee for the report to which he referred in some detail. It was a most interesting document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I inform the honourable senator that the Government is concerned that there has not been a response. It intends to make a formal response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee in the near future. I believe that the Senate would be interested to know that the majority of the Standing Committee's recommendations have already been accepted by the Government. I think that is something which should be placed on record in view of the concern expressed by the Chairman and his obvious interest in having his recommendations properly developed and implemented. I will not canvass the main provisions of the Bill. This has already been done by those who have spoken. However, it is necessary to address myself to the amendment which has been moved by Senator Button on behalf of the Opposition, and to several criticisms which were made. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment has been circulated. I will go through it point by point and indicate the reasons why the Government will not accept the amendment and intends to vote against it. In relation to the assertion that there is a low level of Government investment in research and development compared with other technologically developed nations, we point out that public funding of research and development in Australia is higher than in almost any other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country. I have a figure of about 70 per cent in relation to Australian Government investment in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point asserts the failure of the Government to encourage significant private sector development. Again, the Government finds that proposition unacceptable. The Government has increased funding for industrial research and development from $14m in 1977-78 to $54m in 1980-81, which is really a most notable achievement in a time of financial stringency and indicates, probably in a way better than any other, the extent of the Government's commitment to this form of activity. Also, the grant limits which are available are increased by the Bill in two ways: They are increased to $750,000 per annum for project grants and to $40,000 per annum for commencement grants. In addition to that, the grant rate was increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in 1978-78 and later years. </PARA>
<PARA> The third assertion in the amendment states that there is a low level of Australian innovation, as measured by the number of patents taken out each year by Australian individuals and companies. Again, we feel that this can be answered. Australia performs about 1 per cent to 2 per cent of all the research and development effort undertaken by OECD countries. The majority of patents will, of course, be granted to residents of overseas countries, but it is worth noting that about 10 per cent of all the patents granted in this country are to locals, in spite of the fact that we perform about 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the research and development work within the OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth assertion is that there is a failure of the Government to stimulate Australian innovation in a number of areas which are specified in the amendment. The Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme is designed to foster and to encourage industrial research and development and innovation in these areas. Of course, a sizeable amount of the work and the budget of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is directed to these industries set out in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point asserts that Australia is in a disadvantaged position in relation to technology transfer. A substantial amount of technology must be transferred to Australia if we are to develop a healthy technological base. The Government is taking appropriate steps to encourage the transfer of technology through the programs of the Department of Science and Technology. For example, the activities of the Technology Transfer Advisory Board are designed specifically to promote technological transfer, which is the basis of the amendment. I understand that the amendment seeks to condemn the Government for, as it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . losing national control over significant industries based on high levels of research and development, including . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment then lists a number of industries. Australia does not have a large enough base to try to do everything. We are not out to try to reinvent the wheel. We are not out to start to develop all technology from the beginning. But Australian firms are now more competitive than they have been for many years. Australian industry has shown itself able to pursue overseas business opportunities on competitive terms. The assertion that there is any loss of competitiveness or any loss of the capacity of Australian industry to compete is simply not borne out by experience, including our experience in the industries operating in high technology areas. For example, my wife's brother runs a small electronic components manufacturing business and is able to make sales to the United States. Thus we are achieving manufacturing, selling and competing very effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with my colleague. That is an example of what is possible. The third assertion in the amendment is that the Senate rejects those parts of the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions brought down last week which eliminate or downgrade Commonwealth instrumentalities. However, that assertion is not related to the Bill before the Senate, which provides for the strengthening of the administrative arrangements for industrial research and development incentives rather than derogating them. It provides for an enlarged Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board, a technical standing committee for project grants and for a reconstituted incentives advisory committee to advise on public interest projects. I have taken time to proceed part by part through the proposed amendment to indicate why, in justice and in logic, it is one that we should not accept.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although no amendment has been moved in respect of the Bills' title, there has been to some extent a temptation to do so. A number of rival titles have been suggested for the Bill in its present form. Of these I think undoubtedly the most endearing is that offered by Patrick Cook in a recent issue of the National Times. He suggested that a more apt title might be 'The Ask Me No Questions And I Won't Have To Waste Time Lying Bill'. Whether or not that remains an apt title will, of course, depend on the progress of the Committee stage of this debate. It is certainly my hope and expectation that honourable senators and, indeed, the Minister, will treat this as a genuine parliamentary occasion rather than as one for partisan point scoring. Certainly, that is the spirit in which the Opposition will approach the Committee stage of this debate. It is the spirit in which we have endeavoured to put together the volume of amendments which are now before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, the Opposition does not propose an amendment to clause 2 but would seek an indication of attitude from the Government-hopefully of a more precise kind than was offered when the Government made its reply to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs late last year-as to the likely proclamation dates of the Bill and, in particular, whether the Government will reconsider its attitude insofar as the separate proclaiming of Part II is concerned. I refer to that part which deals with the preparation of manuals, indexes and general guideline documents and which has a built-in time lag of 12 months before the obligations set out therein must be satisfied. Given such a built-in time lag could it not come into operation immediately the Bill was passed by the Parliament? If not, why not? Also, can the Minister provide some better indication, in the light of current Public Service attitudes and states of preparation, as to when it might be possible for the Bill as a whole to be proclaimed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs considered this question because of its concern that there should be early proclamation of the Bill and early application of its provisions, so that the value of the Act will be recognised and considerable time will not be wasted while every 'i' is being dotted and every particular arrangement is made. In paragraph 6.32 of the Committee's report, the following recommendation was made:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) While clause 2 of the Bill should not be amended to specifically so provide,--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, to provide for particular dates-</PARA>
<PARA>the legislation should commence general operation not later than 12 months after its passage through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Part II of the Bill should be proclaimed immediately upon assent. </PARA>
<PARA>Part II relates to the publication of documents, the details of agencies, the various structures, manuals and so forth being made known, so that people may know what documents are in the Government's possession and can proceed to make arrangements for access. I too would like some indication from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) as to the intentions of the Government in respect of the proclamation. The Bill does tie the Government down in that respect but I believe that it would be important, and in the public interest, to know how speedily it is proposed to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say on this, the first occasion on which I speak at the Committee stage that some 80 amendments have been proposed by Senator Evans, by me and by other honourable senators. So far as those amendments are concerned, I may be taken as supporting them unless I indicate otherwise in the debate. On the overwhelming majority of occasions I will be supporting these amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in a position to make a specific commitment in relation to the time for proclamation of this legislation if it is passed by the Parliament. In the response I have already given I made some comments. Those are the Government's comments. I have nothing to add to them or to subtract from them. Recently I stated fairly clearly, both in this place and outside it, that the Government is genuinely concerned to have as soon as possible a freedom of information Act substantially along the lines of the Bill that has been introduced. It seems to me that our major task at the moment is to see whether we can get a freedom of information Act. Of course, major problems will be raised by the foreshadowed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously an extensive debate will occur both here and in another place in relation to a number of matters. I hope that our attention can be directed to those issues so that we can deal with them as expeditiously as possible. Once we have an Act, of course, the Government will endeavour to implement it as quickly as it can. Considerable matters of detail will have to be attended to, and this is not a matter that can be proclaimed overnight. When we have the final form of the Bill we will have to consider just how soon its provisions can be brought into operation. I am not prepared to give a specific timetable in relation to these matters except to emphasise again that the Government wants to see a freedom of information Act in place. Obviously we do not want to have in place a freedom of information Act which will not be operative. We will certainly endeavour to bring it into operation as quickly as we can. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 2, clause 3, sub-clause (2) lines 13 to 16, leave out the sub-clause, insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is the intention of the Parliament that the provisions of this Act shall be interpreted so as to further the object set out in sub-section (1) and that any discretions conferred by this Act shall be exercised so as to facilitate and promote, promptly and inexpensively, the disclosure of information. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these two amendments seeks to delete the specific reference in sub-clause (1) (b) to particular reasons for confidentiality, namely, the reference to the maintenance of confidentiality for the protection of certain essential public interests and for the proper conduct of public business. The basic reason we want that wording deleted is simply that it seems selective in that it does not cover systematically, nor is the language general enough to do so, all the various kinds of bodies and interests that are the subject of exemption and exception elsewhere in the Bill. As this clause is simply intended to be a statement of general principle as to the objects of the Bill, there does not really seem to be anything involved in the retention of that sort of qualifying language in the clause other than the possibility of interpretative confusion. That is why we want to remove those words. Their removal would not seem to detract in any substantive way from the Government's intentions as far as this clause is concerned. I suspect that the words have been put in there only through an abundance of caution. My concern is that their presence there creates a potential new set of interpretative hurdles which may stand in the way of a rational application of this Bill as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause (2) is the subject of the second of these amendments. The essence of the amendment is to write in a specific reference to the discretions conferred by the legislation being exercised 'promptly and inexpensively', the idea here again being to focus the minds of the official decision-makers on their obligation not only to provide information when requested but also to do so promptly and inexpensively. The argument in favour of having such a clause is contained in paragraphs 9.1 to 9.5 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I have no doubt that the terms of those paragraphs will be familiar to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). They represent the product of a number of suggestions from various interest groups in the community that the Bill ought to be explicit in this respect. It is by no means unprecedented for general clauses and provisions of this kind now to appear in Commonwealth legislation and examples-I cite the Family Law Act-are given in the text of the Senate Committee's report. The essential reason for these suggested amendments is to remove a possibility of interpretative difficulties by language which does not quite reappear in those terms anywhere else in the Bill and to put in an explicit obligation on officials to react promptly and inexpensively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support these two amendments. I think they will improve the objects that have been put into the Bill, and I complement the Government on having put an object clause in the Bill. I think it will be useful to indicate the policy and, therefore, it is perhaps more important that we take careful notice of the language that we put in the Bill. If, as Senator Evans said, we put in language which places perhaps a wrong emphasis in the objects clause, we may well find that wrong emphasis magnified when courts and public servants give their interpretations. I do not believe the words presently in the Bill should be shown as a major element in the need for freedom of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the very important aspect of the second of these amendments is the idea that there should be promptness and inexpensiveness in the operation of freedom of information. I have before me the submission by the Canadian Bar Association to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs in relation to the Canadian Bill. Debate on that Bill is proceeding at the same time as debate on this Bill. The Canadian Bar Association refers in its submission to the objects clause in the Canadian legislation and to the Canadian model Bill in which the following statement of policy has been incorporated:</PARA>
<PARA> An agency, in processing a request for a record, shall do so with a view to making the maximum amount of information promptly and inexpensively availble to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will see that in our sister nation the same theme is held by a group which has an enormous amount of interest in the development of freedom of information in Canada. I believe that emphasis should go into this Bill. For that reason I think both of these amendments are desirable and could be quite important in interpretations of the Bill at a later stage. Therefore, I support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with amendment No. (3) is that it does not really accurately indicate that a balance has to be struck with freedom of information. The amendment would simply leave the objects of the Act as being those set out in clause 3 (1) (a), which refers to the making available of information about the operations of departments and the practices affecting the public and the creating of a general right of access to information in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities. If we leave clause 3 (2) as it is or include it in amended form it still would not make any reference to the fact that there is a balance to be struck. The purpose of the two limbs of clause 3 (1) (b) which would disappear if the amendment were agreed to would, as I have said, have the effect of leaving the objects without any reference to the balancing process that is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not wedded to the words in those two limbs. I would be quite happy to discuss some other form of words. I have in mind something along the lines that there should be a right, as far as practicable, of access to information in the posession of the government where this can be done without endangering any overriding public interest, or some such phrase. Again, I am not necessarily wedded to those words, but that is the idea that I think needs to be expressed. It is not a pure right. It is qualified by exemptions. Whatever happens in the course of this debate, a number of important exemptions will still remain in the Bill. I understand that all sides in this debate agree that there will be exemptions. I would like to get some indication of what attitude the Committee would take to that idea. If the Committee accepts my point, we could discuss it further and perhaps come up with some other drafts and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The next amendment would bring about very little difference in the clause. I see that the words 'as far as possible' would not appear. I do not have any trouble with that. I do not have any trouble with putting in words to the effect that it is the intention of the Parliament that the objects shall be exercised to facilitate the prompt disclosure of information. I have some difficulty with the use of the word 'inexpensively'. The matter of what expense will be incurred has yet to be decided by the Parliament under regulations. I think Parliament is going to keep control of that matter. 'Inexpensively' is a vague expression. There could be so many views on it that I do not think it really sits very happily in an objects clause. On the other hand, I do not want to be suggesting for a minute that we believe it ought to be expensive. It seems to me to be a very vague term to appear in the clause. I do not want to make an issue of it. However, I think I must make an issue of the balancing which I think needs to be inserted somewhere in the objects clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the Attorney-General that I for one would have no objection to reconsidering amendment No. (3) and, in fact, incorporating some general formula of the kind the Attorney-General in fact suggested in order to indicate that a balancing interest is involved. I do not think anyone disagrees, as the Attorney-General said, with the notion that there are rival interests that have to be accommodated. Indeed, a good deal of the argument in the last day or so has been about certain Cabinet information. The sense or otherwise of its being revealed is very much a matter of public interest. I am sure that agreement on some formula such as that can be reached. So I for one would be happy for further consideration of that amendment to be postponed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to amendment No. (4), I indicate that the expression 'inexpensively' as it appears is really directed to the working public servant or official rather than just to those legislators who are responsible for writing the statutory provisions or regulations to begin with. There are expensive, time-consuming ways of searching for documentary material and there are ways of expediting that search. We wanted to ensure that, to the extent that the charges that would be borne by members of the public would bear some relationship to the way in which the offiicals went about their task of digging out infromation, the officials expedited their role as much as possible. I think, read in that context, 'inexpensively' does make sense and could well be retained without further demur by the Attorney-General. But if he wants to postpon consideration of this amendment so that it can be brought back together with consideration of amendment No. (3), I am sure that other honourable senators will not wish to pursue this matter to a vote at this stage. </PARA>

In other words, there could be various ways of looking at costing of the charges generally in this area. We could have arbitrary charges which may be either very high or very low. We could have some indication at the beginning of the Bill-I think that this is possibly Senator Evans's point-that those charges should be in effect at cost, to put it that way. A reasonable charge could be made to the public which can be justified purely on the cost that is being incurred by the Government in providing the information. I would have thought that that was possibly what we are trying to achieve. I suggest the words 'at the lowest possible cost' if any redrafting is going to try to achieve that end. Any similar words could be used but I think the words 'at the lowest possible cost' semantically cover it. I would be interested to know what the Attorney-General's comments are.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add one or two sentences to this matter. Perhaps I stated the case too narrowly when I said that this amendment could be read as simply a direction to public servants. It seems to me to be important also that, to the extent that the charges are to be fixed in detail by regulation and there will be a regulation-making power later in the Bill which will govern the precise fixation of those charges, those regulations should be promulgated against the background of some overriding statutory provision of that kind. I think it is important that there be language of that kind-not necessarily those words-to govern both the exercise of the powers of the regulation makers and the actions of the bureaucrats involved. I hope that the Attorney-General takes my willingness not to press the amendment at this stage as being not in any way a willingness to resile from the necessity for some reference to expensiveness or inexpensiveness in this clause.

<PARA> (5) Page 4, clause 4, sub-clause (1) lines 8 to 13, definition of 'prescribed authority', leave out the words 'but does not include-' and paragraphs (e) and (f). </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment that I have just moved requires that paragraphs (e) and (f) be deleted from the definition of prescribed authority in clause 4(1) of the Bill. Those paragraphs are in effect the references to external territories. The effect of these provisions in the Bill as it stands is to exclude from the scope of the Bill matters arising in respect of Australia's external territories, those territories being prominantly Christmas Island, the Cocos-Keeling Islands, Norfolk Island and the Australian Antarctic Territory. This exclusion seems to be a new provision in the Bill. It was not embodied in the terms of the original Bill, which was introduced in 1978, and accordingly the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs did not have an opportunity to comment on it. </PARA>
<PARA> We think that a strong onus of proof is vested in the Government to satisfy the Parliament that there are good reasons for the exclusion of these bodies and persons operating where external territories are concerned. I say that because it is quite evident that recently there have been a number of controversies involving certain events in external territories, notably the wages controversy on Christmas Island in which the behaviour of authorities operating in that territory was very much in issue and very much a matter of public interest within Australia. On the face of it it would seem to be quite unfortunate were public officials and bodies operating in those territories to be excluded entirely by virtue of this definition provision from the potential operation of the Bill. In the absence of any articulated justification for this further omission, I have moved that this exception be deleted from the text of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Evans. No particular reason has been shown in any paper that I have seen that would justify the citizens of the territories which are populated-they are the ones with which we are really concerned-not having the benefit of the provisions of the Bill. In some ways, being more remote and being in a more difficult situation, they might a fortiori have an even greater claim to the benefits of having Government information available to them. We make provisions in this Bill for persons who seek to get Government information. Those people do not have to be citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia. The provision applies to any person who is in the country. I applaud that fact. It is well recognised that governments in some countries have thought to exclude from the benefits of freedom of information legislation persons who are not citizens of those countries. Of course, it would be very easy for an individual who is a citizen of Australia to apply on behalf of an American or anyone else, so we make the provision that persons who are in this country but who are not citizens shall be entitled to have the benefit of the Freedom of Information Bill. Here we say to a group of citizens on Norfolk Island or Christmas Island: 'You shall not have the benefits that apply'. I say very simply: No ground has been shown for excluding those persons from the provisions of the Bill. I believe that any additions to the expense involved so far as their activities are concerned would be minimal. The populations are not great in this case. I think that as a matter of principle those Australian citizens ought to have the same rights as the people in the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to the amendment which is before the Committee. Senator Evans has asked what new facts have emerged to justify the provision in paragraphs (e) and (f) of clause 4. The position is that since the original Bill was introduced in 1978 a new degree of self-government has been conferred on Norfolk Island under the Act which was passed in this Parliament I think in 1979. Therefore we believe that this Parliament should not impose upon the Norfolk Island Administration the obligation that we are prepared to assume for our own administration under this legislation. Negotiation and discussion with the Norfolk Island authorities would obviously be required to determine whether they wished to be embraced under this type of legislation. It would be contrary to the spirit of self-government established on Norfolk Island for us to impose upon its people by including them in the provisions of this Bill. We are opposed to the amendment because of this new factor which has occurred since the Bill was introduced in its original form in 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I would have thought that even that expression is capable of a wide application. It does not state in terms that it is an enactment establishing institutions of self-government.

I would have thought that the very generality of that language is capable of being construed as drawing a veil of secrecy over a number of administrative operations presently prevailing in a number of other territories; for example, various Antarctic authorities operating in Australia's southern territory and various other authorities operating in Australia's other territories. The language seems far too wide to accommodate what, on the face of it, might otherwise be a conceivably legitimate exemption. </PARA>

Let us assume that we wil exclude Norfolk Island for the reasons the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) gives. Christmas Island and other territories, including Antarctica and Heard Island where people may not be living, have an administrative set up which is part of our Public Service and which has the governance, control and administration of the territory. I understand the point that is made. We are dealing only with an Act or an ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. But of course there are Acts that relate to the governance of some of the Territories. I know that Acts have been passed in this Parliament concerning Christmas Island, the Ashmore Islands and various territories. It is just a little bit unclear as to how, by this indirect route, we exclude them. I understand what the Attorney-General says, but it seems to me that it could be done much more directly. If we are to exclude just Norfolk Island, why not do so and leave the others quite clearly within the provisions of the Act?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that consideration of the amendment be postponed to enable some of these matters to be given further thought by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I do not think we will solve this sort of thing on the run and certainly will not do so without very extensive time being taken in discussion. For my part I am worried about two things.

<PARA> The second problem I have is a rather larger one of principle, and that is whether there is in fact a justification for excluding from the operation of the Act self-governing external territories which nonetheless are wholly within Australia's federal legislative jurisdiction and in respect of which Australia does have overriding powers and, indeed, from some points of view, responsibilities. I would certainly want to give, and I would hope that the Government would want to give, the justification for that sort of exemption a little more consideration than it has had so far. The main object of moving an amendment at this stage was simply to get some argued reaction from the Government as to why this brand new exemption was in fact there. We have had an explanation, but I am not sure that that explanation does more than raise a number of new problems in people's minds. Under those circumstances, and given that we have a lot of other business that we can go on with, I suggest that consideration of this amendment be postponed. </PARA>

The Government has already decided that the provision should not apply to Norfolk Island. If the Senate were of a different view I think very lengthy discussions would have to occur.

<PARA>but this Act does not apply to any request for access to a document of a tribunal, authority or body so specified unless the document relates to matters of an administrative nature. </PARA>
<PARA>The object of the amendment is to treat this clause, which deals with courts, judicial offices, certain industrial tribunals and their registries, in such a way that those bodies are not exempt from the operation of the Act so far as their administrative procedures, properly so-called, are concerned. This was the subject of discussion and commentary in the Senate Committee report in paragraphs 12.29 to 12.30 and paragraphs 12.33 to 12.34. In those paragraphs the point was made that whilst there are obviously good reasons for excluding the operation of this kind of legislation where it might intrude on the independence of the judiciary and whilst it certainly should not operate as an alternative means for litigants to obtain discovery of court documents in the course of their litigation, there was a clearly definable area of court and tribunal activity which was legiti- mately the subject of public interest so far as efficient administration was concerned. The Bill ought to be amended to make this clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The kind of matters that the Committee had in mind as justifying the operation of the Bill were questions relating to the number of sitting days, the number of cases determined, the number of cases withdrawn, the number of cases which were subsequently appealed, criminal cases in which bail was awarded and so on. The utility, or indeed the necessity, for an exemption for administrative questions of this kind is in fact made more obvious by the recent change in the legislation governing the High Court of Australia. These sorts of administrative questions are now clearly within the Court's jurisdiction, whereas previously the majority of administrative matters of this kind were performed by or through the Attorney-General's Department and as such were the subject of ordinary access procedures so far as information was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> If questions of administrative efficiency of this kind are now to be locked away within the bosom of the institution, as a result of legislative changes of the kind that have recently been made concerning the High Court, it becomes that much more important for there to be access procedures available to people to ensure that information of the kind to which I am referring can be extracted. That is the justification for the amendment. The Senate committee does not see this as interfering or trespassing in any way with the independence of these bodies which, as a part of our constitutional system, it is important to preserve. It is a distinction which is familiar and understood and the language in which the amendment is cast is sufficiently clear and precise, in our view, to be accommodated directly by the Government. I hope that is exactly what happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also support the two amendments which relate to the administration of courts. I support what Senator Evans says and the reference that he makes to the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. There should be a limit placed on the exemption granted in respect of court documents of a non-administrative character-certainly, court documents in the usual sense. Of course, there are good grounds for saying that those documents and activities of judges should not be interfered with. I think there is a great tendency by the public to regard courts as sacrosanct and therefore for there to be a feeling that, with a broad brush, we should exclude them from any nosy parker activity on the part of individual members of the public or members of Parliament. I do not believe that that is correct in regard to administrative activities of courts which, in that respect, are very much like any other government body.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to this amendment. It is one about which we have some very firm views. The object of this legislation is to provide access to information at the level of the Executive branch of government, not the Parliament or the judicial branches of government. Very sensitive relationships exist between the Executive and the judiciary, as I am sure all honourable senators will be well aware. For a start it is a very difficult exercise to indicate clearly what sort of documents will be comprehended in regard to administrative aspects as opposed to the other judicial aspects of a court. Obviously problems of very considerable detail could arise, but putting that aside, the policy of this legislation is directed to the Executive government. By seeking to extend it, even to a limited extent, into the administration side of the judicial branch of government, I believe is going beyond the object and intention of this legislation. As I have said, the reason we have not gone into that is because of this very sensitive relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Judges see the staff provided to them, even though they may be provided as part of the Executive branch of government, as being very much under the authority of the judges and working for them. I am particularly conscious of that now-even if I have not been during all the time I have held my present office. I think that if rights of this kind were created they would be regarded as an intrusion into judicial independence. The sort of information that might be required, putting aside the High Court of Australia Act, has been readily obtained by the Parliament in the past. No great difficulties have been experienced in obtaining for the Parliament information on the sorts of matters that Senator Evans has mentioned. If the Minister concerned wants information he can obtain it. I do not think that the High Court, being a separate administration, presents a technical or legal problem. Obviously it is a separate administration and information, as a matter of law, cannot be obtained so readily. I do not think it is likely that there will be any problems with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Money is provided by the Parliament. For example, when we were giving our consideration to the Estimates, the Clerk of the High Court was here. The appropriations for the High Court was included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81. Information can be obtained readily enough twice a year through that avenue. But I do not foreshadow any difficulty in obtaining information at any other time if it is sought by the Parliament. To give a general right of access to any member of the public, as this Bill would do, to the administrative documents in courts I believe will open up, in a very obvious way, the question of independence of the judiciary. As I have said, even though an attempt is made in the amendment to limit its scope to administrative matters, I think the same considerations should apply to those matters as apply to draft judgments or other matters which are clearly within the judicial area. Courts do not look at their independent role as being limited only to what the judge may do. The courts look upon themselves-and rightly so under our Constitution-as bodies separate from the Executive. A very clear distinction is made and we agree with that. I think by opening up that question, as the carrying of this amendment would do, we would be raising matters which are really quite beyond the intention and object of this legislation which, as I have said, is designed to provide access to documents in the executive arm of government, not the other arms of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that I am disposed to press this matter to the point of a division because the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has said no more than that certain sensitivities are likely to be offended more as a matter of abstract principle rather than practical working inhibitions on their effectiveness. That is a consideration that the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee had well in mind when it considered this matter carefully and produced the conclusion that it did. We decided, as I indicated, that it was important to maintain, absolutely unsullied and unfettered, the principle of judicial independence so far as judicial powers, properly so-called, were concerned. But when it came to the administration of any of the courts in the Federal system and even more so when it came to the administration of things like the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, Office of the Industrial Registrar, Deputy Industrial Registrars, the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal, Public Service arbitrators and so on-all of the other bodies which are also dealt with as part of this compendious amendment- the public had an overwhelming interest and indeed a right to know how they were being administered, how effectively, how cost effectively and to what extent services were being made available in the public interest. It is not to the point, might I suggest, that information as a matter of practice in the present environment is likely to be made available to the extent that it is reasonably requested in this area. That may be said of innumerable other areas of potential operation of this freedom of information legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. Even the exemptions are permissive and still allow a residuary right for the body in question, be it a department or an authority, to grant access even though there is a prima facie right to refuse it by virtue of the terms of the exemption. The effect of these provisions, however, is to remove completely that kind of discretionary decision-making power from the operation of this legislation-to remove completely these bodies from the procedures, conciliatory and otherwise, which are available under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We of the Opposition see that as just not being defensible in principle provided that a distinction can be drawn between judicial and non-judicial or administrative powers. I think the Attorney has acknowledged in everything that he has said that the division can be drawn. He was really just making a thin edge of the wedge kind of point, acknowledging in the process that the interference with the judicial or arbitral function that is here being contemplated would be of a limited kind. Under all of those circumstances, I think we are doing no more than traversing ground that was considered and considered very carefully by the Senate Committee. I hope that, under those circumstances, other members of this chamber will appreciate the issues and vote accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should add that I think there are very real difficulties in attempting to limit the access provisions to matters of an administrative nature. I think there are very real difficulties in applying them to the judicial area. I think a good deal of controversy would arise. This would lead to appeals on those issues and we could have the difficult situation of appeals on such issues from the chief judge of a court or perhaps even the Chief Justice of the High Court to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, presumably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, if this amendment were carried in this form, consequential amendments would have to be considered because we could not just accept this amendment and leave it at that. This would raise the question of who is to make the decisions, what appeals can be made against the decision and also whether there should not be some special or other exemptions. I am not saying these are the reasons why I am opposing the amendment. I am opposing it on the grounds of principle. If this Committee is not prepared to accept that principle, I simply warn the Committee that the acceptance of the amendment would mean there would have to be a great many other consequential amendments. Those amendments have not been developed. They would have to be developed. In the course of developing them, further problems would arise. So I am opposed to this amendment because, as I said, it is a matter of a stand on principle that I believe the Parliament should take in confining this proposed legislation to the Executive and not seek to apply it to the judiciary. As I said, further than that, some real consequential problems would arise if this amendment is passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support this amendment. We have listened with great interest to the comment on this amendment because it would seem to be the first major point of principle we have come to in this Committee stage. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has said that his objection to the amendment basically is, if I understood him correctly, that there would be difficulties if it were accepted. I think the Minister almost indicated that the difficulties would be of a sort of nuisance value if the administrative areas of the judicial processes somehow were subject to public inquiry. There is a feeling in what he says-I hope I did not misjudge him-that somehow the judiciary should be exempt from that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This brings us to an extremely important point of principle. The Australian Democrats feel for reasons of public appearance that that is the very area in which there should not be exemptions. In other words, I think it is fairly unlikely that there will be a necessity for requests for information in this area. If there are such requests there may well be good reasons of one kind or other for it. It should be apparent in the public view-and that means in the legislation-that should that kind of situation arise it would be subject to examination. It seems to me a perfectly simply principle. The Minister has mentioned consequential amendments. He would know about that better than I. I do not pretend to understand the legal complexities. But on that point we say that if they are necessary we will have to accept that situation. It is not good enough to leave things out of the Bill merely on the basis that their inclusion might create difficulties. I substantially agree with Senator Evans' view and we will vote for this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just about to raise the very point that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) touched on. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs did in its consideration look at the separation of powers and also at the question of administrative practicality. For that reason we did not recommend that the documents of the Parliament, Library documents and so on should be subject to the freedom of information legislation. As I said at the outset, I was interested to hear the objection, that is, the difficulties that this amendment would create if it were accepted. The Attorney has concentrated entirely on this problem of judicial power and the Chief Justice appearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and so on; but he has not at all touched on the other leg of this amendment which deals with various tribunals which certainly are not involved in the exercise of judicial power and could not reasonably be regarded as part of the judiciary. I wonder whether the Attorney can say why they should not be included because I am trying to make up my mind whether I accept the arguments, which have some substance. But it is a matter of balance. To my mind, it is not a matter of absolute principle. If the Attorney would be so kind, I would like to hear something on the reason why the various tribunals should be excluded from the operation of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for it is very simple and that is that although these other bodies are not, as a matter of strict constitutional law, judicial bodies they are widely regarded in the community as judicial bodies. The community makes no distinction whatever between a judge of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and a judge of a federal court. I think that was very apparent in the debates in this Parliament last year and in the public debate in relation to Mr Justice Staples. Despite the fact that as a matter of law it was not the case, he was regarded in exactly the same light as a judge of a court. Mr Justice Kirby is regarded universally in the same light as any other judge. It is very interesting that when the Labor Government set up the Law Reform Commission and appointed Mr Justice Kirby, it appointed him not to the industrial Court, as it then was, but to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. As I said, although these bodies are not strictly judicial bodies, they are accepted in the community and, I think, in this Parliament as being bodies served by people who are of the same status, of the same character and certainly of the same vigorous independence as the judiciary. That is why they have been included along with the judiciary, properly so called.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has raised the question whether the parliamentary departments ought to be included in this provision. Of course there is persuasive argument in favour of their inclusion. But lest it be thought that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, when it considered the freedom of information legislation, did not give thought to this matter, let me read what it said in paragraph 12.32 of its report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there would appear to be, on balance, a case for giving the parliamentary departments the somewhat less than total blanket exemption from the Act, we have found it difficult to distinguish clearly or systematically those activities of the parliamentary departments disclosure of which might be thought to have a detrimental effect on the position of members of parliament. We have not found it possible to agree on any formula which would provide a satisfactory general basis for making the distinctions in question. In the event, in the absence of any submission to us from any source, recommending that the parliamentary departments be subject in whole or part to the Bill, we do not at this stage recommend any amendments to the Bill in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to note this next comment:</PARA>
<PARA> We do, however, believe that the parliamentary departments should be encouraged to act as if the legislation were applicable to them in the same way as the executive departments have been instructed to treat requests before the introduction of the legislation as if it were in force. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, they were not recommendations but there were recommendations in respect of what the administrative activities of courts and tribunals should be. That was a different situation. But honourable senators will see that the Senate Committee recognised the fact that there was a balance in favour of the parliamentary departments as well. But there is no simple explanation of the administrative nature type of document such as we have in regard to this amendment. Clearly, it was contemplated that the parliamentary departments should treat themselves as though they were bound by the legislation; that, in reality, they ought to be acting as though freedom of information applied to them. I think the argument, therefore, is that in regard to the courts and the other authorities, where we can make a clear distinction, we should put that provision in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having now had a submission from as authoritative a source as the highest law officer in the land, the Attorney-General, that the parliamentary departments ought to be included in this way, I can assure him that we would be very happy indeed to go away and try to draft an amendment to incorporate the parliamentary departments within the scope of this Bill, provided that we can be assured of his support for such an amendment if we go to the effort of drafting it. In principle, as Senator Missen demonstrated by reading the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, there is very great sensitivity to the point that the Attorney made about the desirability of the parliamentary administration being included. I, for one, believe it is possible to draft a clause fairly easily which would accommodate that interest. I believe, equally, that it is very much in the public interest that the parliamentary departments be exposed to the same kind of scrutiny so far as their administration is concerned as is here being proposed for the courts. So, although it sounded a pretty good debating point while it was being made, I do not think the Attorney has succeeded in deterring us from our course on the courts by raising that issue. But if he is prepared to give us an indication of whether he would support an extension to cover the parliamentary departments, I assure him that we will do the drafting work for him and bring back the matter before the conclusion of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other matter that I want to respond to and that is the small 'h' hyperbole, if I can put it that way, of the Attorney so far as the consequential implications of these amendments are concerned. It is hyperbole because the general structure of the Bill is such that the necessary adminstrative arrangements to establish lines of responsibility and so on can very readily be applied to the courts as to any other body. I remind the Attorney of the existence, for example, of clause 22, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> A decision in respect of a request made to an agency may be made, on behalf of the agency, by the responsible Minister or the principal officer of the agency or, subject to the regulations, by an officer of the agency acting within the scope of authority exercisable by him in accordance with arrangements approved by the responsible Minister or the principal officer of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA>So the capacity to delegate particular officers within the court structure to be the responsible officers from the point of view of administering this freedom of information legislation and all the baggage of appeals and so on that goes with it can readily be handled by that clause and, indeed, by the whole structure of the Bill as it presently stands. There is, in our suggestion, no need for any further apparatus of exemptions and so on so far as the courts are concerned in this respect because the very focus of these amending clauses is purely on the administrative functions of the courts and tribunals in question, which functions ought not to be controversial so far as their potential exposure is concerned. So, for all those reasons, I persist with the amendment and will persist with it to the point of the support of my colleagues calling a division on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise for the first time in this debate to indicate a view on the scope and extension of this exemption. It seems to me that there can be few areas in which an individual citizen has more legitimate interest than in the administration of the law. The fact that it is the individual, not the Executive Government, who by and large is likely to be on the receiving end of any maladministration of the law, who will be inconvenienced or upset or will have his rights prejudiced by what in fact amounts to administrative problems in terms of the operation of the law seems to me to be an area in which that individual citizen ought to be able to get some information. If he finds that there are unsatisfactory aspects to it he ought to be able to lay that information before his parliamentary representative or anybody else who is charged with an overall responsibility for the protection of the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment as moved clearly seeks to limit the extent and operation of the clause to the administrative functions of the courts and tribunals only. It seems to me that there is altogether too much secrecy in particular in the operation of the law and that the law is making itself and the judges are making themselves very much a closed shop in the sense of putting themselves above and beyond the legitimate rights of the citizens of Australia whom, after all, they are supposed to serve, not in an elected sense but in a judicial sense. The judiciary clearly has a responsibility within the framework of the good government of the Commonwealth of Australia to interpret the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and to assist the Parliament in providing for the good government of Australia. Most of these bodies are creatures of the Parliament to the extent that the Parliament establishes them, has control, in essence, of their financing, and has control of their financing, and has control of the laws under which they are obliged to operate. The law is there to serve a public interest, not to serve the interests of lawyers, judges or those who have an immediate connection with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The point which the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) made about the separation of the judiciary from the Executive is a most important one. It goes to the heart or essence of what our system of government is all about. One cannot separate the role of the judiciary in the administration of the judicial process from an overwhelming and overriding public interest that people ought to know that the administration of the legal system-not that the laws are adequate and proper; that is a matter for them to test through the Parliament-is appropriate, efficient, and is operating, as I have said, for the overriding benefit of members of the community. From time to time we in this Parliament, for instance, have concerned ourselves with such matters as the operation of family courts. Parliament legitimately wants to know how family courts operate. The test is not to interfere with the independence of the judiciary but to make sure that the processes of family law are properly carried out and that the administration of family law is properly carried out.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, as Senator Martyr has said, that justice is done. The test is also to determine whether the Act which the Parliament has passed is working in the way in which the Parliament expected, intended, and indeed hopes that it will work. To that extent it seems to me that this is an area which touches very fundamentally upon the rights of citizens and upon the ability of people to be convinced or pursuaded that the legal system in fact is there to serve them, to help them, to protect their rights and not simply a great morass in which they find themselves. Once they are in the hands of the lawyers, the legal systems and the courts they are totally lost. They are totally at other people's mercy. They not only do not know whether the law is good law or a bad law, which, as I said, is a matter to be tested in the Parliament, but also they do not even know whether the legal system-the judicial system and the administration of that system-works properly. It is simply not good enough for us to say that every six months when the Estimates committees hearings come around Parliament can get what information it can from the administration of the courts. I do not deny that. I do not cavil at that, but this is not a matter of what information is available to the Parliament. This is a matter of what information is available to the citizen in his individual capacity and is his individual right to know. To the extent to which the amendment is limited to the administrative functions of the judicial system and the arguments which are cogently advanced in the Senate Committee report, this amendment has my support.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Puplick would be sadly disappointed if he thinks that by passing this amendment any citizen will learn very much about how the judicial system works, because the sorts of problems with which he is concerned will be within the judicial area and not in the administrative area. I simply instance the Estimates committees in relation to the High Court of Australia because that is the only part of the administration of justice at the Federal level which is an independent body. Otherwise, the administration of the courts is, in the end, the responsibility of my Department. One may ask questions of me every day when Parliament sits about this or that aspect of the administration and one can get information. It is not by any means limited simply in that way. A great deal of the majority of the work of courts would be within the judicial area. There are, of course, very strict prohibitions in the Family Law Act in regard to getting information about the Family Court of Australia. There will not be very much information available in that area. In relation to the counselling services, the documents would almost certainly all be exempt anyway. One would get a very limited picture indeed of the judicial system by having access to this class of documents. All one does is give access to a limited area and at the same time breach the independence of the judiciary because it would regard the whole operation in which it is engaged as not being clearly defined as to when it is acting on judicial work and when it might be doing some administrative work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why I say that in the end it comes down to a matter of principle. I also reiterate that many problems would arise in actually identifying documents, as to whether they are purely administrative or whether they are not involved in the actual judicial work of the court. Also, I do not think-although Senator Evans sought to minimise it-that one can minimise the problems which may arise in regard not only to consequential amendments but also one would have to think of whether there are areas in which other exemptions may be required. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I have not thought of them because the Government does not believe that this legislation was designed to apply to any other area but to the executive area. I am not saying that it ought to apply to the Parliament. I simply take the point that if one is going to take it outside the executive area, which is what I understood this exercise was about, I cannot understand why it should be limited in this way and should not apply to the Parliament as well as to the judiciary. I believe there is a range of arguments against this amendment. I cannot think of what more needs to be said about it, but it is certainly not a matter which I am prepared to reconsider because the Government has had a very firm view about it at all times. As I said, I hope the Committee will reject the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has made the point, as I understand him, that in this case it might be adequate if information were available through members of parliament. I say only that there is evidence throughout the world, in regard to areas of information of this kind, which shows that it is not adequate, with all respect to my colleagues, at all times for only members of parliament to have access to information. Surely the basic point of this matter is that all members of the public should know. One might think of a hypothetical case here. I agree with the Attorney that this would be a specialist area. I would not imagine that the average Joe Blow who wanted to make an inquiry in this area would be a solicitor, somebody interested in some particular area, or somebody with greatly specialised knowledge and would have a point that he wanted to clear up which could be of great importance. It is something perhaps that even a member of parliament might not know about. It might be a peculiarly specialised matter on which he wished to seek information in this administrative area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said when I spoke earlier on this clause, it is unlikely to my mind that this would be used a great deal, but the real substance is the appearance of it. There should be something there so that the public will feel that even where possible the operation of the courts is subject to public scrutiny, that any person can apply through the freedom of information legislation and can obtain the information that he wishes. The Attorney-General made the point again that many documents concern the administration of the courts. He mentioned that family law courts would be exempt in any case. I suggest that that is another matter. I think that is something which has to be looked at separately. It does not affect the basic principle at stake here. It is a very basic principle indeed and one that I believe will arise again and again at the Committee stage of this Bill. We come back to the question: Are we prepared to have legislation which will, as this legislation pretends to do, give the freest possible information in the pure sense of that term? Here we have the first collision with the Government. The Minister says: 'No, that is not to happen in this case'. Therefore, we are faced with a limitation of the community's freedom to obtain information, something which in all honesty I do not believe the Minister has yet justified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, Senator Harradine was not in the chamber, nor apparently was he listening to the debate, when the matter was raised earlier. However, it is important and, since he has now raised it, perhaps I should repeat what I said then. These bodies are included with the courts in the exemptions because, although under the Constitution they are not strictly judicial bodies, they are accepted by the community at large and this Parliament as having the characteristics of judicial bodies. The members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are given the title of judge.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have discussed the matter and do not want to go over it all again. There is a very widespread public recognition of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. These bodies are similar to that Commission and indeed two of them are part of it. There is widespread public recognition that these bodies are completely independent and that the judges who comprise them enjoy the same independence as if they were appointed to a court created by the Parliament. Indeed, we have gone to great lengths to build into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act a similar protection. It cannot be as wide as the constitutional protection provides but quite rightly, we have gone so far as to accord the judges of the Commission the same status and independence as that of judges of courts, strictly so-called. Thus, the Government feels that it would be quite invidious to treat the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being separate, or in any way different, from the ordinary courts in regard to the application of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I assumed that those honourable senators would speak for either half an hour or an hour and that the freedom of information legislation would not be reached until after dinner.

<PARA> '(7) Sub-sections 48(4), (5), (5A) and (6) and Section 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 do not apply to regulations made in accordance with this section.'</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to this clause which deals with exemption of certain bodies. It is the provision whereby the Government exempts certain bodies from the operation of the Act. This is an important clause and this amendment is one of some significance. I wish to draw attention to the fact that in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitution and Legal Affairs recommendation No. 33 is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The exemption of any agencies or classes of documents of an agency and the determination of whether a body is part of a specified agency should be achieved by listing them in a schedule to the Freedom of Information Bill with subsequent amendment to that schedule occurring by means of regulation taking effect only upon affirmative resolution of both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has accepted, in part, the recommendations which the Senate Committee made. I should read the response from the Government. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the recommendation that initial exemptions from the Act should be made in a schedule to the Act. Whilst the Government is of the view that deletions of bodies included in the original schedule should be by amendment to the Act, subsequent additions to the schedule might be made by regulation, which would be subject to the normal disallowance procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government accepts the fact-and I congratulate the Government on doing this-that in the Act are the bodies which the Government proposes to exempt and which senators will find now in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Act. That will be, of course, a matter for debate by this Committee at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers under which this is done do not allow for the proposal which the Senate Committee put. It said that if we increase the number of bodies that are to be excluded entirely from the operations of the Freedom of Information Act or from Part II of the Schedule-in particular many of those bodies will have documents which relate to competitive, commercial operations-the alterations in respect of those documents and the perhaps vast widening of the ambit of exclusion from the Act or the reduction in the other way as well will be achieved by regulation and will not be debated necessarily in this Parliament at all. In effect, this is one of the hidden exemptions in the Bill and it could be a very considerable exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that there may be no parliamentary scrutiny because it is very doubtful whether the normal parliamentary scrutiny with which the Committee is very familiar-including the referral of all regulations to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and on occasions consideration of disallowance on the recommendation of that Committee or on the recommendation of any senator, will happen. If, in fact, the Government in future proposes to add to the Schedule, it can do so by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations and Ordinances Committee, of course, is subject to and works upon four criteria only. Perhaps the most likely criterion that it could use-and probably the only one-is that it interferes with the rights and liberties of the citizen. In a sense it may be said that to remove some organisation from scrutiny of freedom of information interferes with rights and liberties. It is perhaps tenuous at the best. In fact, it is unlikely that that Committee would be in a position to scrutinise carefully that sort of organisation or that sort of decision by the Government. Then, of course, it would have to bring before this chamber a discussion and a debate on that exclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the recommendation of the Senate Committee was that the method of making alterations to exemptions should be my means of an affirmative resolution. It should be done by some action which requires debate in both chambers. This is an important recommendation. Because it is a matter of proceeding to change the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act, this recommendation was made. Provision also is made that such a change in the Act should not take effect until it is, in fact, affirmed by both Houses of Parliament. In other words, we should not find the situation where a regulation is made excluding some organisation from any action under the Act, which might be done for some purpose by some government, and where some months later there is a discussion, at the best for possible disallowance of that regulation. The fact is that I think such regulations should not take effect until affirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the Senate Committee's consideration of this Bill, in two other areas it recommended the same use of affirmative resolution which has been used on a number of occasions in this Parliament. I shall give as examples section 26 (3) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and section 24 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Senators will be familiar with that area where we have to pass affirmative resolutions regarding the redistribution proposals to the States because we regard those matters as important and requiring scrutiny by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we have recommended in two other areas in this Senate report the use of the affirmative resolution. One area is chapter 8.43 in which we deal with the reduction of times. This refers to recommendation 14 of the Senate Comittee. We made recommendations whereby the times for compliance with the provisions of the Act could be reduced from 60 days-it is proposed at the moment to reduce it to 45 days-and later to 30 days. These important changes ought to be done by affirmative resolution. The other area is in chapter 21.13 for which another Schedule was proposed by the Committee for prescribed secrecy provisions. If that is put into the Act, further prescribed secrecy provisions or changes that may be made to that Schedule would, under our recommendation 58 (b), be done by the same affirmative resolution proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will see from the terms of the amendment which is before them that one provision, sub-section (7), makes provision that the various sub-sections of the Acts Intepretation Act do not apply to regulations made in accordance with this section. Those are provisions relating to disallowance which would not be applicable if, in fact, the proposed changes to the Schedule would have to come before the Senate in any event to be affirmatively upheld. For these reasons, I propose that this amendment be inserted in clause 6 so that we can be sure that Parliament has a real and constant obligation to know what further changes are to be proposed, whether organisations are to be made subject to the Act or whether their present exclusion is to be taken away, and whether new organisations for some good reason were to be given that privilege, not to be answerable to the people and not to provide materials and documents as the Act provides. Because of the importance which the Schedule involves and because of the recommendations that the Senate Committee put before this chamber, I recommend this amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment before the chamber. The position is that certain bodies have been listed in the Schedule for very strong policy reasons which no doubt we will be debating at some later stage. We believe that those bodies, particularly the intelligence bodies, should not be removed from the Schedule by regulation but that it should be done with the full strength of amendment. I am fairly relaxed about the suggestion that additional bodies should be added by affirmative resolution, although I think that if we are to get an affirmative resolution we might as well forget about changing the Schedule by regulation and leave it to be amended by amendments to the Act. As I have said, we are not prepared to have the listing of certain bodies changed by regulation. We would require an amendment to be made to the Act. I hope that there is some agreement in relation to that aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, I am not very concerned about the other aspects of this amendment. If the Committee really thinks that no deletions or changes should be made to the bodies listed in Parts I and II, I cannot really see any great issue about that, but the Government believes that some of these bodies should not be deleted from the Schedule except by an Act of Parliament. I do not wish to spend a great deal of time on a matter which, apart from the issue to which I have just referred, does not seem to me to be of any great importance. I just wish to get an idea from the Committee as to whether it wants to make an issue of that point. If it wants to make it an issue, the issue will be joined on that point. If the Committee does not want to join issue on it, we can postpone consideration of it and see whether we can arrive at some compromise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a disposition on my part, and I suspect on the part of the Australian Labor Party, to join issue with the Attorney-General on this matter. We support Senator Missen's amendment and we do not find the objections of the Attorney-General especially persuasive. The main consideration which appears to be exercising the Attorney's mind is that he does not want to see any important agency that is exempted by virtue of being embodied in the Schedule being able to be deleted from that Schedule by way of mere regulation as distinct from an Act of Parliament. What he appears to have overlooked-this is very clear indeed from the text of Senator Missen's amendment-is that either an insertion or a deletion of a body in the schedule which is to be accomplished under this system by regulation must be accomplished by virtue of affirmation of that regulation by the Parliament. Assuming that the intelligence agencies were listed at present, and assuming that some subsequent government were minded to remove them from the Schedule and promulgated regulations to that effect, it would be only upon an affirmative resolution of those Houses that those regulations could be given effect to and that the deletions could be accomplished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General cannot have it both ways. On the one hand he is saying that an affirmative resolution is for all practical purposes the same as an Act of Parliament, yet on the other hand, when it comes to doing things that he is not very happy about, he is saying that an affirmative resolution is not as good as an Act of Parliament. The Committee adopted this proposal, after a considerable degree of thought, because, as Senator Missen has said, an additional flexibility is associated with the regulation procedure, even with an affirmative resolution built into it. It is not as cumbrous a procedure as passing an Act of Parliament but it is one that deserves the principle of parliamentary support. The other point is that with a regulation we have the option of having at least some scrutiny on a systematic basis by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, even if that is not a completely effective safety valve. That, of course, is why we argued for more than simple regulation. We argued for affirmation by both Houses. I am a little puzzled at the extent of the Attorney's manifest hostility on this point. It seems to be the sort of thing on which we could reach a reasonable accommodation, but if we cannot do so I guess we will have to press this amendment to a division also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to flag my interest in the agencies that are listed as exempt in the Schedule. I realise that this is not the appropriate time to debate the legitimacy or otherwise of any or all of the agencies listed in Part I of the Schedule, but I feel that it would assist the Attorney-General, having regard to the fact that I stated prior to the suspension of the sitting that I am not committed to any of the amendments, for him to recognise that I have some questions relating to the appropriateness of some of the agencies being listed as exempt in the Schedule. The following agencies are listed: The Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Australian National Airlines Commission, the Australian National Railways Commission, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation, the Australian Shipping Commission, the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, the banking industry, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory, the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, the Health Insurance Commission, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the National Debt Commission, the National Labour Consultative Council, the Pipeline Authority, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. The only agencies that I have not mentioned, of course, are those which are of importance and significance to the security of this country. I assume that there would be general agreement in this chamber that those organisations ought to be exempted from the provisions of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the substance of the amendment. I feel that there is merit in what has been expressed by Senator Missen and Senator Evans in that whatever regulations are made those regulations do not take effect until each House of Parliament has resolved that they should take effect. That, if anything, is a positive assertion of the authority of both chambers of the Federal Parliament. I consider that under those circumstances the amendment provides the safeguards that the Attorney-General has indicated ought to be provided against any regulations adopted by any future government. Therefore it is my intention, unless I am persuaded otherwise, to vote for the amendment which is before the chamber. </PARA>

There are some bodies listed in that Schedule and I am glad that Senator Harradine supports the presence there of the intelligence agencies. The Government is very concerned about that point. It is very concerned that those intelligence agencies should at all times be exempt. When one has a very strong policy in matters of this kind, it seems to me that the appropriate method of changing that policy is by an amendment to the Act of Parliament itself. That is the view that I take. The suggestion which is made here, and which has found some favour, is that we do not need to worry because any regulations that change it will have to have an affirmative resolution, that is, not take effect until each House of the Parliament has resolved that it take effect.

The Government could introduce motions in both Houses of Parliament at the same time, immediately following the making of the regulation. Therefore, the ordinary checks and balances which we believe exist in a bicameral system of government are not preserved by an affirmative resolution procedure. That is the concern that I have about it. I think that the use of affirmative resolutions in relation to regulations is a new idea. We have not had experience of handling it. I do not believe that it has the same security in preserving the position of the exemption of intelligence agencies and other matters-those are the mattes about which we are particularly concerned-as would an amendment to the Act which, as we all know, has a successive consideration by each House of the Parliament. That is the basis of the Government's concern, and that is why I have concern and reservations about this particular amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are, in Parliament, going to decide what bodies are exempted. I trust that the Parliament will agree to the exemption of the intelligence agencies, as Senator Harradine does. I think once the Parliament decides on that, then that is of such policy importance, that only the Parliament by ordinary processes of amendment to the Act should change it. That is the point of principle which I stand on in relation to this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I want to make clear my own position about security agencies as far as the Schedule is concerned. Having given this a great deal of thought, in terms of the exemptions, my view is the same as that expressed by Senator Harradine in that I am prepared to concede that it is proper that the security and intelligence agencies of the Commonwealth should be given a proper protection in the Schedule. I would not support any attempt to remove the security and intelligence agencies from the Schedule as it currently stands in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that there are a couple of points to make. The first is to indicate that although the process of amendment by affirmative resolution, which is described as new-fangled by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), has been used, certainly not with a regulation, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act for the approving or disapproving-this chamber has done both from time to time-of the distribution commissioners' recommendations for redistribution. But lest it be thought that the Committee was seeking to break new ground in terms of dealing with regulations in this way, may I draw the attention of the Attorney-General and the Senate to paragraph 12.6 of the Committee's report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The device of amending a schedule to an Act by regulation is used in section 26 (3) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. This has the advantage of avoiding the necessity for amending legislation yet still complies with the important principle that any legislative alteration in people's rights and obligations should be readily ascertainable. </PARA>
<PARA>The principle is established in government legislation-in legislation that this Parliament and the Senate has already passed-of dealing with the approval of regulations by affirmative action in that sense under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Missen tells me-he was here at the time and I was not-that the Coalition parties supported that legislation when they were on the Opposition benches. I must say that I am anxious to find a reasonable accommodation with the Attorney on the position of the security agencies. I do believe that the security agencies are simply not capable of being dealt with in the same sort of global sense, as one might deal with the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation or the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories or the Snowy Mountains Authority, or whatever happens to be otherwise appearing in the Schedule, in the list that Senator Harradine had already read out this evening. Whether it commends itself to the Attorney and he is prepared to look at this in the light of debate which will take place right at the end of the legislation, when the actual inclusions or deletions of various bodies in the various parts of the Schedule are dealt with, it may well be that a way which is open to the Attorney as far as this is concerned is to let the Parliament make its decision on where the security bodies will appear in the Schedule. I have indicated my support for their continuation in Schedule 1 as they currently are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that we-not just members of the Committee but the Attorney and honourable senators who are in support of this amendment-are basically saying that there is an agreement which covers those agencies which it might be sought to add to the Schedule at a later date. That would only be added, not by regulation, but by affirmative resolutions of both Houses of the Parliament. I do not think that there is any great difficulty faced by the Attorney in terms of deletions from the Schedule by a resolution passed through both Houses of the Parliament provided that that does not touch upon the security agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I am indicating to the Attorney some grounds for my being willing to look for an intelligent compromise on this matter is that in reality the process of passing an Act through both houses of parliament in order to delete one of the security and intelligence agencies from the schedule will, in the long run, be no different, in terms of its processes, from passing an affirmative resolution through both houses of parliament. There will be a piece of paper which has a title as an Act and which simply says 'Schedule 1 of the Freedom of Information Bill 1983'-that is what it will be at the rate we are going-'is hereby amended to remove such and such a body from schedule 1', or whatever it happens to be. On that basis the position taken by those of us who agree with a schedule 1 type of exemption for the intelligence and security agencies and the position that the Attorney-General has put forward this evening are not that far apart. Therefore, I think it is within the bounds of possibility that some reasonable accommodation could be made between the two positions without this matter being pushed all the way to a vote and presumably a Bill coming back from the House of Representatives which seeks the reconsideration of that same point. Basically the Attorney is saying that in certain cases he accepts the principle of affirmative action. He has a concern about the way in which we handle security and intelligence organisations. Senator Harradine and I have both said that we share that concern. On that basis I do not believe that there is any reason for assuming that we cannot work out a reasonable compromise to accommodate both positions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to support what Senator Puplick has said. If it gives any consolation to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) I too do not see any way in which we can delete the security agencies from the schedule. I do not think it is likely that that will happen. I will go one step further than Senator Puplick and say that one possible compromise to this situation could be to create three schedules and have the first schedule containing the security agencies which can be altered by Act of Parliament. I do not know what Senator Puplick thinks about that, but I see no problem. There is a certain sensitivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot see that an Act of Parliament is any different from an affirmative resolution except that it involves more paperwork and requires three reading stages. A motion is a little more simple and would be debated and then passed. If a party had a majority in both houses of parliament a motion or Bill concerning the security organisations could be passed. I do not follow the Attorney's concern in that an Act of Parliament is necessary in these cases. However, if he wished that course to be followed in this case I would not mind. But in other cases we do not want to add to the cumbersomeness of the procedure by requiring the passing of an Act when the same can be achieved by passing a motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I agree that this is not a very serious or basic matter. The amendment provides for a simpler mechanism instead of a more complicated one. That seems to be its merit. It provides, as previous speakers have said, all the safeguards that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) requires. I support the idea that Senator Missen has mentioned of a third schedule so that in some way there could be some control over security organisations. The Minister has said-I will flag out my view on this matter at this stage-that in the Government's view security organisations should at all times be exempt. I think I am quoting him fairly. This raises the point as to whether, in a healthy and democratic society, security organisations should at all times and in every possible respect of their operation-I refer to finance, organisation and other things-be exempt. In other words, should we have a kind of gestapo which is above and beyond the law? I use those words with prejudgment. I suggest to the Attorney that that is what he is advocating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe, and the Australian Democrats believe, that anything that affects the national security should be exempt. There should be absolutely no question about that matter, and we raise no question about it. For heavens sake, the lesson of this world that we all ought to have learnt is that all over the world we find repeated cases of security organisations which, through no fault of their own, have been created along the lines that the Attorney has suggested and which have not filled the requirements of the society that created them. That has happened because they were exempt from any kind of criticism, any kind of check from the Parliament or any other authority in the land. I suggest that they have attracted unsavoury elements-people who act above and beyond the law. Time and again we have seen examples from all over the world of financial discrepancies and illegalities which I do not believe a healthy society should have. I repeat that national security aspects should be absolutely exempt. I do not think that it is difficult to see that this happens. Very clear definitions could be laid down in the third schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will lean over backwards to see that they protect security organisations as far as possible. To give support to an organisation which might expend funds dishonestly, which might exert an improper influence on ordinary law-abiding citizens and which might flagrantly break the law is wrong. I say that in the interests of the security organisations. I would have thought that a security organisation to which these kinds of safeguards are available would be a stronger and better one and that the people running it would have more strength to hand to deal with people of unsavoury attitudes who-it could be purely accidental-have been brought into the organisation. Perhaps they were a plant of another government. Of course, we cannot expect the people who run our security organisations to have universal wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> There may well be a situation where other people in society can warn the nation of some problem. Why completely cut out that option? Why take the view that in no aspect whatsoever of any security organisation can this legislation apply?</PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Attorney to look at that view. We are not putting forward the view in order to attack or impede the operations of security organisations, but rather to help them in their operations and to create a situation where a healthy democratic society applauds them and sees them as being responsible to it through its elected representatives. In that way they will be assisted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps because of my background I am determined that security and intelligence organisations should remain exempt from freedom of information legislation. There is a necessity for controlling these organisations but the proposed Freedom of Information Act is certainly not the way to do so. What we are really talking about is how bodies get on the exempt list and how they get off it. As I understand the attitude of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), he wishes to see bodies removed from that list only by Act of Parliament, but he accepts the addition of bodies to that list by regulation followed by an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs put forward this device of a regulation, followed by an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament, we were trying to streamline procedures. What we felt was most important was that both additions and deletions should be considered by both houses of parliament. They should not be slipped through by regulation which was considered only by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which had different terms of reference and was generally an unsuitable body. We wanted both Houses of Parliament to direct their attention to any additions and deletions from this list of exempt bodies. If we wish to change that-we were trying to be helpful to the Government in the suggestion-both additions and deletions should be done by amending the principal Act. Certainly, that would be more cumbersome but it would have exactly the same effect and require exactly the same majority as would be the case to do the same thing by affirmative resolution. I do not understand why we should take the security agencies out of the Schedule only by an Act of Parliament and add them on to it by regulation, followed by affirmative resolution. I can accept the Attorney's point of view that perhaps, if he wishes and is prepared to accept the encroachment into parliamentary time, this could be done only by an Act of Parliament. That, from our point of view, would make it much more difficult and much more cumbersome to get new organisations on the list. The Senate Committee was deeply suspicious of the fact that new organisations could be put on the list without a proper parliamentary decision. I do not think that many will be taken off the Schedule. I would not object to a change to the Schedule being carried out by an Act of Parliament. I would like to say, as a Government supporter-at the moment, temporarily, a rebel one-that what we are looking for in this is compromise. We have many important things which I am sure the Attorney-General is going to yield gracefuly on. I think we can at least on this issue go part of the way to meet his difficulties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We seem to have forgotten that the point we are debating is not the merit or otherwise of the exemption of the security agencies from the Schedule but rather simply the procedure by which agencies of all kinds are put on and taken off the Schedule. However, I am nothing if not a realist in these matters and it is obvious that attitudes to the exemption of security agencies are going to determine the way this chamber votes on this clause-whether or not, technically speaking, that is relevant. Accordingly, I think the way through this has been most neatly devised probably by what Senator Missen suggested, that is, that security agencies be treated separately either by way of a separate Schedule or a separate provision in the legislation and that their insertion in the legislation and their possible future removal from it be governed by the normal procedures which apply to amendments to an Act of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As irrational as I think the distinction is in this respect, it appears to be the kind of thing that would at least satisfy in the first instance the concern of those who are having difficulties about security agencies possibly being subject to more flexible procedures than other organisations. So for the sake of a quite life I would support the postponement of this clause to enable some provision to be drafted along those lines to make security agencies distinct from other classes of agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I do, however, maintain my strong support for the notion that agencies generally ought to be able to be both inserted in and excluded from the Schedule by way of an affirmative action procedure. Nothing I have heard from any speaker tonight dissuades me from that point of view. I think it is important to have a more technically flexible procedure to get organisations on and off the Schedule as occasions demand, simply because of the procedural reality that if something is embodied in an Act of Parliament and can be amended only by an Act of Parliament it is very largely for practical purposes, given the way government works, frozen. Legislative changes are subject to a whole series of procedures-departmental, Cabinet and otherwise-to which other forms of parliamentary procedures are not. I see it a welcome degree of flexibility so far as agencies generally are concerned if they could be put on and taken off the Schedule by means of this affirmative resolution procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, I am utterly unable to see how the system is put at risk. I am utterly unable to see how the Parliament in a fit of absent-mindedness, as it were, could accede to the removal or, for that matter, the insertion of an agency without really knowing what it was doing or appreciating the significance of its action. The only point that the Attorney seemed able to produce to justify his assertion that there is a dangerous degree of flexibility in this procedure was the motion that an affirmative resolution could be introduced sumultaneously into both Houses and that we would lose the consequential steps that are involved in legislation moving from one House to another which is the way our legislative process presently works. But does not the Attorney remember that all that really matters in the sequential process operating effectively simultaneously is whether one party has a majority in both Houses and, indeed, the disposition of both Houses to pass something quickly?</PARA>
<PARA> Has he forgotten all about the common informers legislation which was passed in response to the Webster case, I think in 1975? The Bill was introduced-I think it was drafted that afternoon-into the House of Representatives and it was out of the Senate literally within, I think, 53 minutes. That was the time it took for its progress from one House to the other. I might add that the superannuation Bill for parliamentarianss went through both Houses almost as quickly. So the notion of public interest being put at risk by the absence of the sequential move through both Houses is, with respect, palpable nonsense. What matters is that there be the requirement of affirmation by both Houses. I particularly do not like that in principle for other sorts of reasons but I am cheerfully willing to accede to it in this context andI think it is an ample safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other string the Attorney seems to have to his bow when we move beyond the defence area is that any such procedure is, as he put it, new fangled. It is not entirely newfangled because it has been used in other contexts and some of them have already been mentioned in debate. I suggest to adopt that view as a sort of conclusive knock-out blow in argument is to adopt Professor Cornford's notorious principle of the dangerous precedent which has as one of its corollaries the proposition that nothing should ever be done for the first time. I think it would be very dangerous if we were to adopt our approach to legislation and the desirability of legislation by reference to any such principle. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I support the postponement of this clause so that it can be amended in the way suggested by Senator Missen which is a separate treatment, irrational as I think that might be, for security agencies to be incorporated in the legislation in the first instance and only able to be taken out by legislative amendment but with the Committee proposed treatment of affirmative resolution being the mode of treatment applicable to all other forms of agencies. I hope that the Attorney in the spirit of compromise which seems to be endeavouring to move him a the moment will accept a way through it on that basis. </PARA>

He suggested that deletions from the Schedule ought to proceed by way of amendment through both Houses of Parliament. I can envisage the possibility, for example, of a Profumo type scandal surrounding the head of the security agency, public demand for information about that scandal and in the aura of that public demand the government of the day bring down regulations on the Monday and slamming them through both Houses of parliament simultaneously on the Tuesday, thus depriving the Parliament and the people of the checks and balances that are contained in the Standing Orders of both Houses.

If we are seeking to have deletions dealt with in this way, why not have additions dealt with in this way as well?

<PARA> '(iiB) a statement of particulars of the facilities, if any, provided by the agency for enabling members of the public to obtain physical access to the documents of the agency; and'. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that this amendment will cause as much concern to the Committee as some of the amendments to previous clauses and, no doubt, to many subsequent ones. What we are dealing with here is the establishment of practices whereby the rights which are conferred by this Bill, or the Act when it has passed through this Parliament, will operate in a context whereby official co-operation and assistance will ensure that those rights really will become real, concrete and effective. So, what clause 7 is about is trying to create a scheme whereby the public is given at the outset and without any reference to any request for a particular document, such information as will help the public to determine most conveniently and expeditiously what documents may be available and to take steps to contact the official within the organisation concerned to get hold of those particular documents. </PARA>
<PARA> What is envisaged is that the Commonwealth Government Directory will become the main vehicle whereby there shall be published by an agency statements concerning the organisation and functions of that agency, together with the various decision-making powers that are relevant to its operation and other powers which may affect members of the public. What we have attempted to do by this amendment is merely in conformity with the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal affairs. We have attempted to add some matters whereby the statements in the Commonwealth Government Directory might be expanded to enable a member of the public to identify more easily and to get hold of the documents to which that member of the public wants access. In particular, for example, we say that there should be within the Government Directory a note of those documents which are open to public access as a result of the operation of some other enactment, that is, some enactment other than the Freedom of Information Bill. We refer in particular to paragraph 11 (1) (b):</PARA>
<PARA> A document that is open to public access, as part of a public register or otherwise, in accordance with another enactment, where that access is subject to a fee or other charge. </PARA>
<PARA>We also say that the Government Directory should also list those documents that are available for purchase by the public in accordance with such arrangements as may be made by the agency. In other words, there should be listed not only those documents which may become available under the freedom of information legislation but also other documents to which the public ought to have access. We also add that there should be some indication of what physical arrangements might be made to enable a member of the public to obtain access. To take an obvious example, it might be indicated in the Directory that there are reading rooms available in certain situations where agencies could make the Directory and other documents available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and Senator Durack are to be commended on the additional clause 7 (1) (a) (iii) whereby in this new 1981 Freedom of Information Bill it is provided that there shall be published as soon as practicable:</PARA>
<PARA> a statement of any information that needs to be available to the public concerning particular procedures of the agency in relation to Part III, and particulars of the officer or officers to whom, and the place or places at which, initial inquiries concerning access to documents may be directed;</PARA>
<PARA>I recall that the Senate Committee was particularly concerned that some such paragraph should appear in the Bill and we are indeed gratified that it does so appear. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I need take up the time of the Committee by saying much more on this matter. As I say, it is very important that the public, before a particular request is made, has access to as much information as possible about how to approach the agency, about to whom to make the initial approach and to have some understanding of the documents within the agency's care or disposal. That is what our amendment seeks to do. It is entirely in conformity with the findings of the Senate Standing Committee. For that reason, I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

Therefore, the words that I have difficulty with are 'and whether by direct or indirect means'. If those words were deleted, I would see no difficulty with the amendment. I just do not know where we get to with the phrase 'by indirect means' relating to arrangements which exist for advice.

<PARA> (9) Page 7, clause 8, sub1clause (1), paragraph (a), line 40. insert after ''precedents'', including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, precedents in the nature of letters of advice providing information to bodies or persons outside the Commonwealth administration; or''</PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing with documents which an individual citizen will have access to and which will help him to understand the way in which the Commonwealth interprets the Acts, the regulations and the ordinances for which it is responsible for administering. Clearly, it is indicated in the existing clause 8 (1) that this is to include manuals or other documents containing interpretations, rules, guidelines, practices or precedents. It goes in to refer to documents containing particulars of such a scheme, not being particulars contained in an enactment as published apart from this legislation. This simply seeks to say that, where there have been statements made by the Commonwealth or by an agency of the Commonwealth which indicate the way in which the Commonwealth or the agency interprets the Act or regulation which is in question and that statement of how the Commonwealth or the agency interprets the matter in question was set by the Commonwealth or the agency to somebody outside the Commonwealth's administration, that should also be included in the material which is made available for public inspection and purchase. I hasten to add that I would not expect that this would be done in a way which would reveal the name of the person or persons outside the Commonwealth's administration to whom this explanation was made. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be perfectly easy to provide that the interpretation which has been given could be given in a way which does not say, for instance, that this was the interpretation which was addressed to me when I asked for an explanation of the interpretation, or was addressed to some body of lawyers or to anybody who made the request. I think it is simply saying that it ought to be possible to provide, within the overall administration, accessibility for members of the public to a document which purports to say: 'This is how the Commonwealth or the agency interprets this piece of legislation. This was advice given not within the bureaucracy by way of a printed manual, an instruction to officers or a directive from a Minister about an interpretation, but an interpretation which was made available to somebody outside and which is the precedent which is being followed'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that one can do that while protecting the confidentiality and the ananymity of the person to whom that advice was sent. That certainly is not part of the relative interest which any individual would have in ascertaining this advice. Otherwise it is not seeking to make a major addition to the document, because the document already states that practices or precedents should be made available. This simply refers to statements of precedent which are in the nature of letters or advice providing information-that is all it says-to persons or bodies outside the Commonwealth's administration. I would not see this as imposing a great burden, nor would I see it as a departure from any substantial practice in which the Government has previously engaged. It is the provision of information which, on previous occasions, has already gone to somebody outside the Commonwealth's administration which is now being sought by an individual or group also outside the Commonwealth's administration to allow him or them to get a clearer understanding of the intention and the interpretation of the Act. </PARA>

<PARA> (d) documents containing statements of the procedures to be followed in detecting or investigating breaches or evasions or possible breaches or evasions of such an enactment or of the law relating to such a scheme.''</PARA>
<PARA>Here again is the same sort of point. It seeks to spell out in some detail matters which may well have been implicit in what the current clause says. It is a question of an individual-perhaps I ought to avoid the use of the term 'citizen' because it does not apply just to a citizen; it applies to non-citizens-who goes to a Commonwealth department seeking information. He will be enabled to get hold of copies of manuals or documents we have previously been referring to in relation to the amendment I moved and which the Attorney-General accepted, and documents containing particulars of such a scheme, which is the existing clause 8 (1) (b). This goes on to say that if there are-there may well not be-documents which give a guide to the way in which the scheme or legislation is to be administered or to be enforced or there are documents which contain statements about procedures-I stress the word 'procedures'-to be followed in detecting breaches or possible breaches or evasions or possible evasions of the legislation in question, they should also be available to the inquiring individual. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate as far as breaches or evasions are concerned that procedures do not have to be in very great detail. They may well simply state the sort of things that have to be established in order to demonstrate or to prove that there has been a breach or evasion or a possible breach or evasion of an enactment of the law relating to such a scheme. This again goes to the process of spelling out in detail what material will be available for public inspection or purchase under the general heading of clause 8 (1). I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no problem with the addition of paragraph (c), which is in the same category as the earlier amendment which I agreed to of spelling out the detail, but I have real difficulties about the suggested paragraph (d), which refers to documents containing statements of the procedures to be followed in detecting or investigating breaches or evasions or possible breaches or evasions of such an enactment. It appears to me to be giving fairly clear signals to people who may be intending to try to evade. Having found out the intended manner of the administration, we tell them how we are going to detect or investigate breaches or evasions. I should have thought that that would give them signals as to how they might more successfully practice such evasion. There is a general exemption of documents in the law enforcement area, and this sort of document may fall within that category. If so the provision would become pointless. If it does not fall within that exemption-I have not given close thought to whether it may fall within some other area-it just seems to offer an unnecessary risk. Why we would want to give statements to people about how we intended to detect or investigate breaches or evasions I cannot imagine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the Attorney-General's concern is that new paragraph (d) is to be read in conjunction with clause 32, which provides for an exemption in relation to law enforcement and public safety documents. A substantial measure of that exemption is to be retained, even under the amendments to it which have been circulated. Proposed new paragraph (d) is cast as broadly as it is because it is clearly desired to bring within the scope of prima facie availability police standing orders and police manuals of the kind which traditionally have governed such things as the police use of firearms, arrest procedures, and search and surveillance and interrogation procedures-the kinds of things which have always been part of the armoury of the courts in most jurisdictions of Australia, in determining the traditional operation of the judges' rules, the admissibility of evidence, the exercise of the court's discretion in regard to admissibility and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not talking here about an unfamiliar body of material. It is merely the ordinary material which basically governs the exercise of police investigative and arrest powers. A very strong argument has been articulated, especially by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its criminal investigation report of 1975, for making this material available-as indeed it is in many jurisdictions. I am not sure of the precise position in the Australian Capital Territory insofar as the Australian Federal Police are concerned. There has been an extraordinary sensitivity on the part of some police forces in regard to making this sort of material available. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the amendment is moved against the background of clause 32, which is sufficiently precise, and will remain so, to exempt material which embodies procedures of a sophisticated kind that one would not wish to fall into the hands of potential law breakers. I refer to complicated evasion detection techniques of the kind that are operated by the Taxation Office and the more involved techniques used by the fraud squads of our police forces. These, quite reasonably, might be regarded as properly exempt. They would be covered by the language of clause 32. Therefore, I do not believe that the Attorney-General need worry about the effect of proposed new paragraph (d), provided clause 32 remains in a reasonable rigorous form. I ask him to accept the amendment on that basis. It brings clearly within the scope of the basic Bill a great deal of police manual type material which ought to be available to the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pursue the point just made by Senator Evans and I would be grateful if the Attorney-General would explain his difficulty with the proposed amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept for one minute the soothing propositions presented by Senator Evans. If one examines clause 32 one finds that it deals with documents which prejudice the conduct of an investigation of an offence, or possible offence, against the law; or disclose the existence of a source of information in relation to the enforcement of law-presumably when an offence has been committed. Those provisions deal with documents which concern the investigation of an offence that has occurred. The breadth of proposed new paragraph (d) is such as to embrace cases involving not just the police area but, more importantly, the tax and social security area, especially the former. One would be required to show the procedures to be followed in detecting or investigating breaches or evasions, or possible breaches or evasions. In other words, one would have to signal to potential tax evaders the methods and procedures that were to be adopted in detecting them. We have heard a lot from Senator Evans about tax evasion, although I might say that this Government has taken more action in that regard than has any Labor government. The proposed amendment would take us into a very dangerous field; I do not know where we might end up. My fear as to where we might be going with this sounds all sorts of warning signals in my mind and makes me take the stand that I do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that Senator Evans' example about documents concerning criminal investigation procedures has anything to do with the proposed provision. His example concerned the exercise of police powers of arrest, interrogation and so on. The proposed provision is much wider than that. It signals the contents of what I would think should be very confidential documents in regard to taxation and social security in particular, and doubtless police activities as well. In short, I believe that that way useful information could be provided to criminals and potential criminals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, may I suggest that if this impasse with regard to proposed new paragraph (d) persists, paragraphs (c) and paragraph (d) should be the subject of separate questions. Secondly, I would like to test the Attorney's objections to proposed new paragraph (d) against the test of clause 32 (2) (a) and 32 (2) (c). Clause 32 (2) provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act, would, or could reasonably be expected to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) prejudice the carrying on generally of investigations concerning breaches or evasions of the law;</PARA>

<PARA> disclose lawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or dealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law the disclosure of which, would, or would be reasonably likely to, prejudice the effectiveness of those methods or procedures;</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 32(2) (c) is not to be the subject of any proposed amendment during this debate. Therefore, we have clearly an overriding exemption which is not the subject of dispute between the Committee and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) or indeed at this stage between anybody and the Attorney-General and which in effect, I believe, takes care of those matters that the Attorney-General is concerned about, which concern I share. It takes care of those matters which could, be presented in a manual or in a way which would enable a potential law breaker or a potential tax evader to say: 'These are the procedures to be used by the agency which relate specifically to how it would detect a breach or evasion of the law or a possible breach or evasion of the law'. </PARA>
<PARA> The wording of clause 32(2) (c) seems to me to be fairly precise-that a document is exempt if it discloses lawful methods or procedures the aim of which is preventing, detecting or investigating breaches or evasions of the law or deals with matters arising out of breaches or evasions of the law where the disclosure of that information would or, even further, would be reasonably likely to prejudice the effectiveness of those methods or procedures. I am interested as to whether the Attorney-General believes that proposed new paragraph (d) would in fact not be regarded as totally subservient to the specific exemption provisions of clause 32(2) (c) which I believe takes up the concerns that the Attorney-General has about the prior disclosure of methods for investigating breaches or evasions of the law or possible breaches or evasions of the law which-I share his concern-one would not want to make public in advance. </PARA>

I think the Attorney-General has a point here. The words 'statements of procedures to be followed' could be read as a specific in a particular case, whereas the words 'documents describing procedures to be followed' indicate not a particular but a generality. I think that is really what Senator Evans was looking for. It is my suggestion that we should ask the Attorney-General whether he would consider some reframing of this proposed amendment which would come closer to his view.

I hope that he will be prepared to reconsider his position in the light of having that drawn to his attention. But should he still be minded to be a bit nervous about this proposed new paragraph in its present form, he might also be prepared to consider not so much the linguistic change which I think Senator Mason was hinting at, but an acceptance of proposed new paragraph (d) with the deletion of the words 'detecting or' in line two so that it will simply read:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I think on reflection the expression 'detecting' does have a wider reach than is strictly necessary to focus on the sorts of documents which I, for one, want to see disclosed as a basic rule under this clause, namely, police manuals and standing orders of the Victorian Brown Bomber kind-that notoriously secret volume-and its federal equivalents. They are the sorts of things at which I think this is clearly directed. I would be happy if that investigative focus was retained in proposed new paragraph (d) rather than the possible wider language which is there at the moment. I repeat: This is really an unnecessary accommodation of the Attorney-General's nervousness because it would appear that clause 32 (2) (c), which nobody wants to amend, would operate as a perfect safeguard against the dangers that he foresees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was seeking to accommodate Senator Mason's suggestion. The point was made that a document which contains a statement of the procedures may well, in fact, be a document dealing with particularities of a procedure. In other words, it may deal with the way in which an investigation in proceeding whereas describing the procedures describes not any particularities but rather a generality of procedure to be followed in terms of dealing with cases that fall within one class or description. I was seeking to accommodate what Senator Evans raised on the question of detecting or investigating. I understand that to relate to much to the same point, that is, that the actual process of detecting may relate very specifically to a case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Alternatively, there can be a difference between the processes of detecting breaches or evasions of the law or such a scheme whereas the procedures in investigating the breaches or evasions or possible breaches or evasions goes to the point that Senator Evans raised at an earlier stage about precisely what sort of documents we are seeking to have exposed under sub-clause (d). They are essentially statements about common rules and procedures which people involved in investigating breaches or possible breaches or evasions of enactments are normally constrained by or normally operate under. </PARA>

The meaning could even go further, I suggest, to include documents describing the general procedures. This again gets away from the specific point. But the Attorney does not see the difference between the amended version and the original wording. I think that would merely strengthen that point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (11) Page 8, clause 8, sub-clause (2), paragraph (c), lines 10 to 13, leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph,</PARA>
<PARA> '(c) not later than 3 months after the publication of the statement under paragraph (b) and thereafter at intervals of not more than 3 months, cause to be published in the Gazette statements bringing up to date the information contained in the previous statement or statements.'</PARA>
<PARA>The current provision, which the amendment seeks to leave out, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . during the year commencing on 1 January next following the publication of the statement under paragraph (b) and . . . during each succeeding year, cause to be published in the Gazette statements bringing up to date the information contained in the previous statement or statements. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the amendment seeks to change from 12 months to three months the period after which the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph must be updated. The preceding paragraph provides that the principal officer of an agency shall:</PARA>
<PARA> not later than 12 months after the commencement of this Part, cause to be published in the Gazette a statement (which may take the form of an index) specifying the documents of which copies are, at the time of preparation of the statement, so available and the place or places where copies may be inspected and may be purchased . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, an agency no later than 12 months after the Act comes into operation, shall cause to be published in the Gazette a statement about the documents which that agency holds and which are available for inspection. The Bill as it stands states essentially that there ought to be an update on that basis every 12 months. The proposed amendment states that instead an update ought to be published in the Gazette every three months simply saying what has happened in the course of the three months to the published index as it appeared originally under the terms of clause 8(2)(b). That will allow people a more contemporaneous access to information and a greater ability to keep themselves informed of changes which agencies are making in the preparation and presentation of documents for public inspection. I commend the clause to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not prepared to accede to the amendment moved by Senator Puplick, because of its resource implications. The fact of the matter is that a tremendous amount of information is to be provided in accordance with the provisions of clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill. I have agreed to amendments which spell out, and which in fact may add to, the information that is produced. As I have said, I think they are in the spirit of clauses 7 and 8, but they do require a great deal of information to be provided about the operations of agencies. They will impose very considerable obligations on agencies, departments and authorities. A great deal of work will be required to bring them into operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said on many occasions both in this chamber and outside it, that the Government is particularly concerned, especially at this time, with the additional resources that may be required to meet the obligations it will have under this legislation. The obligations have been proposed at a time when the Public Service has assumed many additional obligations in the shape of administrative appeals, Ombudsman's procedures and so on. Therefore I think a reasonable balance has to be struck. In the light of Government policy the resources of the Public Service will not be expanded, and in fact will be reduced overall. A greater burden will thereby be imposed on it in trying to satisfy its obligations under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for the publication of documents in the nature of manuals and so forth which set out a great deal of information. It provides that during each succeeding year commencing on 1 January following the publication of a statement in the Government Gazette, information will be provided in the Gazette bringing that statement up to date. The amendment seeks to go further to require that the statement be updated at intervals of not more than three months. Four times the amount of work provided in the Bill is required by the amendment. It requires the updating to be done four times every year instead of once every year. I think that is taking the matter too far. To expect agencies to do that is to place too great an obligation upon them. For that reason, and for that reason alone, the Government is not prepared to accept this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that there are other amendments in the same category. The Government has given a great deal of attention to the whole question of the strain on resources which will be presented by this legislation. I regret to say that the Government has considered and is not prepared to accept at this stage any amendments which appear significantly to add to those resource implications. In the future, when we have had the opportunity of seeing what sorts of demands are made and what sorts of resources have to be assigned to administering this legislation, we may be prepared to consider these matters. But at this stage we are completely in the dark as to what will be the demands on the Public Service, with the very limited resources it will have to deal with these obligations. We believe that the only sensible course is to hasten slowly and to obtain experience in how the legislation works and what the demands are. When the legislation is reviewed, as we have agreed it should be reviewed in three years' time, in the light of the experience we have had a different view may well be taken of suggestions such as those contained in this amendment. At this stage and in view of the great uncertainties that we face in relation to the administration of this legislation the Government is not prepared to accept additional burdens of this kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the present resource crisis in the Commonwealth Public Service is not of the sole making of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), although he does assume some part of the collective responsibility of the Cabinet for it. I have no wish, as a result, to add further to the strain upon his blood pressure by putting him in a situation, or contributing to putting him in a situation, where another amendment has to be resisted unto the death. But can the Attorney see the problem which exists with respect to this kind of clause? It relates only to manuals of internal law, those very detailed interpretive provisions which are crucial in the administration of social service payments and a whole variety of areas of government activity, particularly in the service area. Can he not see that, to the extent that significant changes or amendments are made in those internal law procedures and to the extent that those changes or amendments are not visible and available to the person who is on the receiving end of them, there are problems which remain to be resolved in this area? He cannot see very much at all at the moment because he is absorbed in a conversation with another Minister. Perhaps I should wait until he can devote some attention to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Chaney contributed constructively to this debate rather than getting in the way of progress on it, we might get somewhere. I am asking for some consideration of a possible alternative approach to this matter which will not involve going as far as the Committee wanted to go when it wrote its report in 1978-79, and that is to write in some explicit provision so as to require an agency to make available on request any amendments that have been passed to the internal law procedures when someone comes to the counter requiring access to those manuals of internal law. I am saying that what is involved here is not a statutory obligation to update a gazette of a kind which would presumably involve the mobilisation of resources on a large scale, but simply some procedure whereby when someone is seeking access to an internal manual his or her attention is drawn to significant or substantive amendments which have occurred to it since the last update. I think that would solve the practical problem that the Committee was concerned about without perhaps going as far as this amendment goes in requiring a three monthly major quarterly rewrite and gazettal, which may well impose additional resource constraints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Attorney-General has been able to absorb that proposition maybe he would be prepared in a spirit of conciliation to allow his overworked officers to look at the possibility of a modification to the existing clause 8 to accommodate that situation. It may well be that the Bill when read as a whole could be regarded as including amendments of this kind in the kind of documents that should be made available, but what I am talking about is some specific reference in this clause to an obligation when a manual of this kind is being sought to make available amendments which may have occurred since the manual was last prepared. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Select Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in considering these matters, was conscious of the fact that resource implications were matters which greatly concerned the Government, and probably concern it even more at this time. We were of the view that it was desirable that there should be regular updating of these manuals so that they would have current relevance for people who were seeking information. It was for that reason that, despite the fact that in many other areas we compromised on proposals because of the resource implications, we still felt that this was desirable because of the need for having an up to date series of manuals. I appreciate the view which the Attorney-General takes of this matter and that this question has probably become, if anything, more extreme. I draw attention to the fact that when the Government responded last year to the Committee's recommendations the Attorney-General's response to this recommendation stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not accepted. Clause 7 as presently drafted does not preclude agencies from updating indexes at more frequent intervals than 12 months if it is reasonable and efficient to do so. The Government would encourage agencies to update indexes in cases where there have been significant changes in practice. </PARA>
<PARA>There were encouragements in that which I do not think the Attorney has mentioned tonight but which were contained in the Government's response. It is true that there could be intervals of less than one year under the provision. If in fact it continues to be the Government's intention to encourage agencies to do so, particularly where there have been significant changes of practice in those areas, I think that information ought to be available to people. If there are minor changes and so forth, one can understand why agencies ought not to be put to quite so much of a demand. Whilst I think this would have been desirable, I for one would not want to press this matter to a vote in the light of the resource implications. But I would like to know from the Attorney whether this continues to be the situation so far as the policy of the Government is concerned?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too, would not wish to see this amendment pressed. I accept the concerns of the Attorney-General about resource implications, but I think he has overstated them in a way. Issuing amendments quarterly certainly is not four times the work of issuing them annually. It is only a matter of the collating of what has accumulated in the previous quarter. It is a publications problem, but it is not really such an enormous additional load on resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I would like from the Attorney, if I can get it, is a statement that the Government accepts the importance of these sorts of documents being kept properly up to date. The Bill looked at as a whole may not require the agency to draw attention to any document issued which is actively misleading. If, for instance, procedures had been totally changed since the document was issued and someone reading the document would be totally misinformed about the nature of the procedure, if the Bill as a whole does not require an agency to correct that-not necessarily by promulgation in a gazette but merely by a note inserted in the document, because I do not think the document could reasonably countenance the issue of misleading information-and if the Attorney would give an assurance that he would look at it to see whether any modification of it was necessary, I certainly would not press the amendment at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to resile from statements I made in relation to this matter in response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I would have thought that it was really without question that if any amendment to a particular manual that a person was seeking would be pointed out to him when it was given to him. It would seem to me to be just ordinary common sense that that would occur. I do not know whether I could give an assurance that that would be done. That would be going somewhat far as to what an individual public servant may do in a particular situation. But I would certainly wish it to be made known as far as any advice, direction or training being given to public servants administering this legislation is concerned. That is the sort of thing we would tell them that they ought to do if they did not have enough sense to do it, which I would expect them to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no problem whatever in making that statement. Certainly we can undertake to give that advice. I would hope that people would abide by it. I think it would be unnecessary to have an amendment to cover that situation. I would hope that people would follow it. If they do not, and in our experience we find that this request is not being followed, it may be that when the matter comes up for review a more specific obligation should be imposed. I think at this stage it is quite unnecessary to require a particular amendment to cover it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General might think it is unnecessary, but I suspect that he will take that view about many things which are proposed for the Bill. I would like to see some specific language of the kind I have suggested. I would ask that further consideration of clause 8 be postponed to enable that language to be drafted by me or by us in the first instance, if the Attorney would prefer it that way. If he does not want it to be a burden on his officers over the weekend, so be it. But a hortatory provision of that kind would be consistent with the approach that has been adopted elsewhere in this part of the Bill. I think the Attorney ought to acknowledge that a significant retraction of position is being offered in a conciliatory fashion by honourable senators. Maybe he ought to be willing to respond at least to that extent to enable some consideration to be given to an appropriate small amendment obliging officers to make available amendments in conjunction with manuals when they are available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (12) Pages 8 and 9, clause 8, sub-clauses (5) to (7), lines 25 to 44 (p. 8), lines 1 and 2 (p. 9), leave out the sub-clauses. </PARA>
<PARA>The sub-clauses to be left out are 5, 6, and 7 which enable the Minister-in this case the Attorney-General-to consult the Minister responsible for a particular agency and to waive, by ministerial discretion, the requirement that otherwise exists in clause 8 that a statement be published in the Gazette by each agency not later than 12 months after the commencement of this part, specifying the documents of which copies are, at the time of preparation of the statement, so available and the place or places where copies may be inspected and purchased. It further goes on to allow the Minister to give an exemption to an agency from compliance with that 12 month requirement where he believes:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . complete compliance with this section in respect of those documents would impose on the agency such a workload as would unreasonably divert its resources from its other operation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I said in relation to the previous clause that I was quite prepared to concede the Attorney's point on resource implications as far as three months was concerned. My colleagues, Senator Missen and Senator Hamer, made the same point. Had that proposal been put to a vote, undoubtedly it would have been negatived. We were not pressing the three month requirement. Indeed we would not press that three month requirement or any other formal requirement to that part of the clause because of what the Attorney-General has said about resource implications, which I accept. This is a horse of a somewhat different colour. One of the critical parts of the Freedom of Information Bill is the preparation and public availability of a description, by each agency covered by the Bill, of what documents they have available for public inspection and public purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is to be believed in relation to a Bill that has been knocking around for as many years as this old chestnut has, that competent permanent heads and Ministers and agencies have started to put in hand the process of the preparation of this document, or that they will not have some time between the passage of the Bill in the Parliament and the eventual proclamation of the Bill to get their collective act together. Surely it is within the resources, strained as they may be, of departments and agencies of the Commonwealth Government to be able to prepare within a 12 month period a statement about the documents that are available for public inspection and public purchase. I believe that 12 months is a reasonable period given, as I have said, that this has been around as part of the legislation since its inception. This proposition has been around for four, five or six years. Agencies ought to be in a position to comply with this legislation almost as soon as its proclamation takes effect. This Bill provides that they must comply within 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> These catch-all clauses provide that the Attorney may, in consultation with the Minister responsible for the agency, waive that 12 month period if special circumstances applicable to that agency are laid before him. I cannot conceive of special circumstances existing, given the time that all this business has been in train. But I can conceive the situation in which agencies either because of incompetence or by being deliberately dilatory in preparing these manuals, will go to the Attorney shortly before the 12 months period expires and spin out the usual yarn about why the requirements of the Parliament cannot be complied with, and why it is that the Attorney should specifically make an exemption for them. Undoubtedly they will come to the Attorney two or three days before the deadline with that sort of request. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes on to provide that if complete compliance with this section is not possible, once again the Attorney may, in consultation with the Minister responsible for the agency, make some arrangement to waive the requirement. Sub-clause 7 is a minor matter in that respect. It simply provides that where exemptions under this part have been given, then under section 58-that is the reporting clauses of the Bill-the Minister shall cause that information to be made available to the public. Given the fact that this Bill has been around for a long time and agencies have been on notice for many years about this requirement, given the fact that it will not come into effect even at the time of proclamation, and that there may be a delay between passage and proclamation-one remembers the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in which some time occurred between the passage of the Bill and its proclamation-and given that it is a further 12 months down the track, one is looking at a situation where one can say: 'Here is a possibility that an agency with four or five years notice of this requirement, with a time delay between passage and proclamation, and with 12 months tacked on to that for good measure, should be able to go to an Attorney-General and say that it wants an exemption from this requirement of the Act.' I put it to the Attorney that that is simply unreasonable from the point of view of the parliament and from the point of view of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that these clauses are justified given those three substantial areas of time delay, given the clear warning that departments have had and given the fact that they will get an extra 12 months. It may be that the Attorney will say that they will not be used by him, but my belief is that if we provide a loophole through which an agency may drive a cart and horse the temptation is very great for it to get on that cart and horse and start preparing to drive through that loophole at an appropriate time. These amendments simply seek to take out of the Bill the possibility that that situation might be arrived at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with everything that Senator Puplick has said. I will add two very small matters. In addition to these things, if we look at the terms that are provided in these clauses we see that the Minister is enabled, in the first place, to specify extended time. Periods can be reasonably extended by reason of special circumstances applicable to the agency. One can imagine that there always will be special circumstances applicable to every agency. There will always be something different. It will not be difficult at all to find that there is always something whereby an agency can justify such a claim. The legislation does not specify what the circumstances shall be. It just says that the circumstances will be special. It is up to the Minister to make up his mind about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From my reading of the clause, I understand that these are not matters which can be appealed against to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. They do not come within the provisions of clause 45. They are not matters therefore that can in any way be challenged. There is a provision in clause 6 for the Minister, if satisfied, to direct changes to the circumstances. The Committee will note that this provision applies to the case in which there is such a work load as would unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from other operations. One can imagine how extremely wide that provision is. In any agency there could be a diversion of resources which it thinks is unreasonable and which it convinces the Minister is unreasonable. The Minister can then give permission for an extension and nobody can do anything about it. These clauses in their present terms alone, apart from what Senator Puplick has said, are such that they provide many opportunities for people to avoid giving information which the public may require. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has read much of Franz Kafka. I feel somebody who has had something to do with this Bill has because anyone who has read The Castle would see, I would think from a reading of these clauses, that there has been an attempt to devise something of a fiendish intricacy which is designed to baffle the unfortunate inquirer as much as possible. We will find more of these devices as we go through the Bill, but this is the first classic case of a Kafkaesque situation. I think it is almost a joke that this kind of legislation should have been put forward seriously to this Parliament in a Bill which is called the Freedom of Information Bill. I think this cannot be castigated in any lesser terms than that. The Democrats will indeed vote for the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is strongly opposed to this amendment. I may not have read much of Franz Kafka but I have read Alice in Wonderland and the longer this debate goes on the more familiar that scene appears to me. The total air of unreality in which this Committee seems to be approaching many of these problems is beginning to worry me greatly. It does not appear to me that honourable senators who are taking an interest in this debate have really grasped the significance of the obligations that are being assumed under clauses 7 and 8 of this Bill. In some agencies enormous amounts of material have to be collected; we should not forget that this has to be collected and published accurately. If this material were not accurate it would be worse to provide it to the people than not to provide it. Also the wrath of Heaven will be brought down upon the agencies, I imagine, if there are any inaccuracies at all. It seems to be assumed by many people that we live in some sort of perfect world in which some people, not senators of course, have got to be perfect at all times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So a major obligation of a very serious kind is being imposed on the Public Service by this legislation. The position is that we have identified that the task, in some agencies, will be a really of quite Herculean proportions. The legislation contains object clauses. Requests can be made for statutory exultations to be made on the Public Service about how it is to approach these things and so on. I have no reason to doubt that the Public Service will approach them very seriously. The Government has a very major responsibility to the Parliament and to the people to make this legislation work effectively once it is passed. As I have said, a major task has to be undertaken. We have already identified that some agencies will find this much more difficult than others. </PARA>
<PARA> One agency that already is in the public arena is that Taxation Office. It is estimated that no fewer the 250 man years will be involved in performing this task. It is not just a matter of keeping up tax manuals for one year; the manuals have to be kept up for many past years as well. Two hundred and fifty man years will be involved at a time when the Taxation Office is being asked by everybody-and we are all very concerned about this-to pursue the activities of a large number of tax avoiders. However, this amendment to the legislation proposes to take senior people in the Taxation Office-from their real job, a major job, and to engage them in preparing these manuals. Some 250 man years will be involved. It is not just something that can be left to junior officers. It is something that will have to be given close attention by many senior officers. It is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of these clauses is to cover a situation of that kind where it has become virtually impossible except with quite unacceptable diversion of resources, even if that is the case, to meet this obligation. The sub-clauses that are now proposed to be deleted have been inserted simply and solely to cover that situation. It is a judgment which can be made only at the Executive level. The judgment will be made at the Executive level by the Minister who is responsible for administering the legislation and no doubt the decision will be made after serious consultation, I expect, not only with the Minister in charge of the agency concerned but also probably with other Ministers as well. If a decision is made the Minister will have to defend his position in the Parliament. That is why the provisions are in the legislation and that is why as far as the Government is concerned it wants them to remain there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of the freedom of information legislation is littered with exaggerated claims made by executive agencies and those speaking on their behalf about the implications of this legislation for the performance of their ordinary functions. I need only remind the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) lest he has forgotten, of the estimate that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs received from, for example, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs about the anticipated usage of the legislation. It said something over 100,000 requests would be made a year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirteen times the rate of the whole of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service, as Senator Missen points out. The Committee was given an anticipated usage of the legislation by the Australian Electoral Office, of all places, of 86,000 requests a year which when examined by the Committee proved to be based on the quite bizarre calculation that about 1 per cent of Australian electors would in any year be expected not just to make an inquiry of the Electoral Office but to make a formal freedom of information inquiry under the legislation. And so it went on. We derived numerous illustrations from United States experience about initial exaggerated claims on resource implications and the dollar cost of them. Certainly, the Attorney cannot expect us to be absolutely flayed to the ground by the horror of his assertion about the 250 man years involved in relation to the Taxation Office unless he brings into this chamber to support that kind of assertion a very detailed statement to persuade us just exactly how he has reached that kind of figure in the context of the point that is here at issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, in the Australian Taxation Office there are an enormous number of guideline documents governing interpretations in a number of pieces of very complex legislation. But surely, it cannot be otherwise than the case that those manuals and guidelines are kept up to date. In the overwhelming majority of cases within the Taxation Office, it becomes simply a matter of collation and publication rather than the heroic exercise in historical research that the Attorney seems to regard as being contemplated. I simply make the point that although it is late and the Attorney is getting grumpy-I can understand his anguish at the way in which this debate is proceeding-he cannot expect us to accept at face value enormously far-reaching clauses of the kind that are here contained simply on the basis--</PARA>

To the extent that this is something that any common, rational legislator would regard as being obviously a legitimate loophole for a harassed Executive, why were these clauses not in the original 1978 Bill? What particular flash of lightning has overcome the Executive in the last three years since it spent the previous six years working up the 1978 Bill which has produced this particular far-ranging exemption? What is it, other than a bolt hole through which the Attorney and the rest of the Ministry-the whole Executive, in fact-can rush in order to exempt themselves from the requirement of producing the manuals and guideline documents that are in issue? The ministerial discretions here are absolute; they are not subject, as Senator Missen has said, to any kind of independent scrutiny by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or by anyone else. I am prepared to acknowledge that there will be pressures in particular departments by the flexibility that is already built into the language of this whole Part II of the Bill and, in particular clause 8, ought to be sufficient to accommodate the reasonable concerns of every department and agency in question. So it was thought by all those who drafted the Bill after very careful consideration in 1978 and so, too, it ought to be thought now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>In statements to the House of Representatives on 20 November 1979 and 10 September 1980, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced Government decisions on the recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report 'Privacy and the census' which was tabled by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on 15 November 1979. The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Census and Statistics Act 1905 to incorporate those decisions which are required for the conduct of the 1981 population census. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission noted that the secrecy provisions of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 was defective in that it did not apply to persons who had ceased to be officers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics; as the term 'officer' was not defined in the Act it was not clear that the census collectors were bound by the secrecy provision, and a penalty of $100 for a breach of the secrecy provision seemed hardly appropriate either as a deterrent, or an affirmation of the importance of the principle of confidentiality. As an affirmation of the importance of the principle of confidentiality, the Government is moving to close the defects that have been identified and to substantially upgrade the penalty for unauthorised disclosure. In addition, penalties for all other offences under the Act are also being substantially upgraded to reflect both current values and the seriousness with which these offences are viewed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also amends certain machinery matters relating to the conduct of the population census. It authorises the following two administrative procedures, which were recommended by the Law Reform Commission: Firstly, the use of a special sealed envelope by persons wishing to maintain the privacy of their census schedule by by-passing the census collector; and, secondly, the mailing back of census schedules to the Bureau of Statistics if the usual personal collection by a census collector is, for some reasons, not effective. These procedures will help preserve the essential privacy of personal details collected in the census. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Customs Amendment (Tenders) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to provide a legislation basis for the allocation by tender of import tariff quotas on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. The Bill is part of a legislative package. The other Bills in this package are the Customs Securities (Penalties) Bill and the Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Bill. The decision to allocate this quota by tender follows the Government's in principle acceptance of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation as contained in its report No. 240 of 30 April 1980 entitled 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear'. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1982, a seven-year assistance program for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries will come into operation. It will include two forms of tariff quota to be known as base quota and tender quota. Base quota will entitle importers with established import performance to annual allocations based on 85 per cent of an initially established quota ceiling. Generally, once determined, the ceiling of quota available to base quota holders will not vary during the seven-year program. </PARA>
<PARA> Tender quota comprises the remainder of annual quota ceilings. Tender quota will be alocated to persons who submit successful tenders. The proportion of goods allocated by tender may be increased according to a liberalisation factor and market growth, which will be determined annually following consideration of a report by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Advisory Committee. Tender quota entitlements and duty rates will be determined each year following the evaluation of tenders. Persons wishing to continue to acquire tender quota will still be required to submit tenders each year. The Government considers that this tender system will provide a greater degree of flexibility within the quota regime, and will permit easier access to quota imports by new importers, and importers wishing to expand their market shares.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the formulation of schemes by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Tenders will be called for and dealt with annually pursuant to these schemes. To discourage frivolous bidding, tenders will not be accepted unless accompanied by a written undertaking to the effect that, if successful, a tenderer will import all of the import quota allocated to him under the scheme. Consistent with the administration of import tariff quota generally, provision has been made for the approved transfer of all or part of the tender quota to another person. Such a transfer would acquit the undertaking by the transferor to the extent of the amount transferred. However, the obligation to import that amount will be passed on to the transferee who must give a corresponding undertaking before the transfer will be approved. </PARA>
<PARA> The other parts of the legislative package provide for the imposition of penalties in cases where a successful tenderer does not give a security for compliance with his undertaking, when required to do so, or if he subsequently breaches the undertaking. The Bill contains a provision to amend section 42 of the Customs Act to enable the Customs to require and take the appropriate securities for payment of any penalty that may be incurred by reason of a breach of an undertaking. The Bill also makes provision for the determination of two of the factors relevant to the amount of penalty which may be imposed under the other two Bills. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Securities (Penalties) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a penalty for a refusal or failure to give certain securities to the Customs when required to do so in relation to the importation into Australia of certain tariff quota goods. This Bill forms part of a package of Bills designed to give effect to the Government's decision to allocate by way of a tender scheme, a proportion of the import tariff quota available on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. If a tender furnished pursuant to the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981 is accepted it will be necessary for the successful tenderer, if required by Customs, to give a security that may be applied as a penalty if the undertaking given under that proposed Act is breached. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is designed to discourage persons from submitting frivolous tenders. Such tenders would operate to the disadvantage of genuine tenderers if they influenced the tender duty rate. Undue delays in determining tender duty rates and quota entitlements which resulted from frivolous tenders would make it difficult for genuine tenderers to vary their overseas orders and still fully utilise their tender quota within the quota period. The penalty payable under this Bill will be equivalent to the penalty that would be payable under the proposed Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Act 1981 for a total breach of an undertaking given pursuant to the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of penalties for breaches of undertakings required to be given under the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981. This Bill forms part of a package of Bills designed to give effect to the Government's decision to allocate by way of a tender scheme a proportion of the import tariff quota available on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an essential element of this tender scheme that the import tariff quota offered by tender should be fully utilised. Successful tenderers should not be able to restrict imports through under-utilisation of tender quota. Such action could increase the scarcity value of quota goods and could cause shortages in the local market. This Bill provides for the imposition of a penalty where a person, who has given an undertaking to import tender quota goods under the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981 and has been allocated a specified quantity or value, does not fully utilise his tender quota allocation. Any penalty payable will be proportionate to the quantity or value of tender quota goods not imported. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>This Bill has two essential purposes. Firstly, specific purpose grants to government and non-government schools in the States and the Northern Territory, which are administered by the Schools Commission, are adjusted for cost increases and the Bill authorises this in respect of 1980 and 1981. Secondly, prior to the last election, the Government made a number of commitments both to extend programs and to introduce new programs and this Bill gives effect to those commitments, the details of which I shall give later in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1979 will finalise the adjustment of 1980 grants. The additional grants in respect of the increase in the cost of the salary and wage content of recurrent grants will involve a further appropriation of $7.3m. The amendment of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1980 provides for an adjustment of $27.7m for 1981 programs. Included also is provision for the new programs. These programs are designed to provide a higher level of assistance to those areas which have been identified as having the greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> As the first stage of the Government's commitment to provide over three years a total of $25m for capital grants for new places in non-government schools throughout Australia, $7.4m will be made available in 1981 under the legislation before the Senate. This is in conformity with the Government's resolve to ensure an equality of opportunity and freedom of choice for all Australian school children and their parents. The legislation also provides funds for the first stage of the Government's undertaking to compress the existing levels of non-government schools, as defined by the Schools Commission, to three levels and to continue the linkage of non-government schools general recurrent funding to a percentage of government school running costs. The Government has undertaken to complete this process within the life of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> To give effect to the Government's announced promise to develop education programs for severely handicapped children, the Bill also makes provision for the introduction of a new scheme to facilitate the development of such programs in institutions or in the homes of severely handicapped children. This initiative follows the release of a report on the National Survey of Special Education undertaken for the Schools Commission by the Fred and Eleanor Schonell Education Research Centre, and is in addition to existing Commonwealth expenditure on the education of handicapped children amounting to $19.3m in 1981 under the Commonwealth Schools Commission's special education and integration programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Bill also implements a further election policy commitment for the introduction of a program to assist non-profit part-time ethnic schools. Under the program an annual maximum of $30 per head may be paid to these schools in respect of children undertaking approved supplementary community language and cultural education programs. The States Grants (School Assistance) Bill 1980 will again be adjusted for further cost increases later this year. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978. In accordance with established procedures, for current programs the Bill makes appropriate adjustments for movements in costs applicable to grants for tertiary education covered under the existing legislation. The grants were last adjusted in the Budget sittings in 1980. The adjustments to the grants for all sectors amount to an appropriation of $115m in respect of the years 1980 and 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill will provide for a deferral of an amount of $117,000 from the 1980 program of specified building projects in advanced education sector to the 1981 capital program for the same sector. The replacement of Schedule 7A, the 1980 capital programs, in this amendment, will also enable adjustments to be made to amounts in the Schedule which have been the subject of approved variations since the Schedule was enacted. The Bill will increase by $6,500 both the 1980 and 1981 grants in respect of contributions to the National Institute of Dramatic Art to provide for rental increases. The Bill will also provide for the transfer of portions of the 1981 recurrent, capital and equipment grants currently available in the principal Act for the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education-TCAE-to the University of Tasmania. The amendments implement agreed arrangements for the transfer of certain courses from the Mt Nelson campus of TCAE to the University of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will adjust the per capita rate applicable to grants for non-government business colleges to allow payment of full supplementation in respect of these grants. Anomalous wording in the principal Act currently precludes final adjustments to be made on a retrospective basis. The Bill will provide for minor technical amendments such as a revision of the definition of college purposes in clause 5 and the definition of full time students in sub-clauses 6 (2) and (3) in the principal Act. These minor amendments do not alter the intention of the original provisions. The Bill will also introduce a transitional provision to recognise the repeal of the State legislation which established the Victorian Institute of Colleges and State College of Victoria systems. Responsibility for those systems is now vested in the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 March this year, in speaking to the apple and pear legislation I made a plea on behalf of the apple and pear growers in South Australia that they be granted a representative on the Board of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. In that debate, I quoted from a letter which I received from Mr Lockier, who is the Manager of the Corporation in South Australia. I quote again the extract which I quoted on that occasion. In part he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A meeting of the President of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association and the Chief Executive Officer with the Minister of Primary Industry on 28th January last resulted in the Minister's agreement to increase the grower representation on the Corporation from four to six providing all states agree. </PARA>
<PARA> Our members are concerned that 'State representation' cannot be written into the legislation which does mean that a future Minister could appoint two persons from one State at the expense of another State. </PARA>
<PARA> We have notified the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association that we agree to the Minister's offer to increase members representing growers on the Corporation from four to six provided not more than one such member is appointed from each State. </PARA>
<PARA>At the conclusion of my remarks, I said that I hoped that, when the time came for new appointments to the Board, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) would take cognisance of the suggestion to increase grower representation from four to six and that Queensland and South Australia would be represented. There was an interjection from my South Australian colleague Senator Young who said: 'Hear, hear!' I take it from that that he agrees with the suggestion which I put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume, in reply, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry-</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Nixon-</PARA>
<PARA>has undertaken to re-examine the membership with a view to increasing the number of grower members from four to six, but on the basis that the selection would remain with the Minister and would not necessarily be on a State basis. The increased membership from four to six possibly may give a capacity to respond in ways which the honourable senator has indicated would be desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>On 5 May-that is this week-Mr Nixon put out a Press release headed 'Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Membership and Funding Arrangements' which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Peter Nixon, said today the number of grower members on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation would be increased from four to six, and the maximum rates of levies on apples and pears would be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon said the changes were being made following recommendations to the Government by the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government has accepted the Association's view that the different needs of the industry among the States require a broader representation of growers on the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Therefore, the Government will appoint two additional grower members to serve for the remainder of the Corporation's current term, which ends in August 1983. The Government's intention is to have the new members appointed in time to assist in the marketing of the 1982 harvest.'</PARA>
<PARA>I make the plea to Senator Messner, who represents the Minister in this chamber, to note, as I said on 10 March, when I was supported by Senator Young, the appointment of these two extra representatives to the Corporation which the Minister has decided upon-and I thank him for that decision-and to give due cognisance to the fact that we in South Australia need one of those two places on the Corporation so that our apple and pear growers in South Australian can have a voice. The Press release goes on to state a few other things. It its not a very long Press release. I seek leave of the Senate to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN APPLE AND PEAR CORPORATION MEMBERSHIP AND FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA>The Minsiter for Primary Industry, Mr Peter Nixon, said today the number of grower members on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation would be increased from four to six, and the maximum rates of levies on apples and pears would be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon said the changes were being made following recommendations to the Government by the Australian Apple and Pear Grower's Association. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Nixon said changes in the maximum rates of levies would be made to enable the industry, should it so wish, to support greater activity by the Corporation in domestic promotion and other programs that it undertakes to assist the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The new maximum rate for fresh apples and pears sold for the domestic market and for export is to be doubled to 12 cents a box. Maximum rates of levy for fruit sold in Australia for juicing and processing are to rise to $1.50 a tonne and $3.60 a tonne respectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The Randall Report on the Australian Wool Industry was published in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) Costing of the Australian Wool Industries Conference 1972 Proposals It is understood that the AWIC prepared estimates of some of the financial requirements of an integrated wool marketing system, but decided against their publication. A search of current departmental records, prompted by the question, has failed to reveal any detailed costing of the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) See (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The AWIC, which has since ceased to exist, was not a Government body.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (c) Cost/Benefit Assessment of the Yennora Wool Centre The Australian Wool Board received two feasibility studies on the Yennora Wool Centre. One was undertaken by the Lend Lease Corporation and one by the P.E. Consulting Group. These studies were commercial working documents and not published by the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (d) Financial Accounts of the Australian Wheat Board Under the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1968 and similar earlier legislation, the Australian Wheat Board was not required to present an annual report to Parliament. However, it did publish annual reports in which it provided a financial statement on each season's pool as it was finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> The Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1974 required the Australian Wheat Board, commencing with the 1974-75 season, to prepare for presentation to the Parliament a report on its operations during the year ended 30 November, together with financial statements in such form as the Minister for Finance approved and the report of the Auditor-General on those statements. These requirements have been continued under the Wheat Marketing Act of 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> The latest report of the Board for the year ended 30 November 1979 was tabled in the House on 25 February 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (e) Price of Wheat Sold to China The question appears to relate to the disclosure by the Australian Wheat Board of the prices at which it makes sales overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board is given sole responsibility under Commonwealth and complementary State legislation for the marketing of Australia's wheat crop. In exercising that responsibility the Board operates on a commercial basis as an independent trading organisation. In line with normal commercial practice, and often at the request of the buyer, the Board does not make public the prices at which its sales are made.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (f) Chinese Communications on Resumption of Wheat Trade 1971 In response to a question in Parliament in 1975 (Hansard 7 October 1975, page 1798) it was stated that the then Prime Minister in April 1971 confirmed that his Government had received a report that a Chinese official had indicated to a British representative that China would not place any further wheat orders with Australia because of the attitude of the then Australian Government to China. The reply to the question also stated it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to release any communication on this matter involving the confidence of another Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. In the current financial year welfare funds made available to the States and the Northern Territory increased by 4 per cent over 1979-80 funding to $285m. The grants component has been increased very considerably in the last two years compared with earlier years when almost all funds were provided as repayable advances. State authorities providing rental housing and home loans have internal surpluses and revolving funds available, as well as Commonwealth funds. The State Governments also may provide extra funding from their general purpose payments if they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Decisions on welfare housing funding must be taken in the context of the Government's overall economic policy. A key element of this strategy has been restraints placed on Commonwealth Government expenditure. However it is misleading to simply compare funds provided year by year by the Commonwealth under specific welfare housing arrangements. Policies introduced in the 1978 Agreement have ensured a more effective use of available funds. Furthermore, there has been a considerably increased grant component of Commonwealth assistance for the program in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The 1978 Housing Agreement introduced changes in welfare housing policy designed to ensure as far as practicable that assistance is provided only to people in need and for the period of their need. Rents for public housing are determined by the States having regard to rents on the open market and rental rebates are available to assist people not able to afford those rents. This provision avoids hardship but also results in a fair rent being paid by those who can afford to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The comment referred to was made in relation to proposed funding under the proposed 1981 Housing Agreement due to come into operation for five years from 1 July 1981. It does not acknowledge that the $200m per year guaranteed by the Commonwealth is a base level amount only. The Government has made it clear that total funding is to be determined each year in the Budget context. The comment also ignores other sources of welfare housing funds including those mentioned in (1) above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honouarable senator's question: (1) The article to which the honourable senator refers stated that the Program of Aids for Disabled People was being developed with the aim of commencement on 1 April 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) &amp; (b) The Program did not commence on the original target date of 1 April 1981 because of unforseen administrative problems which arose in negotiations concerning its operation. These negotiations are proceeding urgently, and the program will commence as soon as practicable. The initial appropriation of $700,000 relates to the period 1 April-30 June 1981. In accordance with usual practice, unspent monies from the annual appropriation will revert to consolidated revenue at the conclusion of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. However, it is the Government's intention that information concerning this new program be disseminated prior to its commencement.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Appropriation for this program in respect of 1981-82 will be determined in the context of the 1981-82 Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 March 1981 (Hansard, page 711) Senator Bonner asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Communications to the proposed introduction of cable television. While I agree that this will be a valuable asset to the community. I seek an assurance from the Minister that adequate controls will be built into the system to prevent it from being used to exploit pornography and thus ensure that there will not be any further erosion of the social and moral fabric of our society.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has received 170 submissions to its inquiry into Cable and Subscription Television Services, several of which expressed concern about the possibility of pornographic material being carried by medium of cable. The Tribunal has advised that the matter will receive close consideration under paragraph (9) of the Terms of Reference to the inquiry-i.e. whether any private operators of cable television systems that might be permitted should be subject to licencing, ownership and control and other regulatory requirements of the kind that apply to commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations, or alternatively whether other provisions should be made in relation to these matters.</PARA>
