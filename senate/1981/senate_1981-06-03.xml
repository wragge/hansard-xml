<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give thanks to the Senate for its consent. My question relates to the closure, apparently, of King's Hall to visitors yesterday following the eviction of demonstrators in the early afternoon. In the evening some constituents of mine, including a Mr Paul Marshall and a Mr Rick Whyte, along with other people, were refused access to the House by security attendants, even though, they told me, they had tickets for booked seats to watch the proceedings of Parliament from the public galleries. Subsequent inquiries by my office suggest that all visitors, whether they be lobby groups, tourists or constituents with appointments to see their elected representatives, may have been refused access to King's Hall. I ask whether this is so. If so, was it at the direction of yourself and Mr Speaker? Even allowing for the eviction of the demonstrators early in the day, would you agree, sir, that this appears to breach the right of our citizens to meet with their representatives and the right of senators and members to speak with their constituents in that place? Can the Presiding Officers establish a guideline regarding access to King's Hall after eviction of demonstrators that will not deny access to others who have had nothing to do with such demonstrations? I ask, if indeed there is some restriction on visitors to King's Hall, how long will that continue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the circumstances which prevailed yesterday and after the eviction of the demonstrators in King's Hall, King's Hall was closed to further visitors other than those who desired to meet an honourable senator or a member of the other place. The attendants on duty, I understand, were advised to contact the relevant member of the Parliament, whether a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. On checking with that member or senator that the person was known to him or her and that the member of Parliament desired to meet the person, it was arranged that the member or senator to be visited would go down to meet the visitor. Unfortunately, I understand that in your case, Senator Mason, that was not done. You were not contacted. I regret that that happened. It was a mistake and was not in accordance with the instructions which the Security Co-ordinator had given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That all members of the Women's Services, 1939-45 War, qualify as ''Australian Soldier'' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian Forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies, making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and, according to Acts and Regulations of the period, the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicewomen available for service in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA> As those members of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Air Force of the 1939-45 War who were not sent to War Zones are granted loans, refusal to grant eligibility to all ex-servicewomen of the 1939-40 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I ask: Is the Government aware that any change in the price structure of the wine industry takes five years to adjust to? Grape growers and wine producers in South Australia estimate that a wine tax of 15 per cent would cost the industry $7m in lost revenue, would create further unemployment and would lead to financial hardships for the grape growers. Therefore, I ask the Minister whether an early statement can be made to refute the rumours of the imposition of a wine tax in the next Budget so that the wine industry can settle down to planning for future marketing.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not aware of the five year period that the honourable senator states it takes to adjust to any changes, but I am conscious that frequently representations are made by the industry.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, relates to a statement in the Tasmanian Press of Friday, 29 May, by Mr Adyg Rockliff, a former Australian prisoner of war of the Japanese, warning that he has only just been successfully treated for a worm infestation that he contracted during wartime imprisonment. He has been advised by medical specialists that 75 per cent of surviving prisoners of war may still be subject to the worm, which is known as strongyloides stercoralis. Apparently the significance of the worm's ability to spread throughout the body has only recently been appreciated. Worm larvae migrations cause skin rash, which is intensely itchy. Successful treatment has been very recent. Has the Minister received requests from the Tasmanian Returned Services League conference for a call-up of former prisoners of war for testing? Has his Department indicated that it would or would not conduct such a call-up? If so, will the Minister seek to contact all former prisoners of war of the Japanese and advise them of their possible need for treatment for the strongyloides worm?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Archer for his question on this very important matter, which came to light at the annual conference of the State branch of the Returned Services League in Tasmania last week. I have not yet received a request from the State branch of the RSL to call up all former prisoners of war as was suggested in the article. As to whether an assessment of everyone concerned should be arranged, that has not been considered by the Department as no request for that to be done has come forward. However, the Department is well aware of the condition and has brought it to the notice of departmental doctors and also the 9,320 general practitioners throughout Australia who act as local medical officers for the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department is also sponsoring a research project by Dr David Grove, senior lecturer in medicine at the University of Western Australia and a visiting specialist at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, in Perth, which is seeking to define the proportion of prisoners of war from Japan who still have infestation by the parasite, to simplify its diagnosis and to determine the efficacy of the form of treatment. The outcome of that project and the medical advice arising therefrom will be considered when they become available, and at that time consideration will be given to the need for further action. Of course that would include further publicity directed at ex-prisoners of war and to local medical officers. In the meantime it is suggested that any ex-POWs or any veterans who are concerned about this matter should discuss it with the local medical officer, or perhaps seek advice from the Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst it is not possible to commit the Government in advance to what might happen in a hypothetical situation, it is worth noting that the Budget Papers of succeeding years have indicated quite clearly the Government's record of support for the various facilities to which the honourable senator referred. It has been significant support. In earlier years I was involved in trying to help one of the women's refuges get under way. I think the record is there. The Government, over a number of years, has supported those centres for the benefit of the women who need them. The Government is concerned that the States should have the opportunity to take under their administrations those matters in the service area which they tend to do well. The Government is of the view that the States are likely to take up their responsibilities in a proper way, and we are working to that end.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to speak to the point of order. I think this is very important. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is not a legal authority to which the sub judice rule generally applies, but it has been accepted that when a matter is before the Commission we should do nothing to interfere with or aggravate it, as you have just said. This case, as Senator Bishop has said, is being considered at a conference being held today before arbitrators, who have been appointed by this Government under an Act of this Government, for the purpose of settling this matter. The questioner should ask his question and do nothing else to aggravate the position. The parties may be willing to reach a settlement of this case but, after such propaganda as we have heard today and after such aggravation, there may be no desire for settlement. The parties may well be inclined to reject any reasonable course for settlement. I suggest that, in the interests of getting the telephones working again and getting us back to harmony in industrial relations, the question should not be allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has raised a matter which I think is in the minds of many Australians who are concerned about the potential effects and, indeed, the effects already of the Telecom dispute. On the latest advice I have, the present situation is that the parties have been engaged in private conference in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I think it would be common ground around the chamber that we hope that progress is being made in that private conference. It is a fact that industrial disputes of this sort give rise to great public concern because of the potential damage they can do to individuals who might be affected. The honourable senator referred to some of the sorts of difficulties which can arise. In those circumstances, again I hope it would be common ground that either the parties will come to an agreement which is within the guidelines which have been laid down or they will submit to the processes of conciliation and arbitration which are available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to make is that it is inevitable that, when the public of Australia is subject to difficulty and to inconvenience because of an industrial dispute, questions are raised about the adequacy of the existing mechanisms, rules and so on which we have. Inevitably suggestions will be made for change and for improvement of them. It is scarcely surprising that, in the present climate and in the present context, suggestions of the sort made by the honourable senator should be put forward. I would say no more with respect to the particular suggestion than that I will see that it is drawn to the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations, when it can be considered in the cool and calm way in which these things do have to be considered. Indeed, we had complaints last night that the Government takes too long to consider some of these matters before acting, but I think it is a fact that the Government has shown that it is prepared to give very earnest and long consideration to suggestions of the sort raised by the honourable senator, rather than to move precipitately in an area and risk causing more difficulties.</PARA>

I make the point that responsibility for national economic policies flows from the Treasurer, through Cabinet, to the Prime Minister. What impact on Australia's economic growth would come from the democratic socialisation of industry, distribution and exchange as well as the establishment and development of public enterprises based on Federal, State and other forms of social ownership, to say nothing of the strategic social ownership of Australia's natural resources?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is clear evidence that the people of Australia and, indeed, business and commerce, when confronted with the threat of a government which may take steps within that kind of philosophy, refuse to invest, withdraw their funds and retreat from Australia. A classic example of that was the fall-the very rapid decline-in exploration for oil and minerals in Australia in the latter part of the period of office of the last government in Australia that professed democratic socialism. The fact of the matter is that the philosophy of democratic socialism is accepted by the majority of people as being based on an utter fallacy-that governments can do things better than people and that free enterprise is not the spirit of initiative but is something to be suppressed. For any political party today to pursue a philosophy which has been rejected out of hand and which has been proved wrong in this country and elsewhere is, of course, to fail to understand that it is a doctrine of disaster for the community and for the political party concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> As to the other parts of the question, the fact of the matter is that the Government is here to govern and to look to the interests of the people of Australia. Whether actions are taken by national or multinational companies, the Government's job is to see that the development of resources in Australia gives a true and fair share-a maximum share-to the people of Australia and that the return from the development of those resources by multinational or national corporations or others shall be a fair one. That is what we intend to do. This Government does not exist to govern for any self-interest. It governs in the interest of the Australian people. That is why, out of some 80 years of federation, governments of our philosophy have been returned for 60 years. For 60 years out of 80 years the people of Australia, who are the final jury, have said that the government that will govern in the interests of the people of Australia is a Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA> All the attempts to mouth attacks on us, to try to associate us with national or multinational organisations, are the essence of nonsense. When the Whitlam Government was in power it had opportunities to take actions. It did not do so. In fact, it brought about high inflation and loss of employment.

I pay tribute to the work that he has done, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, in relation to television services and standards which should apply. I have had my attention drawn to an article, and I take it that that is the article to which he refers. It is not the practice of government to outline specific Budget provisions prior to the presentation of the Treasurer's Budget statement in August. The honourable senator, as a senior member of the chamber, would know this and that I cannot offer comments on what any particular appropriations will be or are likely to be. However, I can observe that the Government has made some general decisions on the need to exercise restraint on overall expenditure and that means overall expenditure across all areas of government.

The trade union movement, when it conducts itself in authentic industrial activities, is a fine institution for Australia. But every trade unionist, in looking to his or her own self-interest, must ensure that he or she does not hold to hostage the rest of Australia to gain his or her own narrow ends.</PARA>
<PARA> The test is that a strike ought to be the weapon of last resort.

Of course I acknowledge the interest of Senator Bishop in this question and also Senator Elstob, both of whom have brought deputations to see me in connection with the union movement which is interested in this matter as well. The question of the service pension for merchant seamen is a new one and would necessitate a new policy proposal by the Government; therefore it is a matter for the Budget.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Basically two mechanisms are followed. One is that ever since the Fraser Government came to office each Minister has been required to write a letter to the Prime Minister-I think it is kept by the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Sir Geoffrey Yeend-disclosing to the Prime Minister particular assets and interests. That practice continues. The information is known to the Prime Minister and, I understand, to Sir Geoffrey Yeend. The Prime Minister is in possession of knowledge as to which Ministers have particular interests. Equally, it is the practice-I believe one that is totally observed-that, whenever a debate, whether at the primary stage or otherwise, takes place and a Minister taking part has an interest, that interest be declared. The responsibility to do so would be upon the Minister at any stage; the onus is upon the Minister to disclose his interest. In any case the interest would certainly have been disclosed in the material provided to the Prime Minister. As I understand it, when we implement the recommendations of the Bowen report, it will be the responsibility, subject to penalty, of not only any Minister but also any honourable member of the Parliament, to indicate an interest prior to speaking and voting, so that the world will know the situation. I believe that that would be a good state of affairs. If Senator Bishop has in mind a particular aspect that might be worth looking at, I would be very interested to know it. The Government is eager to draw up rules of ethics on this matter that will be as tight and practicable as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

Can the Minister confirm that the majority of the $6.7m that is to be spent on these projects will go to local and State government authorities and will not be spent in a way which will equip Aboriginal people with the skills to handle their own environmental health problems? For example, is the Minister aware that in the Malan community at Lake Gregory in Western Australia, the State Electricity Commission is to undertake the electrification of the bore although this is an area where it takes months to have a generator repaired?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's goal in funding this program-we have been asked to stop calling it the environmental health program; Professor Hollows has said that it might be better to call it an Aboriginal public health improvement program, and I think that there is some value in his suggestion-is to provide circumstances in which Aboriginal health can improve. That goal is advanced by providing clean water and waste disposal facilities. The question of Aboriginal training in a whole range of areas-the training of Aboriginal health workers or of Aboriginal communities in other skills-is, I submit to the honourable senater, a separate issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the projects listed can be carried out only by existing services-provided sometimes by local governments and sometimes by State governments. In some areas we have tried to have certain of these projects put in place by non-government contractors. To do so requires the use of heavy equipment and a considerable network on the ground. We have experienced great difficulty in that regard. I have no worry about asking State or local governments to help us put these projects in place. Our thrust towards Aboriginalisation, which was set out in the statement of last week, is particularly in the area of the direct provision of medical services. It is in the provision of Aboriginal medical services, or Aboriginal involvement in relation to other health services, that we are pressing now for greater Aboriginal participation. If, in fact, the only way to get water to a community in Western Australia is to use the Public Works Department of that State, it is in the interests of the Aboriginal community that we should do so. We will continue to pursue the goal of better health for Aboriginals. I take up the honourable senator's point that we must also pursue the goal of training in a whole range of areas, but I submit to her that that is separate from the issue of providing clean water and waste disposal.</PARA>

The trachoma program in which Professor Hollows was engaged is carried out by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists funded by the Commonwealth Department of Health.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was at the meeting. I am saying to honourable senators that some of the Press reports as to what went on at the meeting are not strictly accurate. I am delighted that Professor Hollows and Mr Briscoe withdrew their resignations from the health program because that will advance the provision of eye health for Aboriginal people. It was decided that further discussions should be held between those two gentlemen and me to try to resolve some of the other major issues raised at the meeting, which was in fact a very useful encounter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It became quite clear that similar goals are shared by the Prime Minister, by me, by Professor Hollows and by Mr Briscoe in several important areas and that there is considerable opportunity for co-operation in those areas. In particular, there was agreement that there is a need to advance the training of Aboriginal health workers. That relates somewhat to a question asked a moment ago by another honourable senator. I will be holding early consultations with my colleagues to try to advance that matter.</PARA>
<PARA> There was agreement that there is a need to adopt a co-ordinated program in dealing with outstations and I will be holding early discussions with Professor Hollows and Mr Briscoe on that. There was agreement that direct funding by the Commonwealth of Aboriginal medical services will continue. That has always been the intention, but it was made quite clear at the meeting. Indeed, I later confirmed it with Mrs Naomi Mayers, who is a representative of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. It was also made clear at that meeting that the Government was turning to the National Aboriginal Conference for formal advice on health, although it was made quite clear that it is up to the NAC whether it wishes to use NAIHO or any other body from which it seeks its advice. A decision as to whether NAIHO will have a role to play in advising the National Aboriginal Conference will have to await consultations between those two bodies.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that any further funding of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program will be a matter between the Commonwealth Department of Health and the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. I understand that the College has some proposals before the Department of Health and that the College will make its own arrangements in due course with Professor Hollows as to how any program will be conducted.</PARA>

At that time I undertook to get up to date information from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the regime currently in power in Bolivia has virtually abolished trade union rights. There is no right to strike and no collective bargaining. The activities of trade unions have been curtailed and their funds have been frozen. The regime has threatened a number of international labour organisations by arresting or mistreating their visiting representatives. Acts of violence against individual trade unionists have been reported by Amnesty International. Australia, along with many other countries, is a major contributor to a number of organisations in the United Nations system as well as to the regular budget. These funds are used for a wide range of activities including, for example, technical assistance programs to aid developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bolivia, Uruguay and Chile are among the beneficiaries of this assistance. The Government does not contemplate imposing sanctions against these countries. The Government has, both by direct representation to governments and in appropriate international forums, expressed its concern for violations of human rights wherever they occur and believes that considerations about sanctions are most appropriately and effectively dealt with within those forums. At the latest session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Australia supported a resolution appointing a special envoy to visit Bolivia. He will, we hope, report to the Commission, at its next session, on the human rights situation in that country.

<PARA> I draw attention, Mr President, to a segment on a television program entitled 11 AM which was shown on Channel 7 in Sydney on 26 May 1981 as an example of quite inadequate and inaccurate presentation which would continue to contribute to the public being misinformed on these issues. I had been advised some time before agreeing to be interviewed for this program that it was to be an opportunity to bring various areas of question up to date in the public's mind and I agreed to the interview on that basis. In that interview I answered quite frankly a number of questions and I had hoped that the import of my answers would receive proper coverage. What eventuated were selected statements from my interview, interspersed with comments particularly by Senator Chipp. I acknowledge his remarks to me earlier that, in fact, he did not know I was to appear on the program. </PARA>

The report concentrated on the progress of the epidemiological study and Senator Chipp stated his belief that the study will never be completed in time, that thousands of veterans cannot be traced and that there will not be an attempt to trace them. In addition, he implied that the Government has no concern for the veterans and to use his words is playing 'a trick of the worst kind of proportions' on them. I think that these implications are quite offensive. In all fairness, I consider that Senator Chipp's remarks on this occasion may be the result of fairly drastic selectivity by the program's producers.</PARA></TALK.START>

The last thing I want to do is to deny the Minister natural justice, but I remind you that he obtained permission to speak on the grounds that he had been misrepresented. He has made that point. If he now wishes to proceed, as he obviously intends to do, by stating the Government's position about where it has been unfairly attacked, certainly no one on this side of the chamber would refuse him leave to do that, provided the opportunity is given to honourable senators on this side to enter what would then be a debate on the issue and not simply a personal explanation about how the honourable senator has been allegedly misrepresented. Mr President, I put it to you that the decision is now up to the Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate. As far as I am concerned, either course of action would be suitable to us. But if the Minister proceeds now to justify the Government's stand, I think that fairness demands that honourable senators on this side of the chamber be given an equal opportunity to speak to the agent orange and Vietnam veterans questions.</PARA></TALK.START>

I referred to the establishment of an interim counselling service for Vietnam veterans and the additional treatment in urgent cases which was announced in January. I indicated that repatriation benefits are already being paid to some 6,500 Vietnam veterans and I emphasised the need for a continuation of liaison between the Government and the veterans' organisations. I referred to my impending visit to the United States to study at first hand the manner in which these issues are being addressed in that country.

I said that the pilot study results will not be made available publicly because they will not mean anything to the average person. This was not a reflection of my views on the capacity of the average person to comprehend the results. It was a reflection of scientific reality. As I have indicated many times the purpose of the pilot study is solely to test the methodology to be used in the epidemiological surveys. The numbers involved are insufficient to produce valid conclusions concerning the health effects claimed. If they were sufficient, there would be no need to undertake more than the pilot study. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and I thank Senator Carrick. I can understand Senator Carrick's reluctance to grant me leave. In fact, I have stated that if I were in his position I would be reluctant to grant leave. I was not aware that Senator Messner was asked to appear on the same television show or that his comments would be slotted in between mine, as they obviously were. I expressed great concern-and I did use these words-that the Government was using a trick of the worst kind on Vietnam veterans. It was for this reason: Recent research by two eminent Australian scientists, Selinger and Hall, had indicated that massive quantities of dioxin, of agent orange, were imported into Australia from 1970 to 1972. I was Minister for Customs at that time and I signed the papers. But that is another story. I have checked on the question and that is so. It is also crystal clear that massive quantities of the same chemical were used in Malaysia at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the whole basis of the Government's inquiry is to get a control group of veterans who served in Vietnam where defoliants, including dioxin, were being used and compare their health history and that of their children with that of another control group which allegedly had not been exposed to the same chemicals. Selinger and Hall have proved to my satisfaction and, I think, to all reasonable satisfaction, that it is now virtually impossible to get two different control groups so that a true comparison can be made. I pointed out that what the Government will have to do inevitably, in all good faith, in one year or in two, three, four or five years hence, is to say to the Vietnam veterans: 'Sorry, we couldn't get two separate control groups so as to prove anything'. Where I say that this is a trick of the worst kind is that the Government knows that now and it should not keep these veterans in some sort of hope that this inquiry will produce some form of justice for them. I believe the Government knows very well at this moment that the inquiry will prove absolutely nothing and that the Vietnam veterans will get absolutely nothing in the way of compensation. That is why I say that this is a trick of the worst kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now almost nine months since that massive petition for the restoration of the value of the family allowance was presented in the Senate. That petition was signed by over 22,000 citizens of Australia, most of whom came from Tasmania. Since then I have utilised every available opportunity to press the Government to restore the loss to value of the family allowance and to index it. Today is virtually the last opportunity I will have to speak on this matter in the Senate before the significant date of 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard this matter as one of the most important matters facing the Government, the Parliament and the country today. I would regard it as a reprehensible circumstance if the Government failed to take urgent action to remedy the situation so far as families are concerned. There is an expectation amongst families that the Government will do something. That expectation was aroused by the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the people of Australia two days before the election. I shall quote from an article appearing in the Australian of 16 October 1980 which was headed, 'Fraser pledges to give back petrol price rises as rebates or family allowances: OPEC increases will fund tax cuts: Prime Minister says priority to return money to the people'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In a dramatic bid to counter the vote-winning Labor pledge of cheap petrol, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, last night promised to return revenue from increased petrol prices next year to the public in the shape of tax cuts or higher family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not done that in respect of tax cuts. It ought to have done that so far as the family allowances are concerned. As a result of the increase in petrol prices this half year alone it will recoup an extra $170m into the Federal Treasury. This money is coming in the back door and it is not flowing out the front door, as promised by the Prime Minister. But the issue goes far deeper than that. Families throughout the length and breadth of Australia are disconcerted, dismayed and certainly are disappointed at the failure of the Government to rectify the situation. There is a growing realisation that the Government is not supportive of the family. Why is this so? It is because families now are very much aware that the family support systems have been savagely eroded by inflation which has jumped by 60.9 per cent since the family allowances were introduced in 1976. The burden has fallen heaviest on the one income family which now pays $493 more in income tax than the two income family paying tax at the rate of 32 cents in the dollar. The Government made much of its increase in the spouse rebate to $800, but of course this should now go to $1,293. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of tables which I will seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. I have shown these tables to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and to the Opposition Whip. As I understand it there is no problem about having them incorporated. The principal table has been prepared by the Parliamentary Library Service and it details the estimated amounts of the family allowance at each time if it had been subject to indexation on the same basis as pensions. The next table shows the loss incurred between family allowances currently paid and those which should have been applied had they been indexed on the same basis as pensions. The next table is a comparison of the old child endowment rebate scheme and the family allowances scheme. The next table shows the total amount of money saved by not indexing family allowances. The final table is the average amount of money lost per family by not indexing family allowances. Honourable senators will see, if I am granted leave, that the principal table was prepared by the Parliamentary Library and the others are ones that I have worked on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. From the tables it will be seen that in fact an average of $710 has been stolen from the purse of each Australian mother because of the failure of the Federal Government to ensure that the purchasing power of family allowances keeps pace with increased prices. By refusing to index family allowances the Government has pocketed a cool $1.5 billion since May 1976. This also is shown by the tables which I have incorporated. This year alone a mother of four children will be denied $657.80 to which she is justly entitled. As a matter of economic and social justice she should receive an extra $54.80 per month in family allowances. This, I remind the Senate, is on the most conservative calculation based on the outmoded formula used for the indexation of age pensions. But where will the Government find the money to make restitution to each Australian mother? I pose that question because it is the sort of question that is posed by the Government. The very reason this question arises is to be found in what happened in 1976. In that year the Government decided to pay direct to the mother the new family allowances with the money it saved by terminating the old child endowment scheme and by abolishing tax rebates for the children of taxpayers who generally were the fathers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In short, the 1976 exercise transferred money from the hip pocket to the purse. I certainly did not argue about that. Dutifully, the fathers in Australia did not complain about the fact that this occurred. Of course, the mothers were justly delighted. But I guarantee that had the taxpayers of this country realised what had occurred they would have had something to say about it. The Government, with great fanfare, declared that its new scheme was one of the most significant social advances in Australian political history. At the time I endorsed the new scheme but warned that unless it was indexed it could end up worse than the miserable scheme it replaced. I refer the Senate to the table which is entitled, 'Comparison of child endowment and family allowance schemes', a document prepared by the Parliamentary Library. From that document one will see that a family of four is now $352 per year worse off than it would have been had the old child endowment tax rebate scheme continued, the very scheme which the Government branded as hopelessly inadequate and which everyone else branded as hopelessly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must now surely be faced with the charge that it has played a massive confidence trick on Australian families. I appreciate that the Minister, Senator Chaney, has only recently been handed the portfolio of Minister for Social Security. I appreciate that the Minister, Senator Chaney, has had a long standing interest in this matter and indeed in the whole question of support for the family. The Minister, in a recent address to the Institute of Public Affairs, I think it was in Sydney, stressed the importance of the family and also its importance in respect of the care and nurture of young children and the care of the elderly and the sick. I do not wish the Minister to regard anything that I have said as a personal reflection on him because I know that he has a point of view on this matter. I hope when he speaks in the debate, that he gives some indication of the view strongly held by him. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise also that the decision in 1976 not only transferred money from the hip pocket to the purse but also assisted approximately 350,000 families which were not being assisted and which had not been able to claim under the old tax rebate scheme. They were, of course, receiving child endowment payments but they were not receiving anything under the old rebate scheme. However, to suggest that the families of Australia are being adequately treated is a nonsense. To suggest that because 10 per cent of Australian families in some way were brought into the scheme and that that will suffice them and the rest of Australian families for the next five years is a total irrelevancy. In fact, had the old rebate system been maintained, its value would have increased by some 81 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, justice delayed is justice denied. It is no good for the Government to think that just because it has got away with the abolition of tax rebates for children it can coolly pocket the money that it has saved. I remind the Senate that since May 1976 that figure would be in the vicinity of $1.5m. It is grossly unfair for the Government to complain of the social welfare expenditure cost of restoring the value of family support payments when it was responsible for transferring those payments from tax not collected and therefore not publicly noticed to the highly exposed welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's election promise of support for Australian families has not yet been honoured. I expected that something would be done resulting from the statement in the Governor-General's Speech to Parliament on 25 November 1980. We must bear in mind that the Government had been returned to office on the promise of the Prime Minister that he would support Australian families. The Governor-General's Speech, which of course was written by the Prime Minister, states at page 4 under the heading 'Caring for People':</PARA>
<PARA> In what I have said about unemployment, youth and the economy, I have stressed my Government's concern with the human dimensions of the issues involved. It believes that the only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology, not the strengthening of the state, but the effectiveness of that policy in enhancing the lives of people. This is the fundamental concern of my Government. This concern expresses itself in a diverse range of measures to which my Government is committed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It is evident in the commitment of my Government to a range of social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and through it the basic social fabric of this country. My Government has already introduced a number of measures designed to assist families. It will be looking closely at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian families are getting sick and tired of waiting for the Government to come up with some economic justice for them. I conclude by simply reminding the Government that, as I see it, this is the last opportunity, that I will have to address myself in the Senate in this session to this matter of vital importance to the people of Australia. I regard the functions of the Senate to be manifold. We have an expressive function and a representative function. I have sought to honour my obligations to my electors by expressing their viewpoint on this matter over the past many years, but particularly since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a matter on which I stood for election and was elected. I remind the Senate that in Franklin where I live, in my electorate, I received more votes than the Leader of the Liberal Party team and the leader of the Australian Labor Party team. The people of Tasmania understood this issue to be of vital importance, and I am sure the people of the rest of Australia understand it as such as well. A number of avenues are available to me in other States; there are avenues available to me in this Senate. As I mentioned, I have sought to exert the expressive function of the Senate; but the Senate also has other powers, and those powers include the audit and control powers and, if necessary, the blocking or deferment of money Bills. The Senate does not have the power to amend money Bills. I have not given any assurance to the Government, nor to anybody else, on the way I will vote after 1 July. I believe it is premature to do so. But I state again that unless the Government acts quickly on this matter to restore economic justice to Australian families it will create a reprehensible circumstance in which action will be required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has raised a matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Commonwealth Government to maintain economic justice for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter has been raised for debate in this place by many honourable senators including me. Indeed, occasionally it has been raised by Government senators during debates on Appropriation Bills. I realise that in the strict time limits imposed on us in debating matters of public importance we are all limited in what we can say on what is a massive subject. I am sure this is the reason Senator Harradine narrowed down his remarks so much. I would not like anyone to get the impression that I or anyone on the Opposition side believe that the basic cause of economic problems of Australian families today is the failure to index family allowances alone, although I admit that Senator Harradine made a passing reference to the level of the dependent spouse's rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of families in this country-I assume that by 'families' Senator Harradine means adults, unmarried children or dependent adults consisting a group-go far beyond the Government's reprehensible behaviour in failing to increase family allowances and certainly, I believe, will not be solved merely by increasing those family allowances to the level to which they would have been increased had they been indexed. The problem certainly will not be solved by increasing the dependent spouse's rebate to the extent that he said it should be increased. Before we talk about families and before we consider family policy in depth, we really have to look at the sorts of people and groups involved. We have to be aware of the fact that people at various stages of their lives pass in and out of various types of family situations. We must look at families as a whole. We certainly must not make the assumptions which are so often made in debates in this place about the distribution of incomes in those families. If we consider the family as only the group with a working male head, a dependent spouse and dependent children, I believe that we can end up creating policies which are unjust and inequitable in our society. I believe that those who would try to make our society, through policy, conform to some preconceived idea of what the family should be, misuse social policy in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Harradine has said, the Government is prone to trumpet the virtues of what it sees as its policies towards families and has made many claims about benefits that it has introduced to support the family. In fact, as the honourable senator also pointed out, the family, by anyone's definition, has suffered economic disadvantage in the last five or six years, not only because of the Government's failure to increase the family allowances, certainly not only because of its failure to increase satisfactorily the dependent spouse's rebate, but also because of its policy not to increase other allowances paid on behalf of children-particularly pensioners' children-to a sufficient level and its policy of keeping down the real wages of low income families particularly, and of cutting down assistance to families by way of expenditure on education, social and immigration services and housing especially. </PARA>
<PARA> All these things contribute to the economic distress of the family. All, and the problems that they produce, must be considered as a whole before we suggest that, just by increasing the family allowances in the manner suggested by Senator Harradine, we can solve all our problems. No one denies the basic fact of the economic decline of parents in the community. Where people differ is as to the best way to attack the problem and, bearing in mind the limited resources available, how best to order our priorities. I repeat: To do this we must look at the facts where we can and at those who are worst off, and take action initially to correct the problems of such people. I do not believe that we should suggest measures which are inadequate for the worst affected and largely irrelevant for those who are not affected at all-the high income earners-thus spreading our resources too thinly. That certainly does not mean that I accept the Government's view that what we can spend in areas such as this is severely restricted and that our economic ills are due to such expenditure. International comparisons, as I have pointed out in other debates, will demonstrate that the Government's claim that such expenditure, particularly social expenditure, contributes as much as it says it does, or even at all, to our economic ills is nonsense. I believe that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in recent speeches about taxation and the welfare system has shown that he is coming around to realising this. </PARA>
<PARA> First, we should look at some of the facts about those who may be worst off in the community. I have before me a table-no doubt many will be presented this afternoon-which has been reproduced at regular intervals by the statistical service of the Parliamentary Library. It relates to the Henderson poverty line, which is really the only recognised parameter that we have for comparing people's incomes and trying to define in some inadequate way, surely, the level of poverty experienced. That poverty line, as Professor Henderson described it when it was first produced, is a rather austere one. The table compares the poverty line with the disposable income of various family groups in the community and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. It is suitable for incorporation and I have shown it to the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA> In the foregoing tables Poverty Lines have been calculated for December Quarter 1980 and June Quarter 1981. As pensions and unemployment benefits are the rates applying from May 1981, Poverty Lines have been estimated for the June Quarter 1981 using the Average Weekly Earnings (seasonally adjusted) for December Quarter 1980 (the latest available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics) increased by the average percentage increase for the year 1980. The Average Weekly earnings for December Quarter 1980 is $278.40. The total increase during the year 1980 was 14.0 per cent. It has been assumed that the increase will therefore be 3.5 per cent each for March and June Quarters 1981. The figure of 298.20 for June Quarter 1981 is, therefore, only an estimate and subject to revision when final figures become available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about September 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table will be familar to people who have been interested in this subject. It was updated last year. It showed that all pensioner families, living on the pension only, were in fact below Professor Henderson's austere poverty line if they had one or more dependent children and that all single parent families with no income apart from the benefit, were well below the poverty line. I will not go through the figures to demonstrate that. The facts are well known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Low wage families are also having a difficult time. Two years ago a single family with three children, which earned $200 a week, was above the poverty line. Now it is $2 below. A single income family with five children which earns $240 a week is now $9 below the poverty line. A single parent pensioner with two children is $19.45 below the poverty line. A family whose breadwinner is unemployed and which has two children to support, is $12.40 below the poverty line. The unemployed family with four children to support is $36.70 below the poverty line. Certainly, the chief cause of their financial distress is the failure to raise the level of the family allowances which, as Senator Harradine has said, has been frozen since 1976, despite inflation totalling more than 60 per cent since that time. The value of the allowance-has dropped by more than half. These people are all below the poverty line and, despite other measures taken by the Government in the interim, their position has been deteriorating gradually. It is a situation that this Parliament should not tolerate and it certainly provides the reprehensible circumstances to which Senator Harradine has referred. </PARA>
<PARA> In studying the family income units of this country, it is worth while to look at the survey of family incomes made in late 1979 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It was then estimated that there was some 3,736,000-odd family units in the country. These were defined-as I defined them earlier-as comprising two or more persons living in a household consisting of a head and a spouse, if any, and any persons having the following relationships: Unmarried children of any age and any relations who were unmarried and had no dependent children in their care. The differences in income of the various income units are interesting. For the married couple income unit, of which there were some 3.3 million, the average income in those days was $15,000. For one parent income units, the average income was $7,320. For the single person income unit, of which there were 2 million, the average income was some $6,500. Of total income units which were dependent on benefits and not earning incomes, married couples made up 15 per cent; one person units, which included aged persons living alone and unemployed persons living alone, comprised 33 per cent. Single parent families comprised 48 per cent, or almost half of the group that was totally dependent on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The median total incomes of the groups in the community demonstrate other interesting points. A married couple with no dependants had a median income of $12,500. Married couples with one dependant had an income of $14,600. Married couples with two dependants had an income of $15,400. But when we come to the one parent family, those with only one child had a median income of $5,350. Those with two children had a median income of $5,330. This was lower than the income of the family with one child. </PARA>
<PARA> When we examine further the figures in this paper we find that the worst off are single parent families which are headed by a female. What we can see from the figures-there is no need to quote them further-is that those family groups which are by far the worst off in the community, are the single parent families which are dependent on the government for their income and the low income-usually single income-families of the community. Not only are they the worst off, but also many receive incomes that are below the poverty line. Many of them are in difficulty and have become even more so in the last five or six years. We must help and do something about supporting family structures, because a family, however it is structured, which is under economic stress tends to be under social and psychological stress; and problems within that family arise partly but largely out of its economic difficulties. When we try to help families we must look at what we have done in the past and at what is possible in the future. I believe we must try not to make the mistakes of the past which, as many people have demonstrated, have resulted so often in funds being spread too thinly or going in large quantities to the wrong people. We must look at some of the solutions that Senator Harradine has talked about and the way in which we should go about implementing them. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, family allowances are of utmost importance. They are a recognition, however inadequate, that there is a cost to parenthood. As Senator Harradine said, they replace the tax rebate which had previously replaced tax deductions. If they are a recognition of the fact that parenthood costs, we see that they are an inadequate recognition when we look at the amounts that are paid. For the first child a family gets $23.85, for the second child $34.05, for the third child $40.80, for the fourth child $40.80, and so on. I believe those payments should have been indexed. I have said in this place, along with many others, that they should be indexed. I have also said that under the Government's fiscal policy I could not see how they would be indexed, and we on this side predicted that they would not be indexed. If we indexed them and if that was all we did-if we brought them up to the level they should be at had they been indexed since 1976-what sorts of increases would be introduced? I suggest that we would introduce increases which would be inadequate for low income families. We would introduce increases which would be largely irrelevant to the very high income families and of marginal value to some of the middle income families. If we increased the payments to a reasonable level-I am certainly not going to define 'a reasonable level' in this situation-the cost would be high, but the income would be still spread across all levels of the community and, I suggest, the low income people and those on single incomes would still be in the same relative position as they are in now; that is, at the bottom of the barrel on an inadequate level of income. </PARA>

We certainly would not be giving justice to the low income family. I am not arguing against Senator Harradine's proposition. I am just saying that it seems to me that he thinks that would solve all the problems. I am suggesting that, under the Government's present economic stringencies and in the unlikely event that the Government would provide an adequate amount to families through family allowances-I think Senator Harradine and I have to accept that that is unlikely-we may have to look at further measures, such as the family income supplement scheme that I and others proposed before the last election, to correct the difficult problem of the low income families in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be done in all sorts of ways. I am merely putting that up as an alternative. We then have to look at other methods which have been suggested frequently in this place, one of which was adverted to by Senator Harradine; that is, increasing the dependent spouse rebate. The dependent spouse rebate goes to all who have dependent spouses, whether or not they have children. One of the difficulties with it is that it goes disproportionately to those on higher incomes in the community. Frequently they are people who have no necessity to work, which is another subject that Senator Harradine and I have spoken on in this place. I suggest that to use it as an anti-poverty measure will not succeed. To use it to keep people out of the work force will also not succeed in most cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe one of the main reasons that many women are in the work force is only partly to do with economics and is partly to do with social change. That is also another matter. I am not the only one who says that, and it is not only people on our side of the Parliament who say it. I noticed that Mr R. J. Tanner, a prominent member of the Liberal Party, a Sydney stock broker and a man who has many views on taxation, pointed out in the Canberra Times on 15 April that the dependent spouse rebate is a classic example of how a benefit is generally being claimed by the middle and higher income earner so that it is not helping the lower income earner but offsetting the progressive tax structure in a highly tangled and bureaucratic way. Time does not allow me to go into that in detail, but I commend people who use the proposition that the dependent spouse rebate in some way will overcome the economic problems of families, particularly families in need, to look at the problem more closely and to look at just where the dependent spouse rebate goes. In 1978-79 about 21 per cent of those receiving the dependent spouse rebate earned over $16,000 a year. It was in effect a transfer to families, which did not necessarily include children, whose income exceeded the median probably even for two-income families at that time. The rebate was not assisting the sorts of families which I believe Senator Harradine wishes to assist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance submitted by Senator Harradine in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Commonwealth Government to maintain economic justice for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>There being a speaker from the Opposition, a speaker in the form of the independent Senator Harradine and a speaker from the Government, it is useful to find some common ground between the three parties in agreeing that some additional emphasis on families is necessary. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his policy speech before the 1980 election, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief that the strength of Australia depends on the strength of Australian families. Our programs of family support will continue. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Harradine referred to a number of my speeches in which I had acknowledged the premier role of the family in Australian society and our need to ensure its good health. We went on in the 1980 statement to talk about a number of things that were needed for particular problem areas, including the fact that we would establish crisis accommodation for families in distress, the fact that we would initiate a new building program for homeless persons to help homeless youths in particular, and the fact that we would establish a national children's foundation to tackle the problems of child abuse. Those are particular matters which are perhaps outside the mainstream of the concerns expressed by Senator Harradine this afternoon. We find in the Governor-General's opening speech to this Parliament, when he set out the Government's program for the next three years, a quotation which again was referred to by Senator Harradine in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government has already introduced a number of measures to assist families. It will be looking at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a deal of common ground and a common commitment to the broad scope of the proposition which has been put forward by Senator Harradine, namely the need for additional emphasis to be given and for the emphasis to be perhaps swung back towards the family. In those terms I think we are commonly referring to families which have the care of dependent children. However, I think a valuable point was made by Senator Grimes when he pointed out that the matter of the welfare of Australian families is broader than the cash benefits which are provided by government to families. I think Senator Harradine, by interjection, indicated that in a broad sense he agreed with that also. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that most of the families with which we are concerned-forgetting for the moment those who are at the most needy end of the scale and I will touch on them a little later-are part of the working community. Indeed, as many as half of the families about whom we are concerned-those which are supporting children-have not one working parent but two working parents. To a substantial extent the material welfare of those families is dependent upon the work opportunities which are there, upon the continuance of a healthy economy and upon the growth of employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In those terms, the real increases which have taken place in employment over the last year and a half and the more recent decreases in employment rates, which show that the growth in employment is catching up with the greater employment take-up, are matters which also have direct relevance to the welfare of Australian families. I make no apology for the emphasis which the Government has placed on sound economic management and controlling inflation as these are matters which are intrinsic to the general welfare of Australian families. I think it is quite clear that the Government intends to retain that as one of its major concerns. I believe that most Australian families are equally as vitally concerned with that central theme of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A second point I make very briefly, because Senator Harradine has directed this specifically to economic matters, is that the welfare of families in Australia is often a matter not just of economics. There are other substantial problems affecting Australian families-I think Senator Harradine would agree with this proposition-which relate to other aspects of Australian society, some of which I am concerned about and some of which I am sure he is concerned about. Although one might argue that some cases, for example, those associated with marital breakdown, which severely affect the economic and social welfare of families, are related to economic pressures which government ought to be helping to relieve. It is also true that among families of substantial economic resources there are many examples of hardship-material, spiritual and social-which ought to be of concern to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to that because some of the Government's attention is directed to those areas through the Children's Services Program of family support which it is developing with State governments, still on a semi-experimental basis but on a basis which I think is directed at meeting the inability of so many modern families simply to cope and to be successfully functioning families. In addition, our support of the Institute of Family Studies mirrors a concern about that aspect of the situation of the family in Australia. I am not sure that the problems of families are any less in the areas that I have so quickly touched on than they are in the economic areas which are the main subject of the discussion this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be some common ground between Senator Harradine and Senator Grimes in placing considerable emphasis on the problems of one income families. At different points in their speeches they made the point that they saw one income families as being a group in particular need of assistance. I mention that matter again because I think it is important to read the tables which have been put into the Senate record by Senator Harradine bearing that in mind. The tables, in fact, cover the range of families, rich and poor. They relate principally to the shift in the tax system and the benefits system in terms of the totality of benefits which are paid to all families with respect to the dependent children in their care. </PARA>
<PARA> There are tables which compare the old tax deduction and the old child endowment with the present family allowance and the reduction in value in the family allowance, given that it has not been adjusted since 1976. That is the main thrust of these tables. As I said before, they apply to families both well off and not so well off. In terms of the single income families about whom so much concern has been expressed this afternoon, it is important to bring into balance the increase in the dependent spouse allowance which has occurred within the same period. With respect to that category of families one has to make a $400 adjustment to the total position of those families. I am referring now only to single income families and only to tax-paying families. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been adjustments other than indexation in that area. It is affecting a group of families which were claimed by both Senator Harradine and Senator Grimes to be of particular significance. I draw the attention of the Senate and readers of Senate Hansard to the fact that with respect to the last two tables incorporated by Senator Harradine one is entitled to take into account the additional assistance of $400 a year which has been achieved with the doubling of the spouse allowance and which will be further increased with indexation post 1 July. It is quite compatible with the information in those tables also to include with respect to single income families the adjustment of the doubling of the dependent spouse allowance which has occurred since 1976.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point that I think needs to be made about what Senator Harradine said is that he referred to the failure to adjust the family allowance in terms of the Government coolly pocketing the money. I simply want to put that comment in perspective by pointing out that right up to the current year the Commonwealth has continued to budget on a deficit basis. In other words, we are still expending moneys in excess of what is raised from the taxpayers of Australia. There is no peculiar pocket into which these moneys have gone. The fact is that general welfare expenditure of the Commonwealth has doubled in money terms since we took office and the expenditure of the Commonwealth has continued to outstrip the revenue raising of the Commonwealth. We are in a situation in which additional assistance to families is assistance which can come only from either increased revenues or savings which are achieved in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no escape from that fact, that simple truth, which members of the Opposition are able to avoid with a fair amount of success but which governments cannot avoid. In relation to the additional assistance which we are seeking to provide for families, and which is, of course, a Budget matter which has to be considered in the Budget context and on which any decisions taken will be announced in August when we resume for the spring session, it is a fact that any of the increased amounts which can be allocated or additional tax concessions which can be provided for families are matters which will affect the taxpayers of Australia. They will have to pay for the benefits where there is no other source for them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To suggest the money is being pocketed is to suggest that it is in some way being put away and is available to the Government. The fact is, as I have said before, that the Government is still in a position in which it is spending and paying more than it raises from taxpayers. I shall very quickly refer to the changes to assist families which have been made by the Government since it came into office. A good deal has already been said today about family allowances. The important change in 1976 was one which, I think, has been acknowledged in the debate that is, that the families at the bottom end of the income scale in Australia-those who are not taxpayers and those who are, therefore, not benefiting from the old system of tax deductions-were the substantial beneficiaries of the 1976 changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fair to say that those who would in the broadest terms be described as middle income had little change. They lost a tax deduction. They gained a benefit. For the mother there was a shift from the pocket to the purse as was put earlier in the debate. But for an estimated 300,000 poorer families there was a substantial increase in the benefit available to them because they had not previously benefited from the taxation arrangements. The estimate of the number of children benefiting from that change is 800,000. The drift in benefits or advantages to families was raised by Senator Harradine in a question not very long ago. In response to him, I said it was not true that all families had seen a reduction in their financial assistance position from before 1976 to the present. I suggested that the poorer families had, in fact, benefited in a way which still put them ahead of the position pre-1976. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the assistance for children in low income families in March 1976 as against March 1981. That table shows that in all but a very few circumstances the direct assistance provided by Government via the medium of the family allowance increased in real terms over the assistance which was available pre-March 1976. I am not suggesting that that table is the answer to the points which have been raised, but it relates to those families at the poorest end of Australian society, for which we are entitled to have particular concern. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already mentioned the changes in the tax arrangements. The other matter I wish to touch on very quickly is that we have made changes which affect families with special needs. These include increases in the handicapped child's allowance and in the orphan's pension. These have been adjusted on a number of occasions. Sole parents have been assisted. These were groups recognised as being in particular need. Sole parents have been assisted by providing benefits to male sole parents as well as to female sole parents, by extending health benefits to them and by removing the six-months waiting period for the Commonwealth benefit. In the last Budget, additional assistance was given to pensioners and beneficiaries who had to care for children. So there have been a number of things done to improve the position of the family. Broadly, the Government accepts that there is a need for greater provision for families and that is a matter we have under examination. (Extension of time granted). I thank the Opposition Whip for the courtesy of granting me an extension of time. I have been racing and I think I can finish within the five minutes which was suggested. I was trying to put before the Senate a number of special measures which have been taken by the Government over recent years to improve the position of families which are seen as being in particular need. I mentioned sole parents and Commonwealth pensioners and beneficiaries who over recent years have seen an increase in the total assistance provided for them by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to acknowledge the reality of a number of the remarks made by Senator Grimes. It is true that in looking at the totality of assistance which can be provided by the Government to families, there is a need to isolate those groups in the community which can be seen to be particularly in need of help. I believe it is part of the obligation of the Department of Social Security and of my Ministry to ensure that we do, wherever possible, identify those who, more than normal Australians, need the additional help of government. I make that comment in the context of the general commitment which the Government has made to examine the position of families and to see what can be done about families generally. This is a matter of balancing competing interests and demands upon the Government. We will endeavour to do that in as reasonable a way as we can. I am afraid that I am going to waste some of the extra time granted to me because, as I said, I raced to cover the points I wished to refer to, not realising that I would have the courtesy of an extension of time.

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill authorises the Commonwealth to enter into a five year agreement with each State and the Northern Territory for the provision of home purchase assistance and rental housing assistance. The operation of the agreement in each State requires the formal agreement of the State Minister. The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to pay advances and grants to the States and the Northern Territory for home ownership assistance to people not able to achieve it through the private market and for rental housing assistance for people who for various reasons are unable to obtain adequate accommodation themselves. This Agreement will be the latest in a series of housing agreements stretching back to 1945, but it is the first time that the Northern Territory will be a party to a housing agreement common to all States. The 1981 Agreement follows detailed negotiations between the Commonwealth, all the States and the Northern Territory and consideration of more than one hundred submissions received in response to the Commonwealth's request for suggestions from the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Through this legislation, the Commonwealth has firmly committed itself to the funding of welfare housing, but the Commonwealth will not interfere in the method of delivering the assistance which States are best able to assess, plan and provide. This reflects the Commonwealth's belief that the states know best their own needs. The Agreement before the Senate represents a continuation of, and in certain areas, an improvement on, the significant welfare housing reforms introduced by this Government in 1978. These reforms followed comments by authorities such as the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty which found that assistance for welfare housing was not always directed to those most in need. The Henderson inquiry found that many people living in subsidised welfare housing were not poor, and many of the poor were not in subsidised housing. The 1978 Agreement addressed these problems through measures such as market related rents combined with rental rebates and escalating interest rates on home purchase assistance loans. Those reforms were aimed at tailoring assistance to people in need for the period of their need. At the same time the Agreement gave the States increased flexibility to enable them to design programs to meet their own particular requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Bill further increases the flexibility given to the States and continues the process of ensuring that assistance is directed to people in need. The objectives of the programs, spelt out for the first time in the 1978 Housing Agreement, will not be changed. However, with the agreement of the States, three new objectives have been added. Firstly, the design, style and siting of public housing will, as far as is practicable, reflect the needs of the handicapped. This objective is particularly appropriate in this International Year of Disabled Persons and demonstrates the Government's concern to assist these people to live normal lives. Secondly, the States will also have regard to energy savings which can be made. Again this is appropriate in an energy conscious era. Thirdly, tenants of public housing will be encouraged to participate in public housing policies and estate management. This illustrates our desire that tenants have a say in decisions concerning the management of their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government has promised, this Bill provides for a base funding level of $200m for each year of the five year agreement. The States have sought a forward commitment for many years to enable them to properly plan their programs. It should be clearly understood that the $200m is a forward commitment for each of the five years and that total funding will be determined each year in the Budget context. Currently all funding is determined in the Budget context. The Bill appropriates an amount of $54m as part of the base yearly commitment in interest free non-repayable grants for rental housing assistance to special categories of persons listed in clause 38 of the Agreement. This is approximately the amount which is being provided to pensioners and Aboriginals in the 1980-81 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Grants for rental assistance for pensioners were first introduced with the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1969. Pensioner housing continued to be funded under the Housing Assistance Act 1978 and grant funds for Aboriginals were also made available under the Act from 1979-80. These grants reflect the Commonwealth's special responsibilities to disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes it possible for additional earmarked funds over the $54m yearly base level to be made available from time to time for disadvantaged groups. Any additional categories of people to be assisted will be determined only following consultation with the States and the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has announced as part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that grants to the States for Aboriginal housing will be integrated into the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. It is proposed that the transfer will occur from 1 July 1981. This will bring all Aboriginal housing payments to the States under the one Agreement. Aboriginal housing will continue as an identifiable program component of the new Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the base level funding, $146m, is in the form of interest bearing repayable advances at the highly concessional interest rate of 4 1/2 per cent per annum over 53 years. This is the largest interest rate concession ever provided to States under welfare housing arrangements and further emphasises the Commonwealth's contribution to those in housing need. In 1973, for instance, the interest concession was 2 per cent; in 1978, it was 4 per cent. At current rates of interest, the Bill's provisions will result in an interest concession of over 8 per cent. Any additional untied funding will be as advances, grants or a combination of both. The composition will be announced at the same time as the level of additional funding is made known. A major feature of the new Agreement is the considerable degree of autonomy which States will have. They will have complete freedom of choice in allocating all untied advances and grants between home purchase and rental housing assistance. In the past the Commonwealth has laid down conditions as to the proportion of funds which should go either to home purchase or rental. This new provision will allow each State to allocate funds between programs to suit needs in that State. States will also have autonomy as to how they apply funds made available under this Agreement, provided of course these meet the purposes covered by the Agreement. The Commonwealth has created an innovative climate and States will be able, if they so wish, to provide a wide range of assistance in response to various needs. Under our federalism policies, the Commonwealth has removed restrictions on States but will not force them to introduce new forms of housing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1978-79 financial year, States have matched advances provided by the Commonwealth with funds from their own resources. These arrangements recognise the co-operative approach between the Commonwealth and the States to welfare housing. The matching arrangements, however, have operated outside the legislation. This Bill incorporates details of matching arrangements into the Agreement. The States will be required to match all funds except those earmarked for rental assistance to disadvantaged groups. However, such funds allocated by the States from their own resources need not be subject to the Agreement. The arrangements have been designed to give the States maximum flexibility in running their own welfare housing programs which complement programs under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. These arrangements will ensure a continuation of the strong joint effort by the Commonwealth and the States to provide housing assistance for the needy. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be pleased to know that, as a result of these arrangements, over $630m was made available for welfare housing in 1979-80. This comprises Commonwealth funding, State funding and internally generated funds from program operations. This legislation also spells out the method of allocating funds between the States. The present method, based as it is on allocations made in the context of financial arrangements existing in 1973-74, is no longer relevant and has led to widespread inequities. For instance, in 1980-81 Queensland, with 15.6 per cent of the population of the States and the Northern Territory, is receiving 9.7 per cent of advances. New South Wales and Victoria also are receiving less than average per capita allocations. On the other hand, South Australia, with 9.0 per cent of the population, is receiving 14.2 per cent of advances and Tasmania, with 2.9 per cent of the population, is receiving 6.1 per cent of advances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth considers that the distribution of housing funds on an equal per capita basis would mean a fairer allocation of funds between the States and would be more in keeping with relative housing needs. Accordingly this Bill incorporates a formula for the allocation of funds between the States, which moves towards an equal per capita distribution over a ten year planning period. All funds, apart from these earmarked for disadvantaged groups, will be distributed on the following basis: In 1981-82 they will be allocated in the same proportions as advances were allocated in 1980-81. Over the four remaining years of the Agreement they will be allocated on a basis that would progressively achieve an equal per capita allocation in the financial year 1990-1991, if the Agreement were to operate until that financial year. To provide protection for the smaller States and the Northern Territory a guarantee has been built into the formula so that no State or the Northern Territory receives less than 5 per cent of the level of yearly base advances of $146m. I must stress that the gradual phasing-in of an equal per capita allocation over the nine years commencing in 1982-83, and the protection offered to the smaller States, will result in South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory still receiving a higher than average per capita proportion of the untied assistance over the life of the 1981 Agreement. However, the share of funds received by New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland will gradually increase over the life of the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the funds earmarked for rental assistance for disadvantaged groups to be allocated amongst the States on the basis of their respective needs as determined by the Commonwealth Minister. This is a continuation of current practices. For example, pensioner funds are allocated amongst the States in proportion to the number of eligible pensioners receiving supplementary assistance. In order to allow funds to be paid out to States from 1 July 1981, there is provision in the legislation for an advance to the States of loans and grants authorised under this Act before the Agreement has been signed. However, if a State has not signed the Agreement by 1 January 1982, all such moneys are to be repaid. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to specific aspects of the home purchase assistance provisions. The arrangements for home purchase assistance continue under the new Agreement with one minor change from those in the 1978 Agreement. The 1978 provisions demonstrated our concern to encourage home ownership across the widest possible range of income groups. In 1978 the purposes for which home purchase assistance funds could be used were broadened to include a range of flexible practices including interest subsidy schemes and flexible mortgage arrangements such as low start loans. I am pleased to say that some States have introduced interest subsidy schemes. By attracting private capital for loans to low income earners, these schemes enable more families to be assisted with the same amount of Government funds. With the guarantee of continuity of funding contained in this Agreement, I am confident that we will see increasing use of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A minor change relates to the interest rate charged on outstanding loans to agencies of the Home Purchase Assistance Program. The 1978 Agreement provided that the interest rate charged by the States to the lending agencies would escalate by one-half of one per cent per year until a level of one per cent below the long term bond rate was reached. This maximum rate is to be changed to one per cent below the Commonwealth Savings Bank lending rate for housing loans. The individual borrower when he is no longer in need of subsidy will be paying an interest rate akin to a loan from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1978 Agreement made several improvements to the provisions governing rental housing assistance. The purposes for which funds could be used were greatly expanded to include activities such as leasing dwellings and joint ventures with the private sector and with voluntary organisations. We are now adding another purpose, which is 'to provide rental subsidy for eligible persons renting private housing'. This addition is a further example of the flexibility being provided to the States under the new Agreement. It will mean that States will not need to build or otherwise provide dwellings but will be able to subsidise people renting privately if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1978 Commonwealth-State arrangements introduced a requirement that the States charge market related rents for public rental dwellings with rental rebates for people unable to afford them. The Commonwealth believes that the continued development of a system of income related rents with a ceiling set by the assessed market rent for a dwelling offers the fairest deal for families in housing need. Accordingly, the new Agreement refers to a policy of market rents, instead of the market related rent policy required by the 1978 Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> For those unable to pay the market rent, rent rebates apply. The majority of those who currently receive rent rebates are age, invalid, widow pensioners, and single parent families. The Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty found that these were amongst the poorest groups in our society. Single income two-parent families where the breadwinner is on a low wage also benefit from these rebates. The market rent policy combined with rent rebates protects all of these persons from hardship. At the same time it ensures that those whose circumstances have improved pay a rent which reflects their increased capacity to pay. This ensures that subsidies are limited to those in need only for the period of their need. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1978 Agreement required Commonwealth and State governments to jointly seek ways of establishing a uniform approach to the calculation of rental rebates. Agreement has been reached on broad principles to apply. The formula should treat all tenants equally on the basis of their capacity to pay. Thus it should be income based, linked to total household income and treat tenants equally irrespective of how long they have been in public housing. Only such a system will be fair for all public housing tenants. To achieve equity between tenants living in different States, as well as in the same State, a uniform system across Australia is necessary. Hence the new Agreement requires that a uniform rental rebate policy be developed by the Commonwealth and the States and be applied for the calculation of rental rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981 Agreement will continue to provide for sales of rental dwellings to tenants and will continue the requirement that dwellings must be sold for cash. A cash sales policy ensures that the State Housing authorities are able to replace dwellings which are sold and so maintain the level of the public rental stock while still encouraging people who wish to purchase. Eligible tenants may receive a housing loan under the home purchase assistance program. However, States will be able to adjust the market value of a dwelling so that the sale price set for the tenant will allow for improvements made by the tenant before the purchase. This means tenants can be rewarded for the efforts they make. This Bill represents an important step forward in the implementation of this Government's housing policy. This policy is to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of the first reading debate on this Bill, the Customs Tariff Validation Bill 1981, to raise some matters this afternoon which concern many pensioners throughout Australia. Before I continue with that matter I indicate that I believe I will be followed this afternoon by Senator Reid, who will be making her maiden speech in this place. Whilst other speakers this afternoon and this evening will probably congratulate Senator Reid on her maiden speech, at this stage I merely wish her well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned, I wish to mention some difficulties and injustices which are being faced by some pensioners in Australia. These are pensioners who have investment incomes. Before their retirement, many pensioners set aside what they would describe as a nest egg; something to fall back on when the need arises, something for a rainy day. Some of them receive this nest egg as a retirement benefit. It is natural for these people, who have something they can set aside, to invest some or all of their savings. The problem is that some pensioners subsequently lose part of their pension because of the interest that they receive on those savings. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to take the hypothetical example of a single pensioner who has $15,000 invested in, say, Australian savings bonds. The current rate for Australian savings bonds is 12.25 per cent. So a pensioner would receive about $1,800 a year or $34 a week in interest on an investment of $15,000. We all know that a single pensioner can receive up to $20 a week without losing any part of his or her pension, but once a figure of $34 has been reached the pensioner loses about $7 a week of his or her pension. Some may say that that is fair enough because a pensioner may earn up to $20 a week without any pension loss. They may ask why, if a pensioner is receiving $34 a week, there should not be some loss of pension. But is it fair enough? I wish to examine the question further. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look again at that investment of $15,000 in Australian savings bonds earning 12.25 per cent interest. We must remember when we look at that 12.25 per cent that the inflation rate in Australia currently runs at about 9.4 per cent. So out of every $12.25 interest that a pensioner receives for every $100 that he or she has invested, about $9.40 is required to retain the purchasing power of the original investment. Therefore the real rate of interest that the person is receiving is not 12.25 per cent, but 12.25 per cent less 9.4 per cent-the inflation rate-which is about 3 per cent. What income would the pensioner receive if we calculated the interest on that $15,000 investment at 3 per cent? The interest would be about $450 a year, which is close to $9 a week. If we accepted that the person was receiving $9 a week in income, that pensioner would retain the full pension. I hold that pensioners have to count as income that part of their interest which is merely compensation to keep their principal in line with inflation. Because they have to do so, they are losing part of their pension. I do not really think that that is fair enough. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to Senator Chaney, the same principle applies to taxpayers. Some of the solutions that I will suggest shortly could possibly be used in relation to taxpayers. This afternoon, however, I am just dwelling on the plight of pensioners. This is an extremely important topic for pensioners. They think that, once they reach their retirement age, they will be in receipt of an income, without any real hassle about money problems. But they find that, if they have some money set aside in this manner, they have to lose part of their pension because their interest rate is so high. I point out that the interest rate is high because there is a component in that interest rate which takes into account the rate of inflation. Not only that, but also, as Senator Chaney intimated, they have to pay tax on some of their earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the possible solutions to this problem? I do not think it is worthwhile just pointing out that pensioners have a problem without offering some sort of solution. Short of achieving a zero rate of inflation, I can offer three possible solutions which I ask the Government to consider. One solution would be to adjust the rate of interest received by pensioners by taking the level of inflation into account. Taking the example that I mentioned earlier of a person who had an investment of $15,000 at 12.25 per cent, which gave him or her $34 a week, we could adjust the interest rate by taking into account the rate of inflation. As I mentioned earlier, the adjusted interest rate would be about 3 per cent which would mean that the pensioner would receive about $9 a week in real income. That amount would be regarded as the pensioner's income and, therefore, the pensioner would not lose any of his or her pension. That is one possible solution. </PARA>
<PARA> A second solution, of course, would be to increase the amount which a pensioner may earn. Currently, as I have mentioned, a single pensioner may earn $20 a week without losing any of his or her pension. It is a long time since that amount has been adjusted. Lifting the allowable income to $30 a week would mean that the pensioner in the case that I have mentioned would lose $2 a week from his or her pension. If the allowable income were raised to $40 a week, no loss from that pension would occur. That example, of course, does not cover the position of the pensioner having to pay tax on any income that he or she might have. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention a third solution. The Government should give some consideration to the issue of what I call inflation adjusted bonds. At the moment, the interest rate on Australian savings bonds, which are issued by the Government, is 12.25 per cent. Inflation adjusted bonds are used in other countries. I have seen them used in New Zealand and in the United Kingdom. The general idea of inflation adjusted bonds is that, although a low rate of interest applies, the principal is adjusted in line with inflation so that it keeps its purchasing power. If the principal that a person has invested keeps its purchasing power because it is adjusted, there is no need for a high rate of interest. The effective rate of interest received by the person in the example I have given would be about 3 per cent. If the principal were adjusted in line with inflation, an interest rate of 3 per cent might be satisfactory. The beauty of that interest rate of 3 per cent is that the interest received would be the only amount taken into account for income purposes. Any so-called capital gain that might occur because of the adjustment for inflation purposes would not be taken into account as income. These types of bonds, in other countries where I have seen them used, are well accepted by pensioners who do not want to see the value of their principal eroded by inflation. Of course, in these circumstances pensioners are less likely to lose any of their pension entitlements than is the case with the interest and the type of bonds that are available in Australia. It is not just pensioners who find these types of bonds attractive. Young people who are saving for a home also find them attractive because any savings that they have are not eroded by inflation while they are trying to increase their savings to attain the goal of being able to put a deposit on a block of land or a home. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the problem that I have outlined this afternoon is a real one for many pensioners in Australia. They have set aside a nest egg, something that they have been able to save to help them in their retirement, and they like to invest this money in order to receive some interest on it. But the interest that they receive has a component for inflation, which component is counted as part of their income. Of course, the real solution to this problem is to have zero inflation but I do not really see that ever happening in the Australian economy. I have outlined three possible solutions and I ask the Government to take them into consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I have taken my place in the Senate because of the sudden death of John Knight. Honourable senators previously have expressed far more eloquently than I the great sense of loss, both nationally and for Canberra, which came in the wake of this sad event. I wish to thank those honourable senators, on behalf of the people of Canberra, for their eulogies. I endorse them. I will not attempt to emulate them because I cannot. Instead, I will pay my own tributes to John Knight's memory by trying as well as I am able to continue with the kind of service and understanding that he brought to the career of Senator for the Australian Capital Territory. I ask for the assistance of honourable senators and for the assistance of the community in measuring up to this high ideal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the exception of Senators Ryan, Kilgariff and Robertson, each senator here represents a State whose interests will at times seem to conflict with what might be said to be the wider interests of Australia. Senator Ryan and I are perhaps the only members of this chamber who could claim to speak for the whole of Australia without being limited by the interests which impinge on State rights. I believe that from time to time it is reasonable to look at ourselves as a nation and to try to see ourselves as others may see us in comparison with their lifestyles. Viewed in this way, by any standard this is an extraordinary country. By good fortune alone we are blessed with mountains of mineral ores, bauxite, plus energy in coal, uranium and natural gas far in excess of our needs. Few countries are as favoured as Australia in this material sense and, of course, scarcely any have the wonderful choice of climate which is the birthright of every Australian. Australian travellers returning from almost any country might kiss the ground when they compare lifestyles abroad with what we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look broadly and briefly at some of the comparisons which may be drawn. Any recent visitor to the United Kingdom will tell one to treat an English pound as if it were an Australian dollar. Ask any tourist who travels by car from Italy to France how much it costs him at about 66c a litre to fill his tank with petrol compared with about 35.1c a litre for a trip from Canberra to Sydney. A person may rent a house or a flat in Canberra for $85 a week. In London or Washington a person would be lucky to find the same flat or house for $150 a week. We are constantly, and rightly reminded of Australia's unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent but, put another way, we now have rates of unemployment and inflation which are far lower than those of most comparable countries. In the United States unemployment is about 7 per cent, in Italy it is 7.6 per cent, and in Britain it is 8.8 per cent. Only in Germany and Japan, of the Western style economies, is unemployment below that which we have in Australia, and even this bears closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the average weekly wage is $290, which compares favourably with the European Economic Community countries and Japan, in spite of the fact that the actual cost of living in this country is less than it is in those. Consider the traumas when President Carter tried to fix a minimum wage of $2.50 an hour. Add to this the fact that we have weekend penalty rates which terrify employers from other countries. On Sundays many Australian workers can be found fixing a boat, on a golf course or lounging at a weekender. On any strip of coast within motoring distance of a city one will find at weekends thousands of Australians relaxing or trying to start the family lawn mower. Show me a society at any time where the way of life of the common man and his or her opportunities have surpassed our own. Of course there are richer societies, more sophisticated and cultured societies, stronger and more technocratic societies than ours in the Middle East, Europe and North America, but I doubt that many of us feel tempted to emigrate. Nor would many of us feel tempted by the attractions of living permanently in Japan. It is too crowded compared with life in Australia and is resource poor. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many countries where parents will not let their children walk to school. Here some of us still leave our cars unlocked and one still hears police urging people to lock their homes. This is a country where few of us have seen a revolver and we do not want to. Where else in the world is this sense of security taken for granted as part of a way of life, even in our large cities? Ask people from almost any country whether they view our hospitals, schools and welfare benefits with scorn or whether they marvel in wonder and envy at a country that provides so much for its people. Honourable senators might canvass the world to discover a society as free from corruption as ours. Compare, if you will, our Public Service. At all levels it would be difficult to find any other as untarnished by scandal and blessed with the same sense of purpose and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian tourists in Asian countries will be constantly asked by Asians how they and their families can come to Australia and make a new life for themselves. What appeal this country must have that refugees will risk death, coming in what can scarcely be called seaworthy boats, for the chance to begin life again in this country. By almost any yardstick we are a blessed country. Our cities are orderly and mostly well run. We have very few rich people and very few poor people. There is no privileged Australian aristocracy. Our racial problems are minor compared with those which presently afflict so many countries. Our educational facilities are freely available. Australians have the privilege of changing jobs and location and offering their services in the open market place sure in the knowledge that if they fail society will support them in a manner far better than that in all but a handful of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Our legal system at all levels is an example which is envied and, although most of us take it for granted, few countries have access to such a system or else find that it is almost beyond the means of an ordinary citizen. The history of mankind reveals few examples where the freedom to work or not to work exists, where there is no civil conscription and where goods and services are so readily available in the market place, as is the situation in Australia. Australia has no elite immune from the law or which takes for granted positions in society denied to ordinary working Australians. We come as near to the ideals of liberty and equality as any society. This is not to pretend that we have no problems and injustices or that we should not strive to do better to create a fairer society. We must be vigilant to preserve the best of what we have won. We must recognise that there will never be a time or a society when there are no underprivileged people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the fundamentals of the philosophy of the Liberal Party of Australia, and a very strong reason why I support its principles, is the social and economic mobility we can enjoy in this society. A cursory study of the background of most of Australia's successful men and women will show that their parents were generally of humble origins, whose endowments to their children were a teaching of sound values rather than financial encouragement. Liberalism as a philosophy guarantees that personal effort and the willingness to take a risk allows each individual to find his place in society, rather than have it ordained for him by another individual or institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra is the capital of Australia for all of us and not just for me and the people who happen to live here. It should be the centre and focus of the national pride to which I have referred. Canberra is amongst the world's newest cities. Perhaps as yet it has not acquired the greatness of some of the ancient cities but it is already making its unique contribution to the ancient civilising institution of city life. As such it is a successful experiment in creativity. Situated as it is in a panoramic valley ringed by mountains, it is maturing into a national capital of which all Australians should be proud. Some people may not be aware of how beautiful it is or why it is that so many people are happy to be able to live here. I am sad to learn how many honourable senators in this chamber know so little about Canberra. I will be delighted to show Canberra to any honourable senator who would like to know it better and I hope that some honourable senators will respond to this most serious invitation. I know that members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly-on both sides-also would be pleased to be honourable senators' hosts for a day to help them get to know Canberra better. Canberra has a way to go but time will take care of that. Canberra needs to become part of Australian folklore, not just an isolated outpost of government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect of the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions relevant to Canberra's maturing. The Review referred to the transferring of increased responsibility and functions to the States; that is, increased regional rather than national responsibility. I believe I would be remiss if I did not briefly relate this to the Australian Capital Territory. Honourable senators may remember that about three years ago, the people of the Australian Capital Territory determined at a referendum not to accept any degree of responsibility for executive authority in the Australian Capital Territory. There was one overwhelming issue which was decisive in this result: This was a fear, based on uncertainty, of the financial consequences of accepting any degree of executive authority. I accept that that fear was real and prominent at the time of the referendum. I have no doubt that in the foreseeable future the people of the Australian Capital Territory will have no hesitation in accepting their democratic right to determine their own affairs. This view, however, will be subject to reasonable and acceptable financial arrangements being reached which do not prejudice the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I would add that a report on all Australian Capital Territory finances from the Commonwealth Grants Commission is an essential prerequisite to such agreements being reached. </PARA>
<PARA> But however the problems of Canberra are looked at, they pale into insignificance by world standards. To those of us who live and work here the path ahead is clear-while Canberra remains predominantly a Public Service town it will remain different. I have great admiration for the Public Service but it is my wish and, I believe, the wish of most Canberrans that we develop a commercial base. We must face up to the problems and to the costs of an unhealthy dependence upon the public sector. Only with commercial development will there be economic growth, a growth of employment opportunities and a choice of employment. This is necessary for my children, for those now here and for honourable senators' children who may want to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> Encouraging National Semiconductor Incorporated to come to Canberra is the direction in which we must go but it is only a beginning. If honourable senators regard Canberra only as a collection of second and third generation public servants running Australia, isolated from the mainstream of public life, then a change is overdue. Honourable senators can change this outlook by encouraging the economic development I have referred to so that Canberra can, in the future, provide a similar range of opportunities as do Australia's other cities. Mr President and honourable senators, my appeal to you is to be supporters of the national capital and to encourage your electors to have pride in their national capital. </PARA>
<PARA> An essential component of the city of Canberra as perceived by the original planners of the city was a national building on Capital Hill. The Federal Parliament decided in 1977 to proceed with the planning, design and construction of the new and permanent Parliament House on Capital Hill. It should be completed by 1988 in time for the bicentennial celebrations. At this moment honourable senators may have noticed-I am sure my colleague has-that excavation work for the foundations of the building is well advanced. I look forward with considerable anticipation to the completion of this magnificent building and I trust most sincerely that progress with the new Parliament House will proceed according to schedule and without delay. I know that this building will accord with the requirements established by the assessors who chose the winning design in that it will express in a symbolic way the unique national qualities, attributes, attitudes, aspirations and achievements of Australians. It will be a great building for many years, and a building not just for Canberra but for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President and honourable senators, as I said, do not knock Canberra because the problems we have, you can help solve. This Senate was established as a States House, but it has matured into an institution with, I believe, a truly national outlook. I am confident that honourable senators will equally recognise and assist Canberra in the process of its development as the nation's capital. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Health Commission (Amendment) Ordinance 1981, as contained in Australian Capital Territory Ordinance No. 6 of 1981, and made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>Before I proceed to speak to my motion, I would like to offer my congratulations to my senatorial colleague from the Australian Capital Territory, Senator Reid, who has just made her maiden speech in this place. It is a very heartening thing, I am sure my colleagues will understand, for me to hear another senator come into this chamber to put forward the virtues of Canberra and to ask for a better understanding and a greater recognition of the many virtues of our national capital. I congratulate Senator Reid. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an appropriate juxtaposition that in the order of business today we have just heard the maiden speech of Senator Reid and I have just moved a disallowance motion which has to do, I believe, with a number of important things which Senator Reid touched upon in her maiden speech. Senator Reid, like her much loved and much respected predecessor, Senator John Knight, is representing citizens of the Australian Capital Territory because the Labor Government legislated to have Senate representation for the Territory, something which had been denied to citizens of the Territories up to that time. We legislated in that way because we are a democratic party and we believe that the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory, like citizens of any other part of Australia, ought to be able to elect their representatives to make decisions that affect their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as we legislated for Senate representation for the Australian Capital Territory, and are very happy to have senators of the calibre of Senator Reid representing the Australian Capital Territory in this place, so we legislated to give the people of the Australian Capital Territory a voice in their own local affairs via the body which is now known as the House of Assembly. So that that voice could be heard it was our view that elected representatives of the people on our local body ought to be represented on local bodies such as the Australian Capital Territory Health Commission, so that the services provided by that Commission or similar bodies could properly represent the views of citizens of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that that point of view should be unarguable in this place. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Unfortunately, we have since had from the Federal Government and, in particular, from the current Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Michael Hodgman, a series of acts which have eroded the democratic rights of Australian Capital Territory citizens. The motion I have moved concerns just such a very serious erosion. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the ordinance which I seek to disallow. The effect of the ordinance will be to remove the three part time commissioners elected from the House of Assembly from the Australian Capital Territory Health Commission; to remove the three part time commissioners elected by or representative of health industry workers, for example, doctors, nurses, and so on; to leave a commission comprised of three full time commissioners appointed by the Minister and to create a health services council to advise the Minister and the Health Commission. The council comprises six to 10 members elected by nobody, but appointed by the Minister. Clearly, these changes are unacceptable in terms of the democratic principle of self-management, participation and community representation. They are changes which ought not be made, and changes which I urge honourable senators to disallow at an appropriate stage of this debate. The Capital Territory Health Commission is vital to the provision of health services to the people of the Australian Capital Territory, yet major changes, changes which all citizens of the Australian Capital Territory who believe in the principles of democracy and public participation must find abhorrent, were to be made without any proper debate in the Parliament. The ordinance was simply to lie on the table and become law unless the Opposition and the Australian Democrats seized the opportunity to compel debate by moving for its disallowance. This is a most unsatisfactory situation for the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory-a travesty of democratic principles. I think my colleague, Senator Cavanagh, who will support me in this motion, will have more to say about the unsatisfactory aspect of the legislative procedures which currently prevail in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out too that the Ordinance was signed on Wednesday, 25 March, by the Governor-General, gazetted the following Friday and the commissioners were sacked on the same day. This again demonstrates the speed with which the Government can move to gazette and implement an ordinance when it wants to. It is unfortunate that the Government finds it impossible to move with such speed on other more desirable ordinances such as the new sexual offences ordinance for which we have been waiting for a very long time and for which we will wait a long time further if the slowness of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in this matter is any indication. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal from the Capital Territory Health Commission of its elected community representatives is a retrograde step which ends 46 years of elected community representation on Australian Capital Territory health authorities. I point out to honourable senators that since 1935 the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory have had elected community representatives on their central health authorities. Honourable senators do not need to be reminded that that period spans a large number of conservative governments-Liberal governments-as well as the Whitlam Government. The Government, at this stage, is trying to throw out a practice of community representation which has been in operation in the Territory since 1935. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has given the reason for ending this long-standing democratic process. In his Press release on the day of the changes and the sackings he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison Commission of Inquiry identified inefficiencies in the organisational structure of the Capital Territory Health Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals argued against community participation in the Capital Territory Health Commission on the following grounds. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This Commission has been informed that blatant stacking of the membership-that is the membership of the Health Commission-has occurred when matters of major policy have been under consideration, and that political party views have been put forward under the guise of community representation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a rather strange statement. It appears to be a reflection of the Government's displeasure at the political colour of the three part time commissioners elected by the House of Assembly-two Australian Labor Party members and one Australian Democrat. Rather than accept the wishes of the Australian Capital Territory citizens to be represented by democratically elected members of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, the Government seeks to remove them by ordinance which, of course, is a rejection of the principle of elected representatives and the principle of democracy. The second argument advanced by the Jamison Commission against community participation on the Capital Territory Health Commission is that State health commissions are composed of experts and bureaucrats and do not have elected representatives. This argument totally ignores the fact that the States have representative governments in the form of democratically elected State parliaments to ensure that State health services are provided to community satisfaction. The Australian Capital Territory, as we all know, is not in this position. We have no elected State government. We have only the elected body, the members of the House of Assembly, and they are the people who need to represent us on health bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ordinance-this is a very serious point-also ends worker participation in the formation of health policy by removing worker representatives from the Commission. Established in 1975, worker representation reflected a philosophical commitment by the Whitlam Government that workers in an industry should have some say in the development and formation of policy in that industry. As a part of the Fraser Government's obsession with destroying all initiatives of the Whitlam Government, this worker participation is now to be terminated without any assessment of the contribution that it has made. However, one section of the health work force, and one that is consistently favoured by the Government, is to retain its guaranteed representation. The Ordinance provides that one of the three commissioners shall be a medical practitioner. Well and good, but what about the nurses and the other health workers? Why are they to be excluded and the doctors to be allowed to remain? The health services council, which the Minister for Health claims will ensure continued community and professional input for the formulation of health policies, is a farce. I point out to honourable senators that the six to 10 members of this advisory council are simply nominees of the Minister, to be ignored or replaced if they do not toe the Government line. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making the point I started with. All we want in the Australian Capital Territory is the operation of democratic principles that operate in every other part of Australia. We want the electors of the Australian Capital Territory to be able to elect their representatives to have a voice in the delivery of services that affect people living in the Australian Capital Territory. That is a modest enough requirement. It is a requirement which is fully met in other States in Australia. The Labor Party, when in Government, acted to ensure the proper implementation of this democratic principle. We heartily oppose this totally unjustified attempt by the Government to destroy a community representation on the local health commission. I urge honourable senators--</PARA>

What 'stacking' meant, apparently, was that the people who had been elected by the House of Assembly were unacceptable to the Government because they had different political views from those of the Government. The House of Assembly representatives were properly elected by the people of the Australian Capital Territory. That representative body then voted to send representatives to the Health Commission. The result of that democratic procedure was that two Labor Party people and one Australian Democrat were elected.</PARA></TALK.START>

We on this side of the chamber do not accept that sort of suggestion. I understand that the Australian Democrats similarly are committed to the principle of community representation. I understand that they will support this motion. I urge those Government senators in this place such as Senator Missen and Senator Puplick to consider the straightforwardness of my argument that we ought to have community representation. We ought to have worker participation in the policy formulation of the Capital Territory Health Commission. I urge all honourable senators to support my disallowance motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we paid for it. That is perhaps one of the reasons I fail to admire such beauty. I am sure that if we keep democracy in Canberra, we can make it a lot better place. I was very impressed with the new senator's remarks to the effect that while Canberra rejected the concept of self-government and States rights, mainly for financial reasons, she thinks that today, without the financial constraints they would accept a democratic life and the right to control their own future. In one area, Australian Capital Territory people have had that right-in the area of hospital control. This is an attempt to take away that right, much to the concern I would say, of Senator Reid. I feel confident, after listening to her maiden speech, that she will support the disallowance of the ordinance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that Senator Lewis, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, is to follow me in this debate. I think he will convey to us the discussions held by and the attitude of the Committee. I do not want to go into that area other than to say that the Committee had a responsibility to consider the question and its conflict with civil liberties. We had to consider whether the matter was of sufficient substance to warrant a resolution or whether we were opposed to the new principle. I am opposed to the Ordinance insofar as it takes away the present worker participation. I refer to the representation of the elected body, as imperfect as it may be, which does not have the powers that Senator Reid hopes it will soon have. Nevertheless, it is an elected body which the people of Canberra elect from time to time according to their political views. Naturally when that elected body has a predominance of members from a particular political ideology, people of the ideology will receive appointments. The same applies with appointments overseas by this Government; appointments have not been made of people from the Australian Labor Party. The same thing can be said; the composition of representation changes from time to time. The question of stacking does not arise. Appointments are made according to the majority in a particular house; it is the numbers game. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered this matter. Only one member took the view that there may be a breach of the rights and liberties of the individual. I was not that member. I cannot see whether a hospital being run by a medical commission, a board or anything else has anything to do with the rights and liberties of the individual. I think the individual will receive the same treatment in the hospital. Senator Ryan expressed some remarks that I have expressed in this chamber. We want some mechanism whereby we can stop a Minister from acting upon a regulation because of its publication. It may be that one of the Houses of Parliament will reject it. As I mentioned before, there should be a safeguard. We must consider the matter in the affirmative. Trouble occurs because of the long duration between sittings of the Parliament. I think any regulation should at least stipulate a time limit. Perhaps it could be a short time. A copy of the regulation should be supplied to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Where an expression of doubt has been given, the regulation should not be effective until at least the Parliament has had the time permitted under the Acts Interpretation Act to decide whether it supports or opposes the regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a greater aspect contained in this matter. Since I have been a member of this Chamber I have gone to some lengths to uphold the dignity of the Senate and to recognise its power. I admit that at times only Jimmy Odgers and myself thought anything of it. I think the Senate is an important House. At one time I was opposed to second Houses of Parliament, but I am more convinced than ever that they are essential today. I do not think some legislation that operates in Queensland would operate had it had the consideration of two Houses of Parliament. Therefore, the Senate has an important role. One role relates to the supervision of everything that is done by the other House. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always maintained in accordance with our Constitution that this House has only one superior, and that is the people of Australia. The Senate has a superiority, and is a higher court than any other institution in Australia. We have made mistakes. The attitude of the now Government members in 1975 discounted the theory I have mentioned. They said: 'The Senate is the superior court. It is more superior than the people. It is more superior than the people's elected House. The Government cannot govern because the Senate has decided that it cannot'. Although I do not follow that belief, I looked with pride and justification at the power of the Senate and the attitude that the honourable senators took at that time. I think they did worse in 1974. At least the Prime Minister did not resign in 1974. When we reassembled after the double dissolution, the Bills whose rejection by the Senate had resulted in the double dissolution were resubmitted, the Government having gone to the people and been returned. Rather than the Senate accepting the people's mandate, it voted against those Bills and threw itself open to be swamped by the numbers of a lower House to enable those Bills to pass into law in this country. One can be excused for believing that the pride of some members of this Chamber caused them to think that the Senate was even greater than the people. I do not accept that it is greater than the people, but I do accept that it is the greatest and most powerful institution in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That aspect links up with the fact that a similar ordinance to abolish the elected members of the Canberra Community Hospital Board was thrown out by this Senate in 1967. The ordinance was brought in and thrown out. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said: 'Well, the Senate did not reject it. It introduced another ordinance to supersede it. It took out the offending parts which the Senate was complaining about. Therefore, there was no necessity for the regulation'. I think it is belittling the Senate to say that the alteration was made without the power of the Senate. It was because of the power of the Senate to disallow that the alteration, to my mind, was made. Several honourable senators spoke on the matter and disagreed with the appointed board and said that the elected board, the people's representative, was democratic and better. On 26 September 1967, Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) has asked me to advise honourable senators that in the light of the views recently expressed in this chamber concerning the composition of the Management Board of the Canberra Community Hospital, the Government has repealed Ordinance No. 28 of 1967--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Ordinance to which the notice of motion for disallowance related-</PARA>
<PARA>and replaced it by Canberra Community Hospital Ordinance (No. 2) 1967 which was gazetted yesterday and tabled in both Houses today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not been unmindful of the necessity for the Hospital Management Board to be representative of the people of Canberra--</PARA>
<PARA>The Government was cognisant of that and expressed a desire in regard to it-</PARA>
<PARA>and has had regard to a general opinion that representation should be expressed in the legislation itself rather than being left to ministerial decision. Accordingly, the new law provides that the board of five should include two elected members of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council, elected by the Council for a term of 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the attitude of the Government then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will try to examine the situation. I do not think that the Government, having made an ordinance disallowing the appointment of board members, changed its mind without some pressure. Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time, then said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest for the consideration of the Opposition that this matter may well now be redundant in view of the statement made by the Minister representing the Minister for Health. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cohen, who was then Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the matter be allowed to be adjourned. We want to consider the position in the light of the statement made by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, what was being said was: 'If this does not meet the requirements of the authors of the motion to disallow, we will act accordingly'. Plainly, the threat was there. We note that on the following day Senator Murphy sought leave to withdraw the ordinance. Among other statements, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> I had given notice of a motion of disallowance of the Canberra Community Hospital Ordinance 1967. The motion was moved by Senator Dittmer and is pending before the Senate. The effect of the new ordinance that has been tabled is that the purpose of the motion to disallow has been achieved already. Assuming that that portion of the new ordinance stood no further purpose would be gained by the motion. The motion is not strictly ineffective because it could be required under certain circumstances. But the substance of the motion to disallow has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Complete satisfaction was achieved. There was a complete capitulation by the Government to the expressions of the Senate, acceptance of its power. Senator Murphy added:</PARA>
<PARA> The position now is that the new system provides for three appointed members and two persons appointed by the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council. It is open to those in the community who might take objection to the new system to refer to honourable senators the points that they want to have considered or raised, or for any honourable senator to take steps to deal with the substance of the new ordinance. The ordinance to which objection was taken has been effectively removed. Nothing further is to be gained by the motion. Therefore I ask on behalf of myself, who gave notice, and Senator Dittmer, who moved the motion, that it be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>I submit that this Senate-the highest power in the land-clearly has made a decision on this question, yet some flunkey of a Minister can bring in an ordinance and, merely by publishing it, dismiss overnight the board that the Senate protected. That can be done by the exercise of the power of a Minister. We have a responsibility to ensure that when the Senate has made a decision-I acknowledge its right to change its mind at any time-it should not be set aside by a Minister. Honourable senators should make the decision. I do not say that the ordinance is wrong. My contention is that, in view of the requirements of democracy and of workers' representation, it is wrong; that conforms to my belief. I do not see that the ordinance harms anyone greatly. The only persons harmed by it are we senators. We let a Minister come along and say: 'The Senate has done this, but I will do it my way' and then put it into operation the very next day. My submission to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is that, because of that decision of 1967, this proposal should take the form of legislation so that the Senate may have the right to indicate whether it has changed its mind or has held to its belief of 1967. That is the only democratic course that I can recommend. We do not do justice to ourselves or to the high ideals that Senator Lewis expressed today regarding this great city if we let this matter go without challenge or without voting it out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I speak to this matter, I join other honourable senators in congratulating Senator Reid for her fine maiden speech. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Unlike Senator Cavanagh, I agree with all of the sentiments that she expressed concerning our great nation and this city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, to speak to the motion of Senator Ryan for the disallowance of the Health Commission Amendment Ordinance 1981. While the Senate Committee was considering this ordinance in accordance with its usual procedures, it received a resolution of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly and a submission by five former part time commissioners which requested the Committee to examine the ordinance under the Committee's principles (B) and (C) to ensure that the ordinance did not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties and did not unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administative decisions which were not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acceded to this request and further decided to consider, under its principle (D), whether the ordinance contained matters that were more appropriate for parliamentary enactment. In accordance with the intention expressed in the Committee's 64th report, it sought the reaction of the House of Assembly and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory to the applicability of principle (D) to the ordinance. It also sought the views of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) on the three principles and took note of a substantial number of submissions which sought withdrawal of the ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> After considering the submissions, the views of the House of Assembly and the Joint Committee, and a detailed response by the responsible Minister, which incorporated an opinion from the Attorney-General, the Committee determined that the ordinance did not offend against any of its principles. However, the decision was not unanimous, as one member considered that it offended against principle (B) and another objected to it under principle (D). The Senate will appreciate that, in accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee did not review what it regards as policy matters, so the decision taken by the Committee does not determine the desirability or otherwise of the ordinance. However, the Committee was unequivocally of the view that the matters contained in the ordinance were of such importance as to warrant substantive debate in the Senate. Therefore, it welcomes the opportunity for debate which Senator Ryan's motion has afforded. The debate in this chamber on the disallowance motion is, of course, in no way limited to the criteria of the Committee. That will explain why some honorable senators who are members of the Committee agreed that members of the Committee should not move for disallowance of the ordinance but may speak and vote differently in this chamber today. That is the report that I make to the Senate as the Chairman of the Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to add only one other matter. It is in relation to what Senator Cavanagh expressed today. I listened very carefully to Senator Cavanagh when he put his proposition to the Committee. At first it weighed heavily with me as a matter which might persuade me to object to this ordinance under the Committee's principle (D), or in any event to object to the ordinance as a senator. But I think the proposition put by Senator Cavanagh fails to recognise that since that Ordinance was set aside in 1966, an entirely new ordinance was passed in 1975 creating a new commission and that since that date the people of the Australian Capital Territory have had an opportunity to have self-government and have rejected the proposition. It seems to me, those two facts having taken place, that the argument which Senator Cavanagh put to the Senate this afternoon is no longer valid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the motion moved by Senator Ryan for disallowance of the Health Commission (Amendment) Ordinance 1981. To those people listening to this broadcast this might sound like a debate in reverse. In fact it is. It is one of those occasions in which the Senate looks at legislation with a view to undoing it rather than passing it. As we know, there is a device of government by regulation. It may surprise a great number of listeners to this debate to know that decisions can be made by a group of only three Ministers, provided they can get the concurrence of the Governor-General to sign an ordinance. The device is a regulation stemming from an Act of Parliament. But the actual thrust of the regulation need not be spelt out in the Act of Parliament. The group of Ministers might think: 'We have power under the Act already passed by the Parliament to do a certain thing. Now we will do it by regulation, by an ordinance, in this manner'. Therefore, acts can be performed by a group of three Ministers in company with the Governor-General. The Governor-General almost inevitably signs an ordinance if he believes it is a decision of Cabinet or of a responsible Cabinet authority and if he believes that the wording of the ordinance is in conformity with what Cabinet intended. In my experience as a Minister the Governor-General never canvassed the merits of the case at the meeting of the Executive Council when the ordinance was signed; nor did the Ministers. Once it is before the Executive Council it is signed as a matter of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case it was obviously agreed by the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, and, I am sure, by the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, that the Health Commission (Amendment) Ordinance 1981 should be signed. That Ordinance removes the six elected part time community and staff representatives from the Australian Capital Territory Health Commission. The old Commission, before this ordinance had any effect, had nine representatives on it, six of whom were elected part time community and staff representatives. Three of those six were from the elected House of Assembly-fortuitously they were two members of the Australian Labor Party and one member of the Australian Democrats-and three were from the health professions, that is nurses, doctors and so on. I was quite taken with the way in which Senator Ryan described that as participatory democracy. In fact it is. Three people from the professions were actually on the Commission and responsible for such activity in Canberra. They were elected for three-year terms in July 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> The signing of the document at Government House on a day back in March, I believe, means that that is no longer to be the case. The Minister has said that those people are now to be replaced with people appointed by the Government. It is very clear that the Health Commission in Canberra was in fact an independent body in that it had nine representatives, six of whom were elected-three from the House of Assembly and three from the health profession-and only three of whom were appointed by the Government. It is equally clear from the date of the application of the Ordinance that it is no longer an independent body but is now a creature of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA> One wonders why the Minister made that decision. Was it because the former Commission was going against Government policy? Was it because it opposed cutbacks in staff ceilings? Was it because it resisted orders to reduce services in other health areas in Canberra? It did all those things and one must conclude that they were the reasons. I mention that so that people in the Australian Capital Territory can judge for themselves the reasons for the Minister's action. I must say that it is typical of the Government's callous disregard for democratic processes in general. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the part time elected representatives were regarded as doing an extremely good and professional job and the Commission as a whole was being run with commendable efficiency. The Australian Democrats see no reason whatsoever to dispense with the services of elected representatives and to replace them with people who will be mere ciphers of the Government, especially as they had only 12 months to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I add another reason why we object. It concerns a basic principle. It adds to what Senator Cavanagh had to say. The way in which this Government has acted is almost a contempt of this Parliament. It is the second time in the last few weeks that it has acted with regard to the Australian Capital Territory in contempt of the Parliament in this way. The Executive Council may pass an ordinance or a regulation which may be against what I believe in, but I would say that it has the right to pass it. But there is something different about an ordinance which may have escaped the notice of people listening to this debate. An ordinance has all the force of the law and can impact itself on all citizens of Canberra. Once an ordinance has been passed its whole effect can be nullified if either House of the Parliament disallows that ordinance by a simple majority within 15 sitting days of the ordinance being signed, proclaimed or whatever the word is. One would have thought that a government, being conscious of the democratic process, would have said: 'We will pass this ordinance but before we take any action stemming from it we will do the decent thing and ascertain whether the democratically elected people of Australia, namely, members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, will allow it to pass. In other words, we will see whether they move to disallow it'. But that was not so. </PARA>
<PARA> The very day after the Governor-General signed that piece of paper, the Government sacked the Commission. It was an identical action to what happened with that monstrous ordinance that the Government introduced some weeks ago to make a criminal offence of the laws of assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. Because of that hastily drawn up ordinance, people have been arrested and charged with criminal offences before the Parliament had an opportunity of saying yes or no on whether it agreed or disagreed with it. I would have thought that common courtesy demanded that the Government wait the 15 sitting days until either House had approved the regulations. I am surprised and amazed that the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Lewis, did not refer to that in his response. </PARA>
<PARA> This can work two ways. I am conscious that very controversial legislation is before the Senate which will be debated after the suspension of the sitting for dinner. I refer to the conciliation and arbitration legislation. I remind the Senate of something quite exciting that can stem from that legislation. To give us power to have secret ballots under that legislation, I understand that the Government will need regulations. Regulations will have to be brought down after the passage of this amendment. There are not 15 sitting days left before this session of the Senate concludes. Some sitting days will still be left when Parliament resumes in August when a motion for disallowance of part of that conciliation and arbitration legislation could be passed. I remind the Government of that period of discomfiture it could suffer in that area in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I also wish to congratulate Senator Reid on a splendid maiden speech. I suggest and commend to her that a way in which she can write herself indelibly into the history books of this nation and this Territory is to support a motion for disallowance of an ordinance straight after having made her maiden speech. </PARA>

I am not a representative of the people of the Australian Capital Territory but I feel a responsibility to speak on this matter because I have had many representations from people and organisations in this Territory. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I have had the responsibility of joining in consideration of whether that Committee would take action on this matter. As has been said by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Lewis, the Committee has not moved for disallowance. But as honourable senators will see from the statement Senator Lewis has made, the Committee was very strongly moved by the fact that there would be a debate in the Senate about this matter. Although we had different views on the extent to which the Ordinance may or may not have fallen within the various criteria the Committee has-I am one who thinks that the Ordinance fails to comply with the second of the principles of the Committee, namely, that it does trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties; but that is not a general view--</PARA></TALK.START>

Accordingly, I think it probably does come within that criterion of the Committee and possibly the fourth criterion Senator Cavanagh has spoken of. We have decided not to take action because we feel that the whole matter of policy which is involved in this area will be debated. Therefore, it is to that area that I will particularly address my views. I know that this matter arises from the recommendations of the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. I think I should read again recommendation 90. There is not a great deal in the report that speaks about this matter, but recommendation 90 states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting, I was speaking on the motion which had been moved by Senator Ryan to disallow the Health Commission (Amendment) Ordinance 1981. I described the discussions which had taken place in the Regulations and Ordinances Committee about this matter and the fact that there is a debate in this chamber now which can deal fully with the policy which is involved in the matter before us, namely, the changes in the Capital Territory Health Commission arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had quoted from the recommendations of the Jamison report as a result of which the elected representatives of the Australian Capital Territory, of the House of Assembly and those appointed to represent the staff concerned with health matters, are to be removed from that body. In that report it is stated that the removal of representatives results from the stacking of the representation from the House of Assembly. I do not know the details or the reasons for that because it has not been made clear to members of this chamber what is involved. I think the representation consists of two Australian Labor Party members and one Australian Democrat. While one might worry at the extent to which that is a representation which does not cover the field, that it is somewhat disproportionate, I do not know that that can be called stacking because it is apparently as a result of an election in the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned to find among the representations that have been made to honourable senators about this matter, the information which Mr Peter Vallee, the President of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, has informed us of regarding the contacts that he made with Mr Jamison, who presented the report, when he asked Mr Jamison to supply evidence to support the allegations contained in the report. Mr Vallee has reported Mr Jamison saying to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, at a meeting on 2 March:</PARA>
<PARA> I rang Mr Jamison shortly after the report was made public and asked him what instances those charges related to . . . Mr Jamison replied 'Oh, surely, there is something in the report about that' and when I said that I had read it as carefully as I could and could not find anything, he could only say, 'You will have to take it at face value'. In other words Mr Jamison could not recollect one example to justify those serious accusations, not one. </PARA>
<PARA>He then talks about his discussion with the secretary who, likewise, could not produce any evidence. The evidence on which this decision is based is not public. It concerns me that a decision of such importance to people in this Territory should be based on such flimsy evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of discussion and argument in this matter some people have referred to the fact that self government was denied by the people of the Australian Capital Territory in 1978. It is certain that they had a choice and they voted against it. We heard today, in the excellent maiden speech made by Senator Reid her hopes that in the near future there would be an acceptance of self government by this Territory. I believe that one cannot take the decision by the people of the Territory as being any indication that they do not desire to have any other lower or lesser form of self government than they have had, in this case for 46 years, including the rights of health and the right to vote for people to represent them in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparisons have been made with the States. People say: 'In the States you do not elect people to health commisions'. That is true; but in the States in this country there is self government; there are full elections; and those are not to be found in the Australian Capital Territory. I do not believe that we should inflict any further punishment upon the people of the Territory. I believe it was a foolish decision which was made in 1978 and I hope that if the people get a chance they will vote differently on another occasion. But that is no reason for denying them the areas in which they have some form of self government and some opportunity of expressing their views. In the last few days I received a letter from the Committee for Self Government in the Australian Capital Territory. It is signed by J. F. Ley and R. L. Chapman. In that document-which I will seek leave to incorporate-are set out arguments which I find basically sound and which effectively summarise the views which I have formed in discussion of this matter. I seek leave to incorporate that letter in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> The amending ordinance, which appears to be based on certain ill-founded recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals (the Jamison Commission) has the effect of replacing the democratic and participatory structure of the Capital Territory Health Commission (the Health Commission) which has functioned effectively for six years, with a wholly appointed body of Commissioners which is not representative of, or accountable to, the people of the ACT, the registered doctors, the nurses or other employees involved in the delivery of health care in the Territory. Our Committee regards this as a rejection of basic democratic principles in relation to the rights of the people of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>Grounds for disallowance:</PARA>
<PARA> Our opposition to the Ordinance is based on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Need for restructuring unfounded: (a) The criticisms made of the present structure by the Jamison Commission are unsourced and appear to be mainly based on a confidential submission alleging 'blatant stacking of the membership when matters of major policy have been under consideration' and that 'political party views have been put forward under the guise of community representation'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison Commission cites no instance of such alleged 'stacking' or of the expression of so called 'political party views', and gives no indication that it attempted to verify these allegations. As to the claim of 'blatant stacking' it is surely not possible for such an event to occur, since only appointed or elected members have standing to participate in Commission business. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim that political party views were being put forward is surely one of a subjective nature, and without any details being given to support it, it is submitted that it should be viewed with scepticism. Perhaps it simply refers to occasions when members of the Commission have declined to accept uncritically certain policies of the Government in relation to hospitals in the ACT such as cuts in staff and resources-policies which have recently been causing considerable controversy across the country in view of opposition by both Coalition and Labor State Government's to the Commonwealth Government's proposed reduction in Federal funding of State hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Jamison Commission refers to the Health Commission as being-''unique in Australia because it has the dual role of assisting the Minister for Health to meet his statutory obligations for planning developing and administering public health services while also being responsible for day to day management of the various institutions and services''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison Commission contrasts the Health Commission with health commissions and departments in the States and the Northern Territory which, it says, are responsible only for assisting the local Health Minister with the planning, development and administration of health services, and are staffed by officers specifically appointed by virtue of their skills in policy formulation, planning, both short term and strategic, and resource allocation.</PARA>
<PARA> In recommending that the Commission should have only this broad policy function and that it should consist entirely of appointed Commissioners ''with proven management skills chosen for their capacity to judge between the competing health needs of the services'' the Jamison Commission has failed to have sufficient regard for the fact that the ACT does not have a local representative government-the Minister for Health being a member of the Federal Government and not accountable to the people of Canberra in the way that a State or Northern Territory Minister is accountable to the people of his State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The restructuring has the effect of making the Health Commission much less accountable to the people of Canberra in relation to fundamental policy and planning matters which involve issues that cannot be resolved simply on the basis of expertise and good management. Many matters require value judgments to be made and an appreciation by Commissioners of the real needs and wishes of members of Canberra's community. House of Assembly members and elected health workers, are much more likely to be aware of community needs and wishes than are appointed ''experts''. In view of the availability to the pre-existing Health Commission of expert advice from public servants employed by the Commission and the expert opinions of the elected medical, nursing and ancilliary employee Commissioners and the three appointed full-time Commissioners it cannot seriously be suggested that insufficient expertise could be drawn upon by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Removal of elected Commissioners regressive and undemocratic. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the elected Commissioners constitutes a major regression in the context of gradual development of more democratic and accountable institutions in the ACT and in Australia as a whole. It also contravenes at least the spirit of the outcome of the referendum held in the ACT in 1978 when a clear majority of electors voted for a continuation, for the time being, of the existing arrangements for governing the Territory-arrangements which included the structure and functions of the Health Commission. The Government has ignored the strong opposition expressed by the House of Assembly, which was elected by the people of the ACT only 2 years ago, to the removal of its chosen Health Commissioners and the other elected Commissioners all of whom had expertise in the delivery of health services. There has been no call from the ACT community for these fundamental changes to the Health Commission-only confidential, unsubstantiated allegations to the Jamison Commission by an unnamed individual or individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Grounds for disallowance similar to those on which Canberra Community Hospital Ordinance disallowed in 1967</PARA>
<PARA> In substance, the axing of the elected representatives in the Health Commission mirrors that imposed by the Canberra Community Hospital Ordinance 1967, which was disallowed by the Senate. (See in particular Hansard Vol. S.35 pp. 492-512). That ordinance provided for the removal of all five elected representatives from the 8 member Canberra Community Hospital Board, in the interests of ''good administration and cost efficiency''. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the motion for disallowance, a number of senators referred to the importance of the residents of Canberra, who had (and still have) no local government or State Government, being able to be involved in the administration of their community hospital through elected representatives. These speakers accepted that there should be a number of appointed members on the board, but emphasized the long history of elected local residents being members of the hospital board, and the importance in a democratic society, of having members of the community, responsible to the community, involved in decision making concerning the functioning of hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues raised by the amending ordinance are similar to those raised by the 1967 ordinance and it should be disallowed for the same reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Future Effects on Canberra Community Institutions</PARA>
<PARA> If the amending ordinance is not disallowed it will set a dangerous precedent jeopardizing the democratic elements in the few remaining statutory bodies in the ACT (e.g. the ACT Schools Authority and the Legal Aid Commission, (ACT)) which still remain community and worker participation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee for Self Government in the ACT calls for the amending ordinance to be disallowed and asks that the Minister for Health consult with the reinstated Health Commission with a view to resolving any differences which may have arisen in relation to the work of the Commission. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. There are very valuable remarks in that letter which indicate that the Minister, being a member of the Federal Government, is not accountable to the people of Canberra in the way that the State and Federal Territory Ministers are to the people of their States or Territories. Mr Ley and Mr Chapman point out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many matters require value judgments to be made and an appreciation by Commissioners of the real needs and wishes of members of Canberra's community.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that they are salient reasons why one should have, in an area like health, which is so close to the people, the knowledge that elected commissioners would have to offer. Reference has already been made in this debate to the fact that in 1967 an attempt was made by the Federal Government to remove the elected commissioners who were then exercising influence in the health area. Of course there was a debate. Senator Cavanagh has dealt with this matter at some length. It was pretty obvious to me, when I read the debate that the Senate would have disallowed the then move to remove the elected commissioners. Before that happened, the Government withdrew the ordinance and replaced it with another which was presented with a statement from Dame Annabelle Rankin on behalf of the Government and which effectively put an end to the debate. It is obvious that, on the only other occasion when this matter has been before the Senate, the Senate has indicated very clearly its belief in elected representation on health matters for the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question to which I must make reference is whether matters like this ought to be dealt with by an ordinance which can only be disallowed by legislation. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which I have the honour of being Chairman, presented a report in 1977 in which it set out the basis on which laws for the Territories ought to be brought in either by legislation or by ordinance. One thing that was said in that report was that legislation that was of a particular territory:</PARA>
<PARA>which is socially innovative or affects fundamental rights and liberties, if it is of the kind referred to in such paragraphs (d) and (e)</PARA>
<PARA>Those are ones that are normally made by Acts of a State or by municipal corporations-should be made by ordinance. We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends to the Senate that if the Committee on Regulations and Ordinances reports that an Ordinance is of this nature, then such Ordinance should be made the subject of a substantive debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this is an ordinance which deals with fundamental rights and liberties. I believe what we really need here is not just a debate in the Senate where, unfortunately, all we can do is either disallow the ordinance or let it stand, where we have not the opportunity to amend it and where, therefore, the powers of the Senate are limited. We have a situation where we must decide tonight what is to be done. We have a situation where there has been no consultation with the House of Assembly as to the type of health regulation and ordinance that it requires for this Territory. The President has drawn our attention, as a Committee and as the Senate, to the fact that there has been no such consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have thought carefully about the situation and the matter which we have before us. I have certainly formed the view that I should vote for the disallowance of this ordinance. I believe that here we have rights which have existed in the people of the Territory for some 46 years in one form or another. Here we are hurriedly accepting a very small part of the Jamison Report. I do not know very much about Mr Jamison but I am not prepared to base my judgment on what is just to the people of the Territory on a throw-away remark or an undisclosed piece of evidence which Mr Jamison has used as the basis for his one recommendation of many. I believe that the regulation is unjust to the people of the Territory. I, therefore, propose to vote for disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will delay the Senate for only a couple of minutes to advert to the comments made earlier by Senator Lewis. Before I do so, however, I congratulate Senator Reid for her maiden speech. Senator Lewis outlined to the Senate, as I understood it, the principles upon which the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances makes its considerations. He included in those principles one which encouraged a substantive debate in the Parliament on matters affecting the Australian Capital Territory. I give my whole-hearted support to that principle. I cannot see how it has been transgressed in this matter. After all, the Capital Territory Health Commission was established by ordinance. I cannot see why it cannot be disbanded by ordinance. The powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives enable a substantive debate to take place on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not speaking to that point at present. I have formed a conclusion about that from the debate that has taken place both publicly and in this chamber. I might say that I propose to vote with the Government on this proposition. Concerning the aspect of propriety, I agree that these sorts of matters which affect the Australian Capital Territory ought to be the subject of substantive debate in the Parliament. I believe that the powers of the Senate to move for the disallowance of such an ordinance provide the basis for such a debate. I only hope that this high principle will be maintained by Government spokesmen when the deregulation of shop trading hours is considered by the Parliament. That, again, should be a matter of substantive debate in the Parliament. Of course, it will not be a matter of substantive debate if it is included in an omnibus piece of legislation. I am being consistent at this point by accepting the statement of Senator Lewis that these matters ought to be matters of substantive debate. Equally, I hope that the Government and Senator Lewis will be consistent in their attitude when it comes to consideration of clause 90 of the omnibus legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have taken part in this debate, which is concerned with a motion to disallow the Health Commission (Amendment) Ordinance relating to the Capital Territory Health Commission. The Capital Territory Health Commission is concerned with the management of a very major public enterprise. The quality of its management is important to the people of the Australian Capital Territory. It manages several institutions, has many staff and is responsible for providing the health services for the whole Territory. The debate has thrown up several different ways in which one can approach this issue and in which one can attempt to resolve the difficulties of setting one desirable principle against another desirable principle. A balance has to be drawn somewhere. It is said that Georges Clemenceau once said that war was too serious to be left to the generals. I am not quite sure what he meant, but it could well be that in the conduct of health services it does not automatically follow that the health professionals are the people best able to make the management decisions which are needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue is really a simple one: Who should manage the Capital Territory Health Commission to bring the greatest good to the people of the Territory? The choice is whether the benefits which might flow from the community being able to elect its managers are such that they offset the benefits which might flow from the very best professional managers being chosen by appointment to carry out that function. Community input, of course, will not be lost even under the proposals which are before the Senate at this stage, as the Government, as I will set out later, has some means of ensuring that community input remains. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its establishment on 1 July 1975 the Capital Territory Health Commission has operated on the basis of full time and part time membership. The full time members-the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and, more recently, a full time commissioner who was a nurse-were appointed by the Governor-General, while the part time members were included in the membership of the Commission to represent the community in which the health services were provided, the staff and the private medical practitioners who were providing the health services. At the time the legislation was drawn up in 1975 it was felt that the appropriate way to articulate community views was through the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. I recall that Senator Chipp was a member of the Liberal Party at that stage and we considered this matter together. I think he will recall the lobbying that was done at that stage. Quite vigorous argument took place as to what was the best method of responding to the express wishes of some of the professional groups. The legislation at that time provided for an election to take place among the members of the Assembly to bring forward the names of three people to represent the Assembly on the Commission. It also provided for elections among the employees of the Commissiof who were appropriately qualified by their membership of various organisations and among medical practitioners. Since that time the Australian Capital Territory has been able to test by referendum certain principles of self-government. Other honourable senators have mentioned this fact in their contributions. In 1978 a referendum was held. Not just a narrow majority, but two-third of the residents of the Australian Capital Territory voted against the offer of self-government which that referendum held out. It was, to say the least, an expression of view which was significant if not decisive. </PARA>
<PARA> Our problem in approaching this matter is to try to ask what weight we should put upon the most thorough evaluation of institutional health services which has ever been carried out in Australia. Honourable senators are correct in saying that we should not assume that it is the only word or the last word. The question is: What is the correct amount of weight to be put upon an evaluation exercise, upon the judgment of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in Australia and the various points which were made in that judgment concerning the Capital Territory Health Commission. It is true to say that, from the point of view of government, the operation of the elected Commission has become more and more difficult. It has even been suggested that it has become almost unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years one of the major problems has been with the decision-making process, which is a very difficult process in the running of a large bureaucratic structure. It involves the capacity to make hard decisions and hard choices. Over the years it seems that it has lacked objectivity. It seems that there has been some inability to dead with the very real problems of divided loyalty which face those people who are called upon, on the one hand, to make hard management decisions and, on the other, to answer the interests to whom they have to respond at the time of an election. I will not go through the unsatisfactory features in detail except to quote from the report of the Jamison Committee of Inquiry, which reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> This Commission has been informed that blatant stacking of the membership has occurred when matters of major policy have been under consideration-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Ryan" NAMEID="GD5">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not interfere with the honourable senator's speech and I will make my speech in my own way. The report continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>And that political party views have been put forward under the guise of community representation. The Commission considers that such events must interfere with the efficient management of the health services in the Territory and is of the view that two major changes should be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem. How does one balance up the need for the most efficient functioning of health services for the benefit of the people of the Territory against the benefits that are to flow from certain elected membership? These changes that Mr Jamison then proposed were in recommendation No. 90 of the report. That recommendation stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Capital Territory Health Commission be reorganised to separate major policy determination from the management of hospitals and other services. Policy determination to be the responsibility of appropriately knowledgeable commissioners appointed by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriately knowledgeable commissioners are not necessarily bureaucrats. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Management, maintenance and operations of hospitals and other services to be the responsibility of an area health board, which may include elected or nominated representatives of local bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate once again that this was an evaluation document which looked specifically at the operation of hospitals and health services in Australia. The problems arising from the conflict of interest which elected members had between their responsibilities to the organisation or group that elects them and their duties as commissioners led the Jamison Committee of Inquiry to conclude that the organisational structure of the Capital Territory Health Commission was inappropriate. I quote again from Commission of Inquiry's report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The functions of planning, major policy determination and resource allocation, as well as the parliamentary obligations, should be dealt with by the Capital Territory Health Commission as a separate organisation, responsible both to the field and the Minister. There should not be elected representative members of this Commission, rather appointed commissioners with proven management skills chosen for their capacity to judge between the competing health needs of the services. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry further commented:</PARA>
<PARA>This Commission is unique in Australia because it has the dual role of assisting the Minister for Health to meet his statutory obligation for planning, developing and administering public health services while also being responsible for day to day management of the various institutions and services. In its first task it functions as an equivalent to the State health departments and commissions, but its second responsibility is normally delegated by the health authorities to institutional boards of directors which must work within the limits imposed by the policies of the respective authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fair analysis of the way in which the Capital Territory Health Commission is structured and it indicates some of the special difficulties which face those people who try to make it work. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of witnesses have informed this commission both in public and private hearings, of the barriers to efficiency which arise from this unusual arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepted these recommendations of the inquiry. It was not something which we wrote. It was written by an independent inquiry which was made up of three people who spent a lot of time, with a big secretariat assisting them, examining the efficiency of hospitals and institutional care in Australia. The recommendations made were so critical of the present organisational structure of the Capital Territory Health Commission that the Government believes it would have been most irresponsible if it had not acted on the recommendations as it is now doing. It has been stated that the commissioners were sacked. The law making process of the Australian Capital Territory is provided by the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 which lays down that once an ordinance is published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette its effect is immediate. The moment this ordinance was published there were no offices to which the part time commissioners could continue to say they held. Therefore they could not continue to hold their old positions pending this debate in the Senate and determination of this matter tonight. The Government's goal is the fundamental one that all Australians should have proper access to high quality health care services. It is in the pursuit of high quality health care services and efficiently managed institutions that we have introduced these changes. We believe, in the light of the Jamison criticisms that the changes will lead to a more efficient operation of services and that means, for the consumers of health care-for you and me-that when we need health care if we go to the Australian Capital Territory we can expect to receive it more efficiently than we could if the old system were allowed to continue. The goal will be achieved only through good management of our health system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison Committee of Inquiry showed that the Capital Territory Health Commission needed to be restructured in order to achieve maximum organisational efficiency. A few moments ago I referred to Mr Jamison's suggestion that there should be two levels of operation. To alleviate the problems outlined, the inquiry recommended the establishment of an area health board to take responsibility for the day to day management of the health services in the Australian Capital Territory. This is a model which has been developed for larger health services where several area health boards are responsible to a central health authority. Of course in the Australian Capital Territory there will only be the one area health board responsible to the central authority. Such a complex arrangement that might operate in New South Wales is probably too complex for the relatively small, compact Australian Capital Territory health service. So it has been decided that community and professional interests will continue to have input into decision making through the creation of a six to 10 member health services council-I think this will be of interest particularly in the light of the points made by Senator Chipp earlier as we do not wish to lose the voice of the community-whose task will be to advise the Minister for Health and the Capital Territory Health Commission on matters relating to the Territory's health services. I will turn for a few moments to the question of staff and union representation-this matter has been raised as well-on the governing boards. The Jamison commission of inquiry reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission does not encourage worker representation on boards of management and health commissions. The unique arrangement of the Capital Territory Health Commission with its system of elected and appointed members is seen to be antagonistic to effective policy making and resource allocation--</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: 'Is seen to be antagonistic to effective policy making and resource allocation'. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> So changes to that structure are seen to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Government has accepted that a change is necessary, provision has been included in this Ordinance for management and unions to liaise by means of a staff council. The council will comprise five members appointed to represent Commission management and five members appointed by the union liaison committee. Staff consultation formalised through the staff council will still be a requirement of the Health Commission Ordinance and should therefore alleviate any concern by staff organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nonsense for those people who oppose the changes to the Health Commission to talk about the removal of the voice of the community. Until they see who is appointed to the new positions created by this Ordinance that argument is hypothetical only. It will be the calibre of the people ultimately appointed to the positions that really matters. It will be the quality of management which flows to the people of the Australian Capital Territory-the benefits that flow to the consumers-which, in the end, is the overriding consideration. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) proposes publicly to invite expressions of interest from individuals seeking appointment to the health services council and from organisations wishing to nominate an individual for appointment to the council. The Minister also proposes advertising the two vacant commissioner positions widely in order to attract the best possible applicants. It is our concern to get the widest possible group of applicants from whom we can choose those best able to deliver efficiently the level of management which is required. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue in this matter, as focussed on by the Jamison Committee of Inquiry, is the management efficiency of the structure. It is no good having a structure which looks good on paper if it cannot deliver the best service. It is, in the end, a value judgment which honourable senators have to make between the benefits on either hand as to which of these matters they think is more important. If this matter were of such concern to the House of Assembly, it really is surprising that the first meeting held by the Assembly to discuss this report was on 2 March 1981, almost two months after the report was released. The House of Assembly stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the principal argument for the retention of elected representatives on the Hospital Board was the fundamental right of ACT citizens to have a voice in policies affecting the provision of health services in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement has absolutely no substance as all members to be appointed to the health services council will be residents of the Australian Capital Territory. They will be providing a voice. They will be both experienced and knowledgeable in providing input to the health services council. </PARA>
<PARA> The structures proposed in the amending ordinance is designed to overcome the problems which have been outlined. It is recognised that the effectiveness of the new organisation of the Commission depends entirely upon the quality of the persons who are appointed to the remaining full time positions on the Commission and on the health services council. The advice provided on these issues will bring forward a group of people who will make the best possible decisions on health administration in the Australian Capital Territory as these people will be in the forefront of their professions. They will have in the forefront of their thinking and actions the overall efficiency of the Commission as an agency of government with defined objectives and, of course, they will have in the forefront of their attention the interests of the Australian Capital Territory community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the Commission has suggested that the representatives of the House of Assembly and of staff have largely represented sectional interests rather than the total community. Faced with some of the difficult decisions, they have found this to be a task which they have not been able to discharge easily. The staff representative representing about 3,500 people had a disproportionate say in the Commission's policy. Effective machinery will continue to be available to staff to have an input to policy making-for example, the staff council established under the Ordinance and about which I have spoken already. The establishment of the health services council which the Minister foreshadowed will allow for effective and broad representation of community views and this will influence the Commission and the Government in the determination of health policy in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain honourable senators have raised the question of why the changes were made by ordinance. It has been suggested that the Government had attempted to smuggle the change through the Parliament in the form of an ordinance, not subject to debate in the same way as an Act would be. Some of my colleagues have referred to this at some length and in this respect I appreciate the contribution made by Senator Harradine. I think other honourable senators have already drawn attention to this matter. Honourable senators will know that there has been a lot of consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of the proper way in which some of these laws and rules should be made in the Australian Capital Territory. Without going through the matter in detail, I will just remind the Senate that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) advised in a recent letter that amongst the criteria suggested by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs there was this criterion:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation which, in Australian States, would usually be made by Act of a State Parliament, should normally be made by ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe we have followed that course of action in this matter. I do not believe any issue of national importance or of a kind in which uniformity with the States is desirable has come up in relation to this Ordinance. No matter has come up which would justify the enactment of an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said when I began, the real issue is whether resolution of this problem will give to the people of the Australian Capital Territory the most efficient operation of their hospitals and health services. I appreciate that honourable senators who have taken part in this debate have expressed views which differ. But they differ in terms of the weight which people give to different questions of value. I ask all honourable senators to accept the fact that each honourable senator who contributed to the debate is trying in his or her way to contribute to providing the best outcome for the Australian Capital Territory. The Government seeks to have the Ordinance stand. We will oppose the motion for disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude my remarks, Mr President, I add my voice to those who congratulated Senator Reid on a most splendid and notable maiden speech which she made today. I invite the Senate to reject the motion which has been moved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Reid on her maiden speech. I dare say we will hear more from her in the future. We are discussing the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1981. I refer to Senator Scott's contribution to the debate last night. Senator Scott certainly made an appeal for what he considered to be sanity in industrial relations. I think he was sincere and honest in trying to get some type of amiable relations. He referred to the necessity for the Government to consider references that were made to amalgamation. I remind Senator Scott that the Bill to prevent amalgamation of the unions came from the Australian Democratic Labor Party back in the 1960s. Fortunately, the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, which was formed by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Sheetmetal Workers Union, the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia and the Shipwrights Union, came into being before that Liberal-DLP inspired legislation went through to prevent the amalgamation of trade unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Whitlam regime, a Bill to amend the Act came before the Senate six times. The Act was to facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions. The employers' federation, the Chamber of Manufactures and the unions were in favour of it. Indeed, practically every senator on the other side of the chamber who spoke on this subject had very little criticism of amalgamation. Nevertheless, the pattern was set by a splinter party-not a middle of the road vote as some people seem to imagine there is when there is a third party in the chamber. It is not a choice between right and wrong and someone finding a balance. There are probably six rights and six wrongs and one choice. The DLP set the pattern and the Liberals have been stuck with it ever since. Senator Scott also said that we had the opportunity to try to solve industrial relations while we were in office. I cannot quite follow what he meant. I do not know how one solves industrial relations, but one certainly tries to make them as amiable as possible. I refer to the second reading speech by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> They are policies which encourage the democratic control of industrial organisations by their members and strengthen the rights of individual unionists against the central authority of officials. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what the thought behind that statement is. I will refer to it at a later point. There are one or two significant comments I wish to make on it, but not at the moment. The Minister further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 45 allows the Commission to order a secret ballot of members where it thinks that the prevention or settlement of a dispute might be encouraged or assisted by finding out the views or attitudes of the members. </PARA>
<PARA>That shows the lack of understanding of what really goes on in a union. Just imagine if one were a union official and the union was on strike and one was quite well aware that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission intended to find out the attitudes of the union. The union is on strike for a particular sum of money which, unfortunately, seems to be the basis of most strikes. We should be striking more for conditions as well as for money. But if one is claiming, say, a $50 increase, the strike has been on for a few weeks and a secret ballot had been ordered, one would say: 'Look, the position is this: The Commission will look at the results and determine its attitude towards you people being on strike'. If there is a 100 per cent vote in favour of the strike, one gets a better chance of getting one's claim. This Bill has just not been well thought out at all. This matter really worries me. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the general public will be alerted to the true situation and may bring legitimate pressure to bear upon the organisation concerned to cease the industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us suppose that the result of that does not suit what the Minister obviously had in mind. Will the Government then seek public support for what could be considered to be a legitimate cause? Allowances must be made both ways. The Minister obviously has not done so. There is a lack of understanding about what happens with the so-called secret ballots. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to the meat industry dispute of 1970-71. The strike had been going for about three weeks when on Wednesday, 2 December, a secret ballot was conducted of members of the union employed at Midland, Robb Jetty and Anchorage Butchers Abattoirs in Perth under a recommendation of industrial commissioner Cort. The employers' representatives had rejected support for the proposal but, despite that, the Trades and Labour Council decided that if the Industrial Commission were to conduct a secret ballot the members should be encouraged to record their votes. The voting figures show that 456 voted against a resumption of work and 100 for a resumption of work. The estimates of the organisers at the time was that support for the strike was waning and that only about 60 per cent of the workers wanted it to continue. When the secret ballot took place the situation was completely different. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to a strike which lasted about six weeks in connection with the Alcoa organisation in 1980. It involved the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association, the Australian Society of Engineers, the Electrical Trades Union and the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. Great pressure was exerted by the media. Threats were made about fines. After that long period the organisers reported that it looked as though the blokes were getting near the end of the strike. A secret ballot was held and 135 people voted in favour of continuing the strike and seven against. One could assume that the arguments from a trade unionist would be to stick to secret ballots, but that is not the point. The objection to secret ballots is that they are an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with internal affairs of unions. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of strikes, let me mention a strike which received very little publicity. As I said earlier, strikes usually occur because more money or better conditions are being sought. Unfortunately, there are not as many for better working conditions and more money seems to be the main reason for strike action. The strike I refer to is a classic illustration of the tension in Australian energy politics. British Petroleum, backed by Esso Australia Ltd and the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, literally burned $138,000 a month to prove a point to the men in Canberra. Over three months BP burned some $400,000 worth of liquefied petroleum gas rather than sell it to the gas and fuel corporations at what it regarded as a low price. The strategy of burning a product rather than selling it must rank as the most dramatic lobbying exercise carried out by big public companies for many years. At the same time it was a most successful strike. It was an act of vandalism. I never heard anyone on the other side of the chamber complain about that strike. Is there any legislation for secret ballots to be conducted among the proprietors of BHP before they go on strike? The would consider a secret ballot to be a completely unwarranted interference. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the Minister's statement which I mentioned earlier about unionists being against the central authority of officials. Herein lies the thinking of the Government. I do not believe that it is sincere in what it is doing. I believe the bucking and questioning of authority in regard to strikes annoys the Government. I do not believe that the Government is genuinely concerned about the economy of the country. If it were it would take a look at the industrial accident rates in this country. A few weeks ago I asked a question of the responsible Minister after Sir Charles Court had suggested that the Premiers get together to analyse the effect on the economy of the 35-hour week campaign and strikes. I asked the Minister whether he would be prepared to take on board the effect on the economy of industrial accidents. About 33 1/3 more time is lost in industrial accidents than in industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures concerning industrial accidents in Australia are disgraceful. I doubt whether there is another country which claims to be a developed country which cannot collate its figures concerning industrial accidents and diseases. I look firstly at New South Wales where figures are compiled for time lost in excess of three days through industrial diseases and accidents. The figures apply only to compensation cases. In 1977-78 no individual statistics were taken for industrial accidents or diseases, but the State managed to calculate that the total number of weeks lost was 434,890. The latest figures for Victoria, which collates information on any time lost after seven days, relate to 1974-75. Some 159,863 weeks were lost in industrial accidents and some 13,072 weeks were lost through industrial diseases. A total of 172,935 weeks were lost. The list goes on. Queensland compiles statistics a bit more effectively than Victoria. Its calculations are based on time lost on anything over one day. The total comes to 195,341 weeks lost in industrial accidents and diseases. In South Australia in 1978-79 some 74,778 weeks were lost in industrial accidents, and some 4,083 weeks were lost due to industrial diseases. The figures do not include non-recurring accidents. No one seems to try to collate the figures for the cases which do not involve compensation. No one seems to care about them. These accidents and diseases have a far greater effect on the economy than strikes. Of course, it is not romantic to attack that aspect. It seems to be a lot more appropriate to attack anyone who questions authority, and that seems to be the case. If the Government were genuinely interested in the effect of such things on the economy it would be pulling its act together in relation to industrial accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to Western Australia. Some figures given at a conference in February of this year show that there were 89 industrial accidents per 1,000 workers. In the United Kingdom there were 44 industrial accidents per 1,000 workers and in the United States of America there were 22 industrial accidents per 1,000 workers. The figure for Japan was 8 industrial accidents for every 1,000 workers. Western Australia has twice as many industrial accidents as the United Kingdom. We have five times as many as the United States of America and 11 times as many as Japan. The emphasis seems to be on strikes and how the Government thinks it will be able to control them. </PARA>
<PARA> How interested is this Government in safety? The razor gang brought down some recommendations concerning industrial safety. It stated that the functions of the Department of Science and Technology which are concerned with the industrial physical working environment are being scaled down. The following bodies are being abolished: The National Consultative Committee on Occupational Safety and Health; the National Committee on Occupational Safety and Health in Government Employment; and the Employee Participation Steering Committee. So the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The only code of conduct that the Commonwealth seems to have on health is that which applies to the mining of uranium, and I honestly believe that in that respect it chose the lowest common denominator among the States. Now it appears that the Government is unloading upon the States its responsibility towards transport, which will be a big issue in regard to uraniun mining. It also proposes to unload onto the States the matter of the disposal of uranium. No matter where one seeks it, whether from the Parliamentary Library or the Bureau of Statistics, one cannot obtain a consensus as to what is actually happening or as to how bad the situation is. The figures that I have given by way of illustration apply to compensation cases only, yet the Government is concerned about the effect on the economy of lost time and proposes to resolve all this by the imposition of clumsy, awkward secret ballots. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not worried one way or the other about the results of secret ballots because government supporters do not seem able to appreciate that, as far as the AMWSU is concerned, you just do not go on to the job and tell the blokes to go out on strike. You report on the situation and the men will tell you if they will be going out on strike. When they feel that they have had enough they will tell you when they are going back to work. You may advise them but, in no circumstances, dare you tell them that you are pulling on a strike. In my own union especially, you will be in very serious trouble if you do. I was the President of the union and I can assure honourable senators that on no occasion during my years with the union did I ever hear of an organiser instructing the blokes to go on strike. It just does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> That union, according to the Government, seems to be the big bogey-man but it is not, as was implied this morning by Senator Carrick, a communist controlled union. Fewer than  1/2 per cent of its members are communist and, brother, they certainly do not control it. They represent less than  1/2 per cent of the voices on the administration committee. As president of the AMWSU and the AEU in Western Australia, I can assure honourable senators that such members have an equal say with everyone else, as unionists. I resent the implication this morning of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick), in answer to a question, that such unions as my own were communist led. That is not true. There are communists in the union and long may they stay in it because they make a marvellous contribution to it in proportion to their numbers, but they do so as unionists. I am very much opposed to the conducting of secret ballots in the unions. I have made my reasons quite clear. They have nothing to do with the conducting of the ballot itself but rather that it is a clumsy, awkward procedure and an interference in the internal affairs of the union. </PARA>
<PARA> Government supporters should keep in mind that the unions do not have to be members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Continual meddling will force them outside it. If the unions want to amalgamate but cannot do so because of the stupidity of government legislation-the former Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) supports my contention about the lack of understanding in industrial relations and the fact that we are heading on a collision course-I can well imagine that a collision will eventually occur when the unions try to form into industry, or larger, unions outside of the ambit of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If that happens, the Government will only have itself to thank for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a proposed amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Bill before us is notable for what it does contain and also for what it does not contain. Its basic aim is to toughen the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provisions regarding secret ballots with respect to trade unions going on strike. To many people it might sound superficially attractive to say: 'Let us take them on; let us give the rank and file a go in deciding whether or not to go on strike'. These are catchcries that are heard in the community particularly, I would imagine, in Victoria tonight, where one of the most mischievous strikes for some time has been called. I refer to the train drivers' strike, which marooned hundreds of thousands of commuters in Melbourne this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am all for giving the rank and file a greater say, but the Australian Democrats have come to the view, as has the Labor Party, that these particular amendments to the Act do nothing to prevent wild-cat strikes or to inhibit the power of mischievous trade union leaders. In fact, as I hope to be able to demonstrate, they would go some way towards prolonging a strike or causing one in situations where a strike may well otherwise not occur. I would like to develop that theme in just a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe this to be a thoroughly misconceived piece of legislation. So that the Opposition to it might not just be seen as coming from political parties such as the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, let me say that, as I understand it, it is opposed by virtually every organisation that is involved in industrial relations. I challenge the Minister for Social Security (Mr Chaney), in responding, to name one responsible employer group which supports this particular legislation regarding the holding of secret ballots. I ask him, or the departmental advisers who are sitting next to him, to go through the whole gamut of the 346 unions-or whatever the count is-that we have in Australia and to pick out the most tame-cat, right wing union of all and name one which has said to the Department: 'Yes, we would favour this legislation'. I think that is a fair challenge to the Minister, who normally is excellent in responding to second reading debates. He has his advisers sitting next to him, and should therefore be able to pick up that challenge. I merely want the name of an employer group which has said to the Government: 'Yes, go ahead with this legislation; we want it'. Or the Minister need name only one trade union, no matter how right wing or tame-cat it is, which has made such a statement. I would be grateful to the Minister if he could provide that information. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to believe that the Government could introduce such ill-considered legislation in the wake of the resignation of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peacock. The Government's industrial relations reputation must surely now be at an all time low. This legislation, if it does nothing else, confirms the impression that the Government will do almost anything to foster confrontation between unions and employers. The only people whom this legislation will satisfy will be the Government's own hardliners. One of the reasons I advance for that charge is that the Government should have put into this legislation an amendment to make amalgamations of trade unions easier. That was an election promise. It had agreement from employers, from employees, from trade unions and from the community generally. But that provision is conspicuous by its absence. </PARA>

Even worse, there are about 1,500 organised employer organisations which deal directly with organised labour. We wonder why we have strikes in this country, yet we have such an incredible number of trade unions dealing with and being dealt with by such an amazing number of employer organisations. We have chaos. Surely if anything is screaming out to be done, it is for there to be fewer trade unions. The Government had an opportunity to do that but for some reason did not do it. There is another reason, which other speakers have referred to, why there should be fewer trade unions. I refer to demarcation disputes. I ask one of my colleagues in the Labor Party to correct me if I am wrong. I am told that about 20 per cent of all time lost through strikes is caused not by bloody-minded unions or by employer lockouts but simply by demarcation dispute wars between different unions on the same job.</PARA></TALK.START>

Might I relate, by way of comic relief, the circumstances of a demarcation dispute that occurred when I was Minister for the Navy in 1966-67. The Australian fleet was about to engage in an exercise in the Pacific with the American fleet, the French fleet and the British fleet. It was a massive exercise. I think it was a South East Asia Treaty Organisation exercise, but that does not matter. It involved a naval exercise. Three of our ships were in Garden Island dockyard. They were undergoing the final touches of a refit before joining the naval exercise in which Australia was to play a significant part. One morning the Secretary of my Department came into my office and said: 'Minister, the whole of Garden Island dockyard has walked out-gone off the job-with three days to go before the exercise'. I said to him 'What is the cause of the dispute?' and he said: 'A toilet seat'. I was not amused by the rejoinder because it was not a time for a Minister who had to tell the Cabinet that he could not get the Navy's ships out for an exercise to be amused. But the Secretary's remark was absolutely right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dispute was caused by a member of a trade union-I believe he was a member of the carpenters' union-who had repaired a lavatory seat made of plastic. The demarcation rules said that lavatory seats made of plastic must be repaired by a member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. For that reason the whole of the dockyard went off the job for about two days, if I remember correctly. I digressed to tell that story to show the stupidity that is being impacted upon our industrial scene by demarcation disputes which are essentially caused by too many trade unions. Yet the Government walks away from the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am admonished constantly by Churchill's warning to beware of the false analogy. I know that to compare industrial relations in Australia with industrial relations in West Germany could well lead to a false analogy for several reasons. Again I would be indebted to my colleagues in the Labor Party if they were to correct me if I am wrong. Whilst Australia has about 316 trade unions, West Germany has fewer than 20 for a population considerably in excess of Australia's population. Again I ask the Minister: Why was this earlier legislation not brought down? Who got to the Government and said: 'Do not bring it in'? It is a blatant breaking of an election promise. On 18 September 1980 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Tony Street, announced his intention to introduce union amalgamation legislation. His words ring rather hollow now. I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA> The new amalgamation provisions are yet another demonstration of how the Government is meeting its responsibility to provide an industrial relations framework which takes account of the views of the parties and meets their needs, while paying due regard to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>During that speech he also said:</PARA>
<PARA> I might also add that this achievement shows that Government, employers and unions can work together and produce tangible results for the benefit of each other and the community. </PARA>
<PARA>In September 1980 the then Minister said, on this question of amalgamation of unions, that agreement had been reached between government, employers and employees.Yet this Bill does not include any such provisions. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his policy speech of 30 September last year, said:</PARA>
<PARA> For the future, the Government proposes to legislate to facilitate the amalgamation of unions where there is a 'community of interest'. </PARA>
<PARA>That commitment was repeated by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peacock, on 18 November. The Government has thrown out of the window three years of co-operative work by the National Labour Consultative Council, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the Government. The NLCC arrived at a unanimous decision that legislation should be introduced to facilitate amalgamation and the Government has totally disregarded that advice. I ask: Why? The Australian Democrats condemn the Government for that notable omission. Instead of that amalgamation proposal, which all concerned unanimously agreed should be included, the Government has included in the legislation a provocative, useless and counterproductive proposal to tighten up the legislation in regard to secret ballots and strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go through the mechanisms in the amendments to section 45 of this Act which Senator Button did splendidly last night. Suffice it to say that they will complicate an already existing complicated procedure. It has been indicated that if employees are forced by some device to vote by secret ballot on whether to strike that could prolong a strike or cause a strike which would otherwise have been prevented by negotiation between the parties. It could tie the hands of trade union leaders into settling a dispute when the result of a poll might be announced which shows the rank and file to be in favour of continuing a strike or commencing a strike. </PARA>
<PARA> What would happen if a trade union threatens to strike or an industrial dispute arises concerning a trade union's wish to have, say, a $25 a week increase in wages? The trade union might not really want a $25 a week increase. It might not believe that an increase of $25 a week is reasonable. Let us assume that its bottom line figure is, say, $15. Let us assume further that management comes in and offers $10. Let us assume also that this device of voting on a strike by secret ballot is implemented and the union is forced to have a secret ballot on the matter. The question before the unionists voting on that strike is: 'Do you want to go out on strike for $25 a week more? I ask honourable senators: What red-blooded trade unionist would not vote 'yes' to that question? If during those negotiations management offers $17 a week more to the trade union-which is $2 a week above what the trade union really wanted in the first place-but the trade union members have voted 'yes' by secret ballot for $25 and have decided to stay out on strike until they get it, we have reached a situation of absolute absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who suffer most while chaos and dislocation occur are the trade unionists, industry and commerce whereas the strike could well have been settled amicably and sensibly by negotiation a long time before. Why has this legislation been brought in? I ask the Minister to request his departmental advisers to say which employer group asked for this legislation on secret ballots? Did any trade union ask for this legislation? The second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . frequent requests from members of organisations-and from the public-</PARA>
<PARA>Is that true? Was the Minister, Mr Viner, telling the truth? If he says that in his second reading speech I, as a senator, am entitled to know: What members of organisations? What organisations? What members of the public? How many asked for this tightening up of secret ballots?</PARA>
<PARA> I come to a matter even more serious. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will have to guide me as to whether I transgress Standing Orders. I ask the Senate and people listening to the broadcast of these proceedings: Did the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Ian Viner, tell a lie when he introduced this Bill? Talking about the secret ballot provisions of the Bill, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Following consultations with the major employer and union councils in the National Labour Consultative Council, the Government is now in a position to proceed with the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>That proposal was for secret ballots. I remember the definition of the truth and what is a lie under British justice. When someone is asked to give evidence in a court, they are not asked just to swear that they will tell the truth. They are asked to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I wonder whether Mr Viner's statement satisfies all three components of that definition. I repeat that he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Following consultations with the major employer and union councils in the National Labour Consultative Council, the Government is now in a position to proceed with the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>It could well be argued by an expert in semantics or casuistry that he did not say that the major employer and union councils gave approval. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Following consultations . . . the Government is now in a position to proceed with the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the 99 people who understand the basic English language and who read that passage would understand that the Minister had consulted with major employers and unions and that, after consulting with them, they had given him the go-ahead to produce this legislation on secret ballots. When the Minister responds, I ask him to argue that point with me-that a responsible person would not form that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> At the risk of breaching Standing Orders, I say that that is palpably and provably untrue. No major employer organisation, and no major trade union council-and certainly not the National Labour Consultative Council-gave approval for this amendment to the Act. Is an omission to say something pertinent to a statement a lie? What the Minister omitted to say was that this proposal had been totally opposed by the unions and the employers who, believing the legislation to be unworkable, had expressed considerable reservations. He did not have to say, because the amalgamations provisions were shelved, that those provisions had bipartisan support from the unions, the employers and, before his ministerial demise, Mr Peacock. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude by reading from a newspaper which can hardly be described as rampant left wing. It can hardly be described as a champion of the labour movement, the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Democrats. In fact, it could well be described as one of the great champions of the Liberal Party in this country. I am referring to the newspaper, the Australian. Its editorial of 18 May, speaking about this legislation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's latest package of industrial relations legislation introduced into Parliament late last week may help to placate its restive backbench but will do nothing to enhance its already dubious credibility in this highly sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, to toughen Conciliation and Arbitration Act provisions on secret ballots, was part of a two-pronged industrial relations initiative in the Government's policy for the 1980 Federal election. The other prong aimed to ease union amalgamations-seen as a step toward industry unions, something long called for to overcome strife caused by too many unions. </PARA>
<PARA> But, in the wake of an upsurge of industrial unrest, particularly the Qantas and air hostesses strikes, and the resignation of the Industrial Relations Minister, Mr Peacock, the government hard-liners flexed their muscles. They did not like either piece of legislation much: the secret ballot legislation was not tough enough-they wanted the ballots to be compulsory-and they feared easier amalgamations would lead to more powerful militant unions. </PARA>
<PARA>So, to avoid a backbench revolt, the Government, already on the ropes for other reasons, quietly shelved the Amalgamations Bill and tightened the secret ballot provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Secret Ballots Bill will do nothing to improve relations between the Government and the Arbitration Commission. It ditches traditional appeals procedures and presumes the commission president will be prepared to overrule lightly decisions by his deputies. It also shows the Government has dismissed the possibility that a ballot could endorse a strike and give it legitimacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The result will be an inevitable clash with the unions and the Labor Opposition-and proof the Government's industrial relations policy is one of muddle-headed confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>To someone who just tuned in, that was not the Labor Star, the Communist Weekly or even Mr Santamaria's thoughtful newspaper. That was the Australian newspaper, whose sentiments in that editorial the Australian Democrats heartily endorse and, in doing so, condemn this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I am disappointed with the information that Senator Chipp gave to the Senate and to the people of Australia about demarcation disputes. The information is not correct when one has regard to the details supplied by and readily available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in respect of disputes relating to trade unionism. I will deal with that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say firstly that I am opposed to this legislation because I believe it to be window dressing. I consider that the principle of orderly industrial progress requires that members of registered industrial organisations should take their part and play their role within those organisations. The imposition from above of this type of legislation will not do any good for the industrial situation within Australia. These matters were canvassed thoroughly in the debate in the House of Representatives on Tuesday of this week as well as in the debate on this matter in this chamber last night and today. I would not grace the proposals with any respect at all because I believe that they emerged from a complete misunderstanding of the requirements for orderly industrial progress in this country. As I mentioned, that requires the positive contribution of union members to the debate within their own organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of secret ballots for union elections is a quite different matter from the question of secret ballots in respect of strike votes. One can only consider them-I do so because I have had a great deal of experience of them as Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council-in respect of disputes which affect the building and construction industry, particularly those construction sites in outlying areas. Presumably if there is a strike ballot in respect of a proposition to go out on strike there has to be a strike ballot in respect of a proposition to come back to work. Anybody who has been involved in these disputes would know that half the labour force is gone by the time the fellows have been corralled into a meeting in order to put a proposition to them after lengthy negotiations with the employers. I am not fussed at all that the employers are not enamoured of this proposition. I take note of what comes from the employers, particularly if it comes from the bureaucrats within employer organisations. I also consider what may motivate those suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to my description of this proposition. The words 'window dressing' are apt to describe this legislation. Public relations must have prompted the secret strike ballot and, indeed, the union amalgamation proposals. In my view neither proposal has a firm or solid industrial base. Although the Government is pressing forward in its intention to push through this strike ballot proposal, it has decided to put its amalgamations proposal in cold storage. Let me put to rest some of the comments that have become accepted wisdom in respect of the amalgamations proposal. One of them is that it will do away with the problem of demarcation issues. Let us not forget that the original push for easier amalgamations came from the Communist Party. I quote from the directive to Marxist operators within the trade union movement, contained on page 45 of the Communist Party handbook entitled 'The Trade Unions'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the bigger tasks in the Trade Union Movement of the country is that of the establishment of industrial unions. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, came the entry of the giant United States corporations into Australia. They are used to dealing with the United States industry unions but are completely oblivious of the historical basis for Australian trade unions and completely oblivious of the Australian arbitration system. These organisations are not interested in the long term industrial future of Australia. Then we had the academics who suggested that amalgamations would fix up the demarcation disputes within Australia. Senator Chipp mentioned that demarcation disputes represented 20 per cent of all union disputes in Australia. I shall quote Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. Trade unionism is a classification which is used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to describe disputes relating to demarcation matters, intra-union and inter-union demarcation disputes. It refers also to union membership disputes and sympathy strikes. In 1977 these represented 4.8 per cent of the total number of workers involved, directly or indirectly, in disputes in Australia. In 1978 they represented 3.7 per cent of all workers involved in disputes in Australia. By 1979 they represented 1.9 per cent of all workers involved in disputes in Australia. The figure of 1.9 per cent is nowhere near 20 per cent. I do not know where Senator Chipp got the figure of 20 per cent from. This is the type of misinformation that is encouraging the drive for mergers and for monopoly control in the trade union movement. I oppose monopoly control within the trade union movement as much as I oppose monopoly control in industry. For example, I oppose monopoly control in the banking industry. I oppose the push for easier mergers within the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the proposal? The proposal was to reduce to 25 per cent the current requirement of 50 per cent of the membership to vote on the issue of amalgamation, meaning that only half of that number, namely, 12 1/2 per cent of a union, would need to vote in favour of amalgamation. That is contrary to the principles enshrined in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for rank and file control of the organisation. Not only that, but also the electorate which was proposed was not to consist of all of the union members, but only the financial members. I can understand that only financial members ought to receive the privilege of voting in a union election, but if I have an equity interest in a particular union and if for one reason or another I happen to be unfinancial, that should not deny me the right to express my opinion as to whether that organisation, to which I owe certain arrears in dues, should exist. I should certainly have a right to say whether I pay my dues to that union or to some other union to which my union has been amalgamated without my consent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sorry if I stopped Senator Harradine in the middle of his last sentence but in light of the hour and the purpose of the legislation I thought we should try to confine the debate to the major matters which are before us. Senator Harradine and a number of other speakers, including Senator Button and Senator Chipp, have made much of the failure to bring forward legislation on amalgamation. Indeed, it is perhaps my fault in that I did not take a point of order at a much earlier point in the debate. There is no secret about this matter. The second reading speech which is before all honourable senators and which was laid down in this place last night, and of course, in the House of Representatives some weeks ago, specifically refers to the Government's continuing commitment to the introduction of legislation with respect to amalgamation. I refer honourable senators to that speech and to the reasons which have been given for the Government not proceeding with such legislation at this stage. In my second reading speech I stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that Senator Harradine appears to be piqued by the fact that I drew attention to the fact that this matter was not covered in the Bill. As you say, Mr Acting Deputy President, it was in his hands to decide whether to continue his speech. In any event, I simply refer honourable senators to the passages in the second reading speech which are consistent with the views which were transmitted to the parties to the discussions which are being held on this legislation. The Minister wrote to Mr Polites on behalf of the Confederation of Australian Industry. He wrote to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and to the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations in similar terms, indicating that the Government had decided to defer the introduction of the amalgamation proposals which had been the subject of consultation at the meeting of the National Labour Consultative Council held on 9 February 1981, and indicating again that the Government parties were anxious to consider the full implications of the community of interest criteria for amalgamation and its relevance to meeting the objective of encouraging the formation of industry based unions. I say no more than that the sorts of concerns which were being advanced by Senator Harradine reflect in many ways some of the concerns which are felt about union amalgamation and which have required the matter to receive further consideration. There is no secret about the Government's stance on that matter. It was made clear in the second reading speech. It has been made clear to the parties which are involved in the National Labour Consultative Council. Therefore, I do not think that any further debate is required on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is directed to widening the availability of secret ballots which are to be made available at the instance of members of organisations which may be affected by industrial action. Again, the second reading speech makes it quite clear that there is to be merely an extension of the provisions which already exist to have a secret ballot of members where this might be relevant to the prevention or settlement of a dispute. The Bill builds on the present provision in the Act, which has been contained in the Act, in one form or another, since the 1920s. It will enable a prescribed minimum number of employees at a particular place of work who are members of an organisation which has called for industrial action to apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for a secret ballot. That matter seems to have caused considerable concern among some members of the Opposition, who seem to think that the fact that employees might have an opportunity to make their views known about the rightness or wrongness of industrial action will be in some way destructive. In fact, again, the benefits of the legislation and the view of the Government have been made quite explicit in the second reading speech. The benefits will be to give employees at a particular place of work the right, under the protection of the law, to determine for themselves whether or not to participate in industrial action. Why the extension of that right should be seen in destructive terms would, I think, be a mystery not only to Government senators but also to the members of the public who are concerned about strike action on so many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp mentioned in his speech the present industrial action in Victoria and in my State of Western Australia. At the moment, industrial action is causing very great inconvenience to most of the citizens of Perth. The passage of this legislation will ensure that individual unionists at a work place will have the right to make their views known to the Commission and to seek a secret ballot. Again, that is a matter for which I thought there would have been general public support. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters have been raised. For example, great concern has been expressed about the fact that these are time consuming procedures which will be difficult for people to operate. I think that matter has been adequately dealt with in the debate elsewhere. In particular, I commend to the attention of honourable senators the speech made in the other place by Mr John Spender Q.C. on the operations of the legislation and the choices that are available to workers and the Commission if they seek to avail themselves of this legislation. Members will be able to apply for a ballot as soon as a direction has been given or a request made by the organisation to engage in industrial action. The industrial action need not to have commenced. This will be particularly relevant in relation to prospective or continuing industrial action such as that undertaken, for example, in relation to the 35-hour working week. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that an application is made does not mean that in every case a secret ballot must be held. That is a matter in relation to which, first of all, we have a conditions precedent as to the number of persons who might apply and then certain discretion is vested in the Commission as to whether a ballot is to be taken. There seems to be an extraordinary desire on the part of those honourable senators opposite who have had trade union experience to ensure that rank and file members do not have this opportunity. I think that is a matter which those people who listened to this debate might well have noted. </PARA>
<PARA> My attention was drawn, during the course of the debate, to something that was said as long ago as 1927 by Latham when he dealt with similar legislation in the Parliament. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> These provisions are in pursuance of a definite undertaking given by the Prime Minister in his policy speech at the last general election. </PARA>
<PARA>That situation is true here also. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> They constitute a faithful performance of that promise. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true also. On the one hand, we are being damned for not introducing legislation, for wanting to consider further some of the legislation that was referred to in the policy speech last year and at the same time damned for meeting another promise which was made at the same time last year. Latham went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> They-</PARA>
<PARA>Trade unionists-</PARA>
<PARA>are entitled to have the control of their organisations restored to them and if they do not wish to control their own affairs they need not use these provisions. The opportunity for self-government is given to them, the rest remains with themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>These are provisions which will be used only if trade unionists wish to use them. That is a matter which all the talk of honourable senators in this place who have had some trade union experience should not be allowed to cloud. Why is it that they are so concerned to deny the right, to trade unionists at the work place to seek a secret ballot of their fellows? Why is it that that is something from which they resile so strongly? I suggest that the very vehemence of their arguements will be seen by many people in Australia as a reason for proceeding with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, concern was expressed on the part of Senator Button, who led for the Opposition, about the wide definition of industrial action. It appears to me that that simply ensures that the application for a ballot will not be restricted by some restrictive approach to what sort of disputes ought be subject to ballot and to the opinions of members. The definition is intended to cover all forms of industrial action. There is no implication, as was sought to be drawn by Senator Button, that those forms of industrial action are undertaken as a matter of practice without support of the membership. However, the fact remains that the legislation will give the opportunity to union members to reassess their attitudes to engage in industrial action if they wish to avail themselves of the opportunity. That simply means that there is a wide right vested in the members of organisations. On that basis, it does not seem to be a matter on which there can be any objection to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button and Senator Chipp were exercised about the employer view of this legislation. Senator Chipp, in particular, issued various invitations to me to comment on that aspect of the legislation. There is no basis for the assertion that employers were opposed to the legislation on secret ballots. At the National Labour Consultative Council meeting on 9 February 1981, when the Government's proposals were specifically considered, the spokesman for the Confederation of Australian Industry said that it had no objection to the proposed legislation. </PARA>

Again I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that there is very widespread public support for the proposition that secret ballot should be compulsory for union members when they vote on whether to go on strike. Eighty-one per cent of the people asked said that secret ballots should be compulsory for union members when they vote on whether to go on strike. This figure compares with 78 per cent of people who held that view in March 1976. Seventy-five per cent of Australian Labor Party voters said that the secret strike ballot should be compulsory. Of course, this Bill does not go so far. It simply opens up the possibility of secret ballots being held. I repeat: Why is it that the Opposition is so terrified of people at the work place getting the opportunity to vote on a strike matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two other matters. Senator Button made much of the competence of the previous government in industrial relations as against the incompetence of the present Government. He was concerned about the inability of the present Government to deal with the labour problems of this country. I sought figures regarding the number of working days lost over recent years. These statistics will be as well known to Senator Button--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to quote Liberal Party figures. I intend to quote figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Last night in his speech Senator Button was extremely disparaging about the ability of the present Government to deal with the labour difficulties which are faced by Australia. I again wish to put before the Senate the statistics of the number of working days lost. In 1973-74, 5,426,200 working days were lost; in 1974-75, 3,957,300 working days were lost; in 1975-76, 2,517,700 working days were lost; in 1976-77, 1,573,000 working days were lost; in 1977-78, 1,912,300 working days were lost; in 1978-79, 2,729,100 working days were lost; and in 1979-80, 3,320,600 working days were lost. The fact of the matter is that if honourable senators look at those years of Labor government they will find a very much higher level of working days lost. I simply draw that to the attention of the Senate in the light of the remarks made by Senator Button yesterday about the present Government's record in industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp placed great stress on a passage in the second reading speech which read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Following consultations with the major employer and union councils in the National Labour Consultative Council, the Government is now in a position to proceed with the proposal. The Government would have presented the secret ballot proposals in the summer session last year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The suggestion from Senator Chipp was that the statement that there had been consultations with the major employer and union councils amounted to an implication that the legislation had the agreement, the consent, or whatever, of major employer and union councils. The statement is no more than that there was consultation with those councils. That is a matter which is supported by the fact of a meeting of the National Labour Consultative Council and the subsequent correspondence with the NLCC. I entirely reject any suggestion that any implication is to be drawn that the trade union movement had given its assent, or approval, to this legislation. I think that is a very forced reading of what appears in the second reading speech and I do not believe that the implication drawn by Senator Chipp can be drawn. I thank Senator Scott for his support of the legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provisions of clause 3 amend section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. What they do, in fact, is provide that an employee shall not be victimised-I think that is the correct expression-in his employment or discriminated against in his employment on account of that employee having proposed an application to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for an order under section 45 for the holding of a secret ballot and that an employee shall not be discriminated against by reason of the fact that he has proposed an application to the Commission for an order under section 45 or by reason of the fact that an employee has participated in, or proposes to participate in, a secret ballot ordered by the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What concerns me about the provisions of this amendment is that clause 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as I understand it-perhaps I do not, but I have no doubt that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will enlighten me if that is the case-is designed to facilitate the organisations of employers and employees for the purposes of the good workings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. There is an implicit recognition in clause 3 of this Bill that this legislation will cause trouble between employees and employers. I think that this amendment to section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is implicit recognition of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is concerned to protect an employee who takes part in industrial action from victimisation by an employer. It is concerned to ensure that an employer should not threaten or dismiss an employee or alter his position to his prejudice because the employee is a member or an official of a union. It is also concerned to protect, in certain circumstances, an employer who may be a member of an employers' organisation. The amendment contained in clause 3 carries the very clear implication to me that it is quite likely, in the view of the Government, that an application under section 45 for a secret ballot carries with it the seeds of industrial disruption in certain plants or factories. I say that it does. It effectively means that an employer may discipline a person in his employment because he has taken advantage of this legislation which the Government has provided. That is an extraordinary insertion in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It is quite a departure from the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the traditional understanding as to the meaning of clause 5, which is designed basically to protect employees in circumstances of victimisation by employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I make is that it is an unusual departure and it carries certain implications, in my view. The second point I make is that the ramifications of applications, as they used to be made to the Industrial Court under section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and as they would now be made to the Federal Court of Australia, are just enormous. Very few proceedings are taken under this section, and they are not taken lightly by people because the onus of proof is very high. It is a very difficult onus of proof to satisfy in proceedings under section 5 before the Federal Court of Australia. I ask the Minister whether he sees any lesser implications in the provisions of clause 3 of the Bill. If so, I would be pleased. Also, has the Government considered the ramifications for an employee in the circumstances of taking action against his employer because he allegedly has been victimised as a result of the implications of this legislation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I supplement the remarks of my leader, Senator Button, on slightly different grounds. I refer to the question of disruption. A situation arose in the Melbourne tramways union not so long ago when a girl named Barbara Briggs, for the sake of television notoriety, created pandemonium in that union, being in it for a short time and breaking all the conventions. She was not an employer's plant or anything like that. She was just a girl who had, to say the least, a very chequered career elsewhere. She was odd. For a couple of weeks there were all sorts of problems in the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. There was no doubt that the authorities did not want her. Nobody wanted her. She is unheard of now. She was one of those people with odd delusions of grandeur. She wanted only to get television coverage for a week, and she got it. There was the situation with a man named Koch in another industry. I will not deal with him too much. Notoriety was what he wanted. Later he was involved in some domestic dispute and he is no longer on this earth, but he was an odd man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that these strange people are in abundance. They have their moment of glory in the defiance of authority and conventions. If an employer or an industrial officer seeks out one of these people and says: 'We will have chaos for a week or a fortnight', surely he has the right to cull him out before he becomes, wittingly or unwittingly, with his exhibitionist tendencies an industrial saboteur. That is an aspect in addition to what my leader said. I would like to know about the protection of the employer and the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the point raised by Senator Button. I think it is a very pertinent one. The implication he sees is that an employer may have some resentment towards an employee on this question. I think it is plain from clause 6 of this Bill, taking it in conjunction with section 45 of the Act, that this legislation does not have the purpose of preventing or stopping an industrial dispute. Its purpose is the protection of scabs, and that is all. This is shown in clause 6. One can do nothing about those scabs after the dispute is over. But which employer would want a scab on his books? That is the whole basis of this matter. As I have said, clause 6 is not designed to prevent industrial disputes; it is designed to permit a person to scab. If a man who has an engineering firm wants so many fitters-he already has five and they take action under this legislation and scab against a union direction-where will he get the complement of fitters he wants? Of course no employer wants a scab on his books. Only the Government wants scabs. As I said, I will have more to say about that in connection with clause 6. I think it is significant to point out in regard to clause 3-the Government realises this-that there is a resentment of employers against employees who use this section of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall deal firstly with the point raised by Senator Mulvihill, which I think stands on its own from the points made by Senator Button and Senator Cavanagh. He raised the problem of the odd case, of the person who might be seen as being within a union simply to cause difficulties and to act as an agent provocateur. He cited a couple of examples which he would put in that category. I think the answer to that lies in the clause referred to by Senator Cavanagh, clause 6. If one examines proposed sub-section (3B) in clause 6 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill one will see that a minimum number of people is required to bring an application for a ballot. It provides in (b):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the number of the applicants is not less than-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 250 or a number equal to 5% of the number of members of the organization employed by the employer at the place of work, whichever is the lesser number; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) 4, if the lesser number referred to in sub-paragraph (i) is less than 4.</PARA>
<PARA>In a very small shop it would be possible to get down to the minimum of four people required to bring an application under this legislation. However, there is normally a requirement of 5 per cent or 250 as mentioned in the sub-clause. In other words, a single person who is simply trying to create difficulty would have to get the co-operation of his or her fellows to achieve the undesired result which is referred to by the honourable senator. I think, therefore, there is protection with respect to that. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the point raised by Senator Button and supported by Senator Cavanagh was really answered by the content and tone of the comments made by Senator Cavanagh. He made extremely disparaging comments about scabs and the attitude of unions and employers towards them. I suppose that that spirit which at times infects the industrial relations of this country and which I think is found repugnant by most Australians and certainly by me is one of the reasons for section 5 being in the Act. Protective provisions are provided in section 5 to prevent an employer dismissing an employee or injuring him in his employment because of his trade union activities. That is something that would be generally agreed as being undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cavanagh has made it quite clear to the Committee this evening that anyone who goes against what he sees as the trade union can be classified as a scab and made subject to some sort of action or another. One can imagine circumstances where a trade union may well put an employer under considerable pressure to damage an employee because he has done no more than exercise his right under this legislation to seek a ballot which will determine the view of his fellow trade unionists with respect to the dispute. If there is an extension of the sort of protection offered in section 5, it is because circumstances can be envisaged where there would be potential for victimisation. I think, therefore, that the provisions are required. Looking at the existing provisions of section 5, I doubt that there is protection in the provision as it stands. (Quorum formed). I had almost completed my comments. I was making the point that the amendments simply extend the same protection to members of organisations as are presently extended by the section but cover the new circumstances which the Bill brings into operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not satisfied with the answer. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is trying to cloud the issue. He is not correct in what he says. The very reason for section 5 at present is mostly to protect an employee because of his union activities. Nothing in section 5 protects an employee because he is scabbing. I can understand that the word 'scab' is repugnant to Senator Chaney, but it is an acceptable word in the glossary of the trade union movement. Senator Chaney said that the matter relates to clause 6. Section 45 (1) and (2) of the Act states that where the Commissioner thinks that the prevention or settlement of the dispute would or might be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitude of members he can call a ballot. The Commissioner has to think that the calling of a ballot would prevent the settlement of a dispute or might encourage or assist in the acertaining of views or attitudes of members. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 45 relate to the Commissioner calling a secret ballot because he believes it is in the interest of settling a dispute, but clause 6 does not relate to a vote by members who are on strike. Proposed new section 45 (3A) (a) provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where-the members, or members included in a section or class of the members, of an organization or of a branch of an organization are directed or requested by the organization or by the branch to engage in industrial action;</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, a request must be made. Proposed new sub-section (3B) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> An application shall not be made under sub-section (3A) unless-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) all the applicants are members of the same organization employed by the same employer at the same place of work;</PARA>
<PARA>This matter would not relate to the question of a ballot, if one were available, in relation to the Australian Telecommunications Commission. If any benefit is to be obtained in the Commissioner's mind a ballot would be called for under sub-section (1) and (2) of section 45 of the Act. It may be that someone working at the Canberra transmitter station applies for a ballot. The people involved would have to be members of the same union. The provision relates to a small class of people who are working for the same employer at the same location. The people working in the transmission station in Canberra would have to decide whether they would go out on strike. The union may continue on strike without any direction being given to it. The fellows at the Canberra transmission station would be exempt from any action because they stayed at work. That is an outline of the provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The real definition of a scab is a worker refusing to use his strength in an industrial dispute to better his conditions under the direction of his union. That scab will never be accepted again. He will not be wanted by private employers. This aspect is better illustrated in metal trades disputes. There are thousands of metal trades employers throughout Australia. The proposed new sub-section defines the number of applicants as four persons or 5 per cent of the number of members of the organisation. It would be easy to get four members to make an application for a ballot in a small industry. They would want immunity and the right to continue to work. They have to be in the same organisation, work for the same employer and be at the same location. It may be that fellows at the Forwood Down company at Woodville in South Australia do not want to work but at Mile End they do. It may be that one section of employees wants to scab on the union. This provision gives protection for those scabs. It shows that such people need protection. Clause 3 is being inserted because the Government realises that the boss would not have his job when the dispute was over. A penalty is inflicted on the employer if he dares do anything to the scabs he does not want. This will possibly break him financially because of his inability to recruit other labour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it can be shown from this clause that what I said earlier is correct. I asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) whether section 45 (1) and (2) of the principal Act permit the Commission to call a ballot to assist in preventing or settling a dispute or to encourage a settlement. That could apply to the full membership of the organisation if my interpretation is correct. Under proposed new sub-section (3A), reference is made only to a strike that the employees are directed or requested by the branch of a union to engage. The proposed new sub-section is to have no effect when there is a disagreement at the work place and, without the intervention of the union, the members themselves deciding to go on strike. The strike could be about any question. Therefore, the provision has limited application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Proposed new sub-section (3B) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> An application shall not be made under sub-section (3A) unless-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) all the applicants are members of the same organisation employed by the same employer at the same place of work;</PARA>
<PARA>That illustrates the point that I made earlier. It is not a ballot to try to settle a dispute, but one which is restricted to certain employees-perhaps the fitters and turners-of one organisation, at one location, working for one employer. In the case of a big company such as General Motors-Holden's Ltd, a ballot cannot be conducted unless it is restricted to, say, the fitters and turners, who are members of the Metal Trades Union, to the members of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia or to the members of the Electrical Trades Union. It cannot be an all-in ballot. In every industrial dispute there are one or two men who do not want to strike. They may be offered a reward to slander their organisation. As a result, a vote can be taken with that situation prevailing. Many smaller manufacturing and engineering firms have few employees but it is necessary to get only four who will say that they do not want to strike. Whether the result of the strike will apply to four men only is another matter that we must examine later. </PARA>
<PARA> My whole point is that this clause has no purpose in preventing or settling an industrial dispute. Under it there is no possibility of taking a vote of the union generally. It is to relate to employees in a particular factory who are members of a particular organisation and who are working for a particular employer. It relates to employees who want to buck thousands of members of their organisation and not go out on strike. The Bill will give them immunity to do that. That is my complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new sub-section (3C) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> (3C) A person shall not join with other persons in making an application under sub-section (3A) if the application includes a statement that, to his knowledge, is false or misleading in a material particular. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that requirement would cause many employees to hesitate, but subject to its being complied with and the application being received from the required number of employees we find, under proposed new sub-section (3D), the following provision:</PARA>
<PARA> (3D) Subject to this section, the Commission shall, upon an application made to it under sub-section (3A), order that a vote of the members to whom the application relates for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not they support the industrial action . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My point is that sub-clause (2) of section 45 provides that if it would assist in settling the dispute, 'the Commission may'. But under proposed new sub-section (3D) we are told that when the scabs make the application 'the Commission shall'. There is no let-out, even though the taking of such action may be detrimental to the settlement of the dispute. The Commission orders that a vote of the members 'to whom the application relates' shall be taken for the purpose of ascertaining their views. What is the meaning of the words 'to whom the application relates'? Surely it can only relate to those who signed it. It need only relate to the 5 per cent who have appealed to the court for protection-the scabs. It cannot relate to the other 95 per cent of employees in the factory. Unless the Government can provide some other explanation of the words 'to whom the application relates' I cannot see them relating to anyone other than the persons who have made the application. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new sub-section (3E) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commission, in considering an application made to it under sub-section (3A), forms the view that the cessation or prevention of the industrial action, or the settlement of the matters giving rise to the industrial action, to which the application relates would not be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitudes of the members to whom the application relates, the Commission shall-</PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the application then referred on is refused. Therefore, although sub-section (3D) provides that the Commission shall order a vote, sub-section (3E) seems to be contradictory in that it provides that the Commission may refuse to grant the application. </PARA>
<PARA> Under proposed new sub-section (3J) the following is provided:</PARA>
<PARA> Where, in considering an application made to it under sub-section (3A), it appears to the Commission that, in the circumstances that have given rise to the making of the application, it would be appropriate to make an order for a secret ballot under sub-section (1) or (2) rather than under sub-section (3D), the Commission may make such an order under sub-section (1) or (2) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Under sub-sections (1) or (2), the Commission must be of the view that to grant the application would have a beneficial effect in settling the dispute. Therefore, if the Commission cannot make an order under sub-sections (1) or (2) that it is not of the opinion that to grant the application would settle the dispute, it will make an order under proposed new sub-section (3J), which has nothing to do with preventing or settling strikes. If the Commission can do it, it will do it under sub-sections (1) or (2). It will be only when the Commission cannot grant the application, when it is not of the opinion that to do so will have no effect on the strike, that it will give permission for the applicants to continue to work. I think that is all I can say with regard to clause 6. It becomes clear that its purpose is not the prevention of industrial disputes. Its simple purpose is to protect scabs who want to buck their union and continue in work at the time of an industrial dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the difficulties seen by Senator Cavanagh do not exist when one looks carefully at the sub-sections to which he has referred. For a start, he is concerned at the possible conflict between proposed new sub-section (3D) and the proposed new sub-sections which follow. I draw his attention to the opening words of the proposed new sub-section (3D), which are: 'Subject to this section'. So what is written in proposed new sub-section (3D) is subject to what is written in the subsequent provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that, subject to existing section 45, the requirement is that the Commission shall, upon an application in accordance with proposed new sub-section (3A), order that a vote of the members, and so on, be taken by secret ballot. So there is a mandatory requirement, subject to the later provisions. But it is very important to see the extent to which that mandatory requirement is affected by what follows. In the immediately following new sub-section, proposed new sub-section (3E), we find the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commission, in considering an application made to it under sub-section (3A), forms the view that the cessation or prevention of the industrial action, or the settlement of the matters giving rise to the industrial action, to which the application relates would not be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitudes of the members to whom the application relates, the Commission shall-</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say that the Commission shall refer it to the President or, where the presidential member is the President, refuse to grant the application. Quite clearly the words I quoted are clear and express, that is, if the Commission forms the view that the cessation or prevention of the dispute would not be assisted by ascertaining views, the application is refused. I think the basic concern expressed by the honourable senator in his comments in Committee on these proposed new sub-sections, that this provision is not related to the settlement of disputes, is met when one looks carefully at the provisions of proposed new sub-section (3E). I think it is also relevant to refer to the other proposed new sub-section referred to by Senator Cavanagh. That is proposed new sub-section (3J). Of course, that proposed new sub-section extends the authority of the Commission to take action other than ordering the more confined ballot which may have been sought in an application under these proposed new sub-sections. It provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Where, in considering an application made to it under sub-section (3A)-</PARA>
<PARA>That is this new provision-</PARA>
<PARA> It appears to the Commission that, in the circumstances that have given rise to the making of the application, it would be appropriate to make an order for a secret ballot under sub-section (1) or (2) rather than under sub-section (3D), the Commission may make such an order under sub-section (1) or (2) instead of making such an order under sub-section (3D). </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cavanagh then referred, I think quite rightly, to the existing secret ballot provisions which relate to the existing power to order a general ballot. I think the pattern overall is quite clear. Whilst one is endeavouring to give to members of a union who are affected by a direction to take industrial action the opportunity to have a ballot which will ascertain the wishes of the unionists who are involved at a particular work place, the fact is that the Commission retains powers which enable it to direct its attention--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I was just concluding with respect to what Senator Cavanagh had put with respect to the proposed new sub-sections in clause 6 was that the requirement that a ballot should be ordered in circumstances in which the requisite number of people has sought one had to be read down by the discretions which are subsequently vested in the Commission to take into account the need to achieve a settlement of the dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button raised with respect to the same clause concerns which related to whether I had information from the Industrial Relations Bureau on the number of disputes caused by union managements as against those which came from the rank and file. I am not able to give him such statistics. My advice-it would be my understanding of the situation-is that disputes sometimes emerge on the shop floor and sometimes go to a particular shop floor through the union management. But in that regard I point out that we are dealing here with provisions which are not mandatory but which simply provide people on the shop floor with the opportunity to seek a ballot if they wish to do so. Of course, the extent to which this provision is availed of will depend in part upon the circumstances in which an industrial dispute arises and upon the inclination of the workers involved. The important point is that they are being given an additional right to an expression of opinion with some protection of law. It is a right which will be there for them to avail themselves of if they wish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Committee or to belabour this question. I thank the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for his reply. I started by saying that this clause provides protection for scabs. The Minister has confirmed that with greater clarity than I am capable of. As I said, sub-sections (1) and (2) relate to a settlement of the dispute. The Minister has now pointed out that proposed new sub-section (3D) is mandatory in that in effect it says: 'Subject to this section the Commission shall order a ballot'. We have to look to this proposed new section to see whether there is a let-out for the Commission so that it does not have to order a ballot. The Minister has correctly pointed out to me that there is a provision in proposed new sub-section (3E), which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . forms the view that the cessation or prevention of industrial action, or the settlement of the matters giving rise to the industrial action, to which the application relates would not be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitudes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If it would not be encouraged, the Commission has the right not to order the ballot. Otherwise, it has the right. But that relates to encouraging or settling the dispute. We are talking about the dispute for which there is no encouragement of the operation of the Commission. If it will encourage a settlement of the dispute it will not grant the ballot. Proposed new sub-section (3J) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Where, in considering an application made to it under sub-section (3A), it appears to the Commission that, in the circumstances that have given rise to the making of the application, it would be appropriate to make an order for a secret ballot under sub-section (1) or (2) rather than under sub-section (3D), the Commission may make such an order under sub-section (1) or (2) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The only exemption the Commission has from the mandatory clause for making an order is in a case in which a ballot is a possibility of settling the dispute. Therefore, the Commission uses proposed new sub-section (3D) on the occasion when it has no other resource to prevent the dispute. The Commision has an obligation to grant the ballot, knowing it has had no assistance in settling the dispute. Therefore, the main aim of the clause is not to prevent or settle disputes. The main aim of it is the protection of scabs. The Minister did not reply to that. The Minister did not give me any information on that and I would be very pleased if he could enlighten me. What is his definition of 'the members to whom the application relates'? Does it refer to those who have made the application or is it meant in a wider sense?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a couple of questions that I would like to ask in respect of the provisions of this clause. The first part of clause 7 deals with the method of conducting a ballot if one is requested under the circumstances described earlier in the Bill. Firstly, I am concerned to know whether the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is able to give us any approximate estimate of the time which would be taken in conducting a ballot of that kind. Secondly, if there is a reconciliation of the dispute, can the Minister give us an estimate of the time involved in unlocking that dispute, assuming as one can only assume that the ballot procedure has to be used to unlock it as well as to get it going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another query I have relates to the proposed new section in clause 8 headed 'Commission to have regard to result of ballot'. Proposed new section 45B states that after a ballot has been conducted in accordance with an order under section 45, the Commission shall have regard to the result of the ballot. I think I can understand what might happen if the ballot is against industrial action, but what would happen if the ballot is, for example, 98 per cent, as it has been, in favour of industrial action? What does the expression 'the Commission shall have regard to the result of the ballot' mean? If one looks at the context of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Commission is given on most matters pretty clear guidelines about what it does to handle particular situations. What on earth does the expression 'shall have regard to the result of the ballot' mean if the membership is shown to be almost totally in favour of industrial action? What is the Commission supposed to do? Is it supposed to pore over the resolutions for days?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The third point I raise relates to proposed new section 45C of the Bill. I put it in these terms: This is a right to work Bill. It is a right to work Bill as against the decisions of the committee of management of the union. Presumably, the scenario is that the union says: 'You shall not work because the union thinks you should get $10 a week extra'. The unionist, as an individual employee, as against the union claims the right to work and he says: 'I am not going to have one of these ballots because I want to continue working. I do not want to support the union's claim for a $10 a week increase. I am quite content to go on working'. In the normal situation in most plants to which this legislation refers there are numerous unions involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happens if the employee who claims the right to work under this legislation goes back and says: 'Here I am. We have had the ballot. I am excused. I have a right to continue working', and the employer says: 'I am sorry, there is no work for you. Because other unions are involved in the stoppage, I will have to stand you down'? That is a very common industrial situation. What is the Fraser Government going to do in pursuit of this legislation to ensure the right of that employee to work, as against the right of his employer? How good is the right to work, which this legislation guarantees in terms of the provisions of clause 45(C)? The answer is that it is no good at all because Mr Viner will not pay employers large amounts of money so that they can pay the wages to ensure the right to work in that very common industrial situation, which could arise. That is what is silly about the legislation, because it is not directed at real industrial situations. It is, as Senator Harradine put it-I forget his expression-political stunting or something like that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has raised a number of queries in the context of clause 7. The first of those was with respect to the timing of the ballot. There is no simple, absolute answer covering the variety of circumstances that could come within the purview of this legislation. Obviously we could be dealing with different sized groups involved in smaller or larger concerns. The practical requirements of conducting a ballot will vary from case to case. The honourable senator's concern is expressed in the context of something which he raised during the second reading speech, from my recollection, which is the problem that people might be locked into a situation by a ballot. My understanding of the history of those cases where ballots have been held is that quite often a ballot has been part of the process which has led to resolution. Under this legislation the holding of a ballot does not take from the Commission or from the parties the opportunity to go on dealing with the dispute. The purpose of this legislation is simply to give members the opportunity, if they wish, to express their views through a secret ballot on the question of whether they are in favour of industrial action directed or requested by their organisation. That is not a condition precedent to engaging in industrial action. There is no requirement that having voted in favour of industrial action, the member need vote in a subsequent ballot against industrial action before that action must come to an end. There is nothing to prevent the Commission from continuing to deal with an industrial dispute which is subject to industrial action while a ballot is in progess or when the results have been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the discussion on the previous clause we went through the fact that in those cases where the Commission thought it was inimical to the settlement of the dispute, it is not required to proceed with the ballot. The legislation is not imposing an inflexible framework upon a dispute situation. It has been drawn in a way which allows the Commission to take into account what seems to be settled in the Committee debate as being the primary concern to see that the dispute is settled. It would be the view of the Government that the process is no more hamstrung than it is in, say, the present dispute which is of concern and which was mentioned in the Senate today with respect to Telecom Australia, where because, as I understand it, there has been a union initiated ballot of members, that is not something which locks the parties out of negotiations or excludes the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This is simply adding a further mechanism to those which are available to the people who are involved in the dispute. It is one which we believe will be useful to those people who are of the view that there may be within their work place an opposition to industrial action which has been directed. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the last point raised by Senator Button is concerned, the legislation is not put forward on the basis that it solves every industrial problem. I do not believe that it solves the problem which is raised by Senator Button of the worker who, through no fault of his own and through no fault of the Commission but only through the fault of unionists in perhaps other organisations, is refused the opportunity to work. This legislation does not, and I do not see how it could, deal with the practical problem raised by Senator Button. That means that in certain cases where there are a plethora or a group of unions involved and where there is no opportunity to work, that the mere holding of a ballot is not going to create that opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last part of the Minister's answer really goes to the question of what the credibility of this legislation will be. I have in mind somebody who genuinely wants to work. He seeks a ballot on the first occasion. He may get into the situation I have described. He then asks himself: 'What on earth is the good of all this to me? Why should I take part in any more of these ballots?' That seems to me to be the real situation which is likely to arise. I also ask the Minister whether he has any comment to make about the question I asked, which was what the Commission has to do when it gets a result that the members of the union want to strike? What does the expression, ' . . . shall have regard to the result of the ballot' mean?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would be accepted by Senator Button that those words cannot mean that the Commission is blindly bound to follow the results of that ballot. I think that it is probably beyond power to have a provision which meant that. It is simply an expression which is meant to bring out the Government's view that it is important that the views of the members concerned, the people who have sought and obtained the opportunity to vote, shall be taken into account. The Commission shall have regard for that view. It is not, as I understand it-I think we are excluded from giving legal opinions in this place-trying to simply say that the decision of that vote takes the place of any decision the Commission might take.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a question relating to clause 6. Proposed new sub-section 45 (3B) fixes the minimum number of applicants as the members of an organisation at the one place of work. The Minister will note the word 'organisation' is used in the singular. I wish to relate that provision to the trade union combinations that could be involved. At a big railway workshop, the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, the Australian Railways Union, the Australasian Society of Engineers, the Federated Moulders (Metal) Union of Australia, the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia, the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union of Australia and the Electrical Trades Union of Australia could all be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of a big construction site, the Builders Labourers Federation, the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the Australian Workers Union and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia could be involved. Seven or more unions could be involved at a site. Yet this clause refers to the minimum number of applicants being the members of an organisation. Does that mean that the members of one of the unions involved who met the requirements of the Bill could institute this ballot action? If the answer is yes, does that mean that a ballot would be taken of only one-seventh or one-fifth of the unions involved? Does the reference to a minimum number of applicants mean that parallel action would have to be taken by rank and file members of each of the related unions I have mentioned?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interpretatin which Senator Mulvihill spelt out in his question is, I think, correct. Proposed section 45 (3B) set out in clause 6 specifically relates to a particular organisation; so at a site at which a number of organisations were represented, a ballot would be taken of the relevant organisations and not of the others. In the light of the sorts of comments made by Senator Button in relation to a subsequent clause, that might be regarded as being somewhat irrelevant. But Senator Mulvihill will be aware of situations in which the real problem is that one trade union might seek to take industrial action because it is seeking to extend its right to do certain work done by the members of another union. It may well be very relevant to a dispute of that sort that would occur on a multi-union site. The ballot would apply only to members of a particular union who were concerned about a direction to take industrial action.</PARA></TALK.START>

But if the issue involved a site allowance or something like that, each union would probably take the plunge and become involved in the matter. I take it that the Minister is saying that if five unions felt that none of their rank and file wanted to be involved in a ballot, if they were united on their course, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commissioner dealing with the matter, even if other unions returned to work, would still have to negotiate with the five unions which were still on strike and were maintaining a solid front.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is being asked to give its assent to the Roads Grants Bill 1981. It is being considered in the same way as a number of pieces of legislation have been considered by the Senate-that is, in a rather cursory way. We have been inundated with an amount of legislation which has had the effect of preventing the Senate from giving proper consideration to these matters. As has been the case with many of the Bills with which we have been dealing this week, this is a disgraceful piece of legislation insofar as it sets out to deny the rights of the States so far as road grants are concerned. It puts a nail in the coffin of the co-operative federalism which was so much a feature of the Government's so-called approach to Commonwealth-State relations, particularly as it has been expressed so many times in this place by Senator Carrick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This piece of legislation represents a censure on the character approach of the adviser who was appointed to assist the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to express the very principles of co-operative federalism. It shows the falseness of this Government and the fallacious approach that it has to its relationship with the States and the Territories. Once again, this Government expresses in this Bill its intention to look after its powerful friends in the private sector. Once again, this goes hand in hand with the Government's abrogation of its national responsibilities and its obligations to the States, and with the false notion that somehow or other small government is good government. Anyone listening to this debate, whether in the Parliament or outside it, will appreciate that in this legislation the national Government is dictating to the States and refusing to carry out its proper role of responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past five years the Fraser Government has been gradually reducing in real terms its funding to the Australian road network but this year it has gone one step further in its futile attempt to ultimately destroy any viable public sector in the Australian economy. It ignores all of the advice that has been given to it by its advisers, including the Australian Bureau of Road Economics and other organisations. One of them, the National Roads and Motorists' Association, has been reported in this evening's newspapers as pointing to the defects that exist in this legislation. This Government has finally succumbed to those forces in the Liberal Party which are forcing their ideological stance on both the Government and the community. We see here another expression of the conservatives winning the battle in the Liberal Party against the liberals. Simultaneously, that battle shows an attack on the rights of the States by lumping them with the costliest areas of public expenditure without giving them the financial and leadership assistance which, the Opposition believes, a national government has an obligation to do. It is imposing a costly form of arrangements upon the way in which our road programs will henceforth operate. It is another example of the dictatorial way that the Fraser Government operates in its relationship with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Bill provides some federal funds, the Opposition, whilst it is critical of the nature of the legislation, does not intend to oppose it. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will move an amendment which summarises our basic objections to the provisions of the Bill. Also I will move an amendment in the Committee stages for the retention by the States of their discretionary power to select those national roadworks for which public tenders should be invited. The main purpose of the Bill is to provide, in 1981-82, $685m to the States and the Northern Territory for road works and for the first time it provides minimal levels of advance Commonwealth national road funding in 1982-83 and 1983-84. The Bill retains the same relativities of funds between the States and the Northern Territory and between categories as in 1980-81. However, there is no commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to maintain these relativities over the rest of the five-year plan to 1984-85. We object to this but we realise that the Government has the authority temporarily-for at least another five or six sitting days in the Senate-so there is not much point in objecting to what is proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the monetary rise in grants. In 1980-81, there was an 11 per cent increase; in 1981-82, there is a 9 per cent increase; in 1982-83, there is a scheduled increase of 7 per cent; and, in both 1983-84 and 1984-85, the scheduled increase in grants is 6 per cent. In real terms this demonstrates a continuing but diminishing Commonwealth responsibility for road funding. The Minister for Transport will be empowered by this legislation to declare as developmental roads which he considers to be of national importance. These include those that develop particular industries or energy resources, including roads that aid interstate or overseas trade and commerce or help tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also reduces the number of road categories from four to three and, therefore, it is an important piece of legislation. It amalgamates urban arterial and rural arterial roads into one category of arterial roads. The three categories remaining will be national roads, arterial roads and local roads. The legislation also involves the Minister consulting with those States on a new formula for the distribution of Commonwealth funds to local government. In the absence of an agreement with any State or the Northern Territory, the existing practice whereby the Minister approves a program of local road allocations from States will be followed. As far as I am aware, the formula approach has been adopted by New South Wales and discussions are in progress with Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important, destructive and undesirable change for which this legislation provides is that all grants for national road construction will be conditional-for the first time, as a direction from the Federal Government-upon the States calling public tenders for road works. This differs from existing, established procedures and all past existing legislation whereby the States have had discretion to determine which national highway construction works will go to tender and which will be built by State road authorities. So here we have a piece of legislation which interferes with the rights of States and which, for the first time, directs the States and puts conditions upon the manner in which they will carry out road construction. As a result of this proposal, there is unanimity among the States that this requirement is an unwarranted imposition upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> Without any economic justification whatsoever, without any request from the States, without any advice from people who advise the Government on questions of road works, this Government has made a decision which changes the established practices. Rather than reduce costs, as the State Ministers have said, all States are adamant that this will cause massive disruption to road works and public road construction forces, retrenchments, an increase in red tape, greater supervisory costs and will replace existing flexibility and efficiency with an inflexible requirement. Therefore, one expects that in these circumstances the Senate will exercise its powers of review and say that, as this is a States House, it will give some consideration to the States views. It matters not whether they be from Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia or New South Wales, the State Ministers for Transport are opposed to this legislation. I quote from the New South Wales Department of Main Roads report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that indicates that there would be more roads built or more effective and efficient utilisation of road funds by the complete use of contractors. It has been the Department's experience over many years that the letting of comprehensive roadworks contracts has not resulted in any great savings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that view is also expressed by other main roads authorities and construction authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's excuse for this change of face and for this new attitude is that it is about saving money and reducing taxes. The Opposition says that this is a sham and inexcusable in respect of what this legislation proposes to do. This Government has taken an ideological position and it is pressing it in the interests of its big money backers. The legislation has nothing at all to do with the ordinary men and women of this country. To find evidence of this Government's hollow philosophy in this regard, one has only to turn to the annual report of the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Direct construction by Governments has continued to be a major problem for the industry . . . the national office has devoted a great deal of time to the preparation of draft legislation and to papers for general use. In addition, representations have been made regarding significant volumes of Federal Government work that are still carried out by 'day labour'. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what we are now seeing in this legislation is that 'draft legislation' being considered by the Senate today. Yesterday, citizens attempted to present a viewpoint to this Government and we saw what happened in King's Hall-the use of brute force to remove people who had a point of veiw which was not acceptable to the Government. But it is obvious that the big business backers of this Government are able, not only in respect of this legislation but also in respect of a whole range of legislation which this Government is currently ramming through this Parliament, to have their presence felt, to have an influence in the drafting of legislation. In fact, they are responsible for the very piece of legislation which we are currently considering. The Government is willing to gamble-and it is a huge gamble-with the jobs of many thousands of people and with taxpayers' money in the faint hope and the false hope that its ideology is correct. If the Government wanted to know the facts, why did it not undertake a study into the subject before gambling with taxpayers' money, with motorists' lives, against an article of conservative dogma, which is what this legislation seeks to do? That course was recommended by the now defunct Bureau of Roads to an earlier conservative government way back in 1969. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to honourable senators that every State in the Commonwealth, without exception, is against this Government's proposal to abolish the traditional discretionary power of the States to decide on which projects tenders shoud be invited. At present, private contractors get at least 50 per cent of all the national road construction work anyway, but the road constructors, of course, are not satisfied with this. Their powerful lobby represents itself in the inner sanctums of this Government and legislation is prepared to suit their economic desires. The Australian Labor Party is not opposed to the selective use of contractors, but it is opposed to the Commonwealth dictating to the States. It is opposed to the Commonwealth saying that the States shall not have the power to have a discretion in these matters, that the States should cede control over the mix of contract and day labour work to a very imperfect market situation, to a procedure whereby a Federal official will stand guard at the opening of the tender box to prevent illegalities. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have had decades of experience in road construction and in determining the most appropriate and balanced mix for each type of job. This has resulted in the effective use of available funds and resources and the heavy taxpayer investment in costly road plant and skilled professional experts. The Commonwealth now wants to change this and is about to replace this flexible approach, this correct approach, with an inflexible blanket requiring forcing tenders to be called for all national road construction purposes. Instead of road construction expenditure being dictated by need, by efficiency, by local demand, it will be dictated by a desire for private profit, as determined by this legislation, by the Fraser-Anthony Government. Private enterprise will get the pick of the work and the State road authorities will fill in the gaps. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have the ludicrous situation whereby the States will design national road projects, do the survey work, prepare the project specifications, draw up the tenders, administer the procedures, submit their own tenders to themselves, assess all the tenders and then give the work to themselves or to a private contractor and, in any case, supervise the quality control of construction. Of course that is the general experience of people who know anything about the way in which State public works programs are carried out or the way in which local government programs are carried out. The Commonwealth's contribution to this will be to ensure that a Federal officer is standing at the opening of the tender box so that the States do not tamper with the tenders. So much for this Government's professed belief in the principles of co-operative federalism! So much for this Government's concern for the rights of the States! So much for this Government's professed belief that the States should have the right to determine their own works programs!</PARA>
<PARA> The new procedures will involve the States in a mass of red tape, an increase in State supervisory work, a wasting of public money in needless administration, delays, large scale disruption of State road works, thousands of retrenchments and the under-utilisation of their already existing road plant equipment. I am advised that in New South Wales alone, for example, 790 men will be affected. They work at the following 17 Department of Main Roads depots throughout New South Wales: Thornleigh; Bowenfels; Picton; Bellambi; Singleton; Waratah; Glen Innes; Tenterfield; Armidale; South Tamworth; Holbrook; Tumut; Goulburn; Gundagai; Yass; Karoing and Wyong. In all those places the jobs of the men working for the Department of Main Roads, which hitherto has been an important integral part of decentralisation, are now at risk. Large scale hardship will be the result in these rural areas and there will be an undermining of provincial communities. The very essence of decentralisation is at stake in this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that in Tasmania, for example, some 474 men could lose their jobs as a direct result of this piece of legislation. In that State very few road contractors have the capacity to build national roads, so if the work is to be done by private enterprise, almost inevitably it will have to be done by firms operating from the mainland. This is being done by a government which claims to have respect for the States and which claims to support the principles of decentralisation. This will involve a loss of jobs in Tasmania and a loss of influence by Tasmanians over their own State's affairs. I would expect, therefore, that Tasmanian senators would support their State as, indeed, I would expect the honourable senators who will follow me in this debate from the other States to have some regard to the criticism by the Opposition of this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> No State supports the proposition. No State supports the legislation. The Local Government Association does not support it either. The Local Government Association resolved unanimously at its last conference:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Conference endorse the recent action taken by the Executive-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of the Association-</PARA>
<PARA>in informing the Minister for Transport-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Commonwealth Minister for Transport-</PARA>
<PARA>that it is the ACLGA's view that each local government authority should retain absolute discretion as to whether its road programs be put to tender or carried out by day labour. </PARA>
<PARA>The Association clearly sees the dangers to taxpayers and to ratepayers in the Commonwealth's policy of compulsory preference to private road contractors. The Government is imposing this system on the States, yet no State or local government instrumentality wants it. Why then are we being forced to consider this piece of legislation? Because it ignores the elected representatives of the people in all those areas. The views of the elected representatives of the people are being set aside to permit a private lobby to wax fat on public money. So much for the Government's professed belief in the right to freedom of choice! It is not there for the States. It is not there for local government and it is not there for the citizens. The Government should admit the truth of its ill-conceived sell-out and should not continue with this hyprocrisy. But, of course, we know that in this place for the next five or six days the Government will use its numbers to carry legislation. Thank God that as from 1 July 1981 those numbers will so change as to permit this House to have a review role and not a role of automatically acting as a rubber stamp for the Executive, for the Fraser-Anthony Cabinet. The Government clearly considers that the Australian people's interest in these matters should not be tolerated. It selectively imposed rigours of competition only to serve to concentrate benefits to the contracting section of our society-the powerful-while wage earners and small businessmen and people in decentralised areas have to pay for this pampering and the so-called qualities of free enterprise which corrupt and which are corrupting the way in which the Fraser Government operates. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of all this ideological undermining we also have the Government's continued inability and unwillingness to grasp the essential importance of a good main roads system in this country. The Motorists association, as I said the other day when speaking to a report, has been wringing its hands in despair for years at the steady decline in real terms in road funding. It is the public which suffers in terms of road accidents and deaths, dangerous and unsatisfactory road conditions, loss of time in travelling, loss of income and increased costs in energy and for repairs. But the Government claims that it is interested in conserving fuel, and that it is concerned about road safety and the basic interest of the Australian people. Let us look at what the National Roads and Motorists Association in New South Wales has said about this. That body recently carried out a survey on the new Liverpool to Mittagong freeway which was a product of capital expenditure allocated during the Whitlam period by the then Minister for Transport, the honourable Charles Jones. The survey showed that following the construction of that 64-kilometre road there would be an estimated saving in one year of 370 serious crashes, including 150 casualty crashes, with 300-odd people injured. This type of expenditure is therefore of great value in eliminating some of the needless fatalities and crashes that occur in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people may well come up with varying figures as to what our road accidents cost the economy as a whole. A figure has been suggested by those who have some interest in the area of road safety. A figure of $1,000m has been mentioned as a cost of fatalities and accidents in this country. That figure has been used by those involved in this area for the last seven or eight years. Consequently, one is entitled to say that, taking into account inflationary factors, this figure would be closer to $2,000m. In the April/May issue of Open Road, the NRMA journal-no one could say that is a journal that is any way influenced by my side of politics-it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The NRMA estimates that completion of the F3-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Sydney-Newcastle expressway-</PARA>
<PARA> Should result in an annual saving of 21 lives, 420 injuries and a cut of 920 in the number of recorded crashes. This estimate is based on current crash figures, and on studies which show freeways to be up to five times safer than conventional two-lane highways. </PARA>
<PARA>The paper goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> There should also be enormous saving in fuel each year. A car with a fuel consumption of 11 litres/100 kilometres . . . could save up to $1.30 on a trip from Wahroonga to Newcastle. This saving, spread across the estimated 12,500 vehicles which make the trip daily, could produce savings worth about $4.5m a year. </PARA>
<PARA>So the saving, on those figures alone, almost pays for the construction costs of the roads that we are concerned about. An extract from An Assessment of the Australian Road System 1979 shows quite clearly that this Government's allocation to roads is declining as against the States' allocation to roads. For example, in the period 1979-80 to 1983-84 the Commonwealth's annual growth rate is estimated at 5 per cent, the State annual growth rate is estimated at 11.1 per cent and the local growth rate is estimated at 9.5 per cent. That estimate is based on current prices. The 1976-77 prices show a decline in the Commonwealth's average annual growth rate of 1.4 per cent, while the States had an increase of 8.5 per cent and local government had an increase of 8.1 per cent. On these figures alone, it can be established clearly that the Commonwealth is not playing its part as far as road funds are concerned. (Quorum formed). On behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Roads Grants Bill. It is significant because of the influence on the legislation from the Advisory Council on Inter-government Relations. It is probably the first time that that body has seriously influenced any of the legislation before the Parliament. I believe it is important that we should recognise it on this basis. It is important, accordingly, to consider that that body comprises members from both chambers of the Parliament, and from both major parties, members from every State Parliament, from all parties, and local government, both city and country members, and other citizens as well. I have only recently joined the Council so I have had no part in the preparation of its report, but I recommend to all senators that it should be read, starting with Senator Gietzelt. It is important to see how much of that report has wound up in this legislation and the thinking behind it. Of course, that report was written with the consensus of Federal, State and local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of all the things that we agree on there is really only one clause-recommendation 28-that Senator Gietzelt referred to in his speech. The same applies to the Bill before the Senate. Senator Gietzelt spent the whole of his speech talking about one clause and systematically ignored the rest of the Bill. I think it is important that we look at what has happened in this regard and at the way the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations has worked on the matter. The ACIR is conscious that it is primarily concerned with the relationship amongst governments, and that is the basis under which this report and others have been formulated. Within the main objective, the Council has attempted to describe role and relationship, identify the problems, develop and analyse the possible alternative relationship processes and recommend on possible optimum relation processes. These are the sorts of things that have gone into this legislation. They show through very much. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council came up with four items in its conclusion. Firstly, the Council saw a need to provide an environment conducive to forward planning, Secondly, it took the view that all three spheres of government have an important role to play. Thirdly, it stated that each sphere of government should have clearly defined functions and responsibilities. Fourthly, it suggested that the determination of the classification should involve all the governments concerned. All these aspects are now part of the Bill. The Council considered, in clause 28 of the report, that the States should be responsible for the physical construction and maintenance of national highways. That is the major difference to be seen from all the work that has gone into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council, at clause 302 of its report, concluded that in general the relationships between the three spheres of government in the roads field were sound. The Council secretariat was impressed by the obvious desire to achieve as harmonious a relationship as possible. From the way Senator Gietzelt was carrying on, it sounded as though this had been done under great difficulty; but this is not so. The composition of the Council is something that has to be seen to be fully understood. All the members present were from different parliaments and of different political persuasions and views. There were no reporters and no advisers present. The meeting was very open and great credit should be paid for the way it has been set up. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important issues of the Bill is that the categories of roads have been reduced from eight to three. Everybody wanted the number of categories reduced. We are now down to the categories of national, arterial and local roads. The quotas, which have been a difficulty in the past, have now disappeared. Funding has got under way. It is well started. There was an 11 per cent increase this year and there will be a 9 per cent increase next year. If Senator Gietzelt had read the relevant announcement, instead of saying how much the figures were reduced, he would have said that these national road appropriations for 1982-83 and 1983-84 should be regarded solely as a minimum planning base at this stage. The amounts currently specified in the Bill will be substantially supplemented when subsequent amendments are made to the legislation to appropriate funds for the balance of the five-year program. That aspect seems to have escaped his view at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that existis is that there is complete panic in Tasmania. The Tasmanian Minister has gone completely berserk. He has developed a complete paranoia in regard to responsibility on this matter. He has stirred up the total work force. The work force is sound, solid and completely reliable. With a whole series of radio, Press and television and telex messages all over the place he has got the work force in a total panic. Be it on his head; he will have to answer for this. He has managed to stir up all these people with a remarkable shortage of facts. It is all over the question of calling tenders for national highways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the whole, I do not approve. Meetings have been held all around Tasmania. There have been letters, telegrams all sorts of things. People have come to my home and to my office. I have been able to talk to a lot, but not to as many as I would like. I am still trying to catch up with the correspondence to give the people more of the facts. The theatricals that have been going on will take a long time to unlock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main roads Department labour force in Tasmania is first class and works very well. I have no doubt that if the time comes it will show that it is as efficient as can possibly be expected. It will show that it is as effiicient as any other work force in the road area. I am surprised-in fact, I am terribly disappointed-at the lack of confidence the Tasmanian Government has in its own work force. I think this fear is completely unjustified. I regret the men who are involved in these meetings and in writing letters have purely and simply been used as bait on a rather poor party political hook. If the Tasmanian Main Roads Department does not win all the contracts, it will be for one of two reasons. It will either be that the figure presented by way of tender is absolutely hopelessly loaded with overheads or it has been put together by incompetents. If we have to listen to this fear about mainland contractors swamping Tasmania, we must consider some aspects. Incidentally, the public contract basis in Tasmania is not 50 per cent; it is 100 per cent for main roads contracts. That is the way it is. I see no reason why it will change. I do not think anybody has yet come up with one fact to indicate that it is likely to change. </PARA>
<PARA> If a contractor from the mainland is attempting to undertake a job in Tasmania, he has to pay freight and incur costs in respect of the time involved in locating equipment and getting it to Tasmania. He has to pay fares and accommodation for administrative officers and other members of the work force. He has to hire specialists such as surveyors and engineers locally. Private contractors have to make an allowance for depreciation of equipment which the Department does not have to do. The department does not have to pay payroll tax, sales tax or workers compensation insurance. If it cannot obtain jobs with that type of advantage, with local knowledge and an experienced crew it is an absolute disgrace. I hope that what comes out of this is that the Department and the Tasmanian Government will be able to look at their own affairs, study overheads and also look at the ratio of administration to work force. I hope that benefit will come out of that examination. I deplore the stance that has been taken by my own Tasmanian Goverment and the attitudes that have been expressed in putting this absolute fear into ordinary decent working men all round Australia when there is absolutely no cause for it. There is nothing to indicate that there is any basis for fear. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I will endeavour to commence my speech on the second reading of the Roads Grants Bill. Tonight we are witnessing a scandalous situation. It is now 17 minutes past 12 on Thursday morning. We are dealing with a very important Bill and no doubt the Government hopes that, by keeping the Senate here at this late hour, opposition members will be restricted from making the comments that they should make. We have witnessed this sort of thing before. The Government seems to be in greater disarray during this session of Parliament than it has been since it came to office in 1975. We all know the reason. Government supporters are running around like headless chooks because of their problems not only in Canberra but also in all of the Liberal States. No doubt, when I refer to some of the things that have been said by the Ministers for Roads in non-Liberal States I will throw a cat among the pigeons. I refer particularly to Senator Bjelke-Petersen because I intend to quote what Mr Hinze, the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police has said. I will be very surprised if she does not take some notice of his pleas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt has moved on behalf of the Opposition an amendment to the motion for the second reading. I will not take the time of the Senate to repeat it. It will be available in Hansard. I note that Senator Archer of Tasmania was somewhat critical of Senator Gietzelt for dealing at length with one clause of the Bill. If the legislation is passed-I hope that it will not be-it will make it compulsory for all State road authorities to let their work out to tender. Senator Archer may not think that that is a very significant provision but it is very important to a great many State Ministers and to people who have placed great faith in State road construction authorities over the years and have applauded them for the work that they have done, as I have myself in South Australia in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) the following appears:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that grants for national roads construction works will be conditional upon tenders being called and dealt with in accordance with approved arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Our intention to include such a requirement in future roads legislation was foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his 1980 election policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA>What a pity that so very few of the things that were foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975, 1977 and 1980 have not been put into effect. Most of his policy promises have been broken, but the Minister for Transport has latched on to this proposal, which he says was forecast by the Prime Minister. He claims that the Bill merely honours that election undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter has also been discussed at some length with State Roads Ministers at meetings of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who was not aware of the real situation could be led by those remarks to think that the Minister had obtained the full agreement of the States Roads Ministers. As my colleague Senator Gietzelt has pointed out, the Minister has obtained the agreement of not one of them; all are opposed to the Bill. The Minister added:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that only by the creation of a competitive environment can it be sure that maximum value is being obtained from its very substantial outlays on national roads. State and Northern Territory road authorities will not be precluded from undertaking works using their own day labour forces. It will be open to State authorities to submit bids for the works in competition with private contractors. The requirement will apply to all works commencing after 31 August 1981 for which tenders have not already been called. Detailed administrative arrangements are still to be finalised in consultation with the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate is being called upon to pass a Bill in respect of which the Minister has stated that he has had consultation with the States, but then adds that the detailed administrative arrangements are still to be finalised in consultation with the States. We find a complete contradiction in those paragraphs of the Minister's second reading speech. After being led to believe that the Minister has reached agreement with the States, we are told that final arrangements cannot be worked out until he has had consultations with them. To find such wording in second reading speeches presented by this Government is not new. </PARA>
<PARA> I am especially interested in the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>It will be open to State authorities to submit bids for the works in competition with private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA>In my own State of South Australia, Mr Tonkin became the Premier of the Liberal Government in 1979. (Quorum formed). Since the 1979 election in South Australia, when a change of government took place, we have seen a rapid deterioration of the work force in the Highways Department of that State. The Department has a very proud record. Similarly, the work force of the Engineering and Water Supply Department has been severely run down. The Minister points out in his second reading speech that State authorities will be able to tender for their own works, but we have to realise that all of the specifications and designs for road works will be drawn up in the offices of the respective Ministers in the States. The State authorities will then have an opportunity to submit a tender. In South Australia, where the Government is deliberately running down the State work force, an effort will be made to ensure that the tender by the State authorities is so high that they will not get the work. The Government there will want to pass it on to some of its wealthy friends, the private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that those contractors will be all alerted to the fact that the State tender will be very high. Then, in turn, they will put in higher tenders than they would submit normally. Thus, instead of getting cheaper work, we will get dearer work, carried out by private contractors. I am reminded of a cartoon in the Canberra Times yesterday, based on the arguments abroad now about public funding of elections. The cartoon depicted Mr Fraser with his arm up, standing above Mr Lynch and talking about corruption. We see Mr Lynch with a bag alongside and smoking a good cigar. Private enterprise is seen shovelling dollars into the bag; he is the bag carrier. Similarly, under the system proposed in the Bill, we will find private enterprise contractors shovelling dollars into the bag for the election campaign funds of the Liberal Party. At the same time, our State work force will be run down. Already in South Australia we find private contractors given work without having the necessary machinery to perform it. </PARA>
<PARA> So what happens? They are hiring it at very cheap rates from the State Liberal Government to carry out the work. They are wearing out the machinery. We are losing expertise. When we get back into government at the next election we will have no proper machinery because it will all be worn out and we will have no expertise. It will cost us many millions of dollars to build up the proper equipment necessary to carry on the good work that was carried out in South Australia under the previous roads Minister, Mr Virgo, and to replenish our skilled work force. Then we will be accused of not being able to handle the finances of the State. Those are the tactics of Liberal governments everywhere. That is what they do. </PARA>
<PARA> I sound that warning. I am not the only one who has sounded it. It has been sounded by Mr Hinze, who referred to the great rundown of the work force. I sound that warning. That is what is happening in South Australia. It will go on happening. Every week people coming to my office in the town of Murray Bridge say that to retain a job in the Engeering and Water Supply Department or the Highways Department they have to travel up to 200 miles to work on Monday morning and 200 miles home again on Friday night. That causes not only great expense but also social problems. We are going to see broken homes because mothers are at home all week trying to look after children while dad is away in a camp somewhere doing the work. Yet the Liberal Party says: 'We look after people. We are conscious of the problems of the work force'. It is no more conscious now than it ever was. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote some of the things that have been said in this regard by not only the Premier and Ministers in New South Wales but also by some of Labor's shadow Ministers and some Liberal-Country Party Ministers. A couple of weeks ago in the Adelaide News there was a big headline which read: 'Tonkin warns cuts may cost SA jobs'. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA> The retrenchment of some State Government workers was not ruled out today by the Premier, Mr Tonkin. </PARA>
<PARA> He sounded the warning following tight restrictions on Federal funding of the State. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we see in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The late hour of the night is getting to me. He would certainly never be Premier of that State because there is no gerrymander there. Under a democratic election system he would never be the Premier of any State. I am sorry I made that mistake. However, he is the Premier of Queensland. (Quorum formed). As I was saying, Mr Hinze comes from Queensland where he is the Minister responsible for roads. He has called on all Queensland senators in particular to oppose this Bill. Mr Hinze is the man who has said he will take over the premiership from Mr Bjelke-Petersen in a very short time. No doubt he has had consultations with his leader, who in turn would have had consultations with his wife and impressed upon her the need to oppose this legislation. I hate to think what might happen if Senator Bjelke-Petersen does not cross the floor tonight to oppose this legislation, when she goes back to Kingaroy on Saturday morning. We may not see her back here next week. A report in the Courier-Mail of 24 May about Mr Hinze reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'As Main Roads and Local Government Minister for this State, I will not allow local authorities to be thrown to Canberra's bureaucratic wolves' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hinze said there had not been enough consultation with the States on the legislation, and all States were strongly opposed to the Federal Government's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA>They are Mr Hinze's words. Yet Senator Baume, in one part of his second reading speech, said that there have been consultations. Then he said that when the legislation has been passed he will sit down and have the consultations. So we do not know who to believe. I think this would be one of the very few occasions when I would be prepared to believe what Mr Hinze said. There was quite a big article in the Courier-Mail of 21 May. The headline was: 'Hinze calls up jobs aid'. The dateline is Longreach and the article states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The Main Roads Minister, Mr Hinze, has mustered nation-wide support against Federal Government legislation which threatens thousands of jobs including 400 in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In a telephone hook-up with Labor and non-Labor Ministers in all States, he gained their support to fight the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The proof of the pudding will be here tonight when we see how many honourable senators who belong to his party are prepared to stand behind him and to fight this legislation. The shadow Minister in South Australia, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Jack Wright, was quoted in the Adelaide News of Thursday, 21 May. The headline to the article was: 'Wright calls for road push'. The article states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The transport Minister, Mr Wilson, was called on today for assurance that the Stuart Highway would be completed on time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am surprised that the only South Australian senator in the chamber tonight to speak against this legislation is Senator Messner. Senator Jessop has been a great advocate of road works in South Australia. The Stuart Highway has been debated in here on many occasions, but Senator Jessop is not here tonight to put a case for the Stuart Highway. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> 'At the last election, the Tonkin Government made a firm pledge that the Stuart Highway would be sealed within five years,' the Acting opposition Leader, Mr Wright, said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Tonkin election policy also said if elected a State Liberal Government would immedately confer with the Federal Government to have the sealing of the highway declared a 'special project.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'Unfortunately Mr Wilson's Federal connections have not come good over road funding. And next year's allocation to South Australia represents a decrease in real terms . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will prove that with some figures that were sent to me by telex today and by the figures cited in the Adelaide Advertiser by Mr Wilson, the South Australian Liberal Transport Minister. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright accused Mr Wilson of refusing to 'stand up' to his Liberal counterpart in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>I take it that Mr Wilson has many friends from South Australia who will refuse tonight to stand up to their counterparts and to the Minsiter here. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wilson said the project was running on schedule and was expected to be completed by 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet he said during the election campaign that it would be completed in five year's time-by 1984. So he is already two years behind schedule but he says it is running on schedule. We cannot believe a word that these Liberal or Country Party Ministers say. I will now quote the words of Mr Wilson, the South Australian Minister. They are reported in the Adelaide Advertiser of Saturday, 30 May, which is only a few days ago. The article is headed: 'Grants to SA down: Wilson'. the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> SA was disadvantaged in its road grants allocation, the Minister for Transport, Mr Wilson, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> SA had received 8.2 p.c. of this year's national allocation, a slow decrease from 11.1 p.c. in 1968-69. </PARA>
<PARA> SA had 9.7 p.c. of Australia's vehicles, 16 p.c. of national roads, 12.2 p.c. of the length of all roads, 15.5 p.c. of the area and 9.3 p.c. of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> Through kilometres travelled, South Australians were contributing 9.7 p.c. of fuel taxes, which was the main revenue earner for road grants. </PARA>
<PARA> ''We are at least entitled to that percentage of the allocation which would increase our present share by $10.1m.,'' Mr Wilson said. </PARA>
<PARA> ''It is money SA is in need of and deserves. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ''A fairer allocation to all States may involve the Federal Government realising that more money should be spent on roads. </PARA>
<PARA>Today I received a telex from Mr Ross Williams, who is the President of the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia. In the telex he repeats some of the figures cited by Mr Wilson. The telex is addressed to Senator McLaren. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Association Council urge you protest South Australia's declining share of road grants in 1981 Bill which now provides all time low of 8.2 per cent of Australian national sum for State having 9.3 per cent of population 9.7 per cent of vehicles and 12.2 per cent of roads. </PARA>
<PARA>The telex is signed by Ross Williams, President of the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia. No doubt Government senators, like my colleagues, got one of these telexes. Are Government senators going to stand up for the organisations in South Australia? Are they going to stand up for the plea made by Mr Wilson, a member of their own party. I can see Senator Missen shaking his head. They are not going to do it. I do not know what he is going to do in relation to Victoria. No doubt, no plea has come from Victoria on this matter. They are in such disarray there. They have just pitchforked the Premier and there is a new Premier to be installed, I think, on Friday. Apparently they are in such a disarray in Victoria that there will be no plea from there. Let us look at what Mr Wran said yesterday. Those honourable senators who were fortunate enough to see him interviewed on television last night would have heard what he had to say. He spoke about what will happen. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wran said every local government area in NSW would suffer from the cutbacks in federal funds to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague Senator Gietzelt, in his speech in the debate on the motion for the second reading, referred to some of the areas and towns in South Australia which will see numbers of people thrown out of work because of these cutbacks. Mr Wran is reported in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Seeing that tenders are let by the Department of Main Roads, presumably the department will have to submit tenders to itself. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very point I made earlier. In the case of South Australia we will find a government advising its wealthy supporters that they ought to submit a certain type of tender. They will submit a higher tender because they want to run the whole public sector down. They are on record as doing that. Only about a month or six weeks ago 10,000 public servants demonstrated in Victoria Square in Adelaide against the threat to their jobs. There were 10,000 people present. It is pretty hard to get 10,000 people to a protest march in Adelaide. The only time I think as many people as that attended a rally was when the insurance companies were protesting against Senator Wheeldon's legislation. Of course, the insurance companies paid their employees to attend the rally. The people who attended this rally were not paid because they were not at work. Senator Jessop was the organiser. He admitted that in this chamber. As my colleague Senator Wheeldon said, Senator Jessop organised the rally and got the people there. He is one of the great supporters of private enterprise. I remind people that they ought to look at the cartoon which appeared in yesterday's Canberra Times showing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Lynch, the bagman, getting the bag full with all the donations from private enterprise friends. Mr Wran went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But apart from its essential inanity, this new Commonwealth legislation endangers the jobs of nearly 1,000 men in local government areas throughout NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>It will not be very long before we will be having a State election in New South Wales. The Liberals will get a rude awakening when they look at the figures which come out of the ballot box. The sooner we have an election in Victoria we will see a similar thing. The sooner we have an election in South Australia we will see a similar result again. Of course, then the Labor Party will be getting very close to having a majority on the Loan Council. As sure as the sun rises in the east the next time we have a Federal election the Labor Party will be in government in this place and the people of Australia will be able to get the things that they are entitled to have. I go back to the threat Mr Hinze has made. This is very important. It will have a big bearing on this legislation even if it is passed. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hinze, who was told on Monday by State Cabinet to mount a case against Canberra, said he might enlist the support of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA>He has been told that by State Cabinet. As I said in this place earlier, State Cabinet is presided over by one Joh Bjelke-Petersen whose wife sits in this place as a senator. I hate to think what measures will be dealt out to her when she goes to Kingaroy on Saturday if she supports this legislation. In relation to Mr Hinze the article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> As a senior minister on that body, he was prepared to call an extraordinary meeting from which the Federal Government would be excluded to fight Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>The real old Queenslanders will do the same thing again-fight Canberra. We will see. Queenslanders have the opportunity now to see whether Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who has her first opportunity in voting on this matter, will stand up and fight Canberra as her husband has over the years, even when we were in government. Irrespective of what we were doing for the State Queensland had to down Canberra. We will see. I am sure that Senator Bjelke-Petersen just cannot afford not to take notice of the call sent forth by Mr Hinze and the decision taken in the State Cabinet that this legislation has to be defeated. The hour is getting late. I could say a lot more on behalf of my State of South Australia but I might leave those remarks to the Committee stage. I support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Gietzelt, to the motion for the second reading. I will be giving full support to the amendments we will be moving in the Committee stages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this Roads Grants Bill 1981 because I am vitally interested in the matter before us, that is, funding of roads. I do not think there would be one honourable senator in this chamber who has worked for the Main Roads Department for 14 years, as I did before I was married. I was secretary to the Main Roads Commissioner in Queensland for three years so I really feel that funding of roads is a subject about which I am fairly knowledgeable. Of course, as the wife of the Premier of Queensland-I draw Senator McLaren's attention to the fact that my husband is Premier of the great State of Queensland; I realise that New South Wales does need a new Premier and I think my husband would do a very good job for New South Wales-I have travelled that State from north to south and east to west during the past 10 or 11 years. I can speak from my experience about the huge road network we have in Queensland and the need there is for good roads between our many decentralised cities and country towns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland actually is the most decentralised State in the Commonwealth. We have nine towns with populations of over 30,000 people. We have vast mining areas and more towns are being developed each year. Needless to say, in the far outback there is a need for good roads. In fact, I venture to say that some of the people who live in the far outback might wonder what bitumen really is. Because of all this I draw the attention of the Senate to a very real and disturbing problem that is affecting all of Queensland and all Queenslanders-that is the problem of inadequate funding for road maintenance and construction. In fact, the lack of adequate road funding is the biggest single difficulty facing the local authorities in Queensland at present. The Queensland road network covers some 192,000 kilometres, including 40,200 kilometres of declared roads which are the direct responsibility of the Main Roads Department. Local authorities throughout Queensland are experiencing extreme difficulties in maintaining and financing road projects because, I am sorry to say, of the Federal Government's belt-tightening. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my maiden speech, last year Queensland motorists paid the Commonwealth Government approximately $667m in fuel taxes. Yet in our State they were returned only $117m in the form of road funding. When one considers the vast area of Queensland, one realises that the situation is unfair both to Queensland and Queenslanders. Queensland also has a high population growth. I am sure that when the result of the census which is to be taken at the end of this month is released, honourable senators will see that Victoria has lost population and that New South Wales is finding it hard to keep its numbers up. One thing I am quite sure of is that honourable senators will find that Queensland is experiencing a great population growth. Fifty thousand people are coming to Queensland every year, mostly from the southern States. </PARA>
<PARA> Vehicle registrations are on the increase in Queensland. In the past 10 years, vehicle registrations have risen from 700,000 to 1,600,000. That proves that many more vehicles are using the roads in our State. It is obvious, I am sorry to say, that the Federal Government does not consider road funding to be of major importance to Australia and to Queensland in particular. In 1977-78 road funding in Australia accounted for less than one and a half per cent of the Federal Government's total Budget outlay as opposed to 3 per cent in 1972-73. If my arithmetic is correct-I hope it is-that means that funding has fallen by half. In terms of the Government's priorities, road funding rates very low which, for a country the size of Australia and, in particular, a State of Queensland's dimensions, is absolutely ludicrous. As well as the oil levy, Queensland is contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to the Federal Government in tax and other revenue. The Federal Government must realise that it has a responsibility to return some of this money to the State by way of additional road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bureau of Transport Economics' predecessor, the Bureau of Roads, stated in its final report that Queensland should have received $228m in road funds in 1979-80. I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that Queensland received only approximately $117m. Queensland has fared very badly in regard to road funding allocations compared with other States. I draw the Senate's attention to the assessment of the road system in a report of the Bureau of Transport Economics. It stated in its analysis of results that:</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure in Queensland was two-thirds of the efficient allocation with under-allocations in all categories other than rural local roads. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure on national highways in Queensland was only one-third of the efficient allocation for this category. Expenditure on rural arterials in Queensland was half the efficient allocation, the largest mis-allocation of expenditure of all the Australian States. The report also states that for rural local roads expenditure in all States was above the efficient allocation, except in Queensland, I add, where it was the lowest. I am very sorry about that. I feel that Queensland has not done as it could. In terms of actual comparisons between an economically efficient allocation of road expenditure and what actually occurred in the five years from 1974-75 to 1978-79, Queensland experienced an under-expenditure on national highways, rural arterials and urban arterials. That is most unfair and I am sure that most honourable senators would agree with me. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that this unfair treatment of Queensland last year is unfortunately being repeated in this year's allocation. How can we, as senators from Queensland, travel around our State and tell the people that we are not getting enough money for roads? How can we tell them, in fact, that Queensland is not even getting its fair share of the allocation for roads? I refer to a statement made by the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, in answer to a question from Mr Charles Jones. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that some States are not getting a fair deal under the existing allocation of funds from the Commonwealth resources. Certainly, Queensland is doing badly under the existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Minister should be in a position to know. It is absolutely essential that when the next 2-year plan for roads comes up, the Commonwealth Government does the fair and just thing in respect of Queensland. I sincerely hope that other transport Ministers around Australia will be fair and just enough to concede that this be done and support the effort that the Federal Transport Minister, Mr Hunt, is making to try to get a more equitable distribution of Commonwealth funds for the States for roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland is an enourmous State with very large distances between towns, particularly in the country areas and the remote areas. With air services so infrequent and expensive, road transport is often the only means available for people to travel. The need for adequate road systems is probably more vital to a State such as Queensland than it is to the smaller States such as Tasmania and South Australia. They both received over-allocations in road funding, according to the Bureau of Transport Economics report. It was only last week that the State Government in Queensland announced that passenger vehicles registration fees would be increased by 60 per cent from mid-August to try to provide the Government with more funds for these all-important road works. This is an enormous increase and it will greatly affect the average income earner. It probably will result in a rise in the number of unregistered vehicles on Queensland roads. Why has the Queensland Government had to do this? It has had to do it simply because of the Federal Government's cutbacks. The State Government is not prepared to allow Queensland roads to suffer at the hands of Canberra. This appears to be the only way that the Government can make up the shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the vexed question of the proposed legislation for the funding of national highways in Queensland. The Commonwealth plans to contract out highway construction. I listened to Senator McLaren giving quite a long speech on that subject. He kept talking about the Honourable Russell Hinze but he kept pronouncing it with the long vowel. The correct pronunciation is with the short vowel. He must have been thinking about the baked beans man. </PARA>

He also requested that any requirement for a major shift to contract work should allow a basic day labour presence and provide three years for practical implementation, at the same time avoiding major retrenchments. He also requested that any requirements of this nature should not be embodied in legislation but should be arranged in consultation with each State taking account of local efforts.

That would serve members of the Labor Party right. Nevertheless, I feel quite sure that the Government will have the numbers to pass the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very sorry that some of the shire councils in Queensland have been rather disappointed about the fact that our Government has decided that all national highways should be built by contract. Representatives of the Barcaldine Shire Council in central western Queensland-for those honourable senators who do not live in Queensland, that is near Longreach-have told Mr Hinze that the Council could not afford to tender for these sorts of jobs. They said that a job that ran over the estimate could be a cost to ratepayers for years and that the only alternative will be to sack some men. I do not know whether the Council will have to go so far as that. I certainly hope that it does not. Local government associations in Queensland were also most upset about this decision. A letter was sent to me telling me the facts of the matter as far as all the local authorities throughout the State were concerned. It stated that they were quite disappointed at the fact that they would not have the right to choose whether to do their work by contract or by day labour. Last January, the Australian Automobile Association, in its submission to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the need for increased road grants stated:</PARA>
<PARA> An adequate road system is vital to Australia's needs. . . . This situation is deteriorating annually relative to increased needs. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . Good roads are a vital link in our defence system. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter that I really feel our governments must take notice of. The Association further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Good roads are essential in encouraging tourist traffic. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the consumer is paying for better roads but they are not being provided.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Good roads are a national asset and it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to provide the necessary funds for essential road improvements. </PARA>
<PARA>Funding of road works by the Commonwealth Government serves two very important purposes. Firstly, it ensures the quality of the road network and, secondly, it guarantees employment for many Queenslanders involved in road construction and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I was elected to the Senate to represent all Queenslanders and I would be remiss in my responsibilities if I did not strongly urge the Federal Goverment to give everybody in Queensland a fair go and to help to make sure that when the next lot of road funds is allocated Queensland will get its fair share. I make no bones about the fact that I deplore the way in which small rural communities in particular are being trodden on. The Federal Government must be careful that, in its efforts to balance the Budget, it does not lose sight of the basic needs. I believe that adequate road systems are a need and not a luxury for Australians generally and, in this instance, Queenslanders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with a vitally important area of concern-Australia's road system. It is near enough to one o'clock in the morning and the Government is forcing through by weight of numbers and the elapsing of time an important piece of legislation that should have been before the Senate months ago and thereby given the full attention that it really deserves. I would have thought that the task of this Parliament was to make reasoned, equitable and appropriate law. The Government has failed to ensure that this process can proceed by introducing a steady flow of legislation and providing adequate time for it to be debated. I would not have thought that this was too difficult a problem. Any private business that proceeded on the basis that this Parliament proceeds would have gone bankrupt long ago. To the extent that the Government fails to ensure that process, it is, of course, failing the Australian people. Additionally, it is manipulating unfairly the parliamentary process which, among other things, it was elected to preserve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Roads Grants Bill 1981, in the view of the Australian Democrats-as was the view of previous speakers-has nothing to commend it. Its main purpose, beneath the surface-not too far beneath the surface-seems to be to divest the Commonwealth Government of much of its responsibility for roads and to farm this out to the States and local government. We are getting the same picture that we have had previously-that is, that all is to be left to God and the States. I do not know what we in the Senate will be doing in the end. Presumably, we will sit, draw our salaries and play halma or something like that. If things go on in the way they are now, we will eventually be doing nothing at all in the Federal sphere. It would also seem that this Bill will insist that all grants for national road construction will be conditional upon the States calling public tenders for the works. The Australian Democrats ask whether this means the handling over of the more profitable road works to private enterprise. We also ask: Will private enterprise also dependably deal with the less profitable leavings?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to canvass at any length the familiar and obvious failings of the Government in its overall funding for roads. They have been dealt with to some extent by other honourable senators. I think this matter has yet to be seen generally by the Australian public as a national scandal. I think the message is slowly sinking through, judging from some of the contacts I have had, particularly from shire councils and various such bodies. I think it will have sunk in good and well before 1983. I doubt whether the lesson will be forgotten quickly. The basic fact is that, between 1955 and 1973, Commonwealth roads grants to the States averaged 2.73 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays. This figure has now fallen to 1.74 per cent. This, I think, speaks for itself as an indictment of the Government. I think it also speaks eloquently of the sincerity of honourable senators on the other side of the chamber who have lauded this legislation and have somehow tried to convey the impression that a good deal is being done by this Government for Australian roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The short-sighted nature of the Government's approach in this, as in several other areas that have been identified in the Senate recently, is a kind of penny-pinching, a short term penny-pinching, which I think will have catastrophic results in the long term. This is not confined, of course, merely to roads but applies also to health, education and social welfare. Indeed, the Australian nation is being put into low gear with a vengeance. Roads should be a major challenge to our nation at this time more than any other time. The whole question of transport in the future, its economy and its safety, becomes a matter of enormous importance to the nation. It is not just something that can be let slide. It is something that has to be coped with now. I think that good roads represent not only the lifelines of this country but also the lives of thousands of our citizens. I will quote some figures on that matter a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats recently received a letter from an embattled shire president saying that, at the present funding rate, it would take his shire 46 years to seal all existing main roads, without taking into account either maintenance costs or inflation. That is perhaps not quite typical but it is certainly representative of the deteriorating situation existing in far too many parts of Australia. Some points have been made to us by the Australian Automobile Association. I believe that these points have also been made to the Government, so the Government cannot pretend not to be aware of them. The Association has stated that realistic road expenditure by the Commonwealth would assist in many areas. It has said that congested roads in urban areas cause excessive fuel consumption in motor cars. This has been demonstrated over and over again. In fact, I think I saw it pointed out yet again as an important issue in the newspapers today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that the Government's actions in this Bill are completely opposed not only by honourable senators on this side of the chamber, the States and the Shires but also by that very thoughtful and informed group, the Australian Automobile Association, which represents hundreds of thousands of Australian motorists who, I would imagine, also have votes. The association says, that realistic roads expenditure by the Commonwealth would assist in certain areas. Congested roads in urban areas cause excessive fuel consumption. Sixteen million barrels of crude oil could be saved each year by the provision of adequate roads in our cities. This is an essential and urgent task if we are to say, with any sense of conviction, that we will try to economise on fuel consumption. As the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) is in the chamber, I point out to him particularly that this could have implications for his portfolio. This is surely an area of concern for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Transport costs represent 25 per cent of the costs of goods and services in Australia. This is reflected in the congestion and delays which occur in and between cities. These costs will increase with fuel costs and will affect virtually all activities of the entire community to an increasingly serious extent. I think that the problem will become abundantly apparent to the bulk of the population and that the population will sheet it home, and I think properly so, to the degree of neglect which is perpetuated in this Bill. Better roads would save travel time alone, which is estimated to be worth $700m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of road safety-the old cliche of our society, the great disease which we all prefer to ignore. Last year 3,500 people were killed and 90,000 were injured. There is evidence from all over the world that these figures could be substantially reduced by increasing the quality of roads. That is probably the most important factor, given that all other things are equal. Human nature will not change. We will have people who do not drive as carefully as they should. We will have people who drink and drive. We will have motor cars which break down. One factor that the Government can materially influence is the quality of the roads. In this way we could make a major contribution towards alleviating one of the great tragedies of modern society-the appalling rate of road deaths every year. I know that this point has been made but I make it again: If a disease which caused deaths and injuries of those proportions occurred in our society we would do something about it very quickly, I imagine. It is equally sensible and rational that we should be doing something about it at this time. The cost of smash repairs on cars is estimated by the Association at approximately $1,000m a year. That is largely unnecessary expenditure. So this question of roads is revealed as being of tremendous importance to this society. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the Government's decision to insist on public tendering by the States for all national road construction. The Australian Democrats see this as a major blunder. The States have had decades of experience in determining the correct mix of contract work and day labour. All of the States are opposed to this move of the Government. We are a federal system and we hear great talk about the new federalism. The new federalism seems to me to be a situation in which the States are regarded as lackeys and subservient. They are to do more of the work but they will be pushed around more by the centralist federal system of Canberra, administered by Mr Malcolm Fraser and his cohorts whom we see on the other side of the Parliament. That is what the new federalism really means. I think it is about time that the States woke up to it. They hear talk that they will be given more powers. That is nonsense. They will not be given more powers. They will be given more work to do and more responsibilities but, as we see in this Bill, the whip will be cracked from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Great disruption will be caused to road works. There will be an increase in red tape and I think a great number of retrenchments will take place in local work forces. This will dislocate even more the already fragile economies of some of our country towns and areas. A good example is the plight of the Tasmanian Department of Main Roads. We are given to understand that if the Government's proposals are accepted in this Bill some 470 of the 1,140 men employed by the DMR in Tasmania as a labour field force stand to lose their jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment that has been moved to the Roads Grants Bill 1981. The amendment reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Bill fails to provide adequate funds to the States and the Northren Territory for desirable road construction and maintenance;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the abolition of the discretionary power of the States to determine which national road works should be offered to private contractors by public tender is contrary to the national interest and will create disruption and dislocation of State road authorities, leading to inefficiency, waste, inflexibility and the loss of employment;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the amalgamation of the former categories of Urban Arterial roads and Rural Arterial roads into a single category of Arterial roads will lead to an inequitable distribution of road funds between urban and rural areas; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the Government has again failed to use an expanded road construction and maintenance program to provide safer roads and more jobs'. </PARA>
<PARA>I support that proposition. I wish to point out that there are two main considerations for honourable senators to take into account when determining their attitude to this Bill. One is the overall commitment by the Commonwealth Government to road construction and maintenance within Australia. The second point is the strings that have been attached to those moneys by the Federal Government without the consent of the States. As to the first point, I, together with a number of other honourable senators, have received representations from local government on that particular issue. It has been canvassed substantially in the debate and I do not wish at this late hour of a quarter past one in the morning to delay the Senate in respect of that matter. Suffice it to say, that if, in the operation of this legislation, local government is seen to have been sold out, the Government can expect a very vigorous reaction from the grass roots of government within Australia, namely, local government. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said by Senator Gietzelt who moved the amendment to the Bill for the Opposition that the legislation is anti decentralisation. I concur with that statement. Let me then deal with the ties that have been placed on this piece of legislation by the Federal Government. I refer in particular to the demand incorporated in this Bill for arterial roads to be placed to tender and, in fact, for the State governments to explain why the lowest tenderer does not get the job. As a previous Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, I have had quite considerable experience regarding the welfare of Department of Main Roads workers in my State. In fact, I led a deputation to one of the best governments that Tasmania has ever had-the Bethune Government-in respect of this matter. Subsequent to our struggle for a service and incremental payments scheme for the Department of Main Roads workers, we met the Bethune Government and it gave its recognition of the work that is performed by the day labour force of the Department of Main Roads in our State. </PARA>
<PARA> I was accompanied to that meeting by a stalwart of the trade union movement in my State who was a representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union at that time on the TTLC, Mr Glyn Watkins. He and other union officials obtained an assurance as to the level of the use of day labour force in road construction. I remind the Senate that it was a Liberal Government in my State of Tasmania at the time. We now have a Commonwealth Government seeking to impose its will upon the various States in respect of this very important matter. I am also aware of the work that is done by the Department of Main Roads personnel through my contact with the Transport Workers Union and, in particular, Jim Foley who is a DMR representative of the Transport Workers Union and also Wayne Binns who is a representative of the Australasian Society of Engineers in the Department of Main Roads. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot put the case better than it was put by the Department of Main Roads employees in Launceston in a letter addressed 'to: All Tasmanian Members of Parliament-Federal and State', which was received by me only on Monday of this week. That letter reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> At a lunch time meeting held today 25/05/81 at the Department of Main Roads Workshops, Launceston, of D.M.R. employees from all districts together with Federal and State members of Parliament, it was unanimously resolved that an urgent appeal be made to all our Federal politicians to endeavour to have Tasmania exempted from the requirement that all National Highways be constructed by the medium of public tender. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the D.M.R. provides stable and permanent employment for a day labour field force of 1140 employees not including several hundred administrative and professional personnel. This arrangement has been established and well proven in excess of 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> If the D.M.R. were not successful in securing an EARLY contract made available under the tender system (to be adopted) it would lead to the immediate retrenchment of approximately 260 permanent employees and the subsequent disposal of all surplus plant. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore we are concerned that there will be a further reduction of equipment and man power if funds for arterial roads are issued under the same tender conditions, as the National Highways. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be recognised that the D.M.R. cannot compete or tender against private contractors for any work other than Specified Government Works where as the private sector has an unlimited opportunity to tender for all works on the open market. A resulting wind down of the D.M.R. resources by approximately 25 per cent would reduce the capacity of the Department to a stage where future major tenders would be impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the limited capacity of local contract firms, most major contracts would be undertaken by mainland based sources. </PARA>

As there is an already intolerable National shortage of skilled tradesmen in Australia we feel that every opportunity should be taken to preserve the current training programme that exists in the D.M.R. Contract arrangements can only lead to a decline in this critical area. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion we hope to have demonstrated that the D.M.R. workforce can only be retained at its present manpower level by retention of the current grants system. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore respectfully request that all our Federal representatives give us their unqualified support by vigourously opposing this legislation in its present form which will adversely effect a large number of Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully, (Representatives Department of Main Roads)</PARA>
<PARA>I agree entirely with that letter. Furthermore, I point out that the legislation does not protect the employment of young people coming through the system, not only as apprentices but also as workers in the design area. If this Bill is passed and the requirements are insisted upon, who is to do the designing? Is there any guarantee that the Commonwealth Government will support a State Minister who insists that the design work is done by Tasmanians or, so far as other States are concerned, by employees in those States, and that the contracting company employs a certain number of apprentices? These are two of the very basic considerations which should exercise the minds of honourable senators when they make their decision on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, no guarantee whatsoever is given by the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, on these two aspects. In addition, what is to happen to the expertise in the Department of Main Roads? Will there not be delays in respect of the building of roads by reason of the fact that all of the design work shall have been done or shall need to have been done before the tender documents are finalised. Is that not what is inherent in what the Goverment is putting to us now? If it is inherent in what the Government is putting to us now, there will be considerable delays in road construction works because at present the Department of Main Roads designs as it goes along. Under the new arrangement all of that will presumably be required to be done before the tender documents are finalised. In that event one will have a situation in which road construction is delayed for up to three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this Bill will be to cut out the subcontractors to the Department of Main Roads. I am advised that one of the effects of this piece of legislation will be to tend to cut out the small subcontractors currently engaged by the Department of Main Roads. A considerable number of owner-operators are in that situation. I fear for the livelihood of not only those people but also those workers who have served the community of Tasmania so well over many years in very difficult circumstances and in extreme conditions in the highlands and in various other parts of Tasmania. I regard this Bill as contrary to the principles of a fair go. I regard the statement by the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, in answer to my question on 27 August 1980 that the policy of the Government is somehow related to market forces prevailing, as being neither consistent with the other policy of the Government that there should be a degree of decentralisation nor with the Government's policy on federalism. In the Committee stage I will support an amendment to be moved which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 12, clause 24, sub-clause (1), paragraph (a), lines 32 to 38, leave out the paragraph, inset the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> '(A) that, where moneys paid to the State in accordance with the grant are required by virtue of this Act to be expended on the carrying out of an approved project by way of the construciton of a national road, the State, in its discretion, may invite, and deal with, tenders for those works;'</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that, as a States House, the Senate must uphold the rights of the States and vote for the proposed amendment to be moved at the Committee stage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. Normally, when something is a matter of national importance, one receives some representations or hears of them coming a little more broadly than from one socialist government. I think it is significant that all of the telegrams appear to come from the socialist government of Tasmania and its representatives and employees. The objection is that, if the work is done by some degree of private enterprise, it will be less efficient and effective and more costly to the jobs in Tasmania which, I would have thought, will be contrary to the principle which has been established in this country in the last three elections. The people of this country have said that one of the things that they expect and want is a more efficient way of spending their dollars and getting more miles of road for their tax. They expect to get more effect from what is undertaken by way of national development using taxpayers' funds. What the Government has done and what I totally support relates to the suggestion that history shows-a study undertaken within the past two years demonstrates this clearly-that using the private tender basis, including the opportunity for government agencies to tender, is likely to produce more quickly more miles of road for the taxpayers out of their dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine has said, and said well, the socialist case, that is, that it is better to have the work done by government. He said that we must protect the jobs of the government employees. He quoted parts of a resolution of a meeting of workers of the Department of Main Roads. I received a letter some weeks ago from the secretary in Tasmania of the Australian Workers Union and I responded to it and asked certain questions seeking amplification. I then put the matter to one of the representatives of the major companies which may be a tenderer and asked him to comment on the assertions which had been made and which have been repeated in the resolutions to which Senator Harradine has referred. Having considered those, I came to the conclusion that the protection of Tasmanian jobs, the development of Tasmanian roads and the number of miles of made roads that Tasmanian citizens will be able to drive over will all be enhanced by the implementation of the principle which is inherent in the Bill. I do not think it is desirable to go into every aspect. I guess it is a matter of a basic difference of philosophy. Some believe that the way to achieve is to have government do it all, that government should use day labour and use its own planning systems and organise that which is to be done on behalf of the people. There are others who say--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection, as I understand it, is that a significant percentage of work-50 per cent-is done by private contract. One wonders at the reason for this organised objection. I do not propose to seek to incorporate all the telegrams. I indicate to honourable senators that I have a number of telegrams together with details of the meeting of Department of Main Roads workers and of the concern which has been generated amongst them. Yet, as a result of the representations put to me by the Australian Workers Union-one included the observation that if we were not careful we would import people who were associated with the Builders Labourers Federation and other more militant unions in Victoria and introduce to Tasmania industrial disputes which have not existed before-I checked as best I could for other views that have been put. I believe in the general principle that work can be done more efficiently by tender, and government can tender through the Department of Main Roads. In that way at least we will know how many miles of road we are getting for how many dollars. This is better than working on a basis of cutting out a particular allocation in a year. This has tended to lead, it appears, to the criticism of the way in which main road construction in Tasmania has been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not criticise the individual employees or the unions. I think we have been particularly strike free and particularly fortunate, but I cannot see that a change to the system will bring about all of the evils to which Senator Harradine and others have referred to as being necessarily attendant to the change of the system. Of course those who tender for contracts will employ Tasmanians. They are not likely to be able to import a whole lot of people with work experience. They are not likely to find new truck operators and bring them across. The whole history is that, wherever jobs have been let out to tender in Tasmania, some 90 per cent plus of local contractors, including local staff and labour, have been engaged. I find it very difficult to reason why, other than an adherence to the socialist principle, Senator Harradine, the Australian Workers Union, the State Government and a number of individual employees are so concerned about putting the matter to the test to see whether it would not be better for the people of Tasmania-</PARA>

It seemed to me that the first reason Senator Rae gave in justification of his argument tonight was that the only objection to this legislation, and in particular to that provision which requires tendering, came from the State of Tasmania. I realise that the good senator does not often read newspapers or watch television. If he did he would find that the State of Queensland objects to this legislation also. I am in the extraordinary position of supporting Mr Hinze, the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police, who objects violently to this legislation. If objecting to it is an indication that one is a socialist and represents a socialist government, in Senator Rae's definition of the term, we have the extraordinary situation of his claiming that Mr Hinze is a socialist and represents a socialist government. I will admit that one may say that he represents a national socialist government. It is extraordinary that Senator Rae, just because the only telegrams that he, as a Tasmanian senator, has received have been from Tasmania, should denigrate them and say that they are worthless. If Senator Rae had attended in Launceston on Monday of last week a meeting of the employees of the Department of Main Roads he would have known that their concern was genuine. They were not the only people who were labouring on the roads. They included engineers and others, but Senator Rae says that because the only telegrams he received were from Tasmania we must disregard them. The honourable senator did not receive any telegrams from Queensland because the people of that State know that he is a Tasmanian senator, but the Government of Queensland objects strongly to the provisions of this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no worry about supporting Senator Harradine on this matter. We are supporting the same people, people whom we claim to represent and whom Senator Rae denigrates. The simple fact is that our colleagues from the Tasmanian Department of Main Roads and other government employees also, are concerned because for years they have constructed the roads in that State. They have not done so just with government labour. In fact, the national roads of Tasmania have been constructed on a 50-50 basis by both government employees and private contractors. In Tasmania the Department of Main Roads has always contracted out labour to private industry and built roads itself. I do not think Senator Rae, in his high speed travelling over our roads in Tasmania which is known to all of us, really thinks our roads are so bad and so poorly constructed. The concern of the workers in Tasmania is that when we are forced to contract out in this way the contracts that the large mainland firms will be interested in are the easy ones and the contracts left to the Department of Main Roads will be those that Senator Harradine talked about-for the roads through the mountains and areas where there is snow or inclement weather, and where there is difficult construction. They suspect that the cream of the contracts will be taken off by the mainland contractors who may provide some local employees with jobs but whose engineers and other people with expertise and whose equipment and planning will come from Melbourne or Sydney. That is something about which Senator Rae has always complained in this place because every time that happens so many dollars from those contracts go out of our State. Every dollar that goes out of the State, whether through unemployment problems or something else, sets back our economy that much. That is what our employees are worried about. As Senator Harradine asked, how many of those mainland employers employ Tasmanian apprentices in all those occupations, such as fitting and turning, which are associated with road construction? They employ none. That is another problem about which the employees of the Department of Main Roads are worried. The Opposition's amendment asks only that we leave the discretion in the peculiar and particular situation which applies in Tasmania to the State Government. All the Queensland Government asks is that that situation apply to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently that is the belief of the Queensland Government. I have no brief from the Queensland Government but it was Senator Rae who said here that the only people complaining are the Tasmanians. That is not so. The people from that other decentralised State are also complaining. I think that should be on the record, and I think Senator Rae knew that when he made his speech but he deliberately did not want to mention it. Senator Rae said that the roads built by private companies, by private tender, in Tasmania were better and were built more efficiently. I ask Senator Rae to drive down the southern outlet road in Hobart. Two private firms won tenders for that road; both went broke and both had to be taken over by the State Government. We have the problem that so often we do not understand or know the viability of firms. Senator Rae's colleagues in the Tasmanian Parliament produced a statement saying that the tender system does not matter, that the State Government does not have to accept the lowest tender but can accept the highest tender and therefore look after its own. As Senator Rae knows, that is nonsense. I am glad he did not use that argument tonight. I bring up that argument because his colleagues-Mr Goodluck, Mr Groom and Mr Burr-have produced it in another place. In fact, if the Tasmanian Goverment does not accept the lowest tender it will have to make up the difference in the cost of that road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is for all these reasons that I raise this matter. We have an efficient road building organisation in the Department of Main Roads. It has an efficient system of planning those roads as it has done it for so long. The Department is experienced in building those roads in sometimes difficult terrain. Mainland firms that come in do not train the apprentices in Tasmania that we need to train. We have had experience of mainland firms that have come in and gone broke. We believe that the best people to organise the construction of roads in Tasmania and to organise the balance between public and private construction are in fact the people who have been building the roads in Tasmania for so long- in other words, the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian road authorities. That is why the Opposition has moved its amendment. That is why Mr Burr in another place expressed such concern. That is why there were huge meetings of workers from the Department of Main Roads and of members of the Australian Workers Union and other workers in Launceston, on two occasions, and in Hobart; and tomorrow there will be another meeting in Ulverstone. Nothing that Senator Rae said here tonight will ease that concern. Senator Rae is right-it is a philosophical difference. Senator Rae somehow believes that by opening up road construction in Tasmania to firms from Melbourne, Sydney and elsewhere--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no firms big enough for the sort of construction the honourable senator is talking about. Senator Rae believes that such firms should be allowed to cream off the easy contracts, without training any apprentices, and to take the profits of their enterprise out of the State to other States. Senator Rae believes that the Tasmanian firms which at the moment subcontract to the Department of Main Roads so efficiently and in co-operation with public enterprise in Tasmania cannot do the work. In saying that he denigrated anything that Senator Harradine and I said as socialist-a strange expression to use when we consider that 50 per cent of the construction in Tasmania is done by private firms. Because he believes all that and because he believes in the strange market force philosophy which I do not really think he understands, he is opposing our amendment. He has to go back to Tasmania and justify that opposition. He certainly will not justify it by the speech he made here tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right, Senator Rae. The third area was the national approach and the individual details of that, which Senator Bjelke-Petersen spent some time on. I will make some comments with regard to the tendering procedures. The Opposition sought to make the contributions of those honourable senators who supported the Government sound as though they represented a dogmatic philosophical approach on the part of the Government which denied all common sense and was a sell-out to private enterprise. As Senator Rae so ably pointed out, that is absolutely absurd. The principle that tendering is a way in which we can get better value for each dollar spent on roads and consequently more roads developed in each State represents a very real philosophical approach to getting better efficiencies out of the road funds available. The Government is determined that the maximum value should be obtained from the very substantial outlay in this legislation-some $685m-in respect of national roads. The only way this can be achieved is by the creation of a competitive environment in which the relative efficiency of contractors and day labour can be determined on a project by project basis. The Opposition has sought to make the point that the States are not really in support of this. Certainly that is not true of all States. I mention the State of South Australia where the Minister, Mr Wilson, made the point on 4 July 1980 that he clearly supports works on national highways being put to tender, but he said that there should be a three-year strategy for applying that policy. South Australia is prepared to apply that policy, and it is certainly approaching things from that point of view in other aspects of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one considers the realities of the issue one finds that across the board in all States roughly 10 per cent of total expenditure on roads is going to national construction. Accordingly, we are talking about the calling of tenders, as required by this legislation, involving an average of 10 per cent of total expenditure. I think it is a rather unreal argument for the Opposition to be putting that this is somehow going to cause widespread unemployment in the State day labour force. It is also particularly relevant to note that the percentage in Tasmania, which is about 20 per cent of total expenditure, is a little higher than average. In conjunction with that, one must rememeber that it is always open to the States to tender in these situations and consequently there are not likely to be the kinds of movements which the Opposition and Senator Harradine fear. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the adequacy of funds, we are in the process of negotiating new formulas, and the States have agreed to this approach as part of the run-up to this legislation. We know that the States are supportive of this legislation, bearing in mind those negotiations. The formula approach which is being adopted is not aimed at interfering with any State responsibilities nor is it intended that it should cut across any existing arrangements the States may have for allocating funds to local government from their own resources. Rather, the aim of the formula approach is to provide local government authorities with a greater certainty of future Commonwealth funding levels on which to plan their road programs and to overcome past difficulties in identifying Commonwealth local roads funds provided to each council. The formula approach will simplify administrative arrangements. States will no longer have to submit annual programs to the Commonwealth for approval. Consequently, a feeling of freedom must be engendered amongst the States in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention one other aspect of the legislation, namely, the question of the contraction of the number of road categories from four to three. I think this matter was mentioned originally by Senator Gietzelt. The amalgamation of the former rural arterial roads and urban arterial roads categories is in line with State requests for a further reduction in the number of road categories. One can only assume that State and the Commonwealth interests in this regard are exactly the same, and consequently the values which the Commonwealth and State governments see in this kind of arrangement must be very real and are important in terms of getting value for each dollar. The arrangement is also consistent with the recommendation of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations that there should be only three road categories. The amalgamation of the two categories will provide the States with greater flexibility in the development and implementation of their overall road programs. However, it is just as well to mention that the Commonwealth has never been in a position to determine the overall funding split between rural and urban areas for arterial roads. The States, which provide the bulk of funds for arterial roads, have effectively determined this apportionment. That is in line with the general philosophy of this Government to encourage the widest possible local participation in decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of this general matter of adequacy of funds, I mention the remarks of Senator Bjelke-Petersen. Particularly she drew attention to the fact that Queensland could be lagging behind in terms of that State's proportion of the total split up for roads. It may be true that that does occur in several States. In fact, the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, is on the record as seeking the co-operation of other States in finding a new formula in this regard. He is calling for a statesman-like attitude on the part of all States to determine a new split up in this regard. There was one point that Senator Bjelke-Petersen made concerning a reference to a report of the Bureau of Transport Economics. Because the shortfall appeared to be the greatest in Queensland compared with any other State, she said that somehow indicated that Queensland was far worse off than many other States. I point out to her merely that that particular document deals with not just funds emanating from the Commonwealth in respect of roads in the various States but, more particularly, with the total funds coming from local government and States. Accordingly, one must read that as being a matter for the State determining its own sets of priorities and how it regards roads compared with other priorities in its expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is late and as I realise I am delaying the Senate I will deal finally with two other matters which Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentioned. She drew attention, I think quite rightly, to the fact that roads are an important national activity and, consequently, are the matters which this Government is interested in from the point of view of developing a defence capability. Of course, the Government is interested in ensuring that these things are done in co-operation with the States for the total economic and social benefit of the people living within those State boundaries. It goes without saying that although the funds available are never as great as one would like to spend in particular areas, this expenditure outlined in the legislation is consistent with the Government's general economic approach to ensure that inflation is continually kept on the down track and kept to a minimum so as to get the maximum benefit for all Australians. I commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 12, clause 24, sub-clause (1), paragraph (a), lines 32 to 38, leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that, where moneys paid to the State in accordance with the grant are required by virtue of this Act to be expended on the carrying out of an approved project by way of the construction of a national road, the State, in its discretion, may invite, and deal with, tenders for those works;</PARA>
<PARA>It is pretty obvious from the debate that took place towards the latter end of the second reading stage of the Roads Grants Bill 1981 that a number of Government senators had no understanding of what was entailed in this Bill, particularly as it relates to clause 24. It would appear that they did not hear the early part of the debate and therefore did not understand that there was unanimity on the part of the States about the issue of the States making their own decisions on public tendering for the construction of a main road. In her contribution, Senator Bjelke-Petersen referred to the communication that she had had from Mr Hinze, the appropriate Minister in Queensland. Senator McLaren referred to a Press statement issued by the South Australian Minister, Mr Wilson. I referred to the statement that had been issued by the Department of Main Roads in New South Wales. Of course, we had quite a prolonged debate, as we invariably do when the interests of Tasmania are at stake, by the various senators who seek to represent that State's views in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I think I am entitled to say that Senator Archer misunderstands the intent of this Bill. Therefore, clause 24 ought to be amended if his interpretation has any relevance at all. We seek to give the discretion to the States to determine whether they will carry out their work programs by their own organisations or whether they will utilise the tendering system with private contractors. Clause 24, and the amendment that I seek to move on behalf of the Opposition, seeks to express confidence in the ability of the State Ministers to make that decision and exercise that discretion. The purpose of the amendment is so that the States may exercise their sovereignty and make their own decisions. Where, in their opinion, the work can more profitably and capably be carried out by their own day labour programs, they have the capacity to do so if the amendment that the Opposition is putting forward is adopted. Otherwise we would be entitled to say that the Commonwealth is taking the view that it has no confidence in the State road construction authorities in the six States of our Commonwealth. That is so because clause 24 (1) (a) of the Bill states that the procedure shall be done as approved by the Minister, that is, the Commonwealth Minister for Transport. There is no discretion available to the States to make any decision other than that of putting the job of construction work out to private tendering. The Opposition believes that that is a negation of the very policies that this Government claims to have in respect to its relationship with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard a great deal about the centralist Government in Canberra when Mr Whitlam was the Prime Minister. The same criticism is being levelled now against the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by the Queensland Premier and other State Premiers of different political persuasion suggesting that the same centralist tendencies are appearing. Here is a clear example of this in clause 24 (1) (a) of the Bill, which provides that the Federal Minister will be the sole authority. The Opposition finds that untennable because it believes that the role of the Senate, as a States' House and House of review, is to protect the interests of the States. The Opposition amendment does precisely that. It establishes the discretion of the State Minister or the State Government, if it so desires, to invite tenders for any construction of a national road. If there is any integrity at all in our claim that we are representatives of the States then we are entitled to say that some mature consideration ought to be given to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Having adopted the second reading of the main Bill, we say that the concern expressed by the work force in Tasmania is a concern expressed in every State of the Commonwealth. The telegrams and meetings referred to by Senator Harradine, Senator Grimes and Senator Rae have a basis in the fear that jobs may be at stake. If there is any downgrading of or reduction in the capacity of State construction authorities as a result of this legislation it stands to reason that the balance of the work will be thrown more and more into the private sector, making the public sector in the future perhaps incapable of carrying out its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 24 (1) (a) makes this a very far-reaching piece of legislation. The Opposition shares the concern of the workers in Tasmania. I am talking now not only of the actual construction side but also the supervisory and professional sections of the work force as well as the views of the Tasmanian Government. I think it is proper that the Tasmanian Government should alert the work force to what is at stake if clause 24 (1) (a) is not amended. That same concern, of course, would be expressed in every other State of the Commonwealth, as it has been expressed by the responsible Minister in each of the States. We believe that, having adopted the second reading, we are entitled to expect this chamber to look at the Bill more carefully than perhaps it looked at the Opposition amendments in the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few matters I wish to raise. I make no apologies for raising them at this late hour. It is the Government's intention that we stop here all night. If we had decent sitting hours we would not be here now. One thing I want to take up with Senator Messner was the mention in his windup of the second reading debate that the South Australian Minister signified that he was quite happy with the arrangements. I remind Senator Messner of Mr Wilson's statement, as reported in the Advertiser on Saturday, 30 May-last Saturday. Mr Wilson said that South Australia was disadvantaged in its road grants allocation. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are at least entitled to that percentage of the allocation which would increase our present share by $10.1m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is money South Australia is in need of and deserved. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite the opposite of what Senator Messner has been telling the Senate tonight. He has said that Mr Wilson is quite happy with the deal he is getting under this Bill. As was pointed out in the second reading debate, no State government is satisfied with the deal that it will be getting under this Bill. That ought to be emphasised over and over again. Perhaps Senator Messner has received a communication from Mr Wilson that is at variance with the statement that he gave to the Advertiser last Saturday. It will be interesting to know whether that is the case. We can explore at a later stage whether the South Australian Minister of Roads is communicating one train of thought to this Government and is communicating another train of thought to the local Press in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some questions to ask arising out of the Bill. I refer to clause 3, under the heading 'interpretation'. Clause 3(2) seeks to ensure that where standards have been notified to the Minister in respect of national roads a project must be carried out in accordance with the notified standards. Who will set the standards? Will the standards be identical in each State? What action can be taken against a State government if the notified standards are not carried out? I pose those questions because officers from the Department of Transport briefed the Opposition's transport committee last week and we were told that, under the block grants situation that is to operate, if private contractors are engaged to do certain work on roads and go bankrupt and the State then has to come in and spend more money on that particular road, which means that the State will run short of money for some other project for which it has programmed, that project would not be carried out. I will like to have that fact verified for the Hansard record. Also, if a road is not up to standard and more money has to be spent, does that mean that some road in that State will not be constructed that year?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to speak at length. I think the Government is idiotic in trying to get legislation through at 2.30 a.m. For the first five weeks after the Senate resumed earlier this year there was virtually no work at all for it. For all practical purposes, honourable senators could have stayed at home because of the lack of work. But we know that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) lives in daily fear of what his own senators might do when they are in the States. I wish to make a couple of references in support of the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Gietzelt. In doing so, I wish to point to some of the anomalies that exist in Queensland at present. I can remember a National Party conference in Mt Isa not many years ago at which a decision was taken virtually to take legal action against the Queensland Government because of the neglect of roads in the far north, the central areas and north Queensland generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I heard Senator Bjelke-Petersen refer earlier tonight to the condition of roads in States under a Labor government. I point out to Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who said that there are more large cities and towns in Queensland than there are in any other State, that those towns and cities were built up under previous Labor governments. The only ones that have been--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator KEEFFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all right for Senator Bjelke-Petersen to interject, but the only towns and cities that have been built up since then are in the mining areas. In fact, a lot of the State funds go into road building to help the major mining companies. So there is a prostitution of the very principle of road building carried out by the State Government. This Bill will further aggravate that situation not only in the coming financial year but also in years to come until the situation can be changed by a Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I travelled over the Bruce Highway during the wet. I know that some of my colleagues on the other side of the House waited until the rain stopped. I include the Premier of Queensland who would not go out to have a look at the roads until the rain had stopped. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator KEEFFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. There is a famous cartoon relating to the time before the Flinders Highway was built. It depicts the Premier flying across in his aeroplane and saying: 'I don't know what you are all whinging about, it is quite comfortable to travel over'. The Premier had his own plane, he was able to do this. The plane was paid for by the taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that I really want to make is that funding in Queensland is being misused. We have what is known as the Kingaroy line. All the good roads are south of that line. I refer to roads in the remote areas such as the Bynol Road from Normanton to Burketown and on to Camooweal and the section of Highway 1 that runs from Burketown to Doomadgee where the bulldust is three feet deep. That is where we can see the necessity for building roads. We have tried to get a bitumen surface for the road from Gilbert River to Normanton. We have not been able to get it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Burke Shire is one of the most neglected shires of Queensland. The roads there are almost impassable even in the best of weather. When the Whitlam Government was funding local shires direct with untied grants for the purpose of road construction a real amount of progress was made. Many of those local shires bought their own heavy equipment so that in fact, they could do main roads work as well as look after their shires. There was a tremendous improvement. When the Fraser Government took over much of that heavy equipment became quite obsolete because there was no use for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not criticise the speech that Senator Bjelke-Petersen made tonight. It is obvious that she has been directed either by Mr Hinze-without his '57 varieties'-or by her husband to vote against the amendment and to support the Bill in this House. We cannot have it two ways. When the suggestions were made originally the States cried like-I will not use a rude word. The States put on a very good stage performance. The only States that are sticking with us now in our attitude to the recommendations not only of the razor gang but also those made in other areas are Tasmania and New South Wales. I can imagine people, if they want to be hypocrites, saying certain things outside. We used to have a senator in this place who had a great record of voting against the motion that a Bill be read a second time but who always, when it came to the crunch, voted with the Government on the motion that the Bill be read a third time. He did this about 459 times over a period of years. He voted with the Opposition at the second reading stage but he was always with the Government when it came to the final reading and the passing of the legislation. There is no room in politics for hypocrisy. We seem to have a great deal of it in this country at present. It is starting right here in this chamber and in the other place. Statements are made which are critical of legislation that is projected or actually passed by the Government. When the crunch comes there is nothing but support from those people who do their crying outside. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator KEEFFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am. I felt that there were a couple of points that I should have raised. As my colleague, Senator Cavanagh, said, the real importance is, I suppose, that if we are going to be idiotic enough to stay here until daylight then Government members have to do that too. I hope that this will be the final night when we sit to this hour. I support the amendment that has been moved by my colleague, Senator Gietzelt. I felt that it was necessary in supporting that amendment to add those other points in relation to the unfair distribution of the Commonwealth road grants that were given to Queensland in the first place. The most neglected zone is the northern zone, the central zone comes next and the rest of it goes into the area south of the Kingaroy line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that I want to make relates to the allocation of money for subsidies to transport in Queensland. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is on record as having an overseeing role in the area of transport, including road construction. Any city which has a population of over 40,000 people is entitled to a subsidy. Mr Temporary Chairman, I can see your look of whimsy, but I am about to close off after I have said a few more words so you will not have to pull me into line again. This year money was taken by the Bjelke-Peterson Government and put into the electrification of the Brisbane metropolitan area. It was a job which was stopped by the National Country Party Government immediately after its election to office in 1957, when materials, sheds and other equipment were sold off to friends. Consequently, we did not go ahead with the electrification of the railway line when it would have cost only a very small amount. Now it is a major job. So money that should come to Townsville to assist with public transport is going to the electrification scheme in Brisbane. I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator very much. If Mr Wilson made that claim I imagine it was made against the background of the present situation as set out in the legistion. As I pointed out earlier the question that is open for debate at the moment with the States relates to the formula arrangements which are yet to be settled. Of course those will be the topping-up arrangements in terms of further funding. In respect of the question that Senator McLaren asked about clause 3, of who sets the standards, again this is an example of the co-operative arrangements between the States and the Federal Government. They will be undertaken at officer level in discussions with the States and approved finally by the Federal Minister. Of course the emphasis is on the word 'approved' so naturally there will be consultative and negotiating processes going on earlier in order to determine those standards which are acceptable, I hope, to the States as a whole. Finally, the Government does not accept the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the answers he has given me, to a point, but he did not answer fully the questions that I asked. One question that he omitted to answer was: What action can be taken if the notified standards are not carried out? That matter is of great concern if this amount of money is to be expended. I point out that again we have the contradiction and I referred to it in relation to the Minister's second reading speech in which he said that he had consulted with State Ministers and that consultations had yet to be carried out and certain things had yet to be worked out. Tonight the Minister confirmed that the standards have yet to be worked out, so again we have a very glaring anomaly in the Minister's second reading speech and it is spelt out in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to another matter about which we are concerned and I am sure Mr Wilson is concerned about it. He referred to it in an article in the Advertiser of last Saturday. I refer honourable senators to Schedule 1 which relates to finance. We all know that inflation is not coming down, it is going up. In the last Budget we were told that it was to be 10 per cent this year. We now know that it will be 11 per cent, if not higher. An amount of $27,240,000 is appropriated and that will be paid to South Australia. That is the only State in which I am interested. Honourable senators from the other States can speak for themselves. For the year commencing July 1982 we have a similar amount as for July 1981, but for the year commencing 1 July 1983 the amount is $19,068,000. So there is a drop of $8,172,000 in the two-year period from 1 July this year to 1 July 1983 in payments to South Australia, yet the rate of inflation will increase. South Australia will be placed at a distinct disadvantage, and I take it that that is what Mr Wilson is complaining about. I find it very hard to understand why the Minister said that Mr Wilson is quite happy with what is going on. I am sure that he is not happy. As Senator Gietzelt pointed out in his speech on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, every State Government has lodged a protest with its senators and members of the House of Representatives pleading with them to reject the legislation. Every State has done that, yet Senator Messner said tonight that the South Australian Minister is quite happy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts will not confuse me. If they are confusing me they have certainly confused Mr Wilson. Mr Wilson is on record in the Adelaide Advertiser, which was known for many years as the Liberal Party Bible in South Australia-it gave it a much better go than it gives the Labor Party-as complaining about this matter. The headline states: 'Grants to South Australia down'. Those are the Minister's own words. I will stand corrected if Mr Wilson made a further statement in the Advertiser on Monday or yesterday or today. I saw no repudiation of that statement. He must agree with it or he would have been quick smart to say that he had been misquoted. Yet the Minister has told us here tonight that Mr Wilson is happy. I am sure the Minister will keep on saying that so I will not pursue it, but it is now on the record. I still want an answer about what action can be taken by the Federal Government if the roads standards, to which the Minister has referred as being agreed to by advisers and then put to the various Ministers, are not maintained. What action can be taken to see that the taxpayers do not lose money to private contractors?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we were in government in South Australia we could not get money from the Feds to construct the Eyre Highway, which is a national road and should have been funded by the Commonwealth Government. Menzies, McMahon and Gorton did nothing about it, and it was left to the Dunstan Government to use State finances to fund the road. At that time we did not have the necessary machinery and we engaged private contractors. What happened to them? They went broke, and the taxpayers had to turn around and foot the bill twice over. This is what we are afraid will happen under the regulations in this Bill requiring compulsory tendering for all works on national roads. That is what we are concerned about, and I want to know what action can be taken if the standards are not met. If after constructon of the road has started we then find that some private contractor has been taking short cuts, who will foot the Bill?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to Senator McLaren's question is that this is a cause, if you like, which needs to be satisfied ahead of the funding for national highways being made available by the Federal Government to the States. As to the question of the standards which are to be applied, naturally this would be set out in the specifications for individual roads and is in accordance with the general standards which the Federal Government would have arranged previously through consultations at various levels and in respect of particular kinds of roads. Consequently, providing those specifications are met, the funds would be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the very point of my question. What will happen if the specifications are not met after construction of the road begins? For the first few weeks of construction of some miles of road the specifications might be complied with, but what would the situation be if a contractor who has put in a very low tender starts to lose money and then begins to cut corners, as we know contractors do? The Minister would know from his own experience in South Australia what happened when the tender was let to private contractors to construct the high voltage power line to the south-east. When the first big blow came, lots of the high tensions power lines and pylons blew over. When an examination was made of the concrete mix, it was found that the private contractors had not been putting the required amount of concrete in the mix. This is the sort of thing I am concerned about here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought Senator McLaren would have appreciated that in the event of a breach of contract by a contractor in circumstances such as that, where these matters are set out in the specifications, obviously the contractor would be liable to be sued by the Government for recovery of those funds which might have been wrongfully spent. Consequently, the taxpayer would be safeguarded in the normal way. These are normal commercial principles which the State Government would be responsible to negotiate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the words of the Minister. I support Senator McLaren in his objections to this matter. During the period of the Moore Government in Queensland from 1922 to 1931 this is exactly what happened. Contracts were let to companies without substance because they happened to be friends of somebody-a government Minister or someone else in a high place. A job on a stretch of road just south of Rockhampton in Queensland was let out to one of the private tenderers. It turned out that he did not have the equipment to do the job and when his company spread the bitumen, it did not even bother to smooth out the corrugations in the road. So there was this rippled road there for many years afterwards. As a matter of fact, it has been repaired only in recent years when the road in that area was reconstructed. It goes without saying-I have seen this happen-that when a company goes bankrupt the Government can sue for all it likes but it will not get the money back for the taxpayers. These companies will declare themselves bankrupt and like a couple of building companies floating around this country, they will surface again under another name and catch the taxpayer again. The Minister's remarks are so much poppycock. He cannot prove what he has said. This is exactly what will happen when the Government starts letting out all these contracts to people who are ill equipped financially to be able to carry out the work. What the Minister has said tonight has no substance to it. If he stays in government long enough he will reap the benefits, and they will not be nice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my practice to speak on the third reading of a Bill. It is always claimed by honourable senators opposite that this is a States House and that they are free agents to vote according to their own wishes. We have clear evidence here that this is not a States House. We on this side of the chamber all know from the record that every State government in this Commonwealth has requested their senators to reject the Roads Grants Bill. Government senators had the courage to do it. So much for the Senate being a States House. I think that that should be put on the record. Whenever these people go out on the hustings in election campaigns and try to fool the people, that they are free agents and are not bound by policy, they need to be reminded that there is clear evidence again here tonight, in the way in which they voted, that this is not a States House. As I have said on many occasions, it is a political House and is used as such. Nobody should ever be fooled into thinking that it is a States House. It is no such thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The recommendations of the DOLAC Working Party already implemented include maintenance of the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme (Recommendation 1), national promotion campaign (Recommendation 2), action to increase apprenticeship training in Commonwealth Government departments and agencies (Recommendation 3), provision of the CRAFT $1,000 employer cash rebate in respect of trades in short supply (Recommendation 4), support for group apprenticeship (Recommendation 9) and recommendations relating to statistics and machinery for regular assessment of the labour requirements of major development projects (Recommendations 15, 17 and 18). The implementation of the remaining recommendations is dependent upon the outcome of discussions with State authorities and with both sides of industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not possible to provide information on the cost of implementing each of the 27 recommendations, as many have no discernible expenditure implications or their costs are interrelated. Those for which costs can be identified include the trade training promotional campaign at over $400,000 and the $1,000 Employer Cash Rebate Scheme for the metal, electrical and building trades, estimated at over $7m.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The recommendations in the report are directed not only at expanding the volume of apprentice training in skills in short supply but also at the quality of that training. On the basis of preliminary figures, apprenticeship intakes in the first 9 months of the current financial year show an increase on the record levels achieved in the comparable period in 1979-80.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. I am advised that rabbits continue to be an important pest of Australian agriculture. The elements within my portfolio do not have a responsibility to monitor trends in the size of rabbit populations in the States and are unable to provide that information. It is the prerogative of the States, through their vertebrate pest control authorities, to carry out such monitoring. They are in a better position to give some indication of recent fluctuations in rabbit populations that occur from year to year and from region to region within a State depending largely on climate, food supply and the effects of predators and control measures.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. In CSIRO, expenditure by the Division of Wildlife Research on research related directly to control of rabbits was $585,777 in 1979-80 and in 1980-81 is expected to be at least $600,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The research is designed to provide a detailed understanding of rabbit biology and rabbit populations and thereby a sound basis for the development of improved strategies and tactics of control.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently the research projects are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Studies in population ecology, especially the effects of various environmental factors, such as heat and predation, on the size of rabbit populations in arid and semi-arid areas where myxomatosis occurs only infrequently and where severe damage is caused to vegetation when favourable seasons favour rapid increases in numbers of rabbits;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) biological control of rabbits by myxomatosis. As a basis for understanding long-term trends in the effectiveness of myxomatosis as a control measure and for recommending efficient strategic use of the disease, the development of genetic resistance to the disease is being measured. Field work is being carried out on the introduction of various strains of myxomatosis virus and on their spread and impact in rabbit populations which have a high degree of genetic resistance to myxomatosis. Comparisons are being made of naturally occurring and deliberately initiated outbreaks of myxomatosis in rabbit populations infested with the European rabbit flea;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) studies of the olfactory processes used by rabbits in communication. Odours derived from various skin glands serve for the identification of individuals and groups, and affect behaviour. An understanding of the basic biology of these processes may ultimately provide a basis for improvement in control techniques, particularly poisoning;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) effects on non-target species of poisons used in pest control. This is a long-term study of the effects on native and other non-target species of the poison 1080 which is widely used in rabbit control operations.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Vertebrate pest control authorities in some of the States have current programs of research on rabbit control. Many of the results of these programs are made available through publication in scientific journals. They are also discussed at Australian Vertebrate Pest Control Conferences convened at intervals of about five years under the aegis of the Standing Committee of the Australian Agricultural Council. The Standing Committee also has a Vertebrate Pests Committee which meets annually and provides a forum for discussion between the various vertebrate pest control authorities about research being undertaken. The Committee comprises representatives of such authorities from the States and Territories, together with appropriate Commonwealth Departments.</PARA>
