<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the recent spate of takeover bids by major United States oil companies for big mining enterprises, such as the successful $1.77 billion bid by Standard Oil of Ohio for the Kennecott Copper Corporation. Is the Minister aware that the value of these bids in the United States during the past few weeks has exceeded $8 billion, which approximates the current combined share market value of the BHP, MIM and CSR companies? Is the Minister concerned that these multinational oil companies must inevitably turn their attention to the takeover of mining and other companies outside the United States if they are to maintain their enormous levels of profit? Is the Government taking any precautionary action to ensure that Australian-owned companies are protected from this kind of takeover activity directed from abroad? In particular, will the Government undertake to enforce Australian foreign investment policies and guidelines far more stringently than has previously been the case and to strengthen them where necessary?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1450" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government is aware of the recent takeover bids made by certain United States oil companies for various major mineral enterprises in that country. Should such mineral enterprises have operations in Australia with assets exceeding $3m, these takeover bids will fall within the off-shore provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act. Whilst the off-shore provisions are intended for use only on rare occasions, such takeovers will be examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board to ensure that they will not be detrimental to Australia. Increasing interest has been shown over recent times by international oil majors in investing in Australia's natural resources, particularly our energy resources. The Government's foreign investment policy does not discriminate between types of investors, and individual investment proposals by international oil majors are carefully examined on their merits by the Foreign Investment Review Board under the policy and the Foreign Takeovers Act to ensure that they are not contrary to the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically with regard to the mineral sector, where foreign ownership and control is already extensive, the Government expects to see significant Australian equity participation and/or significant economic benefits before approval for individual proposals is granted. Moreover, the policy incorporates certain guidelines for minimum levels of Australian equity and control in new natural resource projects. It is true to say that there is wide interest in investing in Australia and a wide variety of business organisations, including oil majors, are investing in Australia's resources. This diversity of participation promises to open up a wide variety of channels for Australian exports as well as introducing technical, managerial and financial resources. The Government recognises that too heavy a reliance for development on any one type of investor could carry disadvantages for Australia. I am sure that it is known to honourable senators that the Foreign Investment Review Board indicated in its 1980 report that whilst foreign oil companies own about 50 per cent of Australia's petroleum reserves they have not achieved significant levels of participation in other energy resources. The Board also noted that so far it has no clear-cut evidence to indicate that investment by foreign oil companies has been more or less desirable than investment by other foreign interests. These matters are subject to continuing monitoring and review by the Board. If there are other aspects in the case mentioned by Senator Chipp which he would like me to refer to the Treasurer, I will be happy to do that for him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is interesting that all of the humour on this matter is coming from the Labor Party benches. It seems to me that this is a matter of serious consideration to the parents of millions of school children in Australia and therefore deserves serious consideration and reply. My understanding is that an approval for an amount of money for a special innovations grant was made by the Commonwealth Minister for Education without the identification that that grant was to be used for such a purpose. He approved it for a special innovation, not knowing that that was to be its purpose. Since then the Minister has made a statement on this matter. He has sought to see whether there are legal means of recalling the money and, of course, he has sought to see that in the future any requests for such grants should be so clearly delineated that this situation cannot occur again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. After the last election was the Cabinet Wages Committee abolished? I further ask the Minister: Was it abolished without consultation with the then Minister for Industrial Relations? If in fact it was a Cabinet decision to abolish the Committee, was the Minister present at the Cabinet meeting? Does the Minister agree with the allegation that the abolition of the Committee reduces the effective administration of the industrial relations portfolio?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not recall the events regarding the construction or the abolition of particular Cabinet committees before or after the election. I will certainly seek the information regarding the Cabinet Wages Committee and let Senator Button have this information. Therefore, I do not know whether there was consultation with the Minister or with Cabinet as a whole. Certainly, the structure of Cabinet committees is a matter for Cabinet discussion. I want to make it perfectly clear that Cabinet and the full Ministry have ample opportunity to discuss all aspects of Cabinet government, and they are encouraged to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether any such action would restrict the ability of either the Minister for Industrial Relations or the Cabinet to consider such matters, the answer is emphatically no. There is full discussion by the full Cabinet on industrial relations. Industrial relations has been regarded as one of the most significant functions and responsibilities of the Cabinet. It has been pursued in wide discussion very regularly-almost daily-in the Cabinet. Therefore, in fact, the Cabinet constitutes itself overall as a committee on industrial relations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that last week an offer was made to the Government by at least one international carrier to carry within Australia those passengers who were stranded by the air hostesses dispute-both those connecting with international flights and those travelling only within Australia? Is it a fact that the Government's reply was to refuse to consider the second request and to refer the airline, as to the first, to Qantas Airways Ltd in respect of any such passengers in need of assistance to enable them to travel? Is the Minister aware that Qantas did not acknowledge, reply to, or act upon an ensuing request to carry passengers on the same basis as it had already been allowed to do by the Government? Why did the Government not give any international airlines other than Qantas the ability to receive requests from stranded travellers, either direct or by referral from Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines? Does the Minister agree that the effect of the Government's decision was to give Qantas an unfair advantage over its competitors in access to prospective international travellers and that this decision was not in the best interests of the public?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the approach or the circumstances that the honourable senator defines. However, the Government has made a decision to invite international airlines to carry domestic passengers over sections of the trunk routes in order to assist as many people as possible to fulfil travel arrangements. I have with me a Press statement issued by the office of the Minister for Transport on 27 April. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has requested international airlines serving Australia to consider carrying domestic passengers during the current flight attendants' dispute which has grounded TAA and Ansett aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport, Mr Ralph Hunt, announced tonight that the Government made the request in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA> He said the Government had asked international carriers, including Qantas, to give the following priorities:</PARA>
<PARA> (A) The carriage of domestic passengers for compassionate reasons, the carriage of Federal MP's and other VIP's;</PARA>
<PARA> (B) The facilitation of international travel by carrying international passengers on domestic journeys to or from connecting international flights;</PARA>
<PARA> (C) Domestic passengers enduring hardship such as those stranded away from home and having other compelling reasons to travel;</PARA>
<PARA> (D) The carriage of other domestic passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt said the carriage of domestic passengers would only apply to the routes normally served by the international carriers concerned in normal scheduled services.</PARA>
<PARA> He said international carriers would only be able to carry domestic passengers holding tickets issued by TAA or Ansett. Domestic passengers should not approach international carriers direct.</PARA>

I am advised that samples taken in January and February of this year of water from the main cooling tower and the Prime Minister's standby tower contained legionella. Sampling continued: A sample of 2 April proved negative. A sample of 22 April will take a fortnight to analyse. Each fortnight cooling towers are physically cleaned and scrubbed. Each week they are given a slug dose of biocide. Each fortnight they are given a slug dose of slimocide, which is chlorine based. In addition, biocide is fed continuously into the cooling systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr Andrew Swann, an English expert, was reported in the Age of 21 April as saying that it was very difficult to eradicate the legionella organism and that it was too soon to say that it would not be found in Parliament House again. The procedures being adopted at Parliament House are similar to those he said were adopted successfully at a London hospital. One difference is that the hospital infection was in a pipe water supply whereas in Parliament House the disease was located in cooling towers where chlorine is less important as an eradication agent. Following Press reports on 3 April, the Department of Health and the Joint House Department issued a statement which said people working in Parliament House are no more at risk in contracting legionnaires disease than other members of the public.</PARA>

<PARA>RUNDLE TWINS' DECLINE WAS UNDERWAY</PARA>
<PARA>By Malcolm Maiden</PARA>
<PARA> A study of the share prices and turnover of Central Pacific Minerals NL and Southern Pacific Petroleum NL shares shows that the Rundle twins were out of favour with investors well before Monday's announcement that development of Rundle could be delayed.</PARA>
<PARA> However, a search of both companies' share registers reveals that the major shareholders in both have maintained their presence.</PARA>
<PARA> Neither company was buoyed by the recovery in share price which began last month. Their shares also failed to react early this month when foreign investors returned in force.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact Rundle's stocks were probably highest immediately after the Federal election of October 18-Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser had instanced the Rundle agreement between Exxon and the twins as evidence of the beginnings of a major resources boom.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last weeks before the Exxon announcement the share price of both Central and Southern dipped sharply as turnover accelerated.</PARA>
<PARA> Of particular interest is the solid increase in Southern Pacific turnover in the week before the gloomy announcement-exchange executives are understood to be concerned that inside trading may have occurred before Monday's announcement.</PARA>
<PARA> Southern Pacific has a 23.47 million share holding in Central Pacific-equal to about 23 per cent of issued capital, in line with the group's holding of 2.35 million shares last May; both companies made a nine-for-one bonus issue in September.</PARA>
<PARA> Central Pacific in turn holds 50.8 million shares in Southern Pacific-also about 23 per cent of issued capital; based on Southern's top 20 list of last May, Central would have received 52.54 million shares from the September bonus issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Treasurer made a statement with regard to the money supply matter earlier this week. In that statement, amongst other things, he did state that the money supply figures for March 1981 released by the Reserve Bank of Australia on 27 April show that M3 increased by 11.7 per cent over the 12 months to March. This compares with increases of 11 per cent over the 12 months to February and 11.3 per cent over the 12 months to January. This growth is significantly below the rate of around 13 per cent recorded during the first half of the financial year, but it remains above the Budget projection of about 9 to 11 per cent for the year to June 1981. The Treasurer stated that factors which contributed to the increase in monetary growth last month were much stronger private external transactions as compared with the year earlier and larger net redemptions of government securities, particularly of Treasury notes by non-bank groups. I think it ought to be said also that the latest figures need to be interpreted in the knowledge that over the remainder of the financial year there will be large provisional and company tax payments in April and May respectively which will swing budgetary transactions into substantially larger surplus than was the case last year. This will help to reduce growth in monetary aggregates. There will, of course, be many other influences on monetary growth in coming months such as private capital inflow and changes in the holdings of government securities. These and other influences on the money supply are subject to large month-to-month changes and consequently monetary growth itself can vary from month to month without necessarily indicating any change in the underlying trend. These are some of the comments which were made in the Treasurer's Press statement this week. I commend that statement to Senator Lewis if there are further facts that he would like to ascertain.</PARA></TALK.START>

Did the Minister not express great optimism about the future of the Rundle shale oil project at a Press conference on 2 February this year? Is it true, as reported, that Exxon, the parent company of Esso, told our Australian officials in New York that statements being made by the Australian Government about Rundle were too hard?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that I expressed highly optimistic views. My views on Rundle must be taken in their overall context and Hansard will indicate how I have expressed the enormous challenge, the huge costs, the high technology and the unknowns on the journey. I have expressed enthusiasm for the undertaking to proceed because I believe that all Australians would want us to get synthetic fuel and would want these great enterprises to get moving so that we can be assured of fuel for the future. There is a vast difference between enthusiastically wanting these kinds of projects to get going so that we can be provided with energy balance for the future and being highly optimistic. I also direct the attention of the Senate to the various statements that I have made. I know nothing of any suggestion that there was advice to Australian officials in New York that we were taking too optimistic a view here. I have not heard that. I believe I must have heard it if it was in their possession. It was a responsibility directed to me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop was kind enough to show me the letter from his constituent; I am grateful for that. It is true that there is delay in bringing some cases before the Tribunal; there is no doubt that that is so. This is generally caused by strict compliance with several time-consuming procedures and also by the volume of applications received. The system is designed to ensure that each case is thoroughly prepared and that all available evidence is presented to the Tribunal for consideration. The tribunal has some 130 applications outstanding in South Australia and, in the interests of all concerned, it attempts to deal with them in chronological order of receipt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to Mr Fitzsimons's complaints. As to the advice he claims to have received-that the Tribunal would not be hearing his case until possibly mid-1982-I state that there is nothing to support this. His case is actually due for listing during the Tribunal's sittings in South Australia between 6 and 10 July 1981. That is one pleasing piece of news. Mr Fitzsimons will be advised of the exact time and date of his hearing by the tribunal clerk in South Australia. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Repatriation Commission are aware of, and concerned about, the delays in these cases. They are constantly monitoring the situation in an attempt to find a solution to the problem that Senator Bishop has set out. They are attempting to reduce the time taken to finalise applications to the Repatriation Review Tribunal. Mr Fitzsimons also refers to not being informed of the delay in his case. Unfortunately, this is correct. He has a legitimate complaint in that respect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the bringing forward of this matter of public importance concerning the failure of this Government adequately to monitor and regulate the penetration of the Australian economy by foreign investors, the Senate is being given an opportunity to discuss a grave matter which is central to Australia's future. I believe, and many honourable senators on both sides of the chamber realise, that what is really at stake is the very sovereignty of the Australian people not only over our economic, trading, business and commercial life-although that was so in the beginning-but also, because of the central part that that life plays in the social life of the whole nation, over the very structures and social wellbeing of the whole of Australia. Ultimately, we are dealing with the question of political sovereignty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Political independence is only a sham if, going along with that notional political independence, is an attitude to foreign investors which puts our mineral, energy, manpower and skill resources at the disposal of foreign corporations and investors. If a colonial mentality is adopted in relation to the economic exploitation of the resources of this nation, inevitably and ultimately our political sovereignty will be in peril. If, as is indeed the case, this sort of claim is a recurring theme in this chamber, it is only because it is a recurring concern in the community. I believe that this matter of public importance does no more than express the concerns of people in the street. In the middle of 1978 a very eminent Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA> This increase in foreign ownership and control has led to concern in some quarters that foreign interests might acquire an unduly large and dominant role in the Australian economy. For myself . . . I must say I find it difficult to determine the degree of concern. I'm not sure that the man in the street really cares. </PARA>
<PARA>The eminent Australian who made that statement was Sir Bede Callaghan, Chairman of the Foreign Investment Review Board. If the Chairman of the Foreign Investment Review Board is so politically insensitive and not aware of the concern of ordinary Australians about this issue, it is not surprising that it has performed, with Government concurrence, in the inadequate way which will be highlighted in the speeches made this afternoon. It is a matter of concern to ordinary Australians, as one can see when one moves around the community. To make the point that it is not just a matter of ideological warfare or a matter of merely common concern, one can go to the very boardrooms of Australian companies. All honourable senators would have received in the recent recess a letter from CSR Ltd, perhaps one of Australia's leading corporations, in which concern is expressed about a matter which Senator Chipp brought to the chamber's attention in the first question asked today. In that letter from Mr Aldrich, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, of CSR, note is taken of the way in which the international oil majors based in the United States of America are acquiring other resource or minerals companies within the United States to an extent which was outlined by Senator Chipp. No doubt he will elaborate on that. The final paragraph is very interesting. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is salutary to consider who would control Australia's future resource development in the absence of our long-standing and bipartisan foreign investment policies. These announced takeovers and speculation about further moves give emphasis to the need for Australian foreign investment policies and guidelines to exist and to be administered diligently. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst that is not as explicit as may be the case in personal conversation, it is quite clear from that that the management of CSR is letting the parliamentarians of the national Parliament know that it is concerned that the guidelines that exist-they may be inadequate-are not being administered diligently in the service of ensuring that the Australian economy is not overly penetrated by foreign capital so that it is held hostage to plans and schemes of overseas shareholders. There is recognition there that ultimately our future development as a nation is at stake. It is interesting that that alerted me to the fact that Mr Gordon Jackson, who led CSR from being an agriculturally based company to becoming over recent years one of the great Australian resource developers, in an article appearing in the Australian on 21 January this year, having been named by that newspaper as Australian of the Year, said that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . need not be too encouraging in fields where the maturing Australian economy is becoming self-sufficient in skills and in ability to find funds and do business successfully. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, as I will demonstrate in the following moments, that the Australian Government has supinely and cravenly allowed foreign capital and foreign investors to move into fields which are quite adequately able to be developed to the benefit of the Australian people by Australian investors and Australian companies. One need go no further than the resources development projects in this country to make the point that was made by Gordon Jackson in that article when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy has matured markedly since the slogans about the virtues of foreign investment were first coined. Today there are several large Australian companies, experienced and confident, which have the capacity to take the leading position in major projects for the development and local processing of Australian resources. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a combination of views-from the man in the street and from the leading Australian boardrooms-that the Government is inadequately protecting the Australian economy from being taken over in many respects by persons whose allegiance is other than directly to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Investment Review Board is operating under guidelines which are now almost totally discretionary. I will give one very brief example. In the uranium field we were told that foreign investors would not be allowed to buy into our uranium projects except to the extent of some 25 per cent. In other words, 75 per cent Australian equity would be required. But the Government has allowed, for example, in relation to Yeelirrie arrangements, 75 per cent ownership by the Western Mining Corporation; 10 per cent ownership by Urangesellschaft Australia Pty. Ltd., and 15 per cent ownership by Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc. This arrangement is in terms allowing it to be said that there is 75 per cent Australian equity. However, 35 per cent of the capital costs of the Western Mining Corporation are being met by Esso and 35 per cent of the product is guaranteed to Esso. There is a very clear example of how there has been a manipulation, a modification, a total distortion of the guidelines which have been heralded by this Government as being so important in securing the future of Australia's resources, particularly uranium, for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite difficult to ascertain properly the performance of the Foreign Investment Review Board, except to say that the number of applications it has rejected is a mere decimal fraction of those it has considered. But it can be said that the policies adopted by that Foreign Investment Review Board are unknown to this chamber. There is no requirement that its decisions be made known. There is no knowledge of the criteria upon which it acted when it does make known its decisions. In that respect the Government is merely being entirely consistent with its refusal, for example, to make statistics available to the elected representatives of the people on the penetration of our economy by foreign investors. It is well known that in mid-1978 the Treasurer, Mr Howard, ordered a complete blackout-it could only have been politically motivated-on the compilation by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of figures which would enable an assessment to be made of the penetration by foreign investment of the various areas of the Australian economy. It used to be the case that that Bureau would undertake a survey of some 200 leading manufacturing companies and the 20 leading enterprises in all other fields. The Government ordered the disbandment of that unit within the Bureau of Statistics, so there can be no exact monitoring by this Parliament or by the Australian people of that penetration. </PARA>
<PARA> I take up the point made by Mr Gordon Jackson that the Government should not allow foreign investment in fields where Australian enterprise is equal to the occasion. I will just very briefly mention three areas where the Government has failed to take note of that admonition, which is only one of common sense and national pride and dignity. In the area of the provision of food to the Australian people, for many years we have been used to such well-known labels as Kraft, Carnation, Nestle and so on on our shelves competing with those of Petersville and other Australian companies. But we now have the situation where, for example, Marrickville Holdings Ltd, which showed tremendous enterprise in the post-war period in Australia-changing the eating habits of Australians, creating an oilseed industry really within Australia, in other words, developing the margarine industry-has been bought out by Unilever in such a way that Marrickville Holdings is now left with five bowling alleys as its particular contribution to Australia's life. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is more disturbing-and this is in line with the point made by Senator Chipp in his question this afternoon-is the fact that during the Easter recess the Government gave permission to Caltex and BP to operate food retail outlets in Australia. What is it in the management expertise and knowledge of energy and resource development by these companies which makes them peculiarly apt to provide retail food outlets throughout Australia? There will be a $10m investment by these companies in the coming months to provide food retailing outlets, in conjunction with their petrol retailing enterprises throughout Australia, in a way which can only imperil, damage and ultimately lead to the destruction of many hundreds, if not thousands, of small Australian corner shops. What is it, in the Government's foreign investment policy, which allows permission to be given for this sort of activity which, as I have said, must be destructive?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the Foreign Investment Review Board needed to give its permission for the Caltex and British Petroleum companies to become involved in these new ventures. The permission is contained in a Press release of 22 April by the Treasurer. That Press release makes very clear the role of the Federal Government in this matter. What I am saying is that we are already becoming conscious of the manner in which the oil companies, flush with funds, will try to penetrate not only Australia's mineral and energy resource projects but also every other area of economic, business and trading activity which appears to them to be profitable. No one can make a pretence that Australian enterprise is not able to provide food retail outlets for the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a link between that matter and the next area of penetration by foreign investment to which I refer. It is an area which needs no such foreign capital. Jack Massey left the Kentucky Fried Chicken organisation in the United States in 1970, having created a $500m empire of some 3,000 stores throughout the United States. He then switched his attention to private hospitals. The Hospital Corporation of America, which he helped to create, is now carrying out the same investment programs in Australia. I think there is a very large ethical question as to whether the health care of Australians should be at the mercy of firms or enterprises which establish hospitals merely, solely and only for profit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Australia has many private hospitals. They form a proud part of our health care programs. Some have a charitable base and some are set up by groups of local physicans in order to provide facilities for their patients. But this is a new phenomenon. United States hospital multinationals are moving into Australia in order to get rates of return on their investment which are now being denied to them in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am indebted to Senator Justin O'Byrne for his series of questions and probing speeches in the Senate which have brought this matter to the attention of the Australian public. Dr Thomas Frist, President of the Hospital Corporation of America, has been reported as saying that government regulation of hospitals in the United States remains his chief concern and that projects in Australia are part of the company's plan to develop foreign markets in case the United States Government and State governments in that country apply controls which severely limit the profitability of domestic hospital operations. Their interest is in sheer profitability. This Government is permitting Australia's health care to be put at the mercy of multinational corporations whose interest is solely one of obtaining profit. They are establishing many hospitals and taking over many existing hospitals, not only medical and surgical hospitals but also psychiatric hospitals. I say that that raises a very large ethical question. </PARA>
<PARA> Of concern also is the takeover by foreign investors of Australian agricultural land. I have always thought well of the old adage that the owner's footprints are the best fertiliser that one can get on any property. But in Australia we are reaching a situation where many hundreds of thousands of hectares are being taken over by foreign capital. It is a fact that in the financial year 1979-80 over $100m of foreign capital was used to buy up an area of farming land in Australia equal to the size of Tasmania. That sort of trend is beginning to worry many people. I have here-it is not the Illwarra Mercury-the Queensland Country Life published in Brisbane on 16 April 1981. The bold headline reads: 'Farm ''takeover'' ' and the subheadline states:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreigners 'buy up' Australia as an investment deal. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear that in Queensland, as in many other States in Australia, representatives of graziers' associations and stock and farmers' organisations are becoming extremely concerned at the amount of agricultural land in Australia being taken over by foreign investors. I know, for example, that the Queensland grain growers have put a spotlight on this particular movement within our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation in which once again this trend may very well be linked to the surplus of dollars available to energy companies. There will be competition for Australia's agricultural land in a way which I know is of great interest to the Australian Democrats. There will be competition between using that land to produce agricultural products and food to feed Australia and the hundreds and millions of people who may be dependent on our agricultural lands in years to come and the use of that land to produce the biomass to provide alternative fuels when crude oil stocks dwindle around the world. That competition for land in itself will force up the prices. But it is overseas investors who are proving adept at seeing the opportunity, getting in and paying the price now. There is no mechanism-in fact, Mr Howard has said that he will not introduce a mechanism-to monitor the purchase of land in Australia, particularly where it falls below the $250,000 per purchase level. Of course, one only needs to buy up several parcels of land, each costing less than $250,000 to escape the rigours of any inquiry-if they are rigorous at all-by the Foreign Investment Review Board. As I say, as very few applications have ever been knocked back, one wonders whether it is to submit to any great torment to go before the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of agricultural land in Australia, the provision of food and the provision of health care are examples of areas where there can be no argument that Australia needs particular management skills, the provision of capital and the provision of technology in line with the normal arguments in favour of foreign investment being encouraged in this country. There may be situations, particularly in our resource development, in which such foreign investment needs to supplement investment which can be raised within the Australian economy or overseas by Australian-owned companies using those resources as security for loans obtained overseas. That is, of course, the preferable way for these resource projects to be financed. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I state that the whole thrust of this matter of public importance is to express the concern that Australia must not become a dependency of overseas capital. That spectre, I believe, is emerging. It is sensed by every ordinary Australian. The Government is failing to take note of that concern and unrest within the country; it does so at its peril. It ought to give a very firm undertaking that it will monitor and make available statistics as to the penetration of foreign capital into our economy and, knowing that, then put forward firm and stringent regulations to control and modify the depredations of foreign capital within our trading and commercial life and hence in the whole social life of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; (Victoria-Minister for Finance) (3.50)-Senator Tate has put forward a matter of public importance relating to foreign investment in the Australian economy. The Government welcomes the discussion of this important issue. It is an important issue, and I think the manner in which it was raised by Senator Tate allows us to have discussion of the matters that he has mentioned. In particular, Senator Tate referred to the sovereignty of Australia being at risk from foreign investment or our political independence being at risk. We would want to have the widest ranging discussions on these matters and involve the Australian community in such discussions. I speak as someone who spent a most interesting period-some 8 years ago-of my service in the Senate as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control. At that time foreign investment in Australia was developing as an interest of national significance and importance. I think that those who have an interest in the matter can see the work that was done in that Senate Committee and its relevance at that time and perhaps compare that with what has transpired in the last 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government welcomes foreign investment in Australia because of the contribution that it can make to the development of the Australian economy. It is our policy to encourage foreign investment on the basis that it recognises the needs and the aspirations of the Australian community. I ought to say that the basic approach under the coalition Government's policy is to examine certain foreign investment proposals to ensure that they do harmonise with Australia's interests and with the concerns that were mentioned by Senator Tate. Proposals are considered against a broad criteria which take into account economic, social and other national interests. These matters must be studied when consideration is being given to foreign investment by the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Some comments were made by Senator Tate with regard to the activities of the Foreign Investment Review Board. He expressed some concern with regard to the way in which decisions are made by that body as an instrument of government. I think it ought to be said that a very comprehensive guide is produced for investors. It sets out the requirements of the various categories of investment. There need be no doubt about information, guidelines or requirements of government with regard to investment in the various sectors. There may be some time later to look at some of those but at the moment let me just say that if we are looking at the natural resources sector, there are guidelines for Australian equity participation. The Government expects that new projects for the mining and production of uranium would have 75 per cent Australian equity and to be Australian controlled. Where this 75 per cent Australian equity is clearly unobtainable, and that is after time is given for this to be pursued and attractive proposals put forward as ways of encouraging Australian investment, alternative proposals are considered. Uranium has been regarded as a special case. If the 75 per cent Australian equity is unavailable, the project would need to be of significant economic benefit to Australia. There would then be required at least a 50 per cent Australian equity, and Australian participants would be given the major role in determining the policy of the project. So a very special case has been created with regard to equity of Australians in this important development. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are talking about other natural resources projects, the goal is a 50 per cent Australian equity together with at least 50 per cent of board voting strength being held by Australian interests. Again, there is flexibility. Projects may be approved with less than 50 per cent Australian equity, provided they are not contrary to the national interest, if Australian equity is not available on reasonable terms and conditions. It may be recalled that we introduced naturalisation provisions to the foreign investment policy to offer a framework and an incentive to foreign companies with a substantial level of Australian ownership in order to introduce additional Australian equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Investment Review Board, which was established in 1976, advises the Government on all matters that relate to foreign investment. Very active advice is sought and given, and that is pursued. I do not have time in this debate today to go into all the details of the way in which that matter is pursued, but I can certainly say as a member of Cabinet that where we are looking specifically at a new proposal or development of a proposal with regard to our natural resources, there is a great deal of discussion. In particular, there is an emphasis placed on attracting Australian investment in our own development of these natural resources areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is probably worthy of comment that a statement was made recently by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on existing Australian businesses. It is also worth noting the operation of the Foreign Takeovers Act in this connection. That Act requires non-residents or foreign-controlled corporations or businesses to notify the Government of proposals to acquire or increase a substantial interest in a company. In order for proposed foreign acquisitions of Australian businesses to be approved, foreigners must demonstrate to the Government that their acquisitions would not be contrary to Australia's national interest. If we are talking about real estate investment-Senator Tate mentioned this area of investment-the Government is concerned that foreign interests should not engage in speculative real estate investment without accompanying benefits to the Australian economy. Again, in the booklet I mentioned titled A Guide for Investors 1981 there is a section on real estate. Requirements in that field of investment are given as a guide for those who are seeking to invest in this country. All proposals that are examinable are considered in the light of their expected benefits to the Australian economy, having regard to the level of Australian participation in ownership and control of the business. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the total number of all foreign investment proposals examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board and decided by the Government in 1979-80 was just over 1,100, of which 757 were approved without conditions, 329 were approved subject to conditions, and 20 proposals were rejected. In addition, 360 proposals were found not to require approval under the Foreign Takeovers Act or the foreign investment policy. Total expected investment foreshadowed by proposals approved during 1979-80 was $5,808m-well above the $3,521m recorded in the previous year. The foreign investment policy of the Government enables comprehensive coverage of foreign investment activities in this country. It enables the Government to take action to reject or approve, subject to conditions, any proposed investment that may not be in Australia's best interests. With regard to the monitoring of foreign investment, the Review Board is kept informed of the on-going operations of foreign businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate mentioned the discontinuance of the Bureau of Statistics surveys on overseas ownership and control. In 1978 the Statistician made an assessment of the relative priorities within his Bureau, given the resources that were available to him, and it was decided to discontinue the surveys on overseas ownership and control. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The decision was taken by the Statistician. Perhaps, I ought to add that the decision to discontinue the surveys was taken by the Statistician and was supported by the Government, after considering the availability of foreign investment data from other sources. For example, the Foreign Investment Review Board examines and monitors foreign investment proposals that fall within the ambit of the Foreign Takeovers Act or other areas of the foreign investment policy. In addition, the Board, as appropriate, keeps in touch with the activities of foreign companies in Australia by monitoring progress in the implementation of proposals and ensuring that the conditions required have been complied with. Other sources are available that give a measure of the level of foreign ownership. Figures on foreign investment flows are available, as are figures on the proportion of company income payable overseas. Other statistical information is available, through the Bureau of Statistics, on the levels of equity in Australian industry held by foreigners and stocks of foreign investment by industry. A number of measurements could be quoted with regard to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think some concern was expressed about either monitoring or review. It ought to be said that, given that around 1,000 foreign investment proposals are dealt with each year, it would be impracticable to institute follow-up checks in respect of all of them. The costs of that sort of detailed procedure could become prohibitive. The Foreign Investment Review Board and its Executive are in frequent contact with the parties to proposals and, through correspondence and discussion, follow up conditional approvals as may be necessary and, particularly in the case of the larger and more sensitive foreign investment proposals, a continuing contact is developed. However, in many cases the parties to proposals are required to report periodically to the Board on progress in the implementation of their proposals and in satisfying the conditions that are applied to their approval. As I have said, some approvals are given subject to satisfaction of specific conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to ensuring that claim benefits are realised, in most cases the benefits are inherent in the proposals put forward rather than additional features designed to obtain government approval for the proposals, and it is in the commercial interests of the parties to ensure that these benefits are realised. From the period July 1979 to October 1980, 11 new natural resource development projects were approved. Nine of these projects provided for at least the required level of Australian equity-that is, 50 per cent-while the remaining two projects were required as a condition of approval to meet the guideline level before production commenced. In other words, they had some time in which they could achieve that Australian equity. Of the 17 new coal projects that were approved to the end of 1979-80 and were examined under the foreign investment policy, 11 met the Australian equity participation guidelines, two were approved with less than 50 per cent Australian equity, two were rejected, and two were approved at the exploration stage only. So there are different steps of approval that can be taken if there is concern for the national interest or the participation of Australians in natural resource development. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be said that there is a great difference between the Opposition's attitude on foreign investment and that of the Government. Sometimes when speaking to particular groups the Opposition makes it clear that it acknowledges that some foreign investment is necessary and that there are benefits from it. Perhaps it is also stated at times that these matters are approached very differently by the two main political parties. However, I think that there is an attitude in this country of public acceptance of foreign investment policy. It was stated by Senator Tate that Australian people were concerned about it. I hope that that is a healthy interest in the development of our resources. I do think that there is public acceptance of the need for foreign investment. There is a public recognition--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think that is right. There is a recognition of the need for foreign investment to add to the savings of the Australian community to enable development to be undertaken. I believe that the policy has been accepted as being fair and reasonable. It is one that I think is understood more clearly by those in foreign countries who seek to invest here. The essential aim in the features of this policy have remained unchanged for over five years under the present Government. I think that investors understand and accept this policy as being one that is sustainable in the long term. They appreciate that there is not an open door approach, and that an open door approach would not be acceptable to the Australian community and therefore would not be sustainable in the long term. In other words, if this became a political issue and there were a stop-go policy, if foreign investment were attracted and developments were not able to be completed, it would be very detrimental to the development of the economic resources that become available to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past 10 years-I think it is important to state this because, with some of the things that were said by Senator Tate, there may be no understanding of the size of foreign investment in this country-foreign investment has accounted for about 10 per cent of national savings. It is significant that 10 per cent of foreign investment is accounted for in national savings. The annual supplement to domestically generated resources which Australia derives from abroad runs on average at about 2 per cent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. So if we are talking about sovereignty and political independence, those figures of 10 per cent of national savings and an average of 2 per cent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product ought to be seen in the context of responsible policy which needs to be pursued. Without continuation of the supplement that I have mentioned, the present pattern and level of economic activity and living standards could not be fully sustained. Foreign investment has increased Australia's access to up to date technology and managerial skills which are essential if Australia is to maintain its competitive position in the world. Foreign investment also brings to this country commercial links and it offers access to new markets and financial arrangements. It has played, and I believe it will continue to play, a major role in the development and diversification of the Australian economy. This development can only have beneficial effects on employment opportunities and regional development, exports, foreign exchange reserves, import substitution and competition and provide a wider range of products or services. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are talking about foreign investment we are talking also about our ability to develop the Australian economy, to create new jobs and to raise the standard of living of all Australians. We are talking in particular about our capacity to finance the mineral development which is under way and which is within our reach. The problem with an alternative approach to foreign investment is that it could undermine the basis on which we are able to enhance that development. Relating that to the subject of this discussion, I ought to say that not all sections of the Australian Labor Party are adopting a negative approach to development. The development and decentralisation taking place in New South Wales under the Wran Government are striking confirmation of the need for foreign investment. Recently, the New South Wales Government published a document entitled 'Development Projects in New South Wales' in which the Honourable Don Day, the responsible Minister, gave a graphic illustration of the benefits of a resources boom for that State and for Australia. Among other things, that publication of the New South Wales Government states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the percentage of local and overseas content will vary for individual projects, it is likely that between 70 and 80 per cent of the total capital cost of projects planned in New South Wales will be spent locally. </PARA>
<PARA>The picture, as it emerges from this publication, is of foreign capital coming into Australia under the strictest of guidelines-that is, with Australian equity, Australian management and majority Australian partnerships-and bringing with it the highest skills and technology and new employment opportunities for our young people and for those who have the skills useful in the development of resource projects. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Labor Party was last in government investment in mining and resource development collapsed and petroleum exploration ceased. It is probable that in some sector of the ALP there is a policy that there ought to be more direct government involvement in the development of resources. This would be at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. Labor in government would be using funds compulsorily extracted from the people, through taxation or in other ways in areas in which private enterprise can carry out the function and assist in development. The proposals of the ALP to expand the functions of the Foreign Investment Review Board would probably again frighten off foreign investment in Australia, and this at a time when it is being shown that great benefits can accrue from this investment provided the guidelines are adhered to and there is a policy that observes the requirements for Australian participation in this development. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the importance of foreign investment to this development, I simply want to say that the policy of the Government is designed to serve the interests of the Australian community. It has enhanced the development of the Australian economy and it will ensure that the great resources development which is now taking place will benefit all Australians. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important matter in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment Senator Tate for the manner in which he introduced this matter for discussion and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle for the way in which she responded on behalf of the Government. However, I am bound to say that the response by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) does not satisfy the Australian Democrats. We are discussing as a matter of public importance the failure of the Government adequately to monitor and regulate the penetration of the Australian economy by foreign investors. I was very taken with the speech by Senator Tate, particularly the piece of philosophy-a bit home spun-which he injected into it. I will paraphrase what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He said: 'In this country we seem to have, on behalf of the Government, a colonial mentality towards foreign investment which puts our political sovereignty at risk'. Is there not basic truth in that statement? If we do have a colonial mentality towards foreign investment-if we say that foreign investment is inevitable, that it must come here, that it does not matter whether the foreign investors and multinational corporations own most of our industries as we cannot do anything about it-at a time of crisis our political sovereignty would be put at risk because the governments of this country would not make the decisions concerning our resources and our businesses; those decisions would be made in the foreign board rooms. Unhappily, the sort of colonial mentality that Senator Tate referred to seems to be shared by Sir Bede Callaghan, the Chairman of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I will have something to say about that in a moment. He said, as mentioned by Senator Tate, that his view on foreign takeovers and foreign ownership of Australian industry was that the man in the street could not care less, or words to that effect. If that is the view of the Chairman of this Board, one can understand some of the rather quaint remarks in the report of 1979-80 which I shall read in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should Senator Tate and people on this side of the chamber be concerned about the failure of the Government adequately to monitor and regulate the penetration of the Australian economy by foreign investors? I have mentioned the figures on foreign investment three times in the Senate this year and I will do so again and again to try to impress on the man in the street that this is a serious question because our political sovereignty could well be at risk. I will quote from the United Nations publication Transnational Corporations in World Development, New York 1978. I apologise for not being able to cite later figures but, as Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has just conceded, a couple of years ago the Government disbanded that section of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which kept figures on foreign takeovers in Australia. This publication says that 55 per cent of all mining ventures in Australia are owned by overseas companies. I would ask Senator Lajovic, whom I respect and who will follow me in this discussion, whether, as a good, stout, sturdy Australian, it gives him no cause for concern to know that 55 per cent of all mining ventures in Australia are owned and operated by foreign companies? I shall also mention the figures for the ownership of other industries. Thirty-six per cent of our manufacturing industry, 48 per cent of our service industries, 62 per cent of our chemical, coal, rubber and petroleum industries, 100 per cent of our motor vehicle industries and 91 per cent of our oil refineries are owned and operated by multinationals. Seventy-four per cent of all oil exploration in this country is done by foreigners-multinationals. Eighty-one per cent of our tin production and 62 per cent of our mineral sands projects are in the hands of foreigners. Rather quaintly, 51 per cent of all our advertising agencies are now operated and owned by foreigners. I will have something more to say about that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA> We have been informed by the Government of a $29 billion resources boom in the 1980s. I will not quibble with that figure today except to say that it would be a useful exercise for someone to find out exactly to what extent Australians-the man and woman in the street-will in fact benefit from that $29 billion boom. Today I will be strongly critical of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I am appalled at the latest report. According to the report, the Board examined 1,466 foreign investment proposals during the last financial year-say 1,500 proposals. Of these proposals 360 did not require approval under the various Acts, 757-that is well over half-were approved without conditions, 329 were approved subject to conditions, and 20 out of 1,500 were rejected. That represents 1.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Board is the Government's watchdog in regard to foreign intrusion into Australian industry. The Democrats say that is not good enough. I place these figures on record. On the one hand, payments totalling $1,547m for acquisitions of shares and assets, and prospective new investment expenditures totalling $4,261m were envisaged in the proposals which were approved. On the other hand, payments totalling only $38m for acquisitions of shares and assets, and prospective new investment expenditure of only $450m were envisaged in the proposals which were rejected. The point is that not only was the percentage of rejected applications 1.4 per cent, but also the amount of money involved in those which were approved was infinitesimal. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to read something to the Senate and to those people who are listening. I will play a little party game with the Senate and with people listening. I will not divulge the source of what I read until I conclude. But I ask people listening and honourable senators to try to figure out what sort of organisation would put this in its annual report. I give a clue. It could be the 1980 report of an American corporation seeking to quietly acquire ownership in Australian businesses. The report contains a nice chummy success story of the Americans in regard to private hospitals. I share Senator Tate's concern. He wondered about the ethical nature of foreigners coming into this country and making money out of the chronically ill in private hospitals and being allowed to take over our hospital services and show massive profits. The joke is that they would not be able to make profits out of the terminally ill or out of the sick unless it was for massive Government subsidies paid and funded by the Australian taxpayer under our national health scheme. In regard to the acquisition of private hospitals the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In total,-</PARA>
<PARA>That is for the year-</PARA>
<PARA>19 applications by United States firms to invest in private hospitals in Australia have been approved in terms of the foreign investment policy. Foreign investment approvals in this industry were expected to lead to investment of $45m. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The companies concerned are also required to admit a minimum of 35 per cent local equity into their Australian operations within three years. </PARA>
<PARA>This report makes very pleasant reading for officers of an American multinational company or a wealthy American group which wants to make a profit out of the dying and the sick in Australia. In respect of advertising agencies the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Takeovers of advertising agencies reflect a number of industry characteristics including relative ease of entry and attractive prices payable by the larger agencies for agencies with growth potential. During the past two years, eleven takeover proposals of Australian-owned agencies by foreign (mainly United States-owned) firms have been approved. In 1979, almost 75 per cent of agency billings accrued to the top twenty agencies, of which six were wholly Australian-owned. About one-third of gross income generated by these agencies during 1979 accrued to Australian equity investment. Among the top ten agencies, which in 1979 accounted for about 55 per cent of agency billings, the Australian share was about one-quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>That extract is not taken from an American document. It is not taken from the report of an American corporation seeking to quietly acquire ownership of Australian businesses. It is taken from the Foreign Investment Review Board's report of 1980. If an Australian wrote those words in this report he ought to be ashamed of himself. It brings nothing but shame to me that a group of three Australians constitute this Board-Callaghan, Pettingell and Pooley. Where is their sense of national pride when they gloat and are so proud of the easy way in which wealthy Americans and multinationals can take over our private hospitals and advertising agencies? They say in their report, almost with avid glee, that it is so easy to do. There was a response by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, on behalf of the Department of the Treasury, in regard to the worrying matter, about which I asked a question today and to which Senator Tate referred. I asked about the excess money-billions of it-lying on the floor of oil companies which look at mining companies to become targets for their oil industries drive to diversify. The reply I got was: 'Don't worry, Senator Chipp. Everything is all right. It is in the hands of the Foreign Investment Review Board'. To jog the mind of the moron who wrote this report and of the so-called Australians who approved the words, I use an Australian expression which might be familiar to them: 'Why do they not wake up to themselves?' There is a march on Australian ownership of our industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is significant that a highly respected Australian company, CSR Ltd, should point out the way in which mining companies are buying up, with their billions of dollars of petty cash, companies such as Amax Exploration (Aust) Inc., St Joe Minerals Corporation, and the Kennecott Corporation. I think it is significant that CSR sent this not just to the Cabinet, not just to Ministers, not just to members of the Liberal Party but to all members of Parliament to awaken them to the dangers which lie ahead in this field. I warn those people concerned with the championing of foreign takeovers of private hospitals that this will be subject to a searching examination in the Senate in the very near future, particularly in regard to some of the applications-why they have been approved, the ownership and the names of companies which have been taking over private hospitals-and why they have been changed to suit someone's convenience. I will be wanting answers as to why the Foreign Investment Review Board allowed those changes to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is verging on the ridiculous. Either the FIRB is not doing its job properly or the Foreign Takeovers Act is defective, or both. Why bother having such a Board if such a small proportion of foreign investment proposals is subject to rejection? I conclude by pleading with the Government to do several things. Will it look at the question of double tax on the dividends of the small investor to give the small investor an opportunity of investing in public companies? Will it again look at a resources tax? Will it look again at some way in which to tighten up its woefully inadequate foreign investment guidelines before it is too late?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp said that he knew I was concerned about the people of this country and how its industries were being taken over by foreign investment. But I would like to answer the honourable senator by telling him and everyone who may be listening to the debate that I am even more concerned about the standard of living of Australians, a standard which is one of the highest in the world. It is one that we are all used to and one which has been achieved by employing a great deal of foreign investment. If we did not have foreign investment I would like to know how we would obtain the money to develop industry and to develop exploration for mineral resources. I ask Senator Chipp where he would get the money to do all these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate referred to political independence and the colonial mentality. I wonder what Mr Wran, the Premier of the premier State of Australia would say about that? He has been gallivanting around the world, telling us that he is out to sell New South Wales, a task which he is achieving quite effectively. If the level of foreign investment is as bad as Senator Tate and the socialists claim, I wonder why Premier Wran goes abroad and tries to sell New South Wales-which, as I say, he has done quite effectively. I do not have before me figures on the amount he has sold, but according to the Press, he has sold quite a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced that local industries are quite able to do the job. I hold local industry in very high regard, but ask: Where will it get the money with which to expand? Returning to the subject of socialism-I really enjoy talking about the socialists-how strange it is that in a typically socialist country such as Yugoslavia, from 1968 to the present, one-quarter of the total investment in enterprises has been foreign investment. That has happened in a socialist country. We have heard today typical socialist rhetoric. When the socialists are in opposition they oppose everything. When they are in government, they act differently. If the Australian Labor Party were permitted to go through with its proposals concerning foreign investment, that would have a substantial effect on the economy of this country. It is clear that the policy of the socialists and of the Labor Party is one which has a superficial appeal. In principle, Australia would continue to obtain a substantial supplement to its domestic resources, but without the implications for foreign ownership and control of its industries and resources that private foreign capital entails. Under the so-called socialist plan for foreign investment, the taxpayer would have to contribute heavily in order to supplement the financing of the projects necessary to pursue the development of this country in the way in which we are accustomed and in the way in which the Australian people want it to take place. No one can deny that, under the Fraser Government, Australia has achieved an economic stability and success that is the envy of Western countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's Press we read the headline, 'Caltex offers $90m local equity'. That relates to investment in the development of Australian industry. We read of that offer to Australians to buy an equity in Caltex and on the same day read, though not in the same newspaper, a quite small article which is headed, 'TAB set to top $1 billion mark'. The reference is to the New South Wales Totalizator Agency Board. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales TAB will crack the magic $1 billion mark in turnover in the 1980-81 season. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robertson--</PARA>
<PARA>He is the general manager of New South Wales TAB-</PARA>
<PARA>said the TAB was now holding $20m a week. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, that in New South Wales $20m a week is being diverted to this form of so-called investment. If we had that degree of national pride which ought to exist in this country but unfortunately does not, we would be able with such an investment to buy in two weeks the hospitals to which Senator Chipp has referred. The total investment in those hospitals-I do not know their number-is $45m. I repeat that the so-called investments in TAB in two weeks would buy all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the statistics concerning the so-called investments in TAB, with licensed bookmakers and in lotteries. The figures are from the Year Book Australia 1980. In 1975-76 the total sum invested throughout Australia in betting and lotteries was $3,715m. In 1976-77 it was $4,099m. In 1977-78 it was $4,488m. Thus, in three years, Australians have made so-called investments in gambling and lotteries totalling some $12,000m. That figure merely covers the forms of gambling that are recognised by the statistics. How many bets were placed during that time with illegal bookmakers? We do not know. </PARA>

<PARA> The statistics on direct foreign investment in Australian enterprises show that in 1975-76 a total of $579m-or one-sixth of the total amount spent on gambling during that year-was so invested. In 1976-77 total foreign investment in our enterprises was $1,074m, while at the same time we invested four times as much in gambling. In 1977-78 total foreign investment in our enterprises was $1,008m, while we invested $4,488m in gambling. Anybody who talks to me about buying back the farm or about our doing something that we should not do by allowing foreign investment should consider those figures. They would realise that if we in this country looked at our priorities in a different way and were interested in national pride, we would have the money to develop our local industries without asking for foreign investment if we wanted to do so.

We intend to continue those policies, regardless of what the socialists say, because the socialists have only one aim-to make sure that people's living standards come down, that they become destitute. The socialists would then be able to say: 'Look how the capitalist system is failing. We will do it better'. If we look at the records of all so-called socialist countries where socialism reigns supreme we can see that the people are poorer there than anywhere else, despite all the grandstanding and grand talking about a love of humanity, a love of human beings and a love of their countrymen. But when it comes to delivering the goods, they fail miserably.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nearly half of the speech of Senator Lajovic, who preceded me in this debate, was taken up with the delivery of a long and boring set of figures, the object of which was to support the ludicrous proposition that investment on the Totalisator Agency Board is comparable with investment in industry. I am surprised that such a proposition should come from a member of the Liberal Party. It would not be so surprising if such a proposition came from another party around this Parliament. With backbenchers such as Senator Lajovic, it is no wonder that the Liberal Party has the sorts of Ministers that it has. The great fallacy in the proposition he was putting is that when people put that $4 billion on the TAB and into other forms of gambling they expect to get back, and do in the aggregate get back, about $3.5 billion as dividends. So they are in a way comparable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Foreign investment is not something to which the Australian Labor Party or, to my knowledge, the Australian Democrats are completely opposed. What is being questioned in this debate is the rate at which foreign capital is coming into the country and also the type of foreign capital which is coming into the country. The reference to a colonial mentality which was made by both the previous speakers on this side was an apt one because the mentality of this Government, both economically and politically, is and will remain colonial. It is colonial in the economic sense because the Government believes that it must have an open door policy on foreign investment, and it is colonial in the political sense because it believes no Australian is fit to occupy the position of Governor-General and it has to go to Prince Charles. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale in the past for foreign investment-a rationale which is still spuriously advanced by members of the Government-was that it brings new technology and entrepeneurial skills into the country. Whatever validity that may once have had has now been largely wiped out and, if present trends continue, will soon be entirely wiped out. Equity, portfolio or takeover investment, terms which are almost interchangeable, comprised 10 per cent of total foreign investment in 1979-80 and 39 per cent of total foreign investment in the first six months of 1980-81. In other words, there was a fourfold increase in the proportion of foreign investment which has been directed towards the takeover of existing enterprises or portfolio investment in existing enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The following figures are provided by W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd. In the calendar year 1980 institutional loan and equity investment from overseas-that is, new investment-which was directly invested increased by $84m over the figure for 1979, and the indirect investment of this type increased by $1,109m over the figure for 1979. If we look at the Bureau of Statistics figures, where the breakdown is somewhat finer, we find that portfolio investment in corporate equities, which in the whole of the 1979-80 financial year stood at $623m, has reached $610m in the first six months of the present financial year. In other words, corporate equity investment for the first six months of this financial year was running at double the rate that obtained in the previous financial year. Total capital inflow for the nine months ended March 1980 was only $600m. This year it has climbed to $3.9 billion. That is, almost $4,000m of foreign capital has flowed into the country in the first nine months of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant contributor to this alarmingly high inflow of foreign funds is, of course, the built-in inertia of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Of the 5,000 applications which have gone before the FIRB since its creation almost five years ago, no fewer than 3,800 have been applications for takeovers of existing enterprises; and only 45 of those applications, or a little over one per cent, have been rejected. Recent action in the courts regarding attempts-unsuccessful attempts, I regret to say-by the Commissioner of Taxation to levy tax in lieu of the tax avoided by such companies as Comalco Ltd through transfer pricing operations draws attention to the inherent dangers of enabling Australian enterprises to be controlled in the managerial sense from overseas. Yet this Government has made virtually no moves to restrict this trend, which is growing at an alarming rate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is being rewritten! It is about time members of the Liberal Party, even Senator Watson, learnt that, given the persistent rulings of the High Court and given the way in which over the last five or six years the High Court has emasculated the avoidance provisions of the existing taxation Act, the only way of dealing with it is with a clear, credible threat of retrospective legislation which, once made, probably would never actually have to be enacted. The takeover of existing enterprises would be less alarming if the displaced domestic capital was productively invested. Whilst there are no absolutely reliable figures on the destination of the displaced domestic capital, it is clear that it is going substantially into real estate speculation, which has the anti-social and inflationary effect of pricing land and houses out of the reach of the great proportion of the population and raises the question of the discrimination within the existing taxation system which was touched upon by Senator Chipp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If somebody decides to invest capital productively in, say, a factory-it could be some other business-and if it succeeds he will pay tax on the dividends. If it is a public company or a proprietary company the profits will be taxed as company profits and they will be taxed again as profits to the shareholder, if and when they are distributed. If a person goes into a business as a sole trader he will pay personal income tax on profits made. He also runs the risk of capital depreciation, of actually losing money either because he has been unlucky or because he has been managerially incompetent and the business fails. On the other hand, if somebody decides not to invest in productive activity and decides to speculate in land or housing, the profits gained from that speculation are tax free. It is an article of faith of this Government that those windfall profits will remain tax free. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from equity considerations, sufficient evidence is already available on the distortion of investment decisions caused by this fundamental anomaly that profits from speculation are tax free and profits from productive investment are not. The evidence is clear enough to demand prompt action from the Government but that will not happen until this Government is replaced. What is happening in Australia, roughly, is that private domestic capital, particularly that displaced by foreign takeovers, goes into anti-social speculation. Public domestic capital is largely squandered on pork barrel projects. The Ord River scheme is a significant example from the 1960s. The editorial in today's Age, which I do not have time to read, cites numerous other examples of far more recent vintage. In fact, it cites a few of the 61 uncosted or dishonestly costed promises which were included in the last election speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for a wide variety of mostly uneconomic and almost entirely pork barrel projects designed to save the Government from the electoral defeat which it feared at that time was staring it in the face. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of squandering and frittering away public capital to the extent of an incremental $2 billion, which it promised to do in that 1980 election campaign, the Government ought to be establishing a national investment fund to mobilise the individually small savings of the great bulk of Australians which could then be invested both in new projects and in holding, or preferably increasing, the Australian equity in existing projects. Given the multiple, manic obsessions of this Government-to use Mr Peacock's phrase-the massive inflow of foreign capital, which, I repeat, reached almost $4 billion in the first nine months of this financial year, will do enormous damage in the short term to the economy as well as squander the nation's birthright. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, as we know from experience over the last few months, knows almost nothing. She is unable to answer almost every question delivered to her. She takes the place of a postal pillar in the Senate, referring requests for information to more knowledgeable people in other places. At Question Time today Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle showed that even she knew that the massive capital inflow of nearly $700m in the month of March was the major factor in the money supply, M3, increasing by 11.7 per cent in the 12 months just passed, which is, of course, above the Government's planned target. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether, in fact, a money supply growth rate of that magnitude is really a problem under present circumstances is debatable. But the important point for the present is that the Government sees it as a problem largely of the Government's own making. The Government's response to that is to impose the most savage credit squeeze in history. The Australian savings bond interest rate is 12 1/4 per cent. The trading banks' prime rate is 15 per cent. The small overdraft rate is 12 1/2 per cent and the large overdraft rate is 16 1/2 per cent. All those percentages are still rising. Interest rates of that magnitude have never before been seen in Australia. For those who are forced right out of that area of borrowing and into the personal loan and fringe finance area interest rates in excess of 20 per cent are the norm. These high interest rates establish a vicious circle. The high interest rates attract hot money from overseas, as does the expectation of further revaluations of the Australian dollar. That hot money from overseas leads to more stringent application of the credit squeeze on the domestic economy via higher interest rates which, in turn, attracts more foreign borrowings. The Government has created a vicious circle and it is being fried inside it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an appropriate time, I think, to reflect upon the economic perspicacity of this Government. On 10 December I issued a Press statement which said that the Government is laying the foundations for a massive credit squeeze in the autumn. As a result of that statement, I was interviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program PM in which I repeated that statement and made a number of other comments. The ABC, as was appropriate under the circumstances, put that statement to the Treasurer (Mr Howard). John Highfield from the ABC asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Treasurer do you accept Senator Peter Walsh's claims that the government is laying the foundations for a credit squeeze in the autumn?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard replied:</PARA>
<PARA> No certainly not I completely reject those claims, they are ill-founded speculation, there's no basis to them and it's quite irresponsible of Senator Walsh to make those claims. </PARA>
<PARA>The claim was that there would be a massive credit squeeze in the autumn. The response of Mr Howard, the Treasurer, the man in the Fraser Government who is supposed to understand these things-perhaps he is the best the Fraser Government has to offer; I do not rule out that possibility-was to describe that statement as ill-founded speculation and quite irresponsible. I wonder whether he stands by that comment today given that interest rates are at record levels and rising. Unless the Government, as it has so often done before, chooses to redefine what is a credit squeeze, if interest rates at record levels of 2 per cent and 3 per cent-at least for overdraft rates-above what they have ever been do not constitute a credit squeeze, I would like to know what does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I rise to take part in this discussion of a matter of public importance, which indeed it is. The matter relates to the alleged failure of the Government to monitor and regulate adequately the penetration of the Australian economy by foreign investors. I think in the first place that the word 'penetration' has somewhat sinister reflections about it. I think the matter of public importance would probably be better phrased if it referred to monitoring and regulating the development of the Australian economy. That is what this discussion is all about. It certainly should not be a discussion which involves itself with a whole lot of emotional concepts; it should be a discussion which leads to a real measure of enthusiasm amongst Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking about our own country and its massive capacity and resources and, in spite of what is said from time to time, the determination of Australians across a wide board to develop those resources for two reasons and along two particular lines. Firstly, we have to ensure that the socio-economic development of this country is such that it enables every citizen of Australia to be as affluent as is humanly possible. That is the first objective. The second objective of this development surely must be referable to our responsibility to the world and in particular to the developing countries. Our quite massive resources are especially related to the important fields of energy and food and fibre production. These are basic elements for the survival and development of the developing world. Consequently all Australians should be determined that we should be following a process and policy that will enable the 14 million people of Australia to develop the massive resources of 3 million square miles as rapidly, effectively and fairly as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> So, there should not be a conflict of ideologies in this place. There should be a determination to establish the conditions and circumstances under which Australia is developing its massive resources. We need to identify whether such conditions are meeting with a real measure of success and to identify the rapidity of the development. We need to take a view, naturally, that some areas need to be regarded with a measure of flexibility and need from time to time, to change as circumstances change. Individuals demand a whole range of activity and, consequently, whatever guidelines, determinations and statistical targets we set ourselves from time to time we will have to adjust. That is reasonable and proper and it is written very clearly into the policy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Government has seen an immense amount of capital coming into this country which is aimed at the development of our extraordinary resources. I do not believe that is something to be ashamed of. Australia's resource capacity is no reflection on the genius of Australians; it is merely a reflection on our geological structure. But our political stability and resource capacity are attractive enough to bring massive amounts of development capital into this country. What we, as a responsible government, have to ensure is that that capital comes into Australia in such a way that Australian equity and involvement are maintained and ensured, and that significant benefits go not only overseas but also, in the first instance, to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that this Government has established clearly identified guidelines in which it seeks that 50 per cent of equity, as Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said earlier, in most development operations. Most industry in Australia should be in Australian hands, and in the more delicate area of the mining and processing of uranium there has to be an equity of 75 per cent. A measure of flexibility must, of necessity, be added to those statistics. Senator Lajovic said that the Australian people's priorities relate very much to the Totalisator Agency Board. Who are we to establish the total and absolute priorities of Australia's 14 million people? The Government has to ensure that the population of Australia is secure and that it benefits from the massive development and resources of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that this developmental process shall continue within the guidelines basically set by the Government, and observed and monitored by the Foreign Investment Review Board. There has been a measure of criticism of that Board in this chamber this afternoon. Of course, whatever board, entity or organisation is discussed there will be a measure of criticism. One of the criticisms directed at the Board I find somewhat fascinating, that of all its investigations to date-it was established, I think, in 1976-it has seen fit to rule out totally only 1.4 per cent of applications. Of course, that may well be so. The obvious reason for that is that it is a board which operates with guidelines and values that are so clearly understood by the investing people, whether they be from inside or outside Australia, that unacceptable elements or objectives are seldom found within the applications. The Government has made doubly clear on numerous occasions, inside and outside Australia, the sort of Australian equity that it expects ultimately to establish, and having that in view overseas investors would be virtually crazy to put to the Review Board propositions that are hopelessly outside the guidelines. Consequently it is normal that there should be relatively few total rejections. Indeed, a very significant number of applications have to be revised to make them fit the guidelines and Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the multinational-I speak of the foreign investment angle-in the Australian society and economy is nothing very new. There was a time when the total investment in the United States of America was foreign and virtually all Americans were foreigners. Americans have built out of that beginning a multicultural society of which they are proud and which, at least on the guidelines or yardsticks of social, economic and technological development, rates very highly in the world today. So the fact that foreigners and foreign moneys plays a part in the development of this country is nothing in itself that should be worried about. Rather it may well bring a considerable contribution to the ultimate Australian establishment, character and society or community. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the foreign investment guidelines and policies of this Government, which are looked over carefully and are continually reviewed by the Foreign Investment Review Board, are basically of very great significance for the ultimate and most rapid possible development of our country and for its position internationally. They serve to develop the country far more quickly than it would ever be able to develop alone. They serve a socio-economic purpose because they establish a circumstance in which all Australians should and must benefit. Over and above that, I believe that they are relevant in some measure to the security of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It always seems strange to me to assume that significant nations-whether they be West Germany, the United Kingdom or the United States of America-are prepared to invest almost countless billions of dollars in this country and have no regard for its internal or, indeed, external security. I imagine that such a regard would be a contribution of properly controlled foreign involvement in this country. After all, the Australian Government has total control over export, for instance. That is a pretty strong control over the operation of any organisation. Surely it is reasonable to assume that foreign involvement in this country, from the point of view of development capital, in staying here and continuing to be involved in employment and technological advances, and in funding markets-many of these international organisations have very important connections to markets around the world-is relevant not only to the socio-economic stability of Australians but also to the security of the land. What investor, whether it be another honourable senator, me or a country, is interested in investing somewhere in something which has no guarantee of security at all?</PARA>
<PARA> As time is racing by, I conclude my remarks by referring the Senate to one or two of the results of foreign investment and development in this country, particularly by the mining companies. I think it was Senator Tate who said that 55 per cent of the mining companies are foreign owned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The fundamental goal of this Government in the health area is to ensure that all Australians have proper access to health care services of high quality at a cost the individual and the community can afford. A large and increasing amount of scarce resources is being allocated to the health area to maintain the high quality services we have all come to expect. Clearly, if this level of quality is to be maintained, given priorities in other areas, every effort must be made to ensure that the resources allocated to the health area are used in an efficient and cost effective way. It is not an exaggeration to state that the health care delivery system could become a bottomless pit down which an ever-increasing proportion of gross domestic product could be poured without any real increase in the health standards of Australians. All of us, whether we be providers or recipients of health care, should be conscious of the cost of health services. For example, health professionals should become aware of the high cost of some individual services that they provide or seek access to when simpler procedures would be as effective. Equally individuals should become aware of the cost of the services they use by contributing to the cost of such services. Those responsible for the operation of health institutions must also be fully responsible for ensuring that they provide services on the most efficient basis possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years concern has been expressed about the nature and distribution of the institutions, particularly hospitals, which provide our health care services. Hospitals consume by far the greatest amount of resources allocated to health care. They are expensive institutions to run. In many cases they are not physically located to ensure easy access by the community which they serve nor do they necessarily provide the types of services required by that community. Duplication of services between hospitals exists, particularly in the area of high cost technology. Regrettably, many hospitals compete with others in an attempt to provide all services without any regard to duplication, needs, priorities or costs. If hospitals are to be used effectively, it is important that those people admitted actually require the services provided. It is important to ensure that where a person can be adequately cared for at home, appropriate support services are available. For too long hospitals generally have concentrated on providing services within the hospital rather than in the community. The Commonwealth has reacted to this and, through the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit and the Home Nursing Subsidy Schemes, has attempted to encourage people to remain in the community rather than be institutionalised where this was not required. More needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises too that private hospitals form an integral part of the hospital system in any one State. It is important that a balance between public and private hospital beds be maintained. The Commonwealth believes that any growth of private hospital beds should be consistent with overall State priorities for hospitals. The Commonwealth also recognises the important role of private doctors in providing health services in the community. In the great majority of cases general practitioners provide primary health care services on the most cost effective basis. The Government therefore believes that the important role of general practitioners should be enhanced, wherever possible, and should continue to be the first point of contact for patients with the health care system. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that these general objectives are met the Government believes that firm measures should be adopted so that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) States fully accept their constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services and determine their own priorities as to how funds are to be allocated to the different parts of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) All Australians become far more responsible for their own health care needs and lifestyle and more aware of the full cost of the health services available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Special assistance schemes designed to cover people's hospital and medical bills are only available to those in genuine need, namely, eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Those people in the community who can pay their own way should be required to contribute to the costs of the health services they receive-either by personal payment or through health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Health insurance should be available to all at a reasonable cost and should have wide coverage in order to support the community rating principle. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Government assistance towards the health costs of those who can afford to contribute towards their health services should be restricted to those who are willing to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> (vii) The important role of the private sector of the health care delivery system should be fully acknowledged and action should be taken to ensure that the private hospital sector continues as a viable complement to the public system. </PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Providers of health care services should be more aware of the costs they generate. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern over Australia's burgeoning health bill and significant doubts as to whether the large sums of taxpayers' funds allocated to health were being spent properly led to the Commonwealth establishing the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in 1979. The Government believes that the Commission's report has shown that the Government's concern was justified. The health care delivery system in this country is extremely complex and its many parts are inter-related. It is therefore essential that any review of a major part of that system-such as public hospitals-should be carried out in the context of the Commonwealth's overall health policy. The Government has done so over recent months. My colleague the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and I believe that the Commission's report has provided a sound basis on which to develop an equitable and responsible health policy. The co-operation of all those involved in the health and care delivery system will, however, be required if that policy is to benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Hospital Funding Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>At present, under the hospital cost sharing arrangements, the Commonwealth shares with the States the agreed net costs of operating their public hospitals systems. Honourable senators will be aware that these agreements are due to expire on 30 June 1981, except for South Australia and Tasmania. The agreements with South Australia and Tasmania expire on 30 June 1985. In 1976, these agreements were re-negotiated with the States to remove the open-endedness of the original agreements negotiated by the Whitlam Government. History shows that the decision to re-negotiate the agreements was correct at a time when hospital costs were accelerating. Since 1976 growth in recognised hospital expenditure has slowed down markedly. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the considerable success of these agreements in slowing down the rate of growth in hospital costs, the Jamison inquiry was highly critical of them. The inquiry said that the agreements concentrated on reimbursement of expenditure. As a result little account was taken of the relative needs within and between States for hospital and health services, their distribution and their accountability. States with the most expensive and inefficient hospital systems at the commencement of the cost-sharing arrangements received proportionately more funds than States which had attempted to move with the times, to remove wasteful and inefficient services and facilities, and to concentrate on services appropriate to the communities that they serve. As the Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Cost-Sharing Agreements have rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient and have perpetuated rather than solved some of the main problems in Australia's health system. </PARA>
<PARA>I should point out also that even in those States which have made attempts to remove waste and inefficiency, there is still much more work to be done. Today, the members of the community cannot be expected continually to support, by way of taxation and their own personal expenditures, any wasteful and inefficient public hospital systems in Australia. In the face of the evidence produced by Jamison and earlier inquiries, failure by the Commonwealth to ensure that efficiencies are effected would mean that it would be abrogating its proper responsibilities. The Commonwealth cannot stand on the sidelines and see taxpayers and health fund members bearing increasing costs because of inefficiencies, inequities, and unnecessary duplication in public hospitals. On the basis of its criticisms of the cost-sharing agreements the Commission of Inquiry recommended that the agreements due to expire should not be renewed. The Government has accepted that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In its consideration of the funding arrangements that should replace the existing hospital cost-sharing agreements the Commission found that a major factor behind such inefficiencies was the divided responsibility between the Commonwealth and States. The Commission therefore recommended that the States should be required to take up their full constitutional responsibility for the provision of health care services. The Commission also recommended that the level of Commonwealth funding for the States' health services should be altered so that the amount of funds provided was based more closely on States' needs-as determined by their respective populations and taking into account recognised measures of efficiency. The Commission recognised also that there was a need for States to be able to use health funds provided by the Commonwealth for priority areas in their health service system rather than be confined to narrow program type funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been considering a range of options aimed at overcoming the problems highlighted by the Commission in this vital area. It agreed with the Commission that the responsibility of the States should be more clearly defined and that they should be required to take up their full responsibilities for the provision of health services. It also agrees that a new method for determining funding levels should be introduced. In reaching this decision the Government has been mindful of the warning of the Commission of Inquiry that one should hasten slowly. Quite clearly in a situation involving hospitals where there is a large capital investment and where some communities have become used to facilities or services-even when they are not needed-dramatic changes cannot be made over night. As the Jamison report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>sharp, sweeping changes can be disruptive and impractical . . . much can be gained from continual small measures, rather than from sweeping structural change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has therefore decided that the funds it provides for public hospitals, the general Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme should be included in general revenue grants. This will afford the States the greatest possible freedom as to how the moneys to be allocated are spent. There will be no requirements laid down as to the services to which they should be allocated. The States will be totally responsible for making such decisions. Further, the Government has decided that, at least for the initial period of the new arrangements, the amount to be included in the general tax sharing arrangement should be identifiable as representing the Commonwealth's contribution to the cost of the health services provided by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the importance of ensuring that funds for health services allocated to the States are appropriately based, the Government has also decided that the determination of an appropriate mechanism for allocating funds between States in the longer term should be referred to the Grants Commission. The Commission will be asked to look specifically at relativities between States and to design incentives for States to correct inefficiencies in their health systems. The Commonwealth firmly believes that the peoples of each State will, as taxpayers, fully support the Government's decisions since the proposed measures are designed to ensure the maintenance of the high quality health care delivery systems in Australia while protecting the position of all taxpayers by ensuring that the greatest value possible is received for each dollar spent on health services provided by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Commonwealth has decided that the position of eligible pensioners and their dependants should be protected at all times under the proposed funding arrangements. The Commonwealth and the States have over many decades recognised their responsibility for eligible pensioners. The Commonwealth will continue to meet this responsibility in the hospitals area by requiring States to provide free public hospital accommodation and treatment for such pensioners. The Commonwealth will also ensure that free hospital services will continue to be provided to the disadvantaged. The Government will consult with the States on the question of appropriate administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth holds the view that there should be consistency between the definition of the disadvantaged used by States in relation to public hospitals and that followed by the Commonwealth in relation to the bulk billed medical services provided to them. The Government believes that only eligible pensioners and their dependants and the disadvantaged as defined should be protected in this way. It further believes that all other persons should be required to contribute towards the cost of services received in institutions, particularly hospitals, and that States should take appropriate actions to ensure that they do. The Government recognises that such actions should result in increased revenues being raised for both inpatient and outpatient services, particularly if the States raise the bed day charge in public hospitals from $50 for a shared room and $75 for a private room to a level which more closely approximates the actual daily bed cost involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As any increases in revenue resulting from such actions would reduce the net operating cost of the States' public hospital systems, the Commonwealth is of the view that its funding in this area can be appropriately reduced on a progressive basis without jeopardising the quality and standard of care now provided in public hospitals. The new arrangements will, from the Commonwealth's point of view, apply from 1 September 1981. The Government has therefore decided that the funding to be allocated to New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory that represents its interest in the provision of health services should be equal to the sum necessary to maintain in real terms and funding provided in 1980-81 for public hospitals, the general community Health Program, and the School Dental Scheme, less a share of the revenue the States could be reasonably expected to raise through the introduction of appropriate inpatient and outpatient charges in 1981-82 and the user pays principle in public hospitals. The resultant total sum involved is expected to be about $1250m. It is expected that the funds to be allocated to South Australia and Tasmania will be based on the existing hospital cost-sharing arrangements. However, the Commonwealth will be seeking to adjust those agreements to ensure that conditions relating to free access to public hospitals are uniform across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that if the States accept the Government's view that free access to public hospitals should be restricted to eligible pensioners and their dependants and the disadvantaged as defined by the Commonwealth, they will not be required to introduce a means test. I further emphasise that no State will be required to introduce inpatient and/or outpatient charges for any or all persons. However, should any State decide that free public hospitals should be provided to all persons it will be required to meet the extra cost involved out of its own resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Aged, the Chronically Ill and the Disadvantaged</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As I emphasised earlier, the Government will be acting to ensure that free access of eligible pensioners and the socially disadvantaged to public hospitals is maintained. The Government will also continue to protect the position of such people in relation to their medical costs. It has therefore decided to retain the present arrangements in relation to eligible pensioners and their dependants. However, it has decided that new arrangements should be introduced for the disadvantaged. This new arrangement involves the Government in clearly defining the disadvantaged. The Government has decided to do so because of a dual concern, namely, that bulk billed medical services provided under the existing disadvantaged arrangements are growing at a rate which would indicate that those services have been made available to persons who could not normally be regarded as disadvantaged; and that people in genuine need are not always able to gain the protection of those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the following groups in the community should be regarded as disadvantaged: All migrants and refugees in their first six months in Australia; current unemployment and special beneficiaries who meet the pensioner health benefit income test; and other persons who meet a specified income test. In respect of bulk billed medical services received by such people, a Commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent will be payable, as is now the case in relation to eligible pensioners. Doctors will be able to bulk bill the Government for such services or a disadvantaged person may take a doctor's account to a health fund for payment of the appropriate Commonwealth medical benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the current Commonwealth medical benefit for services provided to the disadvantaged is 75 per cent of the scheduled fee. This new arrangement means that the insured population, eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged will receive benefits for scheduled medical services at approximately the same level. This new arrangement will operate from 1 September 1981. It is expected that a maximum of one million people will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement of the main details of the new arrangements to apply in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>DEFINITION OF THE DISADVANTAGED</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth definition of the disadvantaged the following would be included:</PARA>
<PARA> Migrants and refugees in the first six months in Australia-(no income test);</PARA>
<PARA> Current unemployment and special beneficiaries (including dependants) with private incomes below the PHB limits. </PARA>
<PARA> This group would not become PHB ''pensioners'' and would not qualify for other Commonwealth 'fringe benefits';</PARA>
<PARA> A married couple who have a joint income less than the cut-out point for unemployment benefits for a married couple (rounded up to the next whole dollar) plus $20 and twice the rate of additional benefit for each child. On this basis the income limit is $160 a week for a married couple plus $20 for each child. </PARA>
<PARA> For a sole parent, with one child, the income limit will be the same as for a married couple. For each additional child, the limit will increase by $20. </PARA>
<PARA> For single people, without dependants, the income limit will be 60 per cent of the income for a married couple i.e. $96 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall approximately 1 million persons are expected to be covered by the new arrangements. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that the assistance provided by the Commonwealth to help cover the hospital and medical bills of eligible pensioners is considerable. The cost of such assistance on the medical side alone is now running at over $300m annually. Despite this, the Government believes that further assistance should be given to protect the aged and chronically ill in relation to the cost of nursing home care. It has therefore decided that it will take over full responsibility for the payment of nursing home benefits as from 1 September 1981. At present the Commonwealth pays nursing home benefits only for uninsured persons. The estimated cost of this decision is $120m annually. This is expected to take Commonwealth assistance to nursing home patients to about $560m in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase its assistance for the aged and the chronically ill through greater support for organisations providing home nursing services. The Government believes that such services increase the quality of life of people receiving them and help contain costs by keeping people out of institutions when there is no medical reason for them to be there. As honourable senators may be aware, a number of home nursing services have expressed concern at the restriction imposed in 1976 on the number of nurses the Commonwealth will subsidise under the Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme. Recognising the important work carried out by these organisations the Government has decided that this restriction on the number of nurses subsidised by the Commonwealth should be lifted as from 1 July next. The immediate effect of this will be that additional Commonwealth subsidies will be paid in respect of about 195 nurses. The estimated full year cost of this decision is $1m. </PARA>
<PARA>Health Insurance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I stated at the outset, the Government believes that health insurance should be available to all Australians at a reasonable cost and should have a wide coverage of the population in order to support the community rating principle. Regrettably, the combination of free public hospitals to all people irrespective of their incomes and the existing Commonwealth medical benefit arrangements has resulted in a gradual erosion of health fund membership and, as a result, of the community rating principle. If this trend were to continue it could threaten the Government's health insurance policy, the viability of the health funds and the position of those dependent on insurance-taking special account of the aged, the chronically ill and families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to arrest that trend and bring about an increase in the numbers of people insured the Government has decided that the following major changes should be made to the present health insurance arrangements: Firstly, a tax rebate separate from the existing concessions deduction arrangements will be introduced for the cost of basic hospital and medical insurance with registered health funds with effect from 1 July 1981; the rebate will be set initially at 32c in the dollar. Full details of this decision are to be announced in another place by the Treasurer, the Honourable John Howard, later today. Secondly, Commonwealth medical benefits will be restricted to those people with at least basic medical cover with a registered health fund. Thirdly, a flat rate Commonwealth medical benefit of 30 per cent will apply to all schedule medical services and the existing 0 per cent/$20 limit arrangements will be abolished. Fourthly, the Government's payment to assist health funds to help cover the hospital costs of the chronically ill will be set at $100m. Fifthly, the basic level of medical insurance will be increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the schedule fee and benefits of $10 per service. Sixthly, current insurance tables classed as 'optional to basic' will be prohibited. Unless indicated elsewhere the commencement date for these decisions is 1 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will be aware, basic health insurance covers benefits in medical and hospital insurance as defined in the National Health Act. Basic medical insurance will, as from 1 September next, provide to the insured contributor medical benefits at 85 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum patient payment of up to $10 a medical service at schedule fee levels. Basic hospital insurance provides hospital benefit at the level of charges on insured persons for shared ward accommodation in public hospitals and other such approved charges, that is, out-patient, in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Government has decided that it should enter into urgent discussions with the health funds to establish a mechanism to protect members of registered health funds in the event of the collapse of such a fund. The Government is concerned to ensure that health fund members are not financially disadvantaged should any funds cease operation. However, it would expect that such a mechanism would be fully financed by the health insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, the Government believes health insurance should be encouraged. The decision to introduce a tax rebate is a major step designed to promote that objective. It will significantly assist all those who take out health insurance. These decisions are based on the Government's firm view that community support towards health costs through health insurance should be based on the community rating principle and on significant Commonwealth subsidisation that is financed through the general taxation arrangements. The Government firmly believes that such support, when coupled with special arrangements to protect the more needy sections of the community, is the most equitable and responsible means of providing health insurance cover. </PARA>
<PARA>The private sector</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the Government fully recognises the valuable role played by the private sector in the health care delivery system. It believes that a strong health insurance industry underpins the continued viability of the private sector. The Government is particularly aware of the importance of private hospitals, particularly religious and charitable hospitals. Private hospitals are an essential component of Australia's health care delivery system that should be maintained and strengthened. The Government believes that possible action by the States to confine free access to public hospitals to those in genuine need and possible State action to increase public hospital charges will considerably strengthen the position of private hospitals in the medium to longer term. However, it is aware of the increasing cost of servicing surgical beds in private hospitals when compared with medical and other beds and that action is required to ensure that such beds continue to be available to the community. The Government has therefore decided to increase the present $16 a day bed subsidy for surgical patients in private hospitals to $28. The existing bed day subsidy level of $16 will be retained for other private hospital patients. </PARA>
<PARA>The control of health services costs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I stated at the outset, the Government is keen to ensure that health services are not unnecessarily requested by consumers or ordered by providers and that abuses do not occur. As part of this the Government has been carrying out an ongoing review of the Commonwealth medical benefits arrangements for some years now to ensure that benefits are paid only where services are reasonably required for medical treatment and to prevent abuse. Recommendations on further changes to the medical benefits schedule are currently being finalised by my Department for submission to the Minister for Health with a view to implementing changes as from 1 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also taken action to reduce the incidence of abuse by those few people in the health care profession who may seek to misuse or defraud the system for their own gain. A major example was the establishment of the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry in 1977. These committees are effectively a peer review system designed to prevent over-servicing by doctors. The Government has recently agreed to a number of changes to the committee's operation which should considerably increase their effectiveness. My colleague will be announcing details of these changes when he introduces the necessary amendments to the Health Insurance Act later in this parliamentary session. In addition, my colleague is currently examining, in conjunction with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), a number of other suggestions designed to strengthen further the effectiveness of these committees. Subject to the outcome of discussions on these proposals he expects that the resultant changes would be introduced as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison inquiry made recommendations in the area of salaried medical practice. The Government has considered these recommendations and has decided that it should consult with the States on the matter. However, the question of the administration of hospital systems is primarily a matter for the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The overriding aim of the Government's health policy is that all Australians should have access to high quality health care. At the same time, individuals should be encouraged to be more responsible for their health care needs. The system must be equitable, paying particular attention to the capacity of individuals to contribute towards their health costs. But it is also important that all governments ensure that the high costs involved in maintaining that system do not cripple the general community. The Government's health policy, therefore, should also be responsible providing adequate checks and balances to prevent abuses. The decisions I have spelt out today will ensure that both these objectives are met through special assistance to help cover the hospital and medical costs of those in genuine need; ensuring that those who are in a position to do so should contribute towards the cost of the health services they receive; the promotion of insurance for those providing such a contribution through subsidy arrangements financed through the adoption of health service funding arrangements designed to minimise waste and inefficiency in costly institutions; and acting to ensure that consumers and providers of hospital and medical services do not abuse the health care delivery system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I make this statement on behalf of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) who in this chamber represents the Treasurer (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has just been announced, the Government has decided to introduce a new concessional rebate for health insurance contributions. I have explained the nature of this new concessional rebate, which will be rebatable outside the $1,590 rebate block at the standard rate which is presently 32 per cent. I emphasise that tax savings from this new concession will not depend on a taxpayer's total rebatable expenditure exceeding $1,590. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes the introduction of a concessional rebate for health insurance will be widely welcomed and will, we believe, be of particular benefit for families. In considering the introduction of this new concession the Government has given very great thought to the question of tax indexation.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of September 1980 the existing policy of half-tax indexation will provide taxation reductions of about $500m in a full year commencing in July next. As honourable senators will be aware, there are significant arguments for and against tax indexation and I shall not weary the Senate by canvassing all of these arguments today. It is true, as members of the Government have frequently stated in the past, that tax indexation does oblige Governments to legislate tax increases, and to that extent has been a discipline. It can equally be said, however, that to the extent to which either expenditures or revenues are automatically indexed, the Budget flexibility available to a government to respond to changed economic circumstances is thereby reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that discretionary adjustments to taxation scales and allowances are preferable to tax indexation. However, the Government is conscious of the precise terms of what was said in the Prime Minister's policy speech and accordingly confirms that half-tax indexation will apply from 1 July next, thus providing in full the benefit of some $500m foreshadowed in that speech. That half-tax indexation adjustment will, however, be the last indexation adjustment. Future taxation adjustments will be determined-usually in the Budget context-on a discretionary basis and in accordance with economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> As with similar rebates in respect of special categories of expenditure the medical insurance rebate will generally speaking be received on assessment. As a consequence, the revenue impact of introducing this new concession will be negligible in 1981-82. The full year cost of the new concessional rebate health insurance will be in the order of $600m. Legislation providing for the half-tax indexation adjustment will be introduced later this session. My colleague Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle shall also, at a later date, be providing details of the half-indexation factor to apply in respect of 1981-82 and details of the impact of half-indexation on taxation scales in that year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of this debate last evening I was expressing concern that this Government had stated that it will bring one million migrants into this country in the next 12 months. On its past record of little care and concern about their future, I believe it does not augur well for the people involved, the people coming into Australia, or for Australia itself. We in Australia have extraordinary unemployment at the moment. We have a shortage of skilled tradesmen even though we have high unemployment. Why do we have a shortage of skilled tradesmen when we have high unemployment? It is because we did not train people. Governments were not concerned and industry expressed no concern at all about training the skilled tradesmen it needs to carry on. Australia did not care because it used to go shopping to Europe for the skilled tradesmen it needed. But now it finds that people are not so keen about coming to Australia. Why should they come half way across the world and disrupt their families when their wages in Europe are as high, their social welfare payments are better than ours and, after tonight, of course, their health care is infinitely better than the health care in Australia. So we cannot pick up the skilled tradesmen we used to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do we do now? We go to other parts of the world and we recruit semi-skilled people even though there are millions of people, young people especially, here in Australia who cannot get a job. They cannot get a job because we have not given them any opportunity to train. The Government sees no necessity to train the thousands of people we need to fill those vacancies for skilled tradesmen. So we try to recruit in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does this Government insist on suggesting even that we bring a million extra people into this country when there are no jobs, there is no housing and there is no proper education for them? The Government is bringing out that great mass of extra people because it knows that by bringing them out it can put pressure on the work force that is already here. There is no greater way of making a man put up with the bad conditions he works under, put up with the poor pay he gets, than to have a long line of people at the factory gate waiting to get his job. That is the reason this Government is contemplating bringing out to Australia these thousands and thousands of people. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pointing out yesterday evening before the debate on this Bill was interrrupted that in some inner suburban schools in Melbourne there can be up to 80 per cent of the pupils who come from non-English speaking backgrounds and that at the same time there can be as few as four migrant English teachers for over 700 students in that same area. One wonders what the position will be when another influx of non-English speaking people come into those areas. I have been in schools in the inner suburbs of Melbourne where in one class 27 different languages can be spoken yet there can be not one migrant English teacher. This Government has the cheek to blame teachers, parents and even the children for the unemployment that people are suffering. How can children in these circumstances possibly obtain the skills they need to obtain jobs in the sort of market area that exists in Australia today?</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps these million extra migrants whom this Government is going to bring in will be sent to places like the Latrobe Valley in Melbourne where certainly at the moment jobs are available. Jobs are available but there is no housing available. Schools there are in as bad a position or a worse position than the schools in the inner Melbourne area. It is just inconceivable that the Government could contemplate forcing more people into an area that is groaning at the moment because none of the services there can cope with the population that presently exists. For instance, absolutely no housing is available in the Latrobe Valley. The houses that occasionally come on the market there are rented out for amounts approaching, or more than, $200 a week. How on earth can unskilled people, even in that area, hope to balance the budget when they have those sorts of costs loaded on to them? How do people pay those sorts of costs? Of course, if this Government took housing seriously we might start to pull ourselves out of the economic mess we are in. It is interesting to note in tonight's Victorian Herald the comments of the Housing Industry Authority. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> A boost to home building in Victoria would do more for the State's economy than waiting for the resources boom to be a financial cure-all, according to the Housing Industry Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The HIA says that while resource projects-and in particular the Latrobe Valley and Alcoa Portland developments-are vitally important to the State, present realities should not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Industry Authority was reported as pointing out that while we are pouring millions of dollars into those sorts of areas that will provide very little employment for people, we are neglecting areas such as housing which would provide many more jobs and many more long term jobs and which might provide some stability for the people who are seeking jobs and a future in Victoria today. But this Government does not see the future of Australia that way. Victoria even is in the ridiculous position this year of paying the Federal Government more in interest on the Federal money that has been made available for housing in the past than it will receive this year for housing. So how on earth will Victoria, for instance, cope with thousands of new people being injected into the area?</PARA>
<PARA> As for health, how will people who are unable to find jobs and unable to obtain the skills needed for the few jobs that are going and with no housing available at a price that they can pay, now pay for health care, for this new and glorious health care policy that this scandalous Government has brought in-a government, remember, that promised not to touch Medibank? That is another promise broken. But it is not just a promise broken; it means that the very future, the very health of thousands of people across Australia is now in danger. Why? Because this Government is determined to follow its policy that people do not matter but profit does. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) said today, 'Modern health care is an expensive commodity'. What does that mean? It means that there are thousands of people who now find food too expensive; so how will they get on when they have to meet the high cost of health? These migrants believe that they are coming to a rich country. Government members go around the world telling people that Australia is a rich, safe country. It is for some people. It is for those people who are at the top of the tree. This Government is determined to keep Australia as a place that provides rich resources and returns to the people who have money. We are going back to the dark ages, to the 1970s, when the attitude was: 'When you have the money you can have good health'; for the rest, back luck. They are told: 'It must have been your genes' or 'it is the area in which you were born. That is just too bad. You are not going to have the money to pay for good health'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we have great resources in Australia. This Government keeps telling people that we have great resources. They will benefit the people, but when is that benefit to begin flowing? When will the people at the bottom of the ladder begin to derive some benefit from the resources that we are selling at tuppence a ton to reward the friends of Malcolm Fraser? This Government cares nothing for the people at the bottom of the ladder. That is where the migrants are. That is where the millions of migrants that the Government will bring out to Australia will end up. This maniac Prime Minister that the Government has foisted upon Australia is determined to favour the profit-makers, those who have forced the Australian people to suffer the greatest poverty and ill health in history so that greater profits can be made. For whom? It is for the private health funds, the private hospitals and the doctors. It is no wonder that everywhere one goes in the community, one finds people selling up their assets to invest in private hospitals. One could almost have thought that they knew something like this would happen-that private hospitals would skim the cream off the health market. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with this belief-that the profits to be made from our resources are to go to overseas shareholders-we find that our minerals are being used up for the benefit of others, that the people of Australia are going further downhill than they have ever been before. I have pointed out before that this Government purports to care about people who are forced to be refugees but that when they come to Australia and the problems of life here catch up with them, we deny them proper pensions, force them to exist by begging, force them to exist on special benefits and charity. Yet we offered them a new way of life. We suggested that they come out of the terrible situation in which they found themselves, to this land of milk and honey, this rich country with all these resources, this country which was going to provide a new way of life for its people. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out last evening, it is not just the young people, who get no schooling and not just the unemployed who have no future, who make up the migrant world. There is also, for instance, a group of older migrant women who are not allowed to become citizens. If their husbands are alive and they speak English, these women can be naturalised. If their husbands die and the women do not speak English, they will be denied Australian citizenship. Because of the sort of life that they lived, many are illiterate in their own language, as well as in English; but why deny them, at their age, this right to be Australian citizens. The Government knew when they came here that they were illiterate in their own language, let alone in English; yet it accepted them as migrants. When they were young the world in which they lived denied them education. That was reserved for the males of their community. Any women who came here from parts of Europe and who were born before the last War, would be in that position. Why do we have to be so cruel? If their husbands are alive and speak English, that is enough; they can become Australian citizens. But if they are left as widows who are isolated, if they want the comfort of an Australian passport and the security of Australian citizenship when confronting the question of social security, we deny it to them because they cannot speak English. We forget the background from which they came; we forget that it is not their fault. The Government forgets conveniently that it has done little to give them the opportunity to learn English. It seems hard that we cannot extend this concession to these women, to whom this sort of letter is written:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your personal representations on behalf of-</PARA>
<PARA>I will refer to this woman as 'X'-</PARA>
<PARA>who has been unable to satisfy the English language requirements for the grant of Australian Citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Citizenship Act is quite specific in relation to applicants possessing an adequate knowledge of English and the only exemptions that can be made to this requirement are for people who are the spouses, widows or widowers of Australian Citizens, people over the age of sixty years and those with serious permanent disabilities in hearing, speech or sight. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that Mrs X would find it difficult to learn English because of her illiteracy and her age but unfortunately the Minister does not have the discretionary powers to waive the requirements in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore unless the deceased husband of Mrs X held Australian Citizenship it will not be possible for her to gain citizenship until she reaches the age of sixty years on . . . An application from her would be acceptable six months prior to that date to ensure that processing would be completed by the time she reaches sixty years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>What a typically piddling response from a government that does not really give two hoots about ordinary people. This woman has left her homeland and has brought up children in Australia. She has contributed to the Australian way of life. She has contributed citizens to Australia, yet we deny her this one last comfort because she has not had sufficient education to enable her to learn English. </PARA>
<PARA> There is yet another group-citizens without country because of this Government's negligence in not changing archaic laws. Recently in Sydney there was a case in which a mother applied for citizenship but her 12-year-old daughter was denied it because, according to the authorities, only her father was regarded as a responsible parent. Her parents were divorced. She and her mother came to live in Australia. In this instance, a 12-year-old has been told that she can apply for citizenship in her own right. The Minister said that the relevant section of the Citizenship Act definitely needed updating, but it has needed updating for a long time now and there seems to be no move, even at this point, to do that. Why has it not been updated? How dare a government in this day and age tell a mother who has been given responsibility for her children by a court of law that she is not to be regarded by the Australian Government as a responsible parent. How is it that we just manage to miss that area? How many other children are affected in this way? Would this Government grant Australian 12-year olds a passport if they applied on their own behalf? Of course it would not. It would say that the parents must apply on their behalf. In this instance the Government is sexist enough to have regarded this mother as being not a responsible parent. It results from laziness and sloppiness, from a general disregard for people as people. The Government sees people as mere factory fodder. In fact, if it were honest it would admit that in many instances it would prefer to use the term 'guest workers' rather than 'migrants' because it would be very convenient under this policy if, having brought them out and found that they were in excess of requirements, it could send them home again. </PARA>

It brings them half way across the world and then says, 'bad luck'. It does not have the guts to say: 'Really, you are only guest workers. We only brought you out for the period when we needed you. Now we are going to send you home again.' European nations have the guts to say that but this Government has not. It brings people out here and then finds that it can do nothing with them. Nor can the Government develop Australia to the point where anything can be done with them. We will have the report of the razor gang tomorrow. It will be interesting to see what this Government will do with migrants after tomorrow. After tomorrow's report there will be less welfare, less education and fewer jobs. As long as this Government's friends are getting profit, what do jobs matter? Machines can do the jobs. It would be more to the point if the Government brought in more machines. More and more people are being enticed here by this Government and more and more are going to the wall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, may I quote from one of the Government's friends, the Australian Industries Development Association, which has been pressuring the Government to cut more money out of welfare.

<PARA>Senator MacGibbon has already said in this place that this country has spent too much on welfare and not enough on defence. It would be all right, I suppose, if the Government were to provide more jobs from that spending on defence, but it will not even provide jobs there. It will spend overseas that money it has earmarked for defence, thus making more money for its friends. It has not even got the guts to spend those defence dollars here in Australia to provide jobs. All I can say is that, as this Government is providing no indication that it feels in any way differently from the way the Australian Industries Development Association feels, its project to bring one million extra migrants to Australia is nothing more than immoral. After the report on health that the Government made this afternoon, the whole of Australia will brand this Government as an immoral government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to make my maiden speech, I reflect on the fact that I am in a quite unique position. It is not every day, or even every year, that a blushing neophyte like myself has a chance to be a maiden-twice! I am reminded by the presence of at least one gentleman from the other place that on the last occasion I was there as the honourable member for Swan somebody who was not very kind but who nonetheless was prescient about the events of last October said: 'This is his swan song'. All I can say in my new-found glory in this place is: 'Some song, some swan'. But this is a different pond. I have already farewelled my friends and colleague, in another place. I said: 'Don't call me. I'll call you'. Seriously, I will always value my time in that place. People have said to me that I should look upon it as an apprenticeship. It was an apprenticeship, and a very valuable formative period. It is my privilege to know personally and to have a deep affection for many over there on both sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to convey my sincere thanks to Mr President when he returns for his delightful words on that historic day a few weeks ago-the words 'Admit them'-whereupon Senator Bjelke-Petersen and I tripped delightfully, as a twosome, into this illustrious chamber. I thank Senator Sim, who is not in the chamber this evening, for identifying me to the President. It has been my tribute to his long service in this place to have him sponsor me in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Senate will not object if I thank the more than one hundred members of the Liberal State Council of Western Australia for sending me here. I was very surprised that they chose me, for in my blunt way I said a few things to them which may not have been at the time in my best interests. However, if they are punishing me they have done it in a most pleasant fashion. I pay tribute also to their fairness. I am indebted to them. I am also indebted to all my friends and supporters in Swan and throughout Western Australia. After the sad events of last October I received many letters of-I have to say it-electoral condolence. It was apparently their delight to welcome me back into political life. I suppose I might say that those who were sad in October 1980 during the summer of my discontent-it was not a winter-are now made glorious. I thank them all for their efforts and their kindness to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank also the State parliamentarians of Western Australia. I have the Hansard record of the joint sitting which ratified my appointment to this place. Mr Ron Davies, the Leader of the Opposition, seconded the motion of the Premier, Sir Charles Court. He did not do it with joy or gratitude. Mr Davies and I enjoy good relations. Presumably he felt there was enough joy and gratitude in my heart for both of us. I should also tell the Senate that Mr Brian Burke, who is a member of the State Parliament, said that I was a fascist; and the Honourable Bob Hetherington-I thought a friend of mine-said that I was a retread. Mr Davies concluded his seconding speech by saying that he did it with distaste and reluctance and said further that I had been a member of the Australian Labor Party and of the Democratic Labor Party before I was in the Liberal Party. I tell the Senate all this without any inhibition or rancour because I know that if I do not do so, somebody else will bring it up-and all too soon! I am agreeably surprised to note that those are mild and gentle criticisms which are not a patch on what I have been called in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay tribute to some former senators who impressed me greatly. The late Ivor Greenwood I knew but briefly. I can say only that I loved him and that I loved what he believed in. He, I think, was a genuine conservative; and I think that is what I am. There is a difference, of course, betwen reactionaries and conservatives, and I am not going to bore the Senate with that difference. I think everyone here knows what it is. I remember with affection and respect Reg Wright and Magnus Cormack. Magnus Cormack I always found somewhat crusty but very kind of heart and always trying to help anyone who came to him for advice. I think I have to be honest and say that for a while I regarded Reg Wright as the conscience of the Liberal Party. I heard recently something that may not be to his credit. I understand he was visiting here recently and somebody asked him what he thought of the place. He thought it ought to be burned down. I hope I am not misquoting him. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that those men are no longer with us. They were not too old at all, in my opinion. I sometimes lose patience with those who demand a cosmetic perpetual youth for their parliamentary representatives. I admit that I am in need of some cosmetic uplift. Nonetheless, I get angry when I hear it suggested, and I know that Senator Bjelke-Petersen probably feels the same way as I do. I must say that I am gratified by the election of President Reagan at the age of 69, and he has just recently proved his physical toughness and powers of recovery. The belief that age is a handicap in a leader and that the best candidates are young and preferably glamorous is an American and, apparently, Australian trait. </PARA>
<PARA> Europe's post-war recovery owed much to three very great leaders-Churchill, Adenauer and De Gaulle-and, given their age then, they would make many of the men who have retired from this chamber look like mere boys. The antagonists that the free world has had over all these years also have not been young. Ho Chi Minh was no baby and Mao Tse-tung swam the Yangtze at a great age. An elderly Iranian gentleman is causing a lot of trouble in his part of the world at the moment. This penchant for young, handsome people is something that I think this country has to get away from. We have to go for those who have the ability and the capacity and those qualities are not necessarily found only in the young. </PARA>

I mention these matters to emphasise that the world owes as much to age as it owes to youth and that there has to be more gratitude, understanding and response to the problem of the old by the Australian people as individuals, rather than from their government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been appalled for years at the callous indifference displayed by sons and daughters-many of them are my former electors-to the plight of their aged parents. I refuse to blame the Government for this. I believe that these are personal matters and defects of character that are part and parcel of human nature. What is the exact solution for this problem, I do not pretend to know. But I emphasise to the Senate that it is a problem of the individual and not a problem of the Government. As I have said, it is part of the total human problem that exists today in Australian society, which, in my judgment, has experienced no real worries since 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened with interest to a speech made earlier and I have listened to a few other speeches since I have been a member of this chamber and I have heard used expressions which would indicate that this country is in serious trouble and has been in serious trouble. I insist that we really have not had a serious problem in this country since 1945 and probably for a couple of years before that. The only really serious problem that any nation can say it has is when the enemy is knocking at the door and the citizens of that country are likely to lose their liberty. That is the most serious problem that any nation can face. I think that we in this country can glory in the freedom that we have had and the capacity we have to make up our minds on how we want to live our lives. I feel that part of the reason for people believing that life is really difficult today is the constant feeding of soothing syrup in social welfare handouts from government of our kind and calibre. I think this is not helping the situation; I think it is hindering it. I think it may well have created the situation I alluded to before in which everybody expects the Government to pick up his personal problems and carry them. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, if we have any sense about these matters, the reverse ought to be the case. Surely the Government ought to be the last resort rather than the first resort in matters such as this. Surely the family is the most important delivery mechanism for any kind of social service, and I am not referring to government social services. Instead of helping family solidarity, all the welfare that we have been dishing out over many years has tended to break it down. For instance, take the unemployed youth. I can remember the days of my childhood when things in this country were not as good as they are today, in spite of what people might say. There was far greater unemployment then than there is now. The family took care of its own. It was able to do so, in my judgment as I reflect on those times and what I have seen in the years between then and now, much more effectively than we are doing today with all the social welfare we have. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, take the care of the aged to which I have already alluded. The family did it once but not now. In how many instances in recent years have honourable senators heard their constituents say whenever the problem of aged parents is talked about: 'Bung them into a home'? That is a dreadful statement to come from sons and daughters. Let us consider education. What people did for themselves once is considered today to be a real hardship not to be repeated by our children. </PARA>
<PARA> Though we might not like to hear it, there is a limit and the reason for stopping at that limit is not just the Government's reluctance to continue to come to the party. The demographic fact today is that we are running out of people. This means higher and higher taxes for those who are left to pay for more and more welfare. I believe I have already demonstrated that personal selfishness-from which I do not exclude myself, incidentally-is rampant in Australia. If this selfishiness is correct, and I think honourable senators will concede that it is, the fewer people will not pay the taxes necessary to maintain the welfare. So who then pays the pensions and who looks after the aged? I recollect that not so long ago some hard-hearted person who had been following this argument said to me: 'You have had plenty of kids. Your kids can do it'. That is not a bad sort of reflection and one I would accept if only a few more people would share the load and have a few more kids. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to another point. I believe that the popular disregard for the aged that is apparent today began at much the same time as the popular disregard for unborn life. I know that almost everyone in this chamber has been expecting me to get round to this subject sooner or later. I have been very patient for 15 minutes and I have finally got round to it. I have always maintained-God knows there is enough experience and evidence to prove it-that if we make one section of human life expendable it is only a matter of time before we move on others. Therefore, I was delighted when the Senate acknowledged the unborn in recent human rights legislation and I thank the Senate for that. I know that Senator Puplick says very quietly that I only extend human rights from conception to birth and not after, but I know that he does not mean that. The current legislation is much the final terms of what was struck on in another place last year, I think to the extreme discomfiture of the Senate. I hope that those who, up to date, have been involved in a very tough and courageous campaign in favour of the right to life, particularly Mrs Tighe in Victoria, Mrs Woolf in Canberra, Mrs Harrigan in New South Wales and their dedicated helpers-I could not mention them all by name tonight-will continue their work for the unborn human life. I hope they will continue to exercise the sort of courage they have exercised so far. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia desperately needs population. We must have it by either natural increase or migration. I wish to read from an article appearing in the West Australian of Saturday, 25 April which is, curiously enough, Anzac Day. It is a day that always brings to my mind what had to be done on one occasion and what has had to be done a couple of times since to preserve this country. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The head of the department of environment and life sciences at Murdoch University, Professor D. C. O'Connor, said ZPG meant an ageing society with zero innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia had five per cent of the world's land mass and only 0.34 per cent of its people. It was unreal for a country like Australia to have policies which were not based on growth. </PARA>
<PARA>What I have been saying so far is not just the instinctive rambling of someone who does not really understand the situation. There are demographic facts to support every single thing I have said. If that is not enough, the Executive Director of the Confederation of Industry in Western Australia is reported in an article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . migrants would create jobs and bring in capital. </PARA>
<PARA>The article stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Atkinson said the curtailment of increasing migration in the early 1970s was a major factor in Australia's economic decline. </PARA>
<PARA>Anybody who understands the basic economic concepts of supply and demand-indeed, sometimes when I have listened to debates in this place and elsewhere I have wondered whether those factors are understood at all-knows that if we bring in people a creative cycle is engaged in which, to use economic terms, is bound to exercise a multiplier. We should immediately support an immigration program because Australia is desperately short of people. I think it is quite obvious that no matter what happens we are not going to get the quick natural increase which I think is vitally necessary in this country. I believe that at the same time we should immediately cancel any Government support for killing the unborn. It is just madness, as far as I am concerned, to continue policies of subsidising the killing of the unborn when we desperately need people. This is completely irrespective of the moral position, which I believe is unassailable anyway. I offer that argument to the Senate on purely political grounds. I conclude discussion of this matter with another quotation from the article which appeared in the West Australian on 25 April. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> But with the nation gearing-up for a massive expansion through the resources boom, it is also facing a domestic zero population growth. The reproduction rate is eight per cent below the long-term replacement level. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is also becoming an ageing society. While the total population is expected to increase by 30 per cent by the year 2000, the number of people aged more than 65 will increase by 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of children younger than 14 will increase by only 20 per cent. The average age will rise from 29.5 to 33. </PARA>
<PARA>If those three very well based quotations do not demonstrate everything that I have been saying in the last 20 minutes, I do not know what does. It occurs to me that at this point I should mention an old adversary-the Australian Conservation Foundation. I did not want to be too political as this is a maiden speech but I suppose there will be opportunities, not very far in the future, for people to answer what I have to say. I have tried, unsuccessfully, for five years to get this organisation off the Government handout list. In my judgment-I think I have enough evidence-it has wilfully abused government money, using it to attack government policy on growth and development. Just the other day Dr Mosley attacked the migration program. He has been an advocate of zero population growth for years. Rumour has it that the honeymoon may be over and that it may get no more government money. I hope so. I do not deny that this organisation in its early years may have had attached to it people who were motivated from the very best basis and who hoped to achieve some sort of stand against those who wilfully polluted or destroyed the atmosphere or the land. But I think everybody would have to agree that in recent years the early objects of the organisations have not been achieved. It has used the sustenance that this Government has given it to attack the Government and all of its policies. To me, for a government to subsidise its own destruction, is an act either of very great even- handedness or of plain foolishness. I have no objection to the Conservation Foundation's funding itself, pursuing its own objectives and having its own organisation-good luck to it. But it should do so in its own time and with its own money. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say something about my own State and its problems, the chief of which at the moment is not Canberra. I know that that will be a surprise to some honourable senators who are interested in the present state of Federal-State relations. The Western Australian conservation movement in its class action against Alcoa of Australia Ltd, the aluminium company, could jeopardise not only the alumina contracts but also the very important North West Shelf off-shore gas project. I shall quote to the Senate a most instructive article which appeared in the Economist on 28 March this year. It is rather humorously headed: 'Courting trouble abroad'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The environmentalists are suing one of its most important customers, Alcoa of Australia (51 per cent owned by the Aluminium Company of America), which is now refusing to sign purchase contracts till the legal issue is settled. This could take months, or even years if both parties decide to contest judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The projects'--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the North West Shelf project-</PARA>
<PARA>developers, Shell Australia, BP Australia, BHP and Woodside Petroleum, have already signed construction projects worth over $A650m. So far, however, their only firm sales contract is with Western Australia's state energy commission. The commission signed up last year to buy 385m cubic feet of gas a day for 20 years after production is due to start in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the only sales contract for gas which exists at the moment. I think the Senate can see the obvious difficulty that will arise if this suit continues. I am very grateful to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and I know that the people of Western Australia, by and large-even including some trade unionists-are also very grateful. The Government has decided to use all its force and strength in the United States to see that this class action is unsuccessful. If it is successful it will not only prejudice the aluminium development but it will also prejudice the North West Shelf development and quite a number of ancillary projects which are tied to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining I commend to all honourable senators a series of articles which have appeared in the West Australian newspaper. In case anyone gets the impression that I am touting the favour of the West Australian newspaper, I say that I am not. It just seemed to me that the articles which appeared in recent weeks were the best articles that I could recommend to the Senate in order for honourable senators to achieve a better understanding of what makes that State, and those of us who come from it, tick. The articles are not just about secession, but that feeling has to be understood. It is there. It has been well said about Western Australians: 'If you scratch them you will find a secessionist'. It is perhaps a tribute to some of the reasonable people who have been involved so far in trying to cement a decent Federal-State relationship that Western Australia has persevered with Federation, but that situation will not necessarily continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no evidence at all for suggesting that there is any major force that will even consider or bring about this situation, but I think the Senate has to understand that this feeling is always there and is based on quite reasonable grounds. The Senate may not ever have had this situation put before it, but Western Australia, in its 10 years of responsible self-government between 1890 and 1900-before Federation-was in a state of prosperity which was quite incredible. This prosperity was quite satisfactory to the majority of people in Western Australia who were native-born West Australians. When the question of federation came along there was a very great reluctance to be involved in the Federation. The only thing that eventually swung the referendum was the large number of immigrants from the eastern States located in the Kalgoorlie area. It was this majority that swung the vote in favour of federation. Western Australia came into the Federation but because of high tariffs and certain other difficulties in the Federation there was enormous dissatisfaction. One particular individual, the one time Lord Mayor of Perth, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Twenty-five years ago-</PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1900-</PARA>
<PARA>we all boarded the good ship Commonwealth for a lifetime voyage, with the full assurance that there would be only one class for all the passengers. During the voyage we found to our great surprise that there were four classes. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria and New South Wales had secured all the saloon cabins, South Australia and Queensland the second class, little Tasmania was put in the steerage, whilst Western Australia is compelled to work for her passage in the forecastle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis says that those days have changed. I wonder whether they have. Today about 86 per cent of Western Australia's exports are sold overseas in a competitive market which affords no special protection to this State and 60 per cent of our imports come from the tariff protected and subsidised industries of the eastern States, meaning inflated prices plus freight. With less than 9 per cent of Australia's population, Western Australia earns more than 20 per cent of the nation's income from overseas. Put another way, the average West Australian is responsible for bringing more than twice as much money into the country as his or her counterpart in Victoria or New South Wales. So who is running the Federation now? We are almost at a stage of having taxation without representation. I am pleased to see that Senator Withers agrees with me. We have not always agreed on things, but tonight we do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Senate for its tolerance. I will take just a few more minutes. I want to quote what the free-market economist and Nobel laureate, Professor Hayek, has prepared as a guide for us all. As this is a free enterprise party and a free enterprise government, I think it is appropriate to have his words in the Hansard record. In the circumstances, the quotation is a little long and I would ask, as a first favour from the Senate, if I might incorporate this in the Hansard record of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Almost everywhere the groups which pretend to oppose socialism at the same time support policies which, if the principles on which they are based were generalized, would no less lead to socialism than the avowedly socialist policies. There is some justification at least in the taunt that many of the pretending defenders of 'free enterprise' are in fact defenders of privileges and advocates of government activity in their favor, rather than opponents of all privileges. In principle, the industrial protectionism and government-supported cartels and the agricultural policies of the conservative groups are not different from the proposals for a more far-reaching direction of economic life sponsored by the socialists. It is an illusion when the more conservative interventionists believe that they will be able to confine these government controls to the particular kinds of which they approve. In a democratic society at any rate, once the principle is admitted that the government undertakes responsibility for the status and position of particular groups, it is inevitable that this control will be extended to satisfy the aspirations and prejudices of the great masses. There is no hope of a return to a freer system until the leaders of the movement against state control are prepared first to impose upon themselves that discipline of a competitive market which they ask the masses to accept. The hopelessness of the prospect for the near future indeed is due mainly to the fact that no organized political group anywhere is in favour of a truly free system. </PARA>

<PARA> The first point I want to make concerns the way in which the honourable senator was elected to this Parliament. It is due largely to the charitable attitude of the Australian Labor Party in the 1972 to 1975 era when Premiers cheated in respect of parliamentary replacements. A referendum was held and the people in their wisdom voted by a big margin for the proposition that when an honourable senator departs from the Senate, he should be replaced by a member of the same party. I say with respect to the honourable senator who has just resumed his seat that the Labor Party, via the angel of death, could probably have picked up some advantages on occasions if it had retained the other system. Whenever people talk about a monopoly on democratic concepts, it should be remembered that we had every reason to advocate a 'no' vote in respect of the four constitutional referendums that were held, but we did not do so. If ever a similar situation arose again, I would be amazed if the Government parties advocated that there should be a bipartisan affirmative vote. So I say this: The very presence of the new senator from Western Australia in the chamber is indicative of the Labor Party placing democratic concepts ahead of its own political expediency. It should never be forgotten that when former Senator Milliner died, in his place we got one of the greatest dills who ever entered any parliament. In the case of New South Wales, Senator Bunton was chosen as the replacement senator. He was a very fine man, but he was certainly not here to implement Labor Party policy. Those acts were a prostitution of democracy. So I never want to hear any lecture from anybody on the other side of the chamber about obligations in politics. They were dark days for democracy, and when honourable senators come here, as the recent addition from Western Australia has, they should remember that they are here largely on a dream run, because, as I say, we gave first priority to the principle of democratic replacements. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet, there are two particular matters which I would like to mention. I was amazed at the honourable senator's oversimplification of the position in regard to population and jobs. There is one Minister in the present Government for whom I have a great deal of respect. That is the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee. I mention him in regard to job opportunities. I met him on one occasion when there was a consolidation of the rubber tyre industry in New South Wales and it was considered preferable for Dunlop Australia Ltd to move to Victoria and end its plant operations in New South Wales. Firestone Australia Pty Ltd vacated the field. I could give a long discourse on this Government's policy in relation to tyres and how many tyres are imported from Korea and one or two other countries, but I do not intend to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether people like Senator Martyr who advocate this idea that the jobs are there if we have a large population would change their minds if they had sat with me and Barney French, the secretary of the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia, and the Minister, Ian Macphee, at the telephone for four hours. Finally we were able to get jobs for 800 people. I do not think he would say then that in 18 years' time it will be easy to get jobs for everybody who is born in Australia now and that there will be a job for the fifth or sixth child of any family. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not trying to score political points. Those are the cruel realities of the technological changes that are coming. Senator Melzer mentioned this and I can assure the Senate that there was no xenophobia in what she was saying. If we go into the working class areas of Sydney and Melbourne and no doubt the other capital cities, that is where we find the boys and girls who came to Australia at age 11 or 12 who face the barriers in relation to mathematics and things like that. A woman might want her son to be an apprentice fitter and turner with Qantas Airways Ltd or some other glamour company which employs metal trades apprentices. We have to tell her that there are so many waiting in the queue that she cannot have that apprenticeship for her son. Some people will say that this is a good country and that the migrants are better off here than they would be in the country they came from. That may be so. I am not a psychologist but I can imagine the position of a boy of 15 or 16 who has to take permanent employment as a process worker. I do not say he is any the worse for that, but I wonder whether these people who talk in terms of percentages ever look at that boy and realise that he has stunted ambitions. That is the point about human relations. It would be stupid to deny that at every trade fair one attends there are new technologies and new appliances that visualise there being fewer workers. Now it may be that with a smaller population people can work the shorter working week. That is well and good. But to say blandly today that things will be good in 15 years' time for any family with seven children under 14 years of age is just rubbish. That is not Labor Party thinking. All the early research that has been done over the last decade by the Commonwealth Department of Labour, which is now the Department of Industrial Relations has indicated that the people in the work force will probably have to be retrained twice. They are sober facts. It is not a question of ideology or party politics; it is a question of job opportunity. We may err on the conservative side in these matters. But I do not believe, when I look at some low paid jobs-whether it be the female work force in the cannery business or in one or two other industries that I can think of-that people who came to Australia before their teenage years should remain permanently in those jobs. Conversely, honourable senators opposite talk about computers and say that the work load will be a lot lighter. Of course, it will be. But not everybody can be transferred to that type of work. It is necessary to have a high mathematical aptitude to get that sort of job. It is very nice to talk in platitudes, but if some of the honourable senators opposite-including our new senator, the ex-member from Swan-wandered around the inner city areas over the weekend, they would realise that these are the unpalatable facts that we have to face up to. </PARA>
<PARA> My third point is this: If we are to deal with market forces, it might be argued that families should pick up the tab more for their dependants. I am looking at this now from a capitalist angle, not from a socialist angle. It is probably accepted that the dream of the young married couple, if they can go back into the work force after having a couple of children, is to own their own house by the time they are 45. That is the reverse of what happened to people I know. My father, who was a gas worker, did not have his house paid off until he was 59. I do not think that the previous speaker and all the other backwoods conservatives on the other side of the chamber are saying that we can go back to that situation. Taking the new senator's attitude, I wonder what the cash order people would say if hire purchase of houses and accessories was spread out until a person was in his late fifties or if he never paid off the debt. Even if honourable senators argue from a capitalist concept, they will find that these are the dangers we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martyr referred to living with people who have different views. I respect the honourable senator's right to express that view here, but this is 1981 and that is simply not on. I know of situations where a woman has done office cleaning to supplement her husband's low wage, the children of 12 and 14 years of age are not given the attention they need, and so domestic problems arise. Honourable senators can ask any social worker about those problems. It is not merely a case of putting some religious concepts. If I could get close to the bone, I know Senator Martyr's background. I have read about him in Newsweekly. I am sure that he has read the serves they have given me, and probably they will continue to do so. I am not trying to score points from a sectarian angle. Senator Martyr can get that right out of his head. If he read some modern papers from that area, I think he would find that they do not buy that pre-World War II attitude. It is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA> I rose tonight to deal with four matters. The first matter relates to Senate Estimates Committee B. Monday night was a night of infamy. Senator Rae and other honourable senators talked in this place on Thursday night about how we could make Estimates committee work better. On Monday I attended Estimates Committee B as a guest senator. I am a member of another committee, together with Senator Sibraa and my illustrious Western Australian colleague, Senator McIntosh, and we will go into action tomorrow on foreign affairs, defence and immigration. However, I attended Estimates Committee B, and I pay full tribute to Senator Kathy Martin for the way she handled things. We started at 10 a.m. and at 10 o'clock at night we started Communications. There is not a senator here who does not have problems relating to Australia Post. I had the temerity to raise a question about which the Minister already knew. At the request of the Yugoslav community, I wished to ask about SAL, which is a type of overseas postal concession. I wanted to know why the Netherlands, West Germany and Greece got this concession and Yugoslavia did not. I had received a semi-answer to question on notice No. 190 from the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and I wanted to follow up the matter. I also wanted to know something more about the industrial dispute at the Black Mountain Tower. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Commissioner Payne was present at the Estimates Committee hearing, but nobody else. A departmental officer said: 'Well, Senator, we will take these matters on board'. That is not good enough. If I am there as a guest senator until 10 o'clock at night and I have questions to ask then senior officers of the Department should be present. After all, when the Department of Communications is listed for hearing by the Estimates Committee, surely Australia Post is one of the matters that will be discussed. I repeat that I think it is a pretty shabby show. I know the difficult job that the secretariats have, but Senator Rae and others expressed the gospel about making Estimates committees more viable. It just did not work on Monday night, and the dilemma rests squarely with the Government. It has increased the number of Senate Estimates committees from six to eight, and some of us have to act like kelpie dogs and run round and round to catch up with them. On Monday I was able to attend the Committee but, like other senators, I have other Senate committees I want to patrol. I think that this is a pretty poor show. I say to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, who is at the table-this is not a personal attack on him-that I hoped when I asked for a fleshing out of the answer to question on notice No. 190, which dealt with overseas airmail concessions, that the Yugoslav communities in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, for the benefit of the new senator from Western Australia, would receive a better answer. In fairness to the frank response I got from a member of the staff of the Minister for Communications, somebody said that the Yugoslav community had not asked about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post must do one of two things. Perhaps it sits on its backside and lets things go by, although I do not think that that is the answer. I suspect that somebody got out an atlas of Europe, closed his eyes and pointed to a country with a pin. If we are prepared to give concessions to the Netherlands, West Germany and Greece, then I cannot see why, in terms of geographical affinity, Yugoslavia was not included. I think that Senator Lajovic will agree with me that the Yugoslavs are proud people. They are not going to grovel and they should not have to. We hear a lot of drivel about everyone being equal. It is time that I got an answer to this question. I could easily inundate the Senate with petitions. I believe that this is a shabby show, and it is an insult to the Yugoslav community that it did not get the same response as other groups in the community received. I will be quite fair. I am not one who believes in privilege; I believe in equality. I say to the Minister that I hope Australia Post will give me a quicker answer to my second salvo than it did to my first. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters to which I want to refer. One involves a strange magistrate named Nichols who operates in the Australian Capital Territory. As honourable senators know, I live in the electorate of Lowe. I am the resident senator there and the House of Representatives member is a former Prime Minister, Sir William McMahon. It is a quaint relationship; the electors have a pretty effective double. I was approached by a Mr Rowe from Abbotsford, which is in that electorate. Mr Rowe told me about the cross he has borne. On 25 November 1980 his son, John T. Rowe, and a friend were killed in a motor car accident in the Australian Capital Territory. Six charges were laid against a driver, who was travelling at 80 kilometres an hour. Magistrate Nicholls was content to fine the offender $250. My initial probings in the Australian Capital Territory reveal that the police here believe that people can get away with all sorts of mad driving if they come before Magistrate Nicholls. I have had a reasonable dialogue with the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) on one or two other matters. This may be a matter for him or it may be a matter for the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). Considering the road toll, I think that there is something wrong with this magistrate's appeasement policy. A boy in his prime-20 years of age-was cut down and the offender got a miserable $250 fine. There were no counter-charges that the people in the panel van were at fault. The police laid six charges and the person got a $250 fine. It is a by-word in the Australian Capital Territory. There is not much point in the police doing extensive work to get statements, depositions and all the rest of it when we have a magistrate who perverts justice. I regret that Magistrate Nicholls perverts justice as far as major traffic offenders in the Australian Capital Territory are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot about law and order, and it is rather significant that tonight the new senator from Western Australia referred to the late Ivor Greenwood. I remember early in the piece when that senator was a senior Minister, and I shared with him the idea of more effective gun control. I know that the States have certain responsibilities, but I want to refer to a recent meeting of police commissioners chaired by the South Australian Police Commissioner. Apparently there are Customs loopholes in relation to certain foreign assault weapons. A U2, which is an Israeli machine pistol, and a Soviet Union product apparently can be imported fairly easily, due to inadequate definition. I referred to a former Attorney-General, Ivor Greenwood, and I have spoken to subsequent Attorneys-General. Under our federal system, it is difficult to get unanimity between the States and their responsible ministers. There have been far too many seige cases lately involving people who have even gone beyond using armalite rifles. They have much more sophisticated equipment. I appreciate that there is a valid argument for people who live on farms in remote areas having a need for a rifle for certain purposes. My remarks are not aimed at them. The point I am making is that under the present regulations it is very easy for odd people to have access to high-powered weapons. I appeal to the responsible Minister, whether it be the Attorney-General or the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), who is in charge of imports, to take a hard line in this matter and, if necessary, call an early meeting of the appropriate Ministers with a view to blocking this loophole in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that Senator Carrick is present in the chamber. We have had extensive dialogue on the present uranium operations in the Kakadu National Park region of the Northern Territory. I think that the Minister and I accept virtually as gospel the second Fox report as far as co-existence between the developmentalists and the conservationists is concerned. The Koongarra uranium project is being mentioned frequently in the papers. It appears that the authorities are on the verge of granting approval regarding this project. With due respect to the autonomy of the Aboriginal community in this area, the plain fact of the matter is that as late as about six weeks ago the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, which is headed by Senator Jessop, questioned the Chief Scientist and his people on this subject and they could not promise that an additional mining operation in this area would not overload the fragile environment of the Alligator Rivers region. Another mining operation in this area could be a fatal blow. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go beyond the maximum number of mining operations in the Kakadu National Park area we will be ignoring the umpire's decision. I feel very strongly about that. As an advocate of conservation policies, I have tried to get co-existence between legitimate development and adequate protection for the environment. I say quite candidly that if we get away from and ignore the recommendations in the very costly second Fox report we will certainly provoke the conservationists. They are already rather cynical about the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of conservation, I want to make a point in defence of Dr Mosley, the Director of the Australiam Conservation Foundation. I know of the long feud he has had with Senator Martyr from Western Australia. Let me say that I see a parallel between trade unionism and the aims of the conservation movement. The former does not always involve a log of claims. The unions must keep employers up to safety standards and a lot of other things. If the Conservation Foundation had not come into being, I doubt whether we would be still haggling over the Kakadu National Park, whether the wetlands of Coburg should be a reality and so many other things. They are issues on which governments have to draw a line. But the Conservation Foundation, whether it be through Dr Geoff Mosley, Milo Dunphy or those other fellows who, of course, are controversial, has a role to fulfil and it has done so. There has never been anything disreputable and money has been accounted for. The Foundation has endeavoured to educate people and it deserves support. Senator Martyr spoke about the need for a high degree of nationalism. Surely he would know that in years gone by when mining operations were not controlled a good deal of damage was done and the depradation was costly to repair. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) and I represent the State of New South Wales and we are aware of the Lake George mining company fiasco. It was necessary for the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government to spend about $1.5m to rehabilitate damage which was occasioned to the Molonglo River area. There was also the earlier fiasco in the Northern Territory on the Finnis River. Damage was done because there was no control. Let us be fair about this matter; the Australian Conservation Foundation has a role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I want to deal with relates to whaling. I think it can fairly be said that in the Senate-I will be polite about this-a small group of misguided Liberal senators tried to stop the passage of whaling legislation but sanity prevailed. The present policy virtually enjoys bipartisan support. I believe we have reached a satisfactory situation with our whaling protection legislation, and thank goodness. The 200-mile off-shore zone can be deemed as a mammal sanctuary. The people who support Project Jonah and other people feel that Australia is a bit slow when it comes to obtaining adequate marine research facilities and scientific know-how. Because we now have this off-shore zone, whales will be able to enter the waters around Australia with safety. This zone is a sanctuary for them. We do not have much knowledge on why schools of whales have beached themselves. The Tasmanian Government and the New South Wales Government in particular have been confronted with this problem. But when it comes to research into effective techniques to implement saving whales which beach themselves we are a bit slow. It is virtually a suicide operation for the whales. I do say to the Minister that I believe we all share a bipartisan attitude as far as the whaling legislation is concerned but we cannot stand still. We have to go forward and redouble our efforts in research so that we will be able to save whales which beach themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I hope that the fiasco before Estimates Committee B the other night is not repeated. I hope that when the estimates for a department are before a committee the department will have a full team present, not a skeleton force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague Senator Mulvihill in congratulating Senator Martyr for his maiden speech. Even though he has left the chamber, I am sure that he will be glued to the speakers outside the chamber to hear all the comments that we make about him. On behalf of the Opposition, I welcome him to the community of the Senate. Tonight I want to raise briefly in this first reading debate a matter which is of concern to parents, teachers and children in the Darwin area. There is a petition going forward to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at the present time. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Petition of the undersigned in the Darwin area respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the proposed commercial development adjacent to Bullocky Point and alienation of parts of Darwin High School grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> would severely inhibit continued use of the bush area currently used for instructional purposes and activities by biology, physical education, geography and geology students</PARA>
<PARA> would prevent direct access to the beach which is used for instructional purposes</PARA>
<PARA> would be inappropriate close to a school</PARA>
<PARA> would place pressure on existing space due to a possible 20% increase in student population if Year 7 students are incorporated into high schools</PARA>
<PARA> would destroy one of the remaining bush areas close to the city-an area which contains rare trees</PARA>
<PARA> would remove public land from the foreshores</PARA>
<PARA> would place in jeopardy the proposed community recreation centre. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me give a little of the background to that petition. Darwin High School is built on Bullocky Point, as indicated by the petition. Bullocky Point is a small peninsula some two miles from the city centre. It is the site of the former Vesteys meat works. The area originally set aside for the high school complex was some 35 hectares. Some part of that area has been taken for the museum and art gallery which is being built. This is quite acceptable to staff and students of the high school and I will have more to say about this later. The present proposal is to reduce further the 35 hectares to 13 hectares. It is not only the reduction in the area that is opposed but also the purpose for which the land is to be put. The proposal is for a motel and water slide complex. The parents, the staff and the students are very much opposed to this sort of development. They have prepared the petition, part of which I have read, and they have sent letters to parliamentarians. I will read an extract from a letter signed by the President of the School Council, the President of the Student Representative Council and the Principal of the Darwin High School. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A school is not an 'ivory tower' remote from the community it serves, but it is very much a special-purpose organisation. As it has been sited on Bullocky Point, Darwin High School has had several extremely valuable features:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreshore study access for study and sport;</PARA>
<PARA> Convenient access to and from the city and suburbs it serves, but freedom from the distractions and intrusions of every day commercial life; and</PARA>
<PARA> Useful proximity to the Botanical Gardens, and the valuable sports facilities of Gardens Oval, the Ski Club and the Bowling Club. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to the first of those facilities, much of the detail there will be lost. Much is at risk. I think it is fair to say that there is a concept in town planning that certain kinds of buildings go together. I think it is also fair to say that this concept is basic to modern town planning which is utilised throughout the world. The Darwin City Council obviously concurs with this view because the present city plan embraces the concept. This is why we in Darwin accept the fact of the museum and the art gallery being close to the school. The school, the art gallery and the museum have a similar function and the art gallery and the museum provide a convenient annexe to the school. It will be convenient for students, when the museum and the art gallery open, to be able to go down and make use of those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The performing arts centre, which was originally to have been built close to the school, also would have been acceptable. The original plan was to have it just on the other side of the main road from Bullocky Point in the area close to the Salonika School. But this performing arts centre is now included in a private development project to be financed by an overseas company. I have spoken on this subject before. I have described how the Northern Territory Government and the Darwin City Council worked secretly together to give overseas companies public land. Northern Territory Government land, Federal Government land and city council land was given to an overseas company for the building of a motel and a performing arts centre complex. But, of course, it is not really that. What it is is a motel and a conference centre-the sort of thing we see in most cities. This $40m project will be built by overseas money. It is interesting that we have had no reaction from the Federal Government to my comments, made a couple of weeks ago, that it agreed to give its land to a foreign company. It seems strange to me, particularly after we heard the excellent debate this afternoon when there was a good deal of unanimity on both sides of the chamber on this matter of foreign investment, that not only are we keen to develop this but also we are prepared to give to these companies, which come to Australia, great areas of our own land. It is appropriate and, I think, fair to say that there is not a lot of support for the motel complex in Darwin. Joe Fisher is a former member of the Legislative Council and he now writes a weekly comment in the Northern Territory News. In the Northern Territory News of 4 April 1981, under the heading 'Justice must be seen to be done', he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Territorians must have a voice in major community decision or living here will be meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> The furore over incorporating the performing arts centre in a private development project is a healthy sign. </PARA>
<PARA> The take-it-or-do-without attitude of the Government and the civic corporation should be mellowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Docile acceptance of government and civic 'fait accomplis' over the past three years was a bad omen of indifference where the community's interests are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate to have some developments on a site if there is enough room. We will not go into that argument, but it is certainly inappropriate to have others. As far as I am concerned, it is completely inappropriate to have a motel and a water slide within 50 metres of a secondary school's main entrance. I should not need to dwell on this point. I think that honourable senators would appreciate the undesirability of it. It is also inappropriate to have within walking distance the major casino complex in the Top End of the Northern Territory. This again was one matter in which the Northern Territory Government and the city council colluded in defiance of the expressed views of the people of the Northern Territory. The people do not count any more in the Northern Territory, so it would seem. We have a State-type government which has gone mad. These are not all the comments which I have made about the water slide, the motel and the casino. The letter from the parents' group, the childrens' group and the staff also had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of Bullocky Point, there is a big new marina planned and, with it, on what is now school land, medium-density housing. If all these plans were to go ahead, the School's land would be reduced to one third of its original size-one third of what it was at the time of self-government--</PARA>
<PARA>One third of what it was at the time when the Leader of the Government in the Senate handed over the education department to the Northern Territory Government. There is no appreciation of the traffic problems and no appreciation of the needs of the school. Because we have other matters to go on with, let me make the point that the development of a motel and a water slide complex is completely inappropriate so close to a high school. It creates entirely the wrong sort of environment. Let me make the additional point that the land taken from the school is needed by it for additional playing fields, for recreational facilities and for the biological and other studies which the letter quoted. There is no shortage of land in Darwin for the sort of development proposed. At the present time we seem to have the frightened fawn approach towards development in the Northern Territory which the Federal Government had so many years ago. The bulk of the development in the Northern Territory at the present time is foreign development. It is being done with foreign capital, and the buildings and the complexes are owned by foreign companies. </PARA>

Full statehood has not been achieved and will not be achieved for some time. Acts of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly can be reserved for the Governor-General's assent. So some responsibility remains with the Federal Government. The Federal Government ought to require that there be much more public discussion, that there be more appropriate use of land resources, that safeguards be taken to make sure that the education available to the Darwin students is of the best possible sort, and that we retain the integrity of city planning. If we want to sum it up in one phrase we could say that the Federal Government has a responsibility to protect the people of the Northern Territory from a government which is swamping them in foreign developments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the Government brought down a statement on health care in Australia. Insofar as it is a statement of government policy, it represents a recycling of numerous government initiatives over many years in relation to health care in Australia. It is a recycling because this is the fifth Fraser health policy to be enunciated in the Parliament. What is happening as a result of five changes in Fraser health policy is that the people of Australia are being used as social guinea pigs for experiments by the Fraser Government because of its difficulties in sorting out its ideological position on a variety of issues, and particularly the issue of health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement deals, in a long and somewhat argumentative manner, with a number of proposals on health care and purports to be a response to the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. It is a very patchwork document. I tell the listeners that if they look at the document which the Government has brought down today in relation to health care in Australia they will see that it is a patchwork document in the true sense. Not only is it a document which is typed and which is clearly set out in a number of respects, but also it is a document which has additions and changes which have clearly been made at the last moment and it is a last minute response, clearly, to the tortuous process of sorting out the Government's attitude to health problems in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is Mark V, as I said, of the Fraser Governments health care responses. Let me quote the words of a journalist in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning who talked about the activities of the so-called razor gang of the Fraser Government which will cut government expenditure in a number of respects. The way the razor gang activities are being handled is, in the words of the journalist in the Sydney Morning Herald, not bad government but mad government. The statement brought down earlier today on health care is a typical example of mad Fraser Government as distinct from bad government to which we have become accustomed over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing I say about the statement brought down by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) is that it ignores the principal findings of the Jamison Committee of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals to which it purports to be a response. Let me draw attention to one or two major issues which the Jamison Committee commented on. The response by the Government totally ignores the Jamison Committee's findings and its suggested method of dealing with the matter. The Jamison Committee opposed the absorption of hospital costs into general revenue grants. The Government will absorb hospital costs into general revenue grants. I will come back to that question in a moment. Secondly, I point out that the Jamison Committee was a joint initiative of the Federal and State governments, a sort of exemplification of the Fraser policy of new federalism, of co-operative relationships between State governments and the Federal Government on an important matter such as health care. The implementation of the report of the Jamison Committee is not an example of co-operative relationships between the State governments and the Federal Government. Let me point to that in a simple way by referring to the Victorian Minister of Health, Mr Borthwick, who described the way in which the Federal Government had responded to the provisions of the Jamison report as a cynical exercise. The Government was using the Jamison report as a method of launching yet another Fraser health policy on the Australian community and was not in fact responding to the terms of the Jamison report. So much for Fraser federalism and the notion of co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments on a wide variety of health matters which are crucial to the Australian people and crucial to all governments which provide health services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government has had its response to the joint Commonwealth-State committee which dealt with health care described by a Liberal Minister of the Victorian Parliament as a cynical exercise. He has been joined by the Queensland Minister who has already criticised the Commonwealth Government's attitude towards the provision of health care services and the response to the Jamison report as he understood it in similar terms. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What do you think of the absorption of these block grants?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hoped to come to that aspect in a moment, but as Senator Chipp has asked me what I think about the absorption of Commonwealth grants to hospitals into general revenue grants as distinct from specific purpose grants, let me say that the Opposition has no particular objection. However, it does object to one thing-the Government's stated intention that these Commonwealth funds will be earmarked for only a limited period. We take the view that if we do not earmark the Commonwealth contribution to health and hospitals in particular over a long period and in a sense in perpetuity the State governments will compete for a variety of purposes which may detract from the health care function of the State and Commonwealth governments. We are not saying that we disapprove of the States' administering hospitals with the assistance of general purpose grants from the Commonwealth. We are saying that the Commonwealth's contribution should be earmarked for health purposes continually. We think that is very important because we are concerned about national standards in health care and hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not quarrel with the concept of the Government's response which is in terms of general purpose health grants rather than specific purpose grants. We quarrel with the looseness of the Government's statement about how far the Commonwealth will specify that the Commonwealth money is available for health purposes. I will return to that subject in a moment when I speak in connection with community health services and school dental services. I say to Senator Chipp that I want it to be quite clear that the Opposition feels that a national government has a role to play in insisting as far as possible, on the maintaining of uniform national standards for hospitals and so on. Let me illustrate that point in a particular way by quoting Dr Lionel Wilson of the Australian Medical Association. The quotation to which I wish to refer concerns statistics on planning, building, facilities and manpower in relation to health. Dr Wilson said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no rational information system allowing meaningful comparisons of the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery in the various States. Without such a system allocation of money will continue to be arbitrary. </PARA>
<PARA>The point Dr Wilson is making is that if we do not have some sort of Commonwealth supervision of the way Commonwealth money is spent we will get a very arbitrary system of allocating money for health services in Australia. We would be opposed to such an arbitrary system. </PARA>
<PARA> We take the view that at this point of our national history-if we can refer to this country as a nation-there is a minimum set of standards which should be applicable to all Australians in relation to the delivery of health care services. Under the Fraser Government policy Mark V there is no provision for a minimum national standard of health care services. When we talk about minimum national standards we have to bear in mind that culturally and socially in the Australian society there is one law, one provision, for the poor and another for the rich. That has been so for a long time. If a person is rich and ill everything is open to him. If a politician is ill all sorts of sophisticated medical care is available to him. If a person is poor and ill in Australian society those services are not available to him. That is a cultural and social fact of a society which we should bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a number of specifics of the statement brought down by the Minister for Health in the House of Representatives and also brought down by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who represents the Minister for Health in the Senate. I said earlier that the statement is a very patchwork document. It has all the hallmarks of being put together at 4 o'clock this afternoon. It is a monument to the ineptitude of the Fraser Government, a Government which is characterised not by decision but by a capacity for indecision. The history of health care in Australia reveals that since 1976 we have had five experiments in mucking around with the provisions relating to health care and health insurance-five experiments on the Australian people who, by now, ought to be sick of being guinea pigs for the Fraser Government's ideological experiments in this field. We have before us a patchwork document which obviously was put together at 4 o'clock this afternoon. It is typical of this Government that this is so. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the so-called razor gang, the report of which is presumably to be delivered tomorrow. As one commentator in the Sydney Morning Herald said this morning, this is not bad government; it is mad government. Of course, a Government which is obsessed with its own intrinsic divisions cannot possess a capacity to make decisions about these important matters. That is not possible for a government which is presided over by a Prime Minister who, in the words of one of its former distinguished Ministers, has a manic obsession with getting his own way. Such a Government cannot make decisions in the interests of the Australian people. This document is yet another monument to that fact. On 27 March the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, was saying in Melbourne something quite contrary in relation to health care to what is said in the statement that has been brought down tonight. Why has it been brought down in its present form? It is because the manic obsession of the Prime Minister has again prevailed over the advice of the Minister for Health. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose now to refer to some of the specific matters which are dealt with in the report. The Government set up the Jamison inquiry at a cost of half a million dollars. We who sit in the Senate, in contradistinction to all those who might be silly enough to sit listening to the broadcast of proceedings, know of numerous reports commissioned by the Government-such as the Holcroft report on aviation-which have been ignored when finally brought down. This is a Government which, in order to avoid making decisions, resorts to the appointment of inquiries and seeks the presentation of reports, thus obfuscating and eliminating the necessity for making decisions in the short term. The Jamison inquiry on hospitals in Australia cost half a million dollars. For a long time it was projected by the Government as a method of solving its problems in relation to health costs. Because the Jamison inquiry did not come up with the answers that the Government wanted, weeks of Cabinet meetings have been devoted to formulating the Government's fifth health scheme in as many years. The response to the Jamison Commission's report has been produced this week by the Government because the Premiers are meeting next week and the question of hospital and health funding as basic to their deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reversed one important Jamison recommendation. It is requiring means testing in regard to public hospital beds, a course which the Jamison inquiry rejected. It has reversed a second recommendation of the Commission in that it is absorbing hospital grants into general purpose grants, another course which the Commission rejected. Insofar as this is a response to the report, it is a facade. In the words of the Victorian Health Minister, it is a cynical exercise. Furthermore, the Government has now recommended a 32c tax rebate, a course which the Jamison Commission did not even consider. These are inventions and crazy fantasies of the Fraser Government projected in this response to the Jamison Commission's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The response indicates no real acceptance by the Government of the first tenet of the Jamison report: That the Commonwealth is a provider of funds, with overall responsibility for making available facilities which will promote the good health of the people of Australia. The document brought down tonight by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is not one which is concerned with the good health of the people of Australia. It is one which is concerned with the ideology of the Fraser Government, an ideology which has been described by one eminent authority as manically obsessive and concerned with the saving of Commonwealth funds at the expense of the States and of the people of Australia. This is not a Government which is concerned with the good health of the people of Australia and it has produced a statement which shows that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, what is most important is that the Government is abandoning responsibility for national standards and national needs in regard to health care. It is really recycling the old days-going back to the health system of the 1950s and 1960s. Hospital costs, the community health care program and the school dental services will revert to the States and after this year will be incorporated in general revenue grants and earmarked for specific purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done, in the guise of telling the States that they will have freedom to spend the allocated funds, is dictate to them what they shall do. The Grants Commission has been allotted the unfortunate and unhappy role of working out the 'appropriate mechanism' for allocating funds between the States. That is a sad imposition upon the Grants Commission. No particular information is provided as to whether it can carry out that function. The Commonwealth is demanding that the States do exactly what it wishes. If not, funds for health will be cut. Implicit in this statement is that the funding of State public hospital systems can be reduced on a progressive basis without jeopardising the quality and standard of care provided in such hospitals. There is no evidence to support that implicit suggestion in the Government's response to the Commission's report. There is not one tittle of evidence that funds can be reduced and the same quality of care maintained in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the rhetoric in the first five pages of the statement by the Minister for Health-I invite Liberal Party senators, only two of whom are in the chamber tonight to read it-one will see that it contains all sorts of rubbish and gobbledygook about what the people of Australia should consider as appropriate in relation to health care standards. The people of Australia are invited to play a greater part, to accept a greater responsibility for their own health and health care. That is a laudable invitation, if I might say so to Senator Thomas, one of the two Liberal Party senators who happens to be in the chamber. It really means that the people of Australia are being invited, without being given any assistance from this Government-whatsoever the causes of ill health-to make a contribution additional to that which they have traditionally made. It is a very glib sort of statement. I find it extremely debatable, to say the least, to claim that despite cuts in funds the State hospital systems can deliver quality health care. I want to make one point in relation to Queensland. Queensland has provided for some years-37, I believe-a free hospital system. Under the terms of the statement brought down in the House of Representatives today by the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, it is estimated that the Queensland Government will have to pay an additional $100m from State funds if it is to maintain its free hospital system. I make that point specifically for people who live in Queensland and who have enjoyed what I believe is an excellent system of free hospital treatment. </PARA>

In my view, it does not matter whether we have one lightweight or another as leader of the Government in this country. That is probably what they are doing tonight. I invite Senator Watson, a senator from Tasmania who has now come into the chamber-a laudable exercise, if I might say so-to tell his Queensland colleagues that it will cost the Queensland Government an extra $100m to provide the services it has provided in the past in relation to free hospital care in Queensland if this statement is carried into government policy. Senator Watson, I know, is a man of goodwill and I hope that he will tell Queensland senators in the morning about that prospect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to deal with a number of matters in the statement, but let me just summarise some of the most important points. The first area I want to go into is health insurance funds. This is a government which in terms of its ideology and rhetoric has talked a great deal about individual freedom in Australia. Malcolm Fraser has talked in his numerous election speeches-he said it on 5 December last year in South Australia-about the importance of the freedom of the individual under Malcolm Fraser's Government. He said again yesterday, in a ludicrous response to the former Minister for Industrial Relations, how much he stressed the importance of the freedom of individuals to spend their own income in Australia under Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at health care and health insurance and the freedom of the individual in Australia under Malcolm Fraser's Government. The Fraser Government, as a consequence of this statement, proposes to force all Australians into health insurance funds. They are all taxpayers, but they are to be forced into health insurance funds under the freedom which is provided by Malcolm Fraser's Government. They are to be forced into health insurance funds in a number of ways. First of all, there will be no Commonwealth benefit for uninsured patients, even though they are taxpayers. A taxpayer has no option; if he wants to receive the Commonwealth benefit for health insurance, from now on, under Malcolm Fraser's Government, he has to belong to a fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to come to that in a moment. There is a very small group of disadvantaged people which the Fraser Government recognises and to which a traditional sop has been extended. I invite the honourable senator to go back to his electorate in Tasmania and to tell somebody on $200 a week what he has to do under the new Fraser health insurance proposal. He has to join a fund, at accelerating contribution rates. He has to recognise that if he goes to a public hospital he will have to pay an increased daily bed fee. He has to recognise all those things. Liberal senators should tell such a person in the States they represent what that will mean to him. I hope they will do it honestly. There is no freedom of choice available to him. If Senator Watson can make a speech telling me that there is, I will be the first to applaud him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, there will be no Commonwealth benefits for uninsured patients-a stick from the Fraser Government, the government of freedom of choice. Secondly, there will be tax rebates only for insured patients-a stick from the Fraser Government, the government of freedom of choice and of individual liberty. Thirdly, the current optional insurance tables will be prohibited for all those who insure and there will be no free hospital treatment for bed day patients or for out-patients. What sort of society is that? What sort of society will Liberal senators tell us that is in terms of freedom of choice? I just draw attention to the fact that, under the free enterprise Fraser Government, the contributions to health insurance funds into which all Australians are to be forced by prescriptive legislation and by conscription will be raised significantly because of the increased hospital charges that the States will impose and because the facilities provided by the funds will have to take account of that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These measures, I think, represent rough surgery on what is admittedly the sick man of Australian public life-our health system-but the Australian Democrats think it is perhaps necessary rough surgery. It would be delightful for all of us if somehow the huge and growing costs of medical care in Australia could be paid for by somebody else. That would be just fine, but unfortunately it does not work that way. One way or another, we pay for it ourselves. I was rather disappointed to hear the Opposition spokesman on health, Dr Neal Blewett, on tonight's PM program on the Australian Broadcasting Commission deplore the passing of free hospitals. There have never been and never will be free hospitals. The community pays in one way or another. I think we have had that lesson spelt out time and again over the last few years by the enormous increase in costs, which in my view are demonstrably necessary, particularly in hospital administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that if unlimited amounts of money are made available to bureaucrats they will spend it and go on spending it in enormous quantities, apparently regarding the public purse as bottomless. It is not bottomless. These enormous costs have been reflected already in huge costs to the Australian public for health care, whether or not people are insured. It is against that background that the Australian Democrats acknowledge these measures as at least the Government's effort to remove some of the fat from health care costs. The extent to which that effort is successful will be reflected in due course in the cost of health insurance. Senator Watson interjected a while ago and said that additional membership should provide a set-off. Senator Button conceded that point. Let us hope that that is so. Let us see what does happen in that area. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I have, Senator Tate. That is a point I will return to later in this speech. The way in which funds are spent, which I think Senator Tate will concede was more the point I made in that speech and I will make it again, is an interesting argument in the whole matter of block funding versus the absorption principle. I take the view that we are not necessarily going to ensure that there is any real control over the way a State spends its Budget allocation by having it as a special purpose grant if it is merely for health care. The situation will come about in which institutional spending will take priority over everything else because it is easier for public servants to administer it. That is one thing that worries me about this whole situation. In any case, these measures may not be successful. We shall wait and see. The Australian community will be watching them with great care and, no doubt, will make political judgments on whatever happens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy of the Australian Democrats from the inception of the party has been for a community funded national health scheme in which we would seek to maintain fee for service private practice but on a community service basis. In other words, we see a strong obligation on the medical profession to do, in many cases, better than it has done in the past, to provide a real service to the society. By that we mean that doctors should be available in every locality on a 24-hour basis and that doctors should get together in group practices and make sure that they do that. It is only on the basis that they provide that service to the community that they should come to a government or the community and say that they have a right to earn money from it. They have no automatic right to rip off the public, as pathologists are doing to a disgusting extent in this country. Enormous fortunes are being made by medical pathologists, quite unnecessarily. That profession must clean up this kind of Aegean stable before I will agree, and I think most other Australian Democrats will agree, with the Government's view that private enterprise alone can deal with this problem and that there should not be any other form of medical service in this country. That is something I will return to in a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also our policy-this is a matter I still commend to the Government-that higher excises on alcohol and tobacco should go directly to help finance national health measures in view of the very considerable financial burden that the diseases related to these products impose on the community. I think that is a matter that should not be lost sight of. I think it is a perfectly valid view for a community to hold. Why should the great majority of Australians who do not destroy their health in this way have to pay for the indulgences and the self-inflicted wounds of those who do?</PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see much greater emphasis placed on preventative medicine and on community health services which are aimed at health maintenance. We hope that these objectives eventually will be realised. They must now be pursued at the State government level because the basic truth about the proposals we are debating tonight is that the Commonwealth Government is abdicating a very considerable area of responsibility and, curiously, retaining other areas. The Australian Democrats would ask: Is the Government now to use the absorption principle of including all the funds for public hospitals, the general community health program and the school dental service in general revenue grants? It says that on page 10 of the statement. It says that all those things will, indeed, go into general revenue grants. If so, why is the Government, as described on page 19 of the statement, taking over full responsibility for the payment of nursing home benefits? If the State governments can be trusted with the vast body of medical care, why not trust them with this area also? It seems to me to be inconceivable that they should not be trusted to see that the aged and chronically ill are not thrown to the wolves. There is an inconsistency in this area which I would like a Government senator to explain to me at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly common knowledge that the decision whether funds should be absorbed into general revenue grants or block grants over which the Commonwealth Government would retain some control has been an agonised one. I have some comments to make on that. If, indeed, funds are to be absorbed into general purpose grants, we must hope that all State governments will at all future times, take a proper and responsible view of their obligation to provide, as is stated on page 1 of the ministerial statement, 'health care services of high quality at a cost the individual and the community can afford'. I do not necessarily believe that block grants purely for medical purposes would avoid that. Surely it is the priority of spending that is important. On an earlier occasion in the Senate, I raised a matter concerning a body scanner approved for the Royal Perth Hospital. I raise the matter again now because it is interesting. There was some criticism earlier this year by a health care consumers association in Western Australia of the decision to provide, at a cost of $75,000, a new body scanner for the Royal Perth Hospital. This was the fourth body scanner for Western Australia. That gave Western Australia exactly the same number of scanners as are operating in the whole of Britain. I wonder whether that kind of situation will continue. As I said earlier, I think to Senator Tate, institutional spending is easier because public servants can administer it easily and apparently there are no hard, controversial areas concerned with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point-I think all of us in this place ought to consider it-is that for a long time the community has tended to regard the Federal Government-in Canberra-as being responsible for health care. Community attitudes and knowledge of what we are doing change very slowly indeed. I venture to predict that, in view of this conditioning, the public will tend to do that in the future. It will take a long time before most people fully realise that the States became responsible when these measures went forward. If things go very wrong, I suggest that there could still be a backwash of opinion directed at Canberra. This is, in a sense, an argument for general purpose grants. At least, if the money has gone to the States and they have the responsibility for providing health care they have that responsibility squarely and in time the community will realise that. If they get a block grant they can come back and say: 'We bought body scanners and things like that but we do not have enough money. We want more money now'. I think that is a situation which is to be avoided if, indeed, the Government is to persist with this idea that the States are to do it all. If they are to do it all, I think they should accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the obligation which will now rest on the States to raise hospital bed costs, the costs of health care for Australians throughout this country will rise. I would like now to come to the problem of the single income family. It cannot be stressed sufficiently-I think this is constantly overlooked-that the financial constraints in this area are very real. I am not speaking about just a few Australians. I am speaking about possibly tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of young families. These people cannot claim to be disadvantaged in the terms of these proposals. They have an income and they have jobs but they also have very high commitments, especially if they are renting houses, paying off furniture on hire purchase, paying off a car, buying shoes for the children and doing all the things that young Australians have to do. They may be actually unable to meet medical insurance costs or they may be very severely inclined to give them a lower priority than other things. In other words, they will cut corners and take risks because they simply do not see that they have the money to spare. To the Australian Democrats that seems to be a major fault of these new proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> A little earlier tonight Senator Martyr made his maiden speech. He is a Liberal Party senator. I take this opportunity to congratulate him for his first speech in this chamber and I welcome him here. In his maiden speech he made a point about the needs of the family. He said that we need more children in this country and we are below replacement level. If that is so, how can he, as a Liberal Party senator, support these proposals? How can he say that people will not be able to afford to have children? Under these principles they cannot. The Government in these principles is bringing forward a positive disincentive to people to have children. It is one of many positive disincentives. I think it is time the Government realised that it is doing this, whether deliberately or not, to great effect. If, as Senator Martyr says, not enough children are being born in Australia now, I suggest he should look for the beam in his own eye before he looks for the mote in somebody else's. He is a member of the Liberal Party. It is his job to see that something is done about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Even worse is the situation of people who actually have children. Their children have been born and they have a young family of perhaps three or four young children. These people are Australians of the future. They should be to us the most important people in our society. They are the next generation. They are the perpetuation of this country after we have left it. We have very grave responsibilities to them. Are we now saying that we are going to create a situation in which these young people, who do not ask to be born into this country and who have no political decision-making capacity, will have to take the risk of ill health, some aspects of which could perhaps be carried right through into their adult life? This is because their parents, with the best will in the world and after agonising over the matter, feel that they cannot afford health insurance or, even worse, they have taken the chance of not taking out health insurance? They are now very much caught in a catch-22 situation. It is a desperate situation. As far as the Government is concerned, unless they can prove that they are disadvantaged-provided the father is working-those children will suffer, and will suffer badly. They will get absolutely no help from anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Australian Democrats say that there has to be an escape area. We would go back to our own policy. We say that the best kind of escape area would be for the Government to see some kind of merit in other points of view. I know that in these proposals the Government has said that it believes that private enterprise, fee for service and medicine has to be the whole mainstay of the system. Be that so, surely the Government has sufficient social conscience and awareness to realise that there may be groups who will suffer in this situation. If we are to be very categorical over something we are going to hurt somebody. I would have thought that that was a basic political principle that people should understand. Why then, should then Government not recognise that community health services-community health centres-particularly in suburbs occupied by working people in which there are people with young families, are essential if these measures are to proceed. Then, if a family has a problem it will have at least somewhere to go. The children of that family will not be left to suffer because the Government has not really thought this matter through enough and has not provided an opportunity for a desperate plight to be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government will say: 'That does not matter. In the future those matters will be for the States. If you want any moves for innovations and improvements in health services it will now be in the arena of State politics'. I suggest that that attitude is not really good enough. If the Government wants to see reasonable health care provided for all Australians-I suggest that that is still very much a part of our responsibility in this place and will be seen by the public as part of our responsibility, which I think is rather important-we have to encourage those health centres and perhaps even pay for them as well. The Government has taken the view, as I said earlier, that there are areas in which it will help. It is to provide funds for the aged and chronically ill so that they are not thrown to the wolves. I say to the Government that it ought also to perceive in this area of young families that are on, below or just above the average income, another area of possible need where some remedial circumstances may be necessary. I hope that the Government will not neglect that area in the interests of many tens of thousands-perhaps hundreds of thousands of young Australians. One can hope, I suppose, that with enlightened State governments, health commissions and health departments there will be a greater accent on preventative medicine and a recognition of the needs of families that are being paid below or not too much beyond the average wage. </PARA>
<PARA> There will now be a requirement on the States to provide free hospital services only to eligible pensioners and their dependants and the disadvantaged. Of course the Australian Democrats agree that those categories of people should be taken care of. But we are also concerned at the definition of the disadvantaged as set out on page 17 of the statement, particularly the third definition, which is terribly vague at this stage. It refers merely to 'persons who meet a specified income test'. That does not tell us very much. We do not know what the specified income test is. We would hope that it would not be set too rigidly. In particular, we would ask that very significant variations be made to it in an upwards direction by negotiation with the States to provide for the number of children in a family. I would like to hear from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) later. I take it that that would probably be a principle which would have to be subscribed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the acknowledgement. He concedes that point, I am sure. The mere fact that he has done so will ease the minds of many Australians who are listening to this debate tonight and who are wondering just what is to happen to them and their health problems in the future. There is also an aspect of humiliation in proving low income. I think much will depend on how the test is administered. I do not think it is at all good that we should have a society in which people are compelled by the circumstances of law and necessity to lose their dignity, their self-respect. I think it is vitally important that people should be able to maintain those qualities, whatever else they do. If they are poor-maybe they are poor through no fault of their own-at least they should be allowed to retain their self-respect. We trust that it will be with compassion and discretion that this income test is carried out. I think the Government may have to give some special thought to that matter also, to see that we have no procedures that smack of eighteenth century poor house administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am trying to speak within the general framework. With all respect to Senator Button, I do not think it is of much use saying to the Government that it is doing everything wrongly. If it is going to do something, let us look at the proposal to see what is the best way of doing it. That is certainly our view. Within the general framework the Government has laid out in this statement, there is provision for a tax deduction for health insurance costs over and above the general rebate. It is to be fixed at 32c in the dollar, so that the wealthy are not advantaged over the battlers, and this is a good thing. We are pleased to see that provision. We hope that it will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> We also applaud the Government for the provisions described on page 19 of the statement which are 'to increase assistance for the aged and chronically ill through greater support to organisations providing home nursing services'. We agree very much that to help keep aging persons out of institutions, in their own homes, for as long as possible, is a worthy aim. We support it absolutely. We say that on the evidence of the past it has not been subscribed to nearly enough in Australia. In town after town, one finds that domiciliary services have been cut back. I think it is tragic that that has happened. I cannot see that there is any economic gain in it. If we cut out a domiciliary service that might be looking after half a dozen people in their own homes, we then have to put these people in institutions and immediately increase our costs. I believe that that is indeed a crazy way of looking at health care finance. We applaud the Government for that provision. We urge it to take that principle just as far as it can. We believe that the further it takes it, the more it will make people happy and keep health costs down. </PARA>
<PARA> There may well be heavy criticism of the Government over these measures-indeed, it has already come from the Opposition-but we in the Australian Democrats believe that there has been a necessity to grasp the nettle and this has been done. We trust and expect that the Commonwealth will watch developments in the future quite closely to see whether this experiment in greater State responsibility is successful and that it will reserve the right to intervene if it is not. I think the Government owes the Australian people at least that much. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the spending of money and the priorities of health care worries me a little. I mentioned the matter of the use of a body scanner in Perth. Recently during the adjournment debate in this place I had occasion to mention the Allandale geriatric hospital at Cessnock in New South Wales. It is the largest geriatric hospital in New South Wales. I saw it recently for myself. As I said in the Senate, it represented a degree of utter misery and total discomfort for the unfortunate elderly people there. It might have come from the pages of a novel by Charles Dickens, so degrading and so terrible was the plight of those people. I may say that I have heard quite recently from the New South Wales Health Minister, Mr Kevin Stewart. He wrote to me telling me that close on $250,000 will now be spent on Allandale to correct the problems about which I wrote to him and which I mentioned here in the adjournment debate. That kind of response from a State health department-it was a prompt, reasonable response to what I had said-is a good one. It is a hopeful augury that greater State control, at least in New South Wales, will work. </PARA>
<PARA> All other things being equal, the Australian Democrats believe in devolution of political power. Viewed in the broadest possible way, these measures pass power on to smaller units-the States themselves. It has been said by Opposition spokesmen that less money will be available to the States. But the States will at least have the power stool to ask for money, to lay down their needs and then to spend the money wisely. Surely it is a question of priorities. Allandale is a good case in point. If a fraction of the money that was spent on the body scanner in the West-I know that I am speaking of another State-had been spent on Allandale, 500 old people could have had a reasonable life in their closing days. Instead, that place has been a living hell for years. I do not think it is right that that should happen. It worries me a little that there is not any overall national view of that matter. I think it can be looked at in the light of public opinion to make sure that the States are spending this money wisely. If there are any areas of gross misspending, that could be brought to public attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats ask: What will be the future of the Commonwealth Health Department? Will it continue to function effectively into the future? What will its role be? What will it continue to cost the community? Will that cost be justified because of the reduced responsibilities that it will now bear? I would ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) if he speaks, to give us some insight into that matter. I feel it would be of considerable interest to the public to know the answer. We do not want a residual Health Department of large proportions in Canberra which no longer has any responsibilities or much work to do. That is something we have to accept and that the Government ought to accept. It has created this situation. It is up to the Government now to tidy up that aspect as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We would ask also for rationalisation of the health funds. This is a matter which I regard as a most important part of Australian Democratic policy. Tax deductibility of health fund premiums will now provide the funds with a huge subsidy at public expense. That really ought to get the health funds on their feet and I believe they ought to give due credit for it. May we now see a situation in which they give real value for money? That means a cutback in their extensive competitive advertising which has cost the consumer vast sums of money-quite unnecessarily and unjustifiably, and a cutback in the costs involved in the duplication of such things as staff and computer equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot of talk in this place, especially from honourable senators opposite that there should be fewer trade unions. We agree with this. It is obviously more efficient. Let us then take that principle further. There should perhaps be fewer health funds. Let us have a spirit of competition; but beyond that, let us at least have economically sized units so that the public is not expected to keep this industry going. There is a rather important implication in these proposals-that is, that the Commonwealth Government has now virtually committed itself to supporting these private funds. They have been made an integral part of the health system. They have been given the opportunity of a continued life, a virtual guarantee to print money for themselves. It is up to the Commonwealth Government to see that that money is spent wisely and with greater responsibility than has been shown in that area in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the Australian public will not accept another messed up medical health setup. The Government has its last chance in this matter. If it messes up this scheme, or if the scheme turns out to be a mess, I suggest that the backlash from the community will be very considerable, and rightly so. But granted good will and a genuine desire to give service on the part of all the areas concerned, these proposals may work. It is that desire to give service on the part of the areas concerned that is probably far more important than the mechanism we use. I think it has to be understood that a new scheme, a new set of health proposals, will not be a panacea for anything. It will not make up for the doctor and the pathologist who rip off their patients. It will not make up for the doctor who says: 'I am going to induce this birth because I want to play golf this afternoon'. That does happen; I know that it happens fairly frequently. I think the Commonwealth Government might at least provide some kind of continuing mechanism-perhaps this could be a role for the Health Department, if it is to continue at all, and I suppose it will-to consult the community regularly so that these proposals can be modified progressively from now on. We can only regard these proposals as a sort of crude beginning, a new direction. Whether they work will depend very much on the extent to which the community is consulted and the extent to which the proposals can be modified in the future to meet the reasonable requirements of the community. I would suggest to the Government that just to say that it is going to start this machine off and let it run along its rails without any further interference would be a complete and absolute abdication of its responsibility. It is, after all, the Government of this country and I think it has certain responsibilities in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support that policy of consultation wholeheartedly. We expect and hope that the Commonwealth Government will provide machinery nationally to see that at long last the people begin to get what they reasonably want and need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This evening we are debating a statement which was brought down in this place by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). That statement outlines the Government's new health scheme. When my colleague, Senator Button, was speaking, he mentioned that there were no Queensland senators present in the chamber. He was, of course, referring to Queensland senators on the Government benches, and certainly there were none present at that stage. I think I should point out at this stage that there was a Queensland senator from the Australian Labor Party in the chair at the time and there was also one sitting here waiting to speak. At one other stage also a Labor Party senator from Queensland was in the chamber for a short time. Whilst there were no honourable senators from Queensland on the Government benches present to speak on this matter or even to listen to the comments about the statement which was brought down, there were Labor senators from Queensland present. I point out that at the moment there are still no senators from Queensland present in the chamber on the Government benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make some comments tonight about the way this statement that was presented, and the new scheme that is contained in it, will affect the people of Queensland. This point was touched upon by Senator Button, but I should like to go into it in greater depth. This new scheme will not be well received in Queensland. In the next few days, and tomorrow in particular, I can understand that the debate in Queensland will be very much against this new scheme that has been brought in. The debate will continue over the next few days. The reason for this is that for many years Queensland has prided itself on its free hospital system. The previous speaker, Senator Mason, had some disparaging things to say about the free hospital system. He said that there was no such thing. We have had a free hospital system in Queensland since 1944, when it was introduced by a Labor government. It was carried on by that government and it has been carried on by successive National-Liberal governments in Queensland since that time. I could debate the idea of a free hospital system at length. I will not do so, but let me just mention these points. In Queensland, when we send our children to a primary school, we do not send them with fees in their pockets to pay the teachers' salaries. We accept the fact that if a burglar burgles our home and a policeman is called, the policeman is not paid cash when he comes around to investigate. It is the general revenue that pays for those services. This is the same principle that we have used in Queensland with our hospital system. Since 1944 we have had a hospital system in which one can obtain free of charge the best medical care in Australia. Any person who becomes ill or who is involved in an accident does not have to worry about medical charges because of our free hospital system. If a motor cyclist in Brisbane has the misfortune to have an accident and is taken to the Royal Brisbane Hospital, he obtains medical treatment there without charge. He has certainly got enough worries because he came off his motor cycle. He certainly has enough worries because of his injury. But he does not have the financial worry that is attached to his hospitalisation. This is the system that we have had in Queensland for 37 years. If a child becomes ill on Thursday Island, that child is taken to the Thursday Island Hospital. The parents may have some worries about that child's illness, but they do not have the worry about the financial burden that might be placed on them if we did not have that free hospital system. The same system pertains throughout all of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that this free hospital system was introduced in 1944. It has been a firm commitment under Labor and non-Labor governments. A little while ago Senator Walters asked me whether I agreed with my Premier on this matter. There are very few things that I agree with my Premier on, but she would find that all parties in Queensland-the Labor Party and the National-Liberal coalition-have a commitment to the free hospital system. Whatever party is in power in Queensland, whether it is the current coalition or whether there is a change of government and we have an Australian Labor Party government, one would find that both of those groups of parties would give a high priority to the free hospital system. But in the statement that was given to us today there is direct pressure on the Queensland Government to alter its policy of a free hospital system. I shall quote from pages 13 and 14 of the statement. The statement says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided that the funding to be allocated to New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory that represents its interest in the provision of health services should be equal to-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first major point-</PARA>
<PARA>the sum necessary to maintain in real terms the funding provided in 1980-81 for public hospitals, the general community health program, and the school dental scheme;</PARA>
<PARA>And this is the other point-</PARA>
<PARA>less a share of the revenue the States could be reasonably expected to raise through the introduction of appropriate in-patient and out-patient charges in 1981-82 and the user pays principle in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us go back to that first point. I just wonder how long this sum-and remember, the sum was said to be the sum necessary to maintain in real terms the funding provided in 1980-81 for public hospitals-will be available. We are all aware of the changes that the Government has made in health care in the last 5 1/2 years. When this statement was first issued tonight I admit that I had lost count of how many changes we had had in those 5 1/2 years. Senator Button, in his speech, mentioned that this was the fifth health program that this Government had put foward. But what is the point in knowing that it is the fifth or the fourth or something like that because it is inevitable, if one looks at the history of this Government and its health care programs, that more changes are likely to be on the way. We just know that there has been change after change. How long will this sum, the sum necessary to maintain in real terms the funding provided in 1980-81 for public hospitals, be available? There is a hint in earlier parts of the Minister's speech that we will have such a change. I shall quote part of that speech:</PARA>
<PARA> It-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>agreed with the Commission that the responsibility of the States should be more clearly defined and that they should be required to take up their full responsibilities for the provision of health services. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In reaching this decision the Government has been mindful of the warning of the Commission of Inquiry that one should hasten slowly. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on it said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . dramatic changes cannot be made over night. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on in the statement there is talk about the initial period of the new arrangements. Those parts of the statement seem to indicate quite clearly that we will have changes, changes that will affect this part of the new arrangements which says that we are going to maintain in real terms the funding provided in 1980-81 for public hospitals. But the real rub, and the real rub for the people of Queensland and for Queensland hospitals, is contained in the second section of those two factors which were outlined, the section which outlines the way in which the Federal Government will allocate funds for public hospitals. I reiterate that the statement says that the funds will be provided:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . less a share of the revenue the States could be reasonably expected to raise through the introduction of appropriate in-patient and out-patient charges in 1981-82 and the user pays principles in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>What this means is that the Commonwealth will determine an amount that the States should raise through in-patient and out-patient charges and it will take this amount away from the amount that it would otherwise have provided for the hospitals in the States. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Peter Baume, who introduced this statement in this chamber, know quite clearly that everything possible will be done in Queensland to maintain the free hospital system. They know that if they are going to take funds away from Queensland because Queensland will not impose in-patient and out-patient charges, this is really nothing but a not-too-subtle form of blackmail of the people of Queensland. It is not an approach that will be received well by Queensland residents. How much is the Federal Government going to penalise Queensland for continuing to maintain its free hospital system? At this stage, I do not really know. But let us look at one part of the statement made today, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the States raise the bed day charge in public hospitals from $50 for a shared room and $75 for a private room to a level which more closely approximates to the actual daily bed cost involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in Queensland, if one goes into a public hospital and is there as an in-patient, one does not pay a bed charge. So I just wonder when we look at that $50 and that $74 whether Queensland will be penalised at least $50 per bed per day. </PARA>
<PARA> Another figure was introduced here this evening. Senator Button said that his research indicated that it would cost the State Government of Queensland an extra $100m a year if this new system were in operation. Some might say that it was the Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate saying that and perhaps that was exaggerated. Well, if it is exaggerated, the Minister for Health in Queensland, Mr Austin, is exaggerating even more. I would think that the Minister for Health in Queensland would have much better resources at his command so that he could estimate this more precisely than we are able to do here. Mr Austin, the Minister for Health in Queensland, said today that if Queensland were to maintain its free hospital system it would have to find as a minimum an extra $150m a year by the end of 1982. Whether it is $100m a year or $150m a year or even something less than that, say $50m a year, it is a hefty penalty that this present Government is placing on the people of Queensland for their wanting to maintain their free hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though Queensland has been generously treated in the past by this Government. When the hospital cost sharing arrangements commenced Queensland started with a low base of hospital funding. Because the allocation of federal finance was based on that low base, the amount that Queensland received was lower than that of the other States and Queensland could not improve its position in relation to the other States. I would like to illustrate that by quoting from volume 2 of the Jamison report. For those who are interested, I am quoting from page 95 of that report. Referring to the relative position of the States, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Department of Health in its submission demonstrated that because budgets are prepared by escalating a base year figure of the actual expenditure during the previous year, by various cost producing factors, a State which starts off from a low base can never improve its position relative to other States. This becomes especially evident if some arbitrary percentage increase is applied in the level of funds allocated from one budget to the next. </PARA>
<PARA>Page 96 of the Jamison report quotes the operating costs for the State public hospitals throughout Australia, and I will refer to the 1978-79 figures. The table covers both 1977-78 and 1978-79. These are per capita expenditure figures for the various States; New South Wales was $156.7 and Victoria $134.76. Queensland was the lowest with $127.95. When we look at South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, we find that Western Australia has the highest expenditure per capita with $189. That seems to give the lie to the theory that if one has a free hospital system it will be an expensive hospital system. In Queensland we spend less per capita on public hospitals than is spent in any other State, the highest expenditure being in Western Australia, where it is about $60 per capita more than in Queensland. Because we started off with that low base and because the funds provided to Queensland under the hospital cost sharing agreement were on that basis, Queensland was never able to get ahead. I will illustrate that point by indicating the amount that the Commonwealth pays to the States for public hospitals. Again I refer to the Jamison report, Volume 2, page 102, and quote the figures for just one year. Although the table mentions costs for five years, they all show the same picture. Queensland received the lowest amount from the Commonwealth for its public hospitals-$70.54 per capita. The highest amount was received by Western Australia-$101.93. The point is that Queensland has received less money than any other State. It is not as though Queensland has been generously treated in the past by the Commonwealth and now suddenly something must happen and Queensland must bear the extra burden of $100m, according to my leader, or $150m, according to the Health Minister in Queensland. It is not as though Queensland has been treated well. It has not been treated so well as all the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear indication that one of two things will happen when this new scheme is introduced. Either Queensland taxpayers will foot an additional bill of $100m a year or there will be a severe and drastic cutback in medical services in Queensland. Many statements have been made about the new system the Government is bringing forward, and I will mention one that was made by the Queensland President of the Doctors Reform Society. According to an AAP statement, the President, Dr Bor, condemned the changes as being socially inequitable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The changes further create two classes of patient, the poor and the wealthy, with the wealthy able to afford full health care insurance and be reimbursed by tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA>He predicted that Queensland will be forced to abandon its free hospital system. That is one of the two consequences that I predicted would happen. Either Queensland will be forced to abandon its free medical services or it will face this extra cost of $100m a year. When the Government introduced this measure this afternoon, I am sure that it forgot that the Senate was part of the Parliament and that it was thinking only of the House of Representatives. The statement that was placed before us in the Parliament this afternoon commenced:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the fundamental goal of this Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One could say that a mistake was made and that instead of putting Mr President somebody put Mr Speaker, but it was quite clear to me that all the Government was thinking about was the House of Representatives. When we go to page 12 of the document that was handed to me it again states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I would draw the House's attention to the fact . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the statement that was put in front of us. If the Government forgot that it had a Senate, I am sure that it will not forget that it has one when it brings the enabling legislation into the Parliament. That enabling legislation, for the system that was outlined to us today, will have to pass through this chamber. It will have to run the gamut of opposition, not only from this side but also, I presume, from Queensland senators on the other side. No Queensland senator worth his salt will stand idly by and see legislation of this nature, which will take away the free hospital system in Queensland, go through. Only about a fortnight ago I picked up my Courier-Mail after Mr Austin, the Minister for Health, had rung all honourable senators in this place. The Courier-Mail said that all ten Queensland senators will not stand by and see Queensland's free hospital system taken away. When the legislation comes before this place, it will be interesting to see what Queensland senators on the other side will do. There is no doubt that this system will be disastrous for Queensland's free hospital system, a free hospital system that we have had since 1944, a free hospital system which has been upheld by a Labor government and a National-Liberal coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the popular myths in Queensland is that profits of the Queensland Golden Casket lottery pay for the Queensland public hospitals. Rather than interrupt the theme I was developing, at this stage I will seek leave to continue my remarks later because I believe that some legislation is to be brought forward. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Designs Amendment Bill 1981 is a further development in the Australian industrial property system. It introduces the first substantial changes to the designs legislation since federation. Its aim is to encourage innovation and industrial design within the community. To this extent the Bill reflects the Government's continuing commitment to reforming Australia's industrial property system. It seeks to make industrial property more responsive to our needs in developing and exploiting Australia's innovative technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Designs are probably the least understood of possessions collectively known as industrial property rights. Most people are only vaguely familiar with the meaning and advantages of patents, registered trade marks and copyright rights. The availability of design protection often surprises manufacturers and importers, distributors and retailers. Yet these are the very people who benefit by being able to suppress unfair competition or who could take steps to avoid infringement of another's design rights. This lack of understanding is particularly unfortunate when a business is founded on a new or improved product as its only real asset. </PARA>
<PARA> Designs, in the sense of eye-appealing industrial creations as opposed to mechanical contrivances, can be protected in Australia by a registration procedure which has existed for 75 years. Industrial designs have been created by manufacturers who consciously sought to enhance the sales appeal and competitiveness of their products through ornamentation. Nevertheless, functional considerations have tended to predominate. It is, however, only in comparatively recent times that industrial designing has intensified. It has been encouraged by the need to exploit wider markets; domestic and overseas competition; increased media advertising and display; the discovery of many new processes and materials; and, the higher level of community education. </PARA>
<PARA> If good design is to flourish, those responsible for producing it must be protected. To this end, industrial designs have been safeguarded by legislation through registration. Anyone who produces a new or original design may protect it by registering it at the Designs Office. The right given by registering a design is a monopoly and can be infringed without copying taking place. The monopoly conferred by registration is, however, subject to review by the courts, which have the power to declare any design registration invalid. Thus registration is the only prima facie evidence that the design is valid. This Bill recognises that in this country changes to designs legislation can greatly improve the incentives for innovative design. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970 the Government set up the Designs Law Review Committee to determine what changes would be appropriate to Australian conditions. It advocated the inclusion of new provisions in the designs legislation. The report has been widely circulated and received support from those using the design system in Australia. Under the new legislation designs will be registered initially for one year. This period can be extended so as to give the owner of a design a maximum of 16 years protection. This will apply provided the Registrar is not made aware, either from members of the community or in any other way, of any matter affecting the registration's validity. This Bill introduces a specific provision empowering the Registrar to undertake searches to establish the newness or originality of the design for which registration is being sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant change is the abolition of the present requirement to register according to a class system. The abolition of this system will give wider protection to designs without affecting the test of novelty or originality. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also incorporates a new definition of design which is coupled with a new provision. The combined effect is to make it clear that design features serving a functional purpose should not be taken into account by the courts in determining whether the design is valid. This will allow registration of shapes which enable an article to perform a particular function. The function itself will not be registered, but merely the shape or feature needed to achieve the function. </PARA>
<PARA> I should stress that the benefits provided by the Designs Act apply only to designs registered under the provisions. Whilst the benefits of registration outweight those of non-registration, the Act clearly requires that a design must be new or original and unpublished in Australia before a registration application is made. In return for satisfying those conditions the owner obtains a monopoly for up to 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry, as well as overseas industry, favours the system of Australian design registration. This is apparent when one considers the wide range of articles registered as designs by Australian industry. Design registrations being sought and obtained ranged from air conditioners, barbecues, boat hulls, chairs and display cabinets to roof tiles, toys, wash-basins and yo-yos. This Government is seeking to encourage Australian innovative effort in every possible way. Since 1975 the rate of design lodgments in Australia has increased by 50 per cent. Approximately 70 per cent of all applications for design registration have come from Australians. This indicates a greater awareness of the need for, and the benefits of, statutory protection for industrial property rights. The Government is well aware of this. This Bill is another of the measures introduced in the last three years to provide a more conducive climate for innovation in the Australian community. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill corrects inadequacies in procedures for obtaining a patent for an invention. Although the procedures are technical and sometimes complex, the principles behind them are basic to industrial property protection. In particular this applies to provisions of the Bill concerning time limits for certain actions necessary while a patent application is pending. The main purpose of a patent system is to stimulate industrial invention and innovation by granting limited monopoly rights to inventors, and by increasing public availability of information on new technology. Patent procedures must achieve a balance among competing interests while remaining administratively workable.</PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of time limits is to enable industrial competitors to operate with some certainty about whether they are impinging on someone else's patent rights. A set time limit ensures that third parties can act in the sure knowledge that an applicant has obtained or has foregone his rights. Time limits should not, however, be inviolate. An applicant who fails to observe them may incur the loss of all or part of his potential rights to a patent. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions already in the Patents Act allow the Commissioner of Patents, under certain conditions, to extend the times laid down. The most important of these is section 160, which allows time extensions in circumstances beyond control or through an error or omission by the person concerned, or his agent or attorney. It was a long-standing Patent Office practice to grant liberal section 160 time extensions. Recently this liberal approach has been challenged, resulting in the inadequacies becoming apparent in three areas. The first area relates to the time within which the Commissioner may accept a patent application. Acceptance marks the stage when the Commissioner grants an application. The problem is that no explicit provision allows section 160 to extend that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The second relates to the Convention period which is derived from the Paris Convention and concerns the priority dating of patents lodged in Australia but which originated from other member countries. Again no express provision allows section 160 to extend that period. The third area relates to extending the 12-month period for lodging what is called a 'complete-after-provisional' application. It arises where an applicant lodges a patent application with only a provisional specification. This is in order to retain a priority date corresponding to the filing date of the provisional specification. There is no express provision in section 160 to extend the 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Deputy Commissioner of Patents mean extensions of the Convention period or the acceptance period cannot now be granted. There is also doubt about the validity of 'complete-after-provisional' extensions. The seriousness of the problem became apparent in mid-1979 when an industrial dispute at the Redfern Mail Exchange delayed a large number of patent application documents in transit. As well processing delays could often mean that the time limit for accepting applications has passed. Under these circumstances patents would be irretriev- ably precluded from being granted. The Government decided on remedial legislation, and this Bill ensures extensions of time in appropriate circumstances. The Bill now provides specific sections to supplement the inadequately worded section 160. Apart from time extensions, provisions also allow for protecting third parties adversely affected by extensions. Additionally, there is the opportunity for opposition to extensions exceeding three months. The Bill also contains a catch-all provision to cope with late lodgments of documents attributable to postal delays. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem arises from the findings that some extensions were invalid. The Attorney-General's Department advises that a patent granted after an invalid extension of the acceptance period is itself invalid. In the case of the Convention period, an invalid extension means that the Convention priority date is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore includes provisions retrospectively validating extensions of time purported to have been granted in the past and which are now held, or might be held, to be invalid. All consequences flowing from such extensions are also validated. The only exceptions are those extensions which have been questioned in proceedings under the principal Act. It would be unjust to legislate retrospectively to remove arbitrarily rights established in those proceedings. As far as extensions of the acceptance period and of the time for lodging the 'complete-after-provisional' specifications are concerned, grounds for seeking an extension are the same as those in section 160. However, divergent views exist about the availability of extensions to the Convention period. Because of these conflicting considerations, the Industrial Property Advisory Committee was asked whether the Patents Act should provide for extending the Convention period. The Committee recommended and the Government accepted that: Firstly, extensions be granted where the applicant can show he intended filing within the 12-month Convention priority period; secondly, the failure to do so was beyond the control of the applicant, his agent or his attorney; and, thirdly, under no circumstances should the extension exceed three months. </PARA>
<PARA> Other points covered by the Bill include easing the restrictions imposed by time limits for lodging divisional applications, inclusion of more wide-ranging regulations on professional conduct of patent attorneys, and provisions which enable Australia to carry out its obligations under the International Patents Co-operations Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion this Bill aims to resolve a procedural defect which has been uncovered in the patent system. That defect has not only put obstacles in the way of obtaining a patent, but has also rendered many existing patents defective, and even void. This Bill corrects those defects. The rights of applicants and patentees, and also of competitors in industry, are now safeguarded. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is concerned with one of the ways in which the registered proprietor of a trade mark can protect his rights. In particular, it relates to section 103 of the Trade Marks Act 1955 which, in some circumstances, prohibits the import into Australia of goods bearing a registered trade mark. The Government, through the operation of the Trade Marks Office, is committed to the promotion of orderly development of trade industry and commerce by the protection of trade marks, whether they be for goods or services. This Bill seeks to give effect to that commitment in the area of importing of goods bearing a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA> A trade mark indicates that goods or services bearing the mark come from a particular trade source. It is a kind of property, able to be bought and sold. It is part of the family of intellectual property which also includes patents, industrial designs and copyright. Since a trade mark is a kind of property, it carries a principal feature of property, the right to exclude others from using it. </PARA>
<PARA> This right to exclude others may be enforced in different ways. First, there is the common law remedy known as 'passing-off'. In appropriate circumstances the courts will protect a trader who has built up a reputation in a trade mark, usually by long, extensive, continuous and exclusive use. The basic idea behind this is to protect the public against deception. However, the 'passing-off' remedy is cumbersome and expensive, since the trader has to prove his reputation by calling witnesses into court. Therefore provisions were included in the trade marks legislation to solve this problem. The Trade Marks Act provides quick proof and quick machinery for enforcing trade mark rights through a system of trade mark registration. A trader may apply to the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration. If the Registrar considers the trade mark is one which the Act says he can or must register he will 'accept' the mark. The trade mark will be placed on the Register after the public has been given the opportunity to object. The registered trade mark can then be protected by an 'infringement' action for which production of the registration certificate is sufficient proof of ownership of the trade mark. The remedy of infringement proceedings under the Trade Marks Act is the second way a trade mark owner can protect his rights. </PARA>
<PARA> A third protective remedy is section 103 of the Act. This allows for the prohibition, under some circumstances, of imported goods manufactured outside Australia which bear a trade mark registered in Australia. The registered proprietor or registered user of the trade mark can notify Customs that he objects to goods bearing the mark being imported. This objection enables Customs to seize such goods. It is not hard, for example, to see the value of this remedy where 'pirate' goods bear forged or falsely applied trade marks. Section 103 effectively protects the proprietor or registered user against encroachment on his rights by unscrupulous overseas manufacturers. However, the use of section 103 to prevent the import of genuinely marked goods has caused concern. This includes cases where the trade mark was applied overseas by the same company which is the registered proprietor in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many object to this use of the section, saying it goes too far beyond the ideas behind protecting trade marks and abuses the purpose behind protecting trade marks by registration. The use of section 103 in relation to importation of goods was therefore referred to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee for review. That Committee's recommendations have generally been accepted by the Government. This Bill is designed to amend section 103 to implement the report. The Committee's key recommendation is that the provisions for seizure and forfeiture of goods under section 103 should be confined to those cases where importation infringes a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 103 will no longer be available to prevent the import of goods bearing a genuine trade mark applied overseas by the Australian registered proprietor. It would still protect against pirate goods, provided that the import of those goods constituted an infringement of the registered trade mark. This brings section 103 into line with the philosophy of the rest of the Trade Marks Act, providing a convenient and effective means of enforcing the same civil rights protect- able under infringement proceedings. Section 103 will therefore apply only in situations where the trader's reputation might suffer and where the public might be deceived. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the Committee's recommendation that the mechanism of notifying Customs be retained. Section 103 is available to any registered proprietor of a trade mark registered in Australia, and also to registered users. Procedures laid down are consistent with tying section 103 to the test of infringement. This Bill ensures the rights of the registered proprietor and the consuming public are adequately protected against the import of goods infringing trade marks. At the same time the Bill eliminates undesirable practices which have grown up under the current provisions. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before my speech was interrupted to allow for the introduction of three Bills I was developing the argument that one of the popular myths in Queensland is that the profits from the Golden Casket-Queensland's lottery, as it would be known in other States-pays for Queensland's public hospitals. In fact, when I was reading about the Queensland hospital system in preparation for my speech in this debate I happened to pick up a document entitled 'Australian Health Services'. That document states: 'The State lottery-the Golden Casket-makes substantial contributions to the financing of public hospital services.' It was referring to Queensland. So it is a popular myth not only within Queensland but also within literature. I would just like to indicate that it is a myth. I am not quite sure how much it costs to run the Queensland hospital system but a rough estimate would be about $350m a year. I arrived at that rough estimate by having a look at and calculating figures in the Budget Papers. About $350m for recurrent costs would be what we would have to pay in Queensland for our public hospital system. In the last year for which information is available, 1979-80, the Queensland Golden Casket made a profit of $7.7m. If we put the $7.7m against the $350m we will see that it is nothing but a drop in the bucket. Those people in Queensland who are under the impression that the Golden Casket does pay for the hospital system should realise just how small the profit of the Golden Casket is in relation to total hospital costs in Queensland. This $7.7m will go no way towards overcoming the problem that faces Queensland because of the decisions announced today by the Federal Government in the statement which suggested to me that the Government was thinking only of the House of Representatives. When the legislation does come into this chamber it will be a testing time for the Government because when it brings forth its new temporary health scheme it will have to run the gamut of the debate from this side and, I should imagine, the debate from Queensland senators on the other side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, most of us do not mind working on public holidays because most of us do work on public holidays. Some of the hardest work we do is probably done on public holidays. Most of us work on Saturdays and Sundays and we do not mind. I do not mind working on public holidays. But I point out that next Monday is a public holiday in Queensland and it is a holiday of special significance to the people on this side of the chamber because next Monday is Labour Day. On Labour Day in Queensland I find that it is really my duty to be in Queensland to represent the Australian Labor Party. Most of us, when there is a sitting of the Parliament, would acknowledge that the place where we should be is in the Parliament, but this is one of the special days for the Australian Labor Party when I find it my duty to be not in the Parliament but in Queensland. What will happen next Monday is that I will miss my Estimates Committee meeting. I could not answer Senator Walters' interjection earlier because I wanted to develop that argument. But I think she would understand that I am not asking for the Parliament to be centred around public holidays in Queensland. What I am pointing out is that this is an important public holiday that some of us must observe.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I shall very quickly respond to Senator Colston. I think the point which he has raised is one which the Government would wish to take cognisance of. He would understand the difficulties as there is a very large number of public holidays around Australia and the States celebrate even Labour Day, I think, on different days. Last Monday when Estimates committees sat, uniquely to Western Australia, there was a public holiday. It happened to be an additional public holiday granted for Anzac Day. So on that occasion Western Australian senators had a public holiday but the Estimates committees were sitting. Admittedly, it was a public holiday with a different type of significance to the example raised by Senator Colston. I undertake to take what he said back to the Government, and I can assure him that when setting these dates we will try to take into account the sorts of commitments which he has mentioned. It is the desire of the Government to meet the convenience of honourable senators as much as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 3 December 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How many failures of 15 minutes duration or longer occurred in major telephone exchanges throughout Australia from 1 January 1980 to 3 December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What were the effects, or presumed effects, on local and subscriber trunk dialling calls. What caused the failures and how long did they last.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To what extent were the manual assistance operators at the centres affected able to complete their outgoing calls.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) To what extent were manual assistance operators at other centres able to complete calls into or via the centre at which the failure occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In which cases were subscribers unable to reach their manual assistance operators, and why.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) At manual assistance centres equipped with older switchboards and their own 'transit' lines, which largely by-pass the STD systems, is it true that during network congestion or disruption the operators can still handle approximately their normal daily number of calls to centres to which STD is affected, and that this represents approximately 5% of normal daily total trunk calls including STD.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) At centres where the operators have only the newest type of manual assistance exchange, connected with the computerised STD equipment, will failure of the computer not only disrupt the STD but also make it impossible for callers to reach their manual assistance operator.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Is it intended that, with the exception of some remote localities, like Darwin and Kalgoorlie, all manual assistance will be handled at switching centres of this new type within a very few years, and that these will be located at approximately ten major centres, with calls from most provincial cities having to traverse the STD network to reach the manual assistance switching centre.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) In which locations is it intended that part of the older equipment will be retained for emergency service in the event of failure of the STD computer and its associated manual assistance facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) In those locations, will the capacity of the emergency facility be sufficient to handle, say, 5% of the normal daily trunk traffic (including STD) from all areas served by that centre, and will it have the necessary facilities to enable its operators to by-pass STD problem areas, as the 'traditional' trunk exchanges do; if not, what is the likely percentage of that centre's daily trunk traffic which could be assisted in the event of an STD failure.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) If there will be cases in which the operators will not be able to give substantially the same level of assistance to the community in such events, what is the justification for this planned decrease in the reliability of the telephone system.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Is the survivability of the nation's communication network not seen as sufficiently important or is the requirement to operate the system at rates and charges as low as practicable seen as more fundamental than the need to ensure that the system will be able to perform reasonably well in any foreseeable circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Eight.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The failures would have had no serious effects on local calls. Most STD calls which were in progress prior to the occurrence of the fault would have continued uninterrupted. However, the majority of subsequent calls could not be connected without difficulty until the fault cleared. The failures were due to faults of a technical nature and had an average duration of 35 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Operators could not connect calls during the failures.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Some difficulties, requiring repeat attempts, would have been encountered due to increased congestion in the network served by the affected exchange.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. All failures had the effect of preventing subscribers reaching manual assistance operators.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Yes for New South Wales. No for other States.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. As a general rule, all manual assistance centres within 800 kilometres of the capital city will handle traffic through the new equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. &amp; 10. For technical and operational reasons, old equipment is usually replaced as soon as sufficient positions of the new type have been installed and any initial teething troubles have been overcome. STD and manual assistance security and back-up facilities are being progressively incorporated in the national trunk network. This is a much more effective and efficient means of ensuring security than the retention of largely obsolescent equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>11. &amp; 12. The design and manufacturing specifications for all new manual assistance equipment demand a high degree of reliability. This fact, coupled with the provision of increased security within the trunk network will ensure that past high standards of manual assistance are maintained.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister was in regular contact with the Board and Management of Qantas throughout the dispute and in full support of the way they were handling the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is not possible at this stage to quantify the total cost of the dispute. The TWU fuel bans were responsible for the majority of the additional expenditure. Cargo was embargoed to permit the carriage of large quantities of expensive fuel from off-shore ports. The impact on revenue, however, is not easily measured-especially the impact on the company's forward booking situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There were in fact a number of proposals and counter-proposals made by both the company and the Flight Stewards' Association.

This position was reached before members of Qantas ground unions walked off the job.</PARA>

Service under the terms of these Agreements is considered analogous to that of members of the Forces and those who served under such Agreements may be conceded full rights under the Repatriation Act 1920.

<PARA> (1) The amount spend by government departments and instrumentalities for advertising arranged through the Australian Government Advertising Service (AGAS) in 1979-80 was $15,691,509. There is no accurate way by which amounts likely to be spent for advertising in 1980-81 can be projected before June because funding for advertising comes from many separate departmental appropriations and AGAS does not have advance notice of all commitments.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department holds no record of expenditure for advertising which has not been arranged through AGAS. This information would need to be sought from each Minister in respect of instrumentalities within his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (4) Because records held centrally of accounts presented to departments for advertising arranged through my Department are 'broken-down' by specific accounting points and are not categorised in terms of departments or Ministerial Portfolios; and because accounts from seven different advertising agencies covering 36 separate months and up to 220 accounting points would need to be analysed for the three fiscal years referred to in the question, the use of staff time to provide a detailed answer to these two sections of the question would be too great to be justifiable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The general policy of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) is to advise that levels of contaminants in food be reduced to the minimum. In October 1976 the NH &amp; MRC recommended that the maximum permitted level of aflatoxins in food should not exceed 5 micrograms per kilogram, which is the limit of detectability of modern analytical methods, and extremely stringent.</PARA>
<PARA> NH &amp; MRC reconsidered this matter when it became apparent that it was not possible at the time to achieve the levels recommended and therefore suggested to States and Territories that they delay the introduction of the 5 micrograms per kilogram level.</PARA>
<PARA> Council recommended the following interim levels:</PARA>
<PARA> nut and nut products-15 micrograms per kilogram</PARA>
<PARA> other foods-5 micrograms per kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA> This matter is still under review by the NH &amp; MRC. I would also point out that the level of 15 micrograms per kilogram is below the maximum level in the United States which is 25. The United Kingdom and Canada do not specify a level.</PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of association of aflatoxins in the diet with cancer has been suggested only at levels higher than the levels recommended in the United States and Australian recommendations are much lower again.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The NH &amp; MRC is continuously reviewing labelling requirements for foods and for example has recently recommended provisions concerning ingredient labelling, lot identification and date marking of packaged foods. The NH &amp; MRC is currently reviewing the Standard for Labelling and has proposed that where claims of a nutritional nature are made, such claims should be substantiated by nutritional information such as energy, fat, carbohydrate and protein content.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Attorney-General to his joint statement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of 5 August 1980 announcing that Australia would ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and would establish a human rights bureau to help to implement its policy on human rights. The Attorney-General, in making this announcement, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of changes in law and practice to bring Australia into conformity with the Covenant (for example, by taking steps to improve the civil rights of prisoners).</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Attorney-General inform the Senate of what steps Australia has already taken in law and in practice to conform with the Covenant, including those relating to the civil rights of prisoners? Will the Attorney-General also inform the Senate of what further action will be taken by the Government to reaffirm Australia's standing as a country known internationally for its active commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I undertook to obtain for him details of the steps Australia has already taken in law and practice to conform with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to ratification, Australian law and practice was in substantial conformity with the provisions of the Covenant. Between signature in 1972 and ratification last year a number of pieces of legislation were passed which had the effect of assisting Australia to conform with the Covenant.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to give a complete list of all legislation and administration practices throughout Australia; however some examples are:</PARA>
<PARA> Public Assemblies Act 1972 (SA)</PARA>
<PARA> Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 (Commonwealth)</PARA>

<PARA> Domicile Act (several States)</PARA>
<PARA> Law Reform Commission Amendment Act 1979 (Tas.)</PARA>
<PARA> I also had in mind amendments to the Migration Act then in preparation which have since become the Migration Amendment Act (No. 2) 1980. These amendments extend the application of the Migration Act to the Territory of Christmas Island and remove the requirement for entry permits for persons travelling from Christmas Island to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also worthwhile mentioning that, as regards the civil rights of prisoners, at the time of ratification, several States were giving active consideration, and still are, to the need for amendments to their laws to remove the civil disabilities suffered by persons convicted of capital offences.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Law Reform Commission Act 1973 (Commonwealth) provides that the Commission is to perform its functions in reviewing laws and considering proposals with a view to ensuring, as far as practicable, consistency with the Articles of the Covenant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 February 1981 (Hansard, page 148) Senator McIntosh asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister representing the Minister for Communications inform me of the policy adopted by Telecom Australia when a subscriber's telephone is being checked for faults? If a subscriber's phone is being monitored as part of a fault finding program is it policy or is it mandatory for Telecom Australia to inform the subscriber that his or her telephone is being monitored, or in other words, tapped.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In a major telephone network of some 5 million services it is essential that Telecom staff be able to check and observe lines for faults and other operational matters. There are quite a number of technical testing devices utilised in the location of faults on subscribers' lines and apparatuses, depending on the nature of the fault. Occasionally, listening across a subscriber's line is unavoidable particularly if the fault is of an intermittent nature.</PARA>
<PARA> It would not be practicable to inform all subscribers each time Telecom staff needed to check a line. This aspect is recognised in legislation, for example, section 7 (2) (a) (i) of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 which exempts from the Interception Act an act or thing done by an officer of the Commission in the course of his duties or in connection with installations of a line or equipment or the operation and maintenance of a telecommunications system. However, section 7 (4) of that Act prescribes heavy penalties for disclosure by officers of Telecom of information obtained by intercepting a communication.</PARA>
<PARA> In practice, the need for a subscriber to be informed that Telecom is monitoring a line is left to the discretion of the officer handling the particular fault.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In March, the Government deferred consideration of tariff increases sought by the airlines until it completed its initial review of the inquiry's recommendations. Following this initial review increases in fares were approved on 1 April 1981 using a new formula which meets the thrust of the inquiry's recommendations. However, as foreshadowed by the inquiry considerable further work is being undertaken to achieve greater refinements and the most appropriate fare setting formula based on current costs. To further delay approval of the increase in an attempt to achieve these greater refinements would have been inappropriate as the lost revenue would ultimately have had to have been recouped from higher fares.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 March 1981 (Hansard, page 413) Senator Townley asked me a question, without notice, concerning the number of trunk routes specified by the present and new airlines agreements. The Minister for Transport has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present Airlines Agreement includes no definition of a trunk route and this has been a cause for criticism from time to time as the Agreement effectively applies to every route in Australia, not just trunk routes. The new Airlines Agreement defines a trunk route as a route linking any two of eighteen specified centres. Those centres are those served by the jet services of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines at 1 July 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The new Agreement provided that operators other than Ansett and TAA may serve prescribed routes. A route may be both a trunk and a prescribed route under the Agreement. This would occur if, for example, an operator other than Ansett or TAA served a trunk route at 1 July 1980; or if following a request by the Minister the airlines did not provide a satisfactory service within a reasonable time over a trunk route.</PARA>
<PARA> The new Agreement therefore specifically provides that where an operator other than TAA or Ansett served a trunk route at 1 July 1980 that route is defined as a prescribed route. Also the Agreement clarifies the extent to which operators other than Ansett and TAA may extend their networks to include trunk routes. Certainly, nothing in the Agreement threatens the viability of East-West Airlines. The new Agreement does not preclude East-West from continuing to provide services over its network.</PARA>

The question concerned Australian citizenship for members of the Australian National Soccer team and for Miss Robyn Shaw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethinic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of citizenship for the World Cup soccer team contenders Ken Boden and John Yzendoorn has been finalised, with both players having become residentially qualified for citizenship. Mr Boden was granted Australian citizenship on 27 March 1981 and Mr Yzendoorn on 1 April 1981. I issued a News Release on this subject on 26 March 1981. You also raised the question of the acquisition of Australian citizenship by Robyn Shaw. The child referred to is Miss Dionesia Hanwith-Horden. Her mother, Ms Jeanette Robinshaw, had sought to have the child's name included in the Certificate of Australian Citizenship granted to her. The Australian Citizenship Act 1948 provides for the name of any child under the age of sixteen years to be included in the Certificate of Australian Citizenship granted to the responsible parent or guardian of the child. The responsible parent is defined as the father unless the mother has been given custody in a court of law.</PARA>
<PARA>Consideration is presently being given to the amendment of a number of Sections of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and included amongst them is the use of the term responsible parent and its definition.</PARA>
<PARA>Dionesia is a child of Mrs Robinshaw's previous marriage and was born in Zambia. As Mrs Robinshaw did not have a court order giving her custody of the child it was not possible to include Dionesia in her Certificate of Citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA>As an alternative, however, approval was given for the grant of a Certificate of Citizenship to Dionesia in her own right. That Certificate was issued to her on 13 March 1981.</PARA>

<PARA> In view of the $127m profit made by Telecom Australia for the six months ended December 1980, will the Minister give consideration to the free installation of telephones for pensioners as an aid to home care? Will the Minister consider this as a matter of urgency?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is required to operate as a commercial business undertaking and generally relates its changes to the cost of providing and maintaining its services. The whole of the profit is ploughed back each year to help provide the capital required to expand the network and provide new services. In the current financial year, Telecom has a capital works program involving some $1,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA> The present one-third concession on telephone rental available to eligible pensioners is funded by the Government and now applies to over 666,000 of the 3.4 million non-business services currently in operation. The total value of the concession, amounting to around $19 million annually, is paid by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs to Telecom Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of extending the present telephone rental concession scheme for pensioners to include free installation charges is therefore one which would need to be considered by the Government in the context of the Government's overall social security program.

<PARA> Is it a fact that a Mr Abraham Ordia, the Nigerian who is President of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, is in Australia at present as a paid guest of the Government? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that, before addressing the National Press Club in Canberra last week, Mr Ordia distributed copies of a printed extract from a speech made by John Vorster in the South African Parliament in April 1967 dealing with the South African Government's sports policies at that time? Will the Minister verify, firstly, that there is racial integration in South African sport at all levels, for example, South Africa's national soccer team consists of blacks and whites; secondly, that a non-white gentleman heads the South African cricket union; and, thirdly, that for more than 10 years athletics in South Africa have been racially integrated?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, Mr Abraham Ordia, visited Australia from 17 to 28 March as an official guest. The purpose of such visits is to introduce prominent men and women to Australia, thereby to build up understanding overseas of Australia's policies and institutions, to remove misconceptions about Australia's attitudes and to make better known its growth, achievements and potential.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ordia's program included visits to Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for discussions with Australian sportsmen and sporting administrators including the organisers of the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games. Mr Ordia's program also included discussions with Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Aboriginal Affairs officials, and calls on the Governor-General, Prime Minister and myself. He also attended the First International Assembly of National Confederations of Sport.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ordia did not address the National Press Club, but he gave a luncheon address at the Australian Institute for International Affairs and a press conference at the Lakeside Hotel at which I understand he distributed an extract from a speech made by Mr Vorster.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop asked for verification that there is racial integration in South African sport at all levels. The Government, through our Embassy in South Africa, as well as through our contacts with Australian and international sporting organisations, monitors constantly and closely developments in sport in South Africa. We are aware that there are differences of approach to multi-racial participation in sport between different sports and sporting organisations in various parts of the country and that a number of organisations have moved some distance toward achieving multi-racial sport, although more so at the level of senior representative teams than at club level and practically not at all amongst schools. Soccer, athletics and cricket are all sports where some progress towards integration has been made. Such progress is encouraging, but it falls well short of the full scale racial integration in sport. Genuine racial integration involves equal access to all available facilities (including coaching and training facilities) by sportsmen of different races, access to membership and facilities of all sporting clubs, the opportunity to participate fully in local and international sporting events and equal access by spectators. Club membership, participation in competition and the use of facilities continue to be determined largely on the basis of race.</PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise, moreover, the Government's view that developments in sport in South Africa cannot be viewed in isolation. The discriminatory legislation which constitutes the basic framework of apartheid effects every aspect of the lives of non-white members of the community. Legislation such as the Group Areas Act, the Liquor Licensing Act and legislation dealing with the pass laws and the homelands impose fundamental restrictions on all black and coloured persons. Unless and until genuine efforts are made to remove those restrictions, the goal of eliminating racially discriminatory practices at all levels of South African society, whether in sport, employment, education or any other sphere of activity, will remain unattainable.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop mentioned specifically progress which had been achieved in soccer, cricket and athletics. Soccer is more advanced than most sports in the direction of intergration but the players are still subject to basic apartheid laws. I am advised that the Johannesburg and Pretoria municipalities recently barred soccer teams from using two main stadiums. I note also that in South Africa soccer is a sport which many more blacks than whites play and watch. I understand that some progress has also been made towards bringing about racial integration in athletics but, again, the access to the sport by black and coloured sportsmen is governed by the basic laws of apartheid. I confirm that the head of the South African Cricket Union, Mr Varrachia is non-white.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) (a), (b) and (c) The Request for Tender (RFT) for the Australian national communications satellite system was issued on 30 October 1980 by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia). As the closing date for tenders is 4 May 1981, it is not possible at this time to advise the number or country of origin of the tenderers.</PARA>
<PARA> The closing date for tenders was extended from 2 March 1981 to 4 May 1981 at the request of local and overseas tenderers to allow them to better research and formulate their proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (d) The Government has stated on a number of occasions its intention that Australian industry involvement in the satellite project be maximised. The RFT advises tenderers of the Government's policies in relation to preference to Australian made goods and offsets. It requires that tenderers be able to substantiate claimed levels of Australian content, which will be incorporated as a contractural condition. The RFT also advises tenderers that offsets are required against the imported component of a tender and that agreed offsets proposals will be incorporated as a contractural agreement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The guidelines for the operation of the Youth Services Scheme were distributed to all State and Territory Social Welfare Ministers in December 1979. The statement which follows reproduces the guidelines subject to minor amendments, particularly to Section 4.0 (Evaluation), which take account of subsequent developments.</PARA>
<PARA>GUIDELINES</PARA>
<PARA> 1.0 Essential components of scheme</PARA>
<PARA> 1.1 Definition: A youth shelter scheme with support services to be focused on youth aged to 18 years. At the discretion of sponsoring agencies, youth aged over 18 years may be assisted through the Scheme, when appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.2 Emergency accommodation: This can be provided in:</PARA>
<PARA> A. Residential units offering short-term emergency accommodation for periods ranging from overnight to 3 months, as well as providing for youth in exceptional circumstances requiring accommodation over longer periods or on an intermittent basis. It is not intended that this scheme provide long-term accommodation, however.</PARA>
<PARA> B. Subsidised accommodation through 'contract of bed space' by various means for periods ranging from overnight to 3 months. This form of assistance allows for an approved household to be paid by an agency or scheme to reserve a bed. Such provision-</PARA>
<PARA> increases the amount of available accommodation for emergency placements and transition purposes, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> increases flexibility within the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.3 Support services. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> counselling and information services for children and their parents;</PARA>
<PARA> supervision of young people in accommodation;</PARA>
<PARA> rent/lease guarantees to landlords, and subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.4 Sponsoring organisations. In general, grants are made to community agencies. State Government or local government sponsorship of projects is permissible where no suitable community agency is available to sponsor a project.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.5 Recognition of existing programs. The Youth Services Scheme is not limited to new projects. Existing youth refuge services will be considered for funding on the basis of the eligibility criteria specified in the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.6 Youth who are a State/Territory responsibility. The Youth Services Scheme does not provide for children for whom States/Territories have statutory responsibilities (eg State wards and parolees).</PARA>
<PARA> 2.0 Proposed administrative arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> 2.1 Funding. Funding is for specific projects rather than on a block grant basis. There are joint Commonwealth/State or Territory ministerial announcements of projects approved.</PARA>
<PARA> 2.2 Grants are provided mainly for recurrent funding of projects. Capital grants for new buildings are not available, although the cost of reasonable modifications to existing facilities may be considered for funding.</PARA>
<PARA> 2.3 Administration. Joint Commonwealth/State and Territory administrative committees have been set up in each State or Territory and include representatives from the voluntary sector. Arrangements have been made for consultation with the Homeless Persons Advisory Committee in each State. Recommendations made by these administrative committees are still submitted to the Minister for Social Security and State or Territory Welfare Ministers for final approval.</PARA>
<PARA> 3.0 Administrative costs</PARA>
<PARA> 3.1 State/Territory administrative costs are not a part of the matching funding arrangement, as these would absorb an unduly large proportion of grants for services. The Commonwealth and State/Territory departments are responsible for their respective administrative costs incurred in evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> 4.0 Evaluation</PARA>
<PARA> 4.1 A committee is responsible for evaluation of the Scheme. The committee comprises Departmental nominees from Victoria, New South Wales, and the Commonwealth Departments of Social Security and Employment and Youth Affairs. The Committee is known as the National Committee for Evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> 4.2 The committee has developed an evaluation strategy now endorsed by State/Territory departments responsible for the Scheme. The Minister for Social Security has endorsed this strategy and has sought the endorsement of all the State Ministers involved.</PARA>
<PARA> 4.3 An evaluation report will be provided to Welfare Ministers of all States/Territories participating in the scheme and to the Minister for Social Security and will be considered by the Council of Social Welfare Ministers, and the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators.</PARA>
<PARA> 4.4 Costs for evaluation (excluding administrative costs) may be met from 1 per cent of the matched grants.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0 Contract for services</PARA>
<PARA> 5.1 As part of their management function State welfare departments will contract with the service agency to ensure the availability of health and counselling services and the provision of statistics required for evaluation purposes. Letters of contract will be exchanged specifying terms and conditions (including the fixed-term character) of the grants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that, while the question whether a particular receipt is one of income or capital ultimately depends upon the particular facts of a given case, he is of the view that in most cases profits from the sale of import quotas would be assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA> This would clearly be so where the vendor was in the business of trading in import quotas, where a quota had been acquired for the purpose of making a profit by its subsequent sale or where a quota was purchased and sold within twelve months at a profit. In the generality of cases, however, it seems that an importer would acquire import quotas with the intention of using them in whatever way would be most advantageous. In these circumstances the sale of the quotas would be an incident of the business activities from which assessable income is derived and the profits from their sale therefore part of the assessable proceeds of the business.</PARA>
<PARA> There would, however, be some cases in which the proper conclusion would be that a profit from the sale of an import quota is of a capital nature, e.g. where a quota is sold as part of the assets of a business being disposed of.</PARA>
